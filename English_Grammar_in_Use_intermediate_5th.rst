   This is the fifuh edition of English Grammar in Use. I wrote the original edition when I was a teacher at the
   Swan School of English, Oxford. I would like to repeat my thanks to my former colleagues and students at
   the school for their help, encouragement and interest at that time.

   Regarding the production of this fifuh edition, I would like to thank Rebecca Winthrop and Chris Capper.

To the student
--------------

   This book is for students who want help with English grammar. It is written for you to use without
   a teacher.

   The book will be useful for you if you are not sure of the answers to questions like these:

   #. []  What is the difgerence between I did and I have done?
   #. []  When do we use will for the future?
   #. []  What is the structure afuer I wish?
   #. []  When do we say used to do and when do we say used to doing?
   #. []  When do we use the?
   #. []  What is the difgerence between like and as?

   These and many other points of English grammar are explained in the book, and there are exercises
   on each point.

Level
~~~~~

   The book is intended mainly for intermediate students (students who have already studied the basic
   grammar of English). It concentrates on those structures that intermediate students want to use, but
   that often cause difgiculty. Some advanced students who have problems with grammar will also find
   the book useful.

   The book is not suitable for elementary learners.

How the book is organised
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   There are 145 units in the book. Each unit concentrates on a particular point of grammar. Some
   problems (for example, the present perfect or the use of the) are covered in more than one unit. For a
   list of units, see the Contents at the beginning of the book.

   Each unit consists of two facing pages. On the left there are explanations and examples; on the right
   there are exercises. At the back of the book there is an Answer Key for you to check your answers to
   the exercises (page 336).

   There are also seven Appendices at the back of the book (pages 292–301). These include irregular
   verbs, summaries of verb forms, spelling, and American English.

   Finally, there is a detailed Index at the back of the book (page 373).

How to use the book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The units are not in order of difgiculty, so it is not intended that you work through the book from
   beginning to end. Every learner has difgerent problems, and you should use this book to help you
   with the grammar that you find difgicult.

   It is suggested that you work in this way:

   * [] Use the Contents and/or Index to find which unit deals with the point you are interested in.
   * [] If you are not sure which units you need to study, use the Study guide on page 326.
   * [] Study the explanations and examples on the left-hand page of the unit you have chosen.
   * [] Do the exercises on the right-hand page.
   * [] Check your answers with the Key.
   * [] If your answers are not correct, study the left-hand page again to see what went wrong.

   You can, of course, use the book simply as a reference book without doing the exercises.

.. _Pviii:

Additional exercises
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   At the back of the book there are Additional exercises (pages 302–325). These exercises bring together
   some of the grammar points from a number of difgerent units. For example, Exercise 16 brings together
   grammar points from Units 26–36. You can use these exercises for extra practice afuer you have studied
   and practised the grammar in the units concerned.

ebook
~~~~~

   An ebook version of English Grammar in Use is also available to buy.

.. _Px:

To the teacher
--------------

   English Grammar in Use was written as a self-study grammar book, but teachers may also find it
   useful as additional course material in cases where further work on grammar is necessary.

   The book will probably be most useful at middle- and upper-intermediate levels (where all or
   nearly all of the material will be relevant), and can serve both as a basis for revision and as a means
   for practising new structures. It will also be useful for some more advanced students who have
   problems with grammar and need a book for reference and practice. The book is not intended to be
   used by elementary learners.
 
   The units are organised in grammatical categories (Present and past, Articles and nouns, Prepositions
   etc.). They are not ordered according to level of difgiculty, so the book should not be worked through
   from beginning to end. It should be used selectively and flexibly in accordance with the grammar
   syllabus being used and the difgiculties students are having.
 
   The book can be used for immediate consolidation or for later revision or remedial work. It might
   be used by the whole class or by individual students needing extra help. The left-hand pages
   (explanations and examples) are written for the student to use individually, but they may of course
   be used by the teacher as a source of ideas and information on which to base a lesson. The student
   then has the left-hand page as a record of what has been taught and can refer to it in the future.
   The exercises can be done individually, in class or as homework. Alternatively (and additionally),
   individual students can be directed to study certain units of the book by themselves if they have
   particular difgiculties not shared by other students in their class. Don’t forget the Additional exercises
   at the back of the book (see To the student).

English Grammar in Use Fifuh Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This is a new edition of English Grammar in Use. The difgerences between this edition and the fourth
   edition are:

   *  Much of the material has been revised or reorganised, and in most units there are changes in the
      examples, explanations and exercises.
   *  The book has been redesigned with new, updated illustrations.
   *  There is a new ebook available with all the contents of the book as well as audio, access to a
      dictionary and more.

   An edition of English Grammar in Use without the Key is also available. Some teachers may prefer
   to use this with their students.

Unit 002 Present simple (I do)
------------------------------

   A
   We use the present simple to talk about things in general. We use it to say that something happens all the
   time or repeatedly, or that something is true in general:
   Nurses look afu er patients in hospitals.
   I usually go away at weekends.
   The earth goes round the sun.
   The cafe opens at 7.30 in the morning.
   We say:
   I work but he works you go but it goes
   they teach but my sister teaches I have but he has
   For spelling (-s or -es), see Appendix 6.
   B
   Study this example situation:
   Alex is a bus driver, but now he is in bed asleep.
   He is not driving a bus. (He is asleep.)
   but He drives a bus. He is a bus driver.
   drive(s), work(s), do(es) etc. is the present simple:
   I/we/you/they drive/work/do etc.
   he/she/it drives/works/does etc.
   We use do/does to make questions and negative sentences:
   do
   does
   I/we/you/they
   he/she/it
   work?
   drive?
   do?
   I/we/you/they
   he/she/it
   don’t
   doesn’t
   work
   drive
   do
   I come from Canada. Where do you come from?
   I don’t go away very ofu en.
   What does this word mean? (not What means this word?)
   Rice doesn’t grow in cold climates.
   In the following examples, do is also the main verb (do you do / doesn’t do etc.):
   ‘What do you do?’ ‘I work in a shop.’
   He’s always so lazy. He doesn’t do anything to help.
   C
   We use the present simple to say how ofu en we do things:
   I get up at 8 o’clock every morning.
   How ofu en do you go to the dentist?
   Julie doesn’t drink tea very ofu en.
   Robert usually goes away two or three times a year.
   D
   I promise / I apologise etc.
   Sometimes we do things by saying something. For example, when you promise to do something,
   you can say ‘I promise … ’; when you suggest something, you can say ‘I suggest … ’:
   I promise I won’t be late. (not I’m promising)
   ‘What do you suggest I do?’ ‘I suggest that you …’
   In the same way we say: I apologise … / I advise … / I insist … / I agree … / I refuse … etc.

Unit 004 Present continuous and present simple 2 (I am doing and I do)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   A
   We use continuous forms (I’m waiting, it’s raining etc.) for actions and happenings that have started but
   not finished.
   Some verbs (for example, know and like) are not normally used in this way. We don’t say ‘I am knowing’,
   ‘they are liking’. We say ‘I know’, ‘they like’.
   The following verbs are not normally used in the present continuous:
   like want need prefer
   know realise understand recognise
   believe suppose remember mean
   belong fit contain consist seem
   I’m hungry. I want something to eat. (not I’m wanting)
   Do you understand what I mean?
   Anna doesn’t seem very happy right now.
   think
   When think means ‘believe’ or ‘have an opinion’, we do not use the continuous:
   I think Mary is Canadian, but I’m not sure. (not I’m thinking)
   What do you think of my idea? (= what is your opinion?)
   When think means ‘consider’, the continuous is possible:
   I’m thinking about what happened. I often think about it.
   Nicky is thinking of giving up her job. (= she is considering it)
   B
   am/is/are being
   You can say he’s being … , you’re being … etc. to say how somebody is behaving now:
   I can’t understand why he’s being so selfish. He isn’t usually like that.
   (being selfish = behaving selfishly now)
   ‘The path is icy. Don’t slip.’ ‘Don’t worry. I’m being very careful.’
   Compare:
   He never thinks about other people. He’s very selfish.
   (= he is selfish generally, not only now)
   I don’t like to take risks. I’m a very careful person.
   We use am/is/are being to say how a person is behaving (= doing something they can control) now.
   It is not usually possible in other situations:
   Sam is ill. (not is being ill)
   Are you tired? (not are you being tired)
   D
   see hear smell taste look feel
   We normally use the present simple (not continuous) with see/hear/smell/taste:
   Do you see that man over there? (not are you seeing)
   The room smells. Let’s open a window.
   This soup doesn’t taste very good.
   You can use the present simple or continuous to say how somebody looks or feels now:
   You look well today. or You’re looking well today.
   How do you feel now? or How are you feeling now?
   but
   I usually feel tired in the morning. (not I’m usually feeling)

Unit 005 Past simple (I did)
----------------------------

   A
   Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was an Austrian
   musician and composer. He lived from 1756 to
   1791. He started composing at the age of five
   and wrote more than 600 pieces of music.
   He was only 35 years old when he died.
   lived/started/wrote/was/died are all past simple
   Study this example:
   Very ofu en the past simple ends in -ed (regular verbs):
   I work in a travel agency now. Before that I worked in a department store.
   They invited us to their party, but we decided not to go.
   The police stopped me on my way home last night.
   Laura passed her exam because she studied very hard.
   For spelling (stopped, studied etc.), see Appendix 6.
   But many verbs are irregular. The past simple does not end in -ed. For example:
   write → wrote Mozart wrote more than 600 pieces of music.
   see → saw We saw Alice in town a few days ago.
   go → went I went to the cinema three times last week.
   shut → shut It was cold, so I shut the window.
   For a list of irregular verbs, see Appendix 1.
   B
   In questions and negative sentences we use did/didn’t + infinitive (enjoy/see/go etc.):
   I
   she
   they
   enjoyed
   saw
   went
   did
   you
   she
   they
   enjoy?
   see?
   go?
   I
   she
   they
   didn’t
   enjoy
   see
   go
   I enjoyed the party a lot. Did you enjoy it?
   How many people did they invite to the wedding?
   I didn’t buy anything because I didn’t have any money.
   ‘Did you go out?’ ‘No, I didn’t.’
   Sometimes do is the main verb in the sentence (did you do?, I didn’t do):
   What did you do at the weekend? (not What did you at the weekend?)
   I didn’t do anything. (not I didn’t anything)
   C
   The past of be (am/is/are) is was/were:
   I/he/she/it was/wasn’t was I/he/she/it?
   we/you/they were/weren’t were we/you/they?
   I was annoyed because they were late.
   Was the weather good when you were on holiday?
   They weren’t able to come because they were so busy.
   I wasn’t hungry, so I didn’t eat anything.
   Did you go out last night or were you too tired?

   A
   Past simple (I did) ➜ Unit 5
   I was doing (= in the middle of an action) I did (= complete action)
   We were walking home when I met
   Dan. (in the middle of walking home)
   We walked home afu er the party last
   night. (= all the way, completely)
   Kate was watching TV when we
   arrived.
   Kate watched TV a lot when she was ill
   last year.
   Study this example situation:
   Yesterday Karen and Joe played tennis. They started at
   10 o’clock and finished at 11.30.
   So, at 10.30 they were playing tennis.
   they were playing =
   they were in the middle of playing, they had not finished
   was/were + -ing is the past continuous:
   he/she/it was playing
   doing
   working etc.
   we/you/they were
   I was doing something = I was in the middle of doing it at a certain time. The action or situation started
   before this time, but had not finished:
   I started doing I was doing I finished doing
   past past now
   This time last year I was living in Hong Kong.
   What were you doing at 10 o’clock last night?
   I waved to Helen, but she wasn’t looking.

   Compare I was doing (past continuous) and I did (past simple):
   C
   You can say that something happened (past simple) in the middle of something else (past continuous):
   Matt phoned while we were having dinner.
   It was raining when I got up.
   I saw you in the park yesterday. You were sitting on the grass and reading a book.
   I hurt my back while I was working in the garden.
   But we use the past simple to say that one thing happened afu er another:
   I was walking along the road when I saw Dan. So I stopped, and we talked for a while.
   Compare:
   When Karen arrived, we were having
   dinner. (= we had already started before
   she arrived)
   When Karen arrived, we had dinner.
   (= Karen arrived, and then we had
   dinner)

Unit 007 Present perfect 1 (I have done)
----------------------------------------

   Tom can’t find his key.
   He’s lost his key. (= He has lost …)
   he has lost his key =
   he lost it and he doesn’t have it now
   have lost / has lost is the present perfect simple:
   I/we/they/you have (= I’ve etc.)
   finished
   lost
   done
   been etc.
   he/she/it has (= he’s etc.)
   Study this example situation:
   When we say ‘something has happened’, this is usually new information:
   Ow! I’ve cut my finger.
   The road is closed. There’s been an accident. (= There has been …)
   Police have arrested two men in connection with the robbery.
   When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with now. The action in the past has a result now:
   Tom has lost his key. (= he doesn’t have it now)
   He told me his name, but I’ve forgotten it. (= I can’t remember it now)
   Sally is still here. She hasn’t gone out. (= she is here now)
   I can’t find my bag. Have you seen it? (= do you know where it is now?)
   Compare gone (to) and been (to):
   James is on holiday. He has gone to Italy. (= he is there now or on his way there)
   Amy is back home now. She has been to Italy. (= she has now come back)
   B
   You can also use the past simple (did, went, had etc.) in the examples on this page. So you can say:
   Ben isn’t here. He’s gone out. or He went out.
   ‘Are you hungry?’ ‘No, I’ve just had lunch.’ or ‘No, I just had lunch.’
   D
   You can use the present perfect with just, already and yet.
   Just = a short time ago:
   ‘Are you hungry?’ ‘No, I’ve just had lunch.’
   Hello. Have you just arrived?
   Already = sooner than expected:
   ‘Don’t forget to pay the bill.’ ‘I’ve already paid it.’
   ‘What time is Mark leaving?’ ‘He’s already left .’
   Yet = until now. We use yet to show that we are expecting something to happen.
   We use yet in questions and negative sentences:
   Has it stopped raining yet?
   I’ve written the email, but I haven’t sent it yet.
   C
   The present perfect simple is have/has + past participle. The past participle ofu en ends in -ed
   (finished/decided etc.), but many verbs are irregular (lost/done/written etc.).

   DaVE: Have you travelled a lot, Jane?
   JaNE: Yes, I’ve been to lots of places.
   DaVE: Really? Have you ever been to China?
   JaNE: Yes, I’ve been to China twice.
   DaVE: What about India?
   JaNE: No, I haven’t been to India.
   When we talk about a period of time that continues from the past until now, we use the present
   perfect (have been / have travelled etc.). Here, Dave and Jane are talking about the places Jane
   has visited in her life, which is a period that continues until now.
   Study this example conversation:
   In the same way we say:
   Have you ever eaten caviar?
   We’ve never had a car.
   I don’t know what the film is about. I haven’t seen it.
   Susan really loves that book. She’s read it three times. (She’s = She has)
   It’s a really boring movie. It’s the most boring movie I’ve ever seen.
   been (to) = visited:
   I’ve never been to Canada. Have you been there?
   past now
   Jane’s life
   (a period until now)
   In the following examples too, the speakers are talking about a period that continues until now
   (recently, in the last few days, so far, since I arrived etc.):
   Have you heard anything from Ben recently?
   I’ve met a lot of people in the last few days.
   Everything is going well. There haven’t been any
   problems so far.
   The weather is bad here. It’s (= It has) rained every
   day since I arrived. (= from when I arrived until now)
   It’s good to see you again. We haven’t seen each other for a long time.
   In the same way we use the present perfect with today, this evening, this year etc. when these
   periods are not finished at the time of speaking:
   I’ve drunk four cups of coffee today.
   Have you had a holiday this year?
   I haven’t seen Tom this morning. Have you?

   We say ‘It’s the (first) time something has happened’. For example:
   Don is having a driving lesson. It’s his first lesson.
   We can say:
   It’s the first time he has driven a car. (not drives)
   or He hasn’t driven a car before.
   or He has never driven a car before.
   In the same way we say:
   Sarah has lost her passport again. This is the second
   time this has happened. (not happens)
   Andy is phoning his girlfriend again. It’s the third
   time he’s phoned her this evening.

   Compare these two situations:
   There is paint on Kate’s clothes.
   She has been painting her bedroom.
   has been painting is the present perfect
   continuous.
   We are thinking of the activity. It does not matter
   whether it has been finished or not. In this
   example, the activity (painting the bedroom) has
   not been finished.
   The bedroom was green. Now it is yellow.
   She has painted her bedroom.
   has painted is the present perfect simple.
   Here, the important thing is that something has
   been finished. ‘She has painted’ is a completed
   action. We are thinking about the result of
   the activity (the painted bedroom), not the
   activity itself.

   Somebody has eaten all the chocolates.
   The box is empty.
   Where’s the book I gave you? What have
   you done with it?
   Have you ever played tennis?
   We use the continuous to say how long (for
   something that is still happening):
   How long have you been reading that
   book?

   emails all morning.
   They ’ve been playing tennis since 2 o’clock.
   I’m learning Arabic, but I haven’t been

   We use the simple to say how much, how many
   or how many times (for completed actions):
   How many pages of that book have
   you  read ?
   Amy has sent lots of emails this morning.
   They ’ve played tennis three times this
   week.
   I’m learning Arabic, but I haven’t learnt
   very much yet.
   Some verbs (for example, know ) are not normally used in continuous forms ( be + - ing ):
   I ’ve known about the problem for a long time. ( not I’ve been knowing)
   How long have you had that camera? (not have you been having)
   For a list of these verbs, see Unit 4A. For have, see Unit 17.

   Study this example situation:
   We use the present perfect to talk about something that began in the past and still
   continues now.
   Compare the present and present perfect:
   Paul is in hospital.
   but He’s been in hospital since Monday. (= He has been …)
   (not Paul is in hospital since Monday)
   We know each other very well.
   but We’ve known each other for a long time.
   (not We know)
   Do they have a car?
   but How long have they had their car?
   She’s waiting for somebody.
   but She hasn’t been waiting very long.
   I’ve known / I’ve had / I’ve lived etc. is the present perfect simple.
   I’ve been learning / I’ve been waiting etc. is the present perfect continuous.
   When we ask or say ‘how long’, the continuous is more usual (see Unit 10):
   I’ve been learning English since January.
   It’s been raining all morning.
   Richard has been doing the same job for 20 years.
   ‘How long have you been driving?’ ‘Since I was 17.’
   Some verbs (for example, know and like) are not normally used in the continuous:
   How long have you known Jane? (not have you been knowing)
   I’ve had these shoes for ages. (not I’ve been having)
   See also Units 4A and 10C. For have, see Unit 17.
   B
   Dan and Kate are married. They got married exactly
   20 years ago, so today is their 20th wedding anniversary.
   They have been married for 20 years.
   We say: They are married. (present)
   but How long have they been married?
   (not How long are they married?)
   They have been married for 20 years.
   (not They are married for 20 years)
   (present perfect)
   You can use either the continuous or simple with live and work:
   Julia has been living in this house for a long time. or Julia has lived …
   How long have you been working here? or How long have you worked here?
   But we use the simple (have lived etc.) with always:
   I’ve always lived in the country. (not always been living)

Unit 013 Present perfect and past 1 (I have done and I did)
-----------------------------------------------------------

   Present perfect and past 1 (I have done and I did)
   A
   Study this example situation:
   Ten minutes later:
   The present perfect (something has happened) is a present tense. It tells us about the situation now.
   ‘Tom has lost his key’ = he doesn’t have his key now (see Unit 7).
   The past simple (something happened) tells us only about the past. If somebody says ‘Tom lost his key’,
   we don’t know whether he has the key now or not. We know only that he lost it at some time in the past.
   Compare present perfect and past simple:
   They’ve gone away. They’ll be back on Friday. (they are away now)
   They went away, but I think they’re back at home now. (not They’ve gone away)
   It has stopped raining now, so we don’t need the umbrella. (it isn’t raining now)
   It stopped raining for a while, but now it’s raining again. (not It has stopped)
   Tom is looking for his key. He can’t find it.
   He has lost his key. (present perfect)
   This means that he doesn’t have his key now.
   Now Tom has found his key. He has it now.
   Has he lost his key? No, he has found it.
   Did he lose his key? Yes, he did.
   He lost his key (past simple)
   but now he has found it. (present perfect)
   You can use the present perfect for new or recent happenings:
   I’ve repaired the washing machine. It’s working OK now.
   ‘Hannah has had a baby! It’s a boy.’ ‘That’s great news.’
   Usually, you can also use the past simple:
   I repaired the washing machine. It’s working OK now.
   Use the past simple (not the present perfect) for things that are not recent or new:
   Mozart was a composer. He wrote more than 600 pieces of music.
   (not has been … has written)
   My mother grew up in Italy. (not has grown)
   Compare:
   Somebody has invented a new type of washing machine.
   Who invented the telephone? (not has invented)
   B
   We use the present perfect to give new information (see Unit 7). But if we continue to talk about it,
   we normally use the past simple:
   a: Ow! I’ve burnt myself.
   b: How did you do that? (not have you done)
   a: I picked up a hot dish. (not have picked)
   a: Look! Somebody has spilt something on the sofa.
   b: Well, it wasn’t me. I didn’t do it. (not hasn’t been … haven’t done)

   We do not use the present perfect (I have done) when we talk about a finished time (for example,
   yesterday / last year / ten minutes ago etc.). We use a past tense:
   It was very cold yesterday. (not has been)
   Paul and Lucy arrived ten minutes ago. (not have arrived)
   Did you eat a lot of sweets when you were a child? (not have you eaten)
   I got home late last night. I was very tired and went straight to bed.

   When did Carla leave?
   Present perfect (have done)
   I’ve done a lot of work today.

   that continues until now. For example:
   today / this week / since 2010.
   It hasn’t rained this week.
   Have you seen Anna this morning?
   (it is still morning now)

   Past perfect (I had done)
   A
   Study this example situation:
   The past perfect (simple) is had + past participle (gone/seen/finished etc.).
   Sometimes we talk about something that happened in the past:
   Sarah arrived at the party.
   This is the starting point of the story. Then, if we want to talk about things that happened before this time,
   we use the past perfect (had …):
   When Sarah arrived at the party, Paul had already gone home.

Unit 017 have and have got
--------------------------

   A
   have and have got (= for possession, relationships, illnesses, appointments etc.)
   You can use have or have got. There is no difgerence in meaning. You can say:

   Lisa has two brothers. or Lisa has got two brothers.
   I have a headache. or I’ve got a headache.
   Our house has a small garden. or Our house has got a small garden.
   He has a few problems. or He’s got a few problems.

   With these meanings (possession etc.), we do not use continuous forms (I’m having etc.):
   We’re enjoying our holiday. We have / We’ve got a nice room in the hotel.
   (not We’re having a nice room)
   For the past we use had (usually without got):
   Lisa had long hair when she was a child. (not Lisa had got)
   In questions and negative sentences there are three possible forms:
   Do you have any questions?
   or Have you got any questions?
   or Have you any questions? (less usual)
   Does she have a car?
   or Has she got a car?
   or Has she a car? (less usual)
   I don’t have any questions.
   or I haven’t got any questions.
   or I haven’t any questions. (less usual)
   She doesn’t have a car.

   I didn’t have my phone, so I couldn’t call you.
   Lisa had long hair, didn’t she?
   B
   have breakfast / have a shower / have a good time etc.

   breakfast / dinner / a cup of coffee / something to eat etc.
   a bath / a shower / a swim / a break / a rest / a party / a holiday
   an accident / an experience / a dream

   trouble / difgiculty / fun / a good time etc.
   a baby (= give birth to a baby)
   Have got is not possible in these expressions. Compare:

   a few years ago
   these days
   Nicola doesn’t travel much these days.
   She prefers to stay at home.
   But she used to travel a lot.
   She used to go away two or three times a year.
   She used to travel a lot = she travelled ofu en in the past, but
   she doesn’t do this any more.
   now past
   she doesn’t
   travel
   she used to travel
   I used to do something = I did it ofu en in the past, but not any more:
   I used to play tennis a lot, but I don’t play very much now.
   David used to spend a lot of money on clothes. These days he can’t afg ord it.
   ‘Do you go to the cinema much?’ ‘Not now, but I used to.’ (= I used to go)
   We also use used to … for things that were true, but are not true any more:
   This building is now a furniture shop. It used to be a cinema.
   I used to think Mark was unfriendly, but now I realise he’s a very nice person.
   I’ve started drinking coffee recently. I never used to like it before.
   Lisa used to have very long hair when she was a child.
   B
   ‘I used to do something’ is past. There is no present. You cannot say ‘I use to do’.
   To talk about the present, we use the present simple (I do).
   Compare:
   past he used to play we used to live there used to be
   present he plays we live there is
   We used to live in a small village, but now we live in a city.
   There used to be four cinemas in the town. Now there is only one.
   C
   The normal question form is did (you) use to … ? :
   Did you use to eat a lot of sweets when you were a child? (= did you do this ofu en?)
   The negative form is didn’t use to … (used not to … is also possible):
   I didn’t use to like him. (or I used not to like him.)
   D
   Compare I used to do and I was doing:
   I used to watch TV a lot. (= I watched TV ofu en in the past, but I don’t do this any more)
   I was watching TV when Rob called. (= I was in the middle of watching TV)
   E
   Do not confuse I used to do and I am used to doing (see Unit 61). The structures and meanings
   are difg erent:
   I used to live alone. (= I lived alone in the past, but I no longer live alone.)
   I am used to living alone. (= I live alone, and it’s not a problem for me because I’ve lived
   alone for some time.)

Unit 019 Present tenses (I am doing / I do) for the future
----------------------------------------------------------

   Present tenses (I am doing / I do) for the future
   A
   Present continuous (I am doing) with a future meaning
   I’m doing something (tomorrow etc.) = I have already decided and arranged to do it:
   a: What are you doing on Saturday evening? (not What do you do)
   b: I’m going to the cinema. (not I go)
   a: What time is Katherine arriving tomorrow?
   b: Half past ten. We’re meeting her at the station.
   I’m not working tomorrow, so we can go out somewhere.
   Steve isn’t playing football next Saturday. He’s hurt his leg.
   We do not normally use will to talk about what we have arranged to do:
   What are you doing tonight? (not What will you do)
   Alex is getting married next month. (not will get)
   We also use the present continuous for an action just before you start to do it. This happens
   especially with verbs of movement (go/come/leave etc.):
   I’m tired. I’m going to bed now. Goodnight. (not I go to bed now)
   ‘Tina, are you ready yet?’ ‘Yes, I’m coming.’ (not I come)
   This is Ben’s diary for next week.
   He is playing tennis on Monday afu ernoon.
   He is going to the dentist on Tuesday morning.
   He is meeting Kate on Friday.
   In all these examples, Ben has already decided and

   Present simple (I do) with a future meaning
   We use the present simple when we talk about timetables and programmes (for example, transport
   or cinema times):
   I have to go. My train leaves at 11.30.
   What time does the film start tonight?
   The meeting is at nine o’clock tomorrow.
   You can use the present simple to talk about people if their plans are fixed like a timetable:
   I start my new job on Monday.
   What time do you finish work tomorrow?
   But the continuous is more usual for other personal arrangements:
   What time are you meeting Kate tomorrow? (not do you meet)
   Compare:

   the situation now makes this clear.
   The man is walking towards the wall now, so we
   can see that he is going to walk into it.
   You can also say that ‘something is going to happen’ in the future. For example:
   C
   I was going to do something = I intended to do it, but didn’t do it:
   We were going to travel by train, but then we decided to drive instead.
   I was just going to cross the road when somebody shouted ‘Stop!’
   You can say that ‘something was going to happen’ (but didn’t happen):
   I thought it was going to rain, but it didn’t.

   ‘I’ll call you again later when I arrive’ is a sentence
   with two parts:
   the main part: I’ll call you again later
   and when … : when I arrive
   The time is future (‘later’), but Amy says:
   … when I arrive (not when I will arrive)
   We say
   when I do something (not will do)
   when something happens (not will happen)
   Amy is on a train. She’s calling a friend.
   You can also use the present perfect (have done) afu er when / afu er / until / as soon as:
   Can I have the newspaper when you’ve finished with it?
   Don’t say anything while Ian is here. Wait until he has gone.
   We use the present perfect to show that one thing is complete before the other. The two things do not
   happen together:
   When I’ve phoned Kate, we can go out.
   (= first I’ll phone Kate and afu er that we can go out)
   Do not use the present perfect if the two things happen together:
   When I phone Kate, I’ll ask her about the party. (not when I’ve phoned)
   It is ofu en possible to use either the present simple or the present perfect:
   I’ll come as soon as I finish. or I’ll come as soon as I’ve finished.
   You’ll feel better afu er you have or You’ll feel better afu er you’ve had
   something to eat. something to eat.

   I’ll be angry if it happens again. (not if it will happen)
   Hurry up! If we don’t hurry, we’ll be late.
   We use if (not when) for things that will possibly happen (or not happen):
   If it is raining this evening, I won’t go out. (not when it is raining)
   Don’t worry if I’m late tonight. (not when I’m late)
   If they don’t come soon, I’m not going to wait for them.

   can, could and (be) able to
   We use can to say that something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has the ability to do
   something. We use can + infinitive (can do / can see etc.):
   We can see the lake from our hotel.
   ‘I don’t have a pen.’ ‘You can use mine.’
   Can you speak any foreign languages?
   I can come and see you tomorrow if you like.

Unit 026 can, could and (be) able to
------------------------------------

   You can say that somebody is able to do something, but can is more usual:
   We are able to see the lake from our hotel.
   But can has only two forms: can (present) and could (past). So sometimes it is necessary to use
   (be) able to. Compare:
   B
   could and was able to
   We use could for general ability and with see, hear etc. :
   My grandfather could speak five languages.
   I could see them, but not very clearly.
   But to say that somebody succeeded in doing something in a specific situation, we normally
   use was/were able to or managed to (not could):
   The fire spread quickly, but everybody was able to escape. (not could escape)
   I didn’t know where Max was, but I managed to find him in the end. (not could find)
   Compare:
   Jack was an excellent tennis player when he was younger. He could beat anybody.
   (= he was good enough to beat anybody, he had the ability)
   but Jack and Andy played a match yesterday. Andy played well, but Jack managed to beat him.
   (= he succeeded in beating him this time)
   The negative couldn’t (could not) is possible in all situations:
   My grandfather couldn’t swim.
   I looked for Max everywhere, but I couldn’t find him.
   Andy played well, but he couldn’t beat Jack.
   D
   I can’t sleep.
   Tom can come tomorrow.
   Maria can speak French, Spanish and
   English.
   I haven’t been able to sleep recently.
   Tom might be able to come tomorrow.
   Applicants for the job must be able to
   speak two foreign languages.
   Sometimes could is the past of can. We use could especially with:
   see hear smell taste feel remember understand
   We had a lovely room in the hotel. We could see the lake.
   As soon as I walked into the room, I could smell gas.
   I was sitting at the back of the theatre and couldn’t hear very well.
   We also use could to say that somebody had the ability to do something, or was allowed
   to do something:

Unit 027 could (do) and could have (done)
-----------------------------------------

   could (do) and could have (done)
   A
   Sometimes could is the past of can (see Unit 26):
   Listen. I can hear something. (now)
   I listened. I could hear something. (past)
   But could is not always past. We also use could for possible actions now or in the future, especially to
   make suggestions. For example:
   a: What shall we do tonight?
   b: We could go to the cinema.
   a: When you go to Paris next month,
   you could stay with Sarah.
   b: Yes, I suppose I could.
   Can is also possible in these sentences (‘We can go to the
   cinema.’ etc.). Could is less sure than can.
   We also use could (not can) for actions that are not realistic. For example:
   I’m so tired, I could sleep for a week. (not I can sleep for a week)
   Compare can and could:
   I can stay with Sarah when I go to Paris. (realistic)
   Maybe I could stay with Sarah when I go to Paris. (possible, but less sure)
   This is a wonderful place. I could stay here for ever. (unrealistic)
   B
   We also use could (not can) to say that something is possible now or in the future:
   The story could be true, but I don’t think it is. (not can be true)
   I don’t know what time Lisa is coming. She could get here at any time.
   Compare can and could:
   The weather can change very quickly in the mountains. (in general)
   The weather is nice now, but it could change later. (the weather now, not in general)
   C
   We use could have (done) to talk about the past. Compare:
   I’m so tired, I could sleep for a week. (now)
   I was so tired, I could have slept for a week. (past)
   The situation is bad, but it could be worse. (now)
   The situation was bad, but it could have been worse. (past)
   Something could have happened = it was possible, but did not happen:
   Why did you stay at a hotel? You could have stayed with me.
   David was lucky. He could have hurt himself when he fell, but he’s all right.
   D
   I couldn’t do something = it would not be possible:
   I couldn’t live in a big city. I’d hate it. (= it wouldn’t be possible for me)
   Everything is fine right now. Things couldn’t be better.
   For the past we use couldn’t have … (= would not have been possible):
   We had a really good holiday. It couldn’t have been better.
   Note that ‘I couldn’t do something’ has two meanings:
   (1) I couldn’t = it would not be possible now, I would not be able:
   I couldn’t run ten kilometres now. I’m not fit enough. (= I would not be able)
   (2) I couldn’t = I was not able (past)
   I couldn’t run yesterday because I’d hurt my leg. (= I was not able)

Unit 028 must and can’t
-----------------------

   A
   Study this example:
   We use must to say that we believe something is certain:
   You’ve been travelling all day. You must be tired.
   (travelling is tiring and you’ve been travelling all day, so you must be tired)
   ‘Joe is a hard worker.’ ‘Joe? You must be joking. He doesn’t do anything.’
   Louise must get very bored in her job. She does the same thing every day.
   We use can’t to say that we believe something is not possible:
   You’ve just had lunch. You can’t be hungry already.
   (we don’t expect people to be hungry immediately afu er a meal)
   They haven’t lived here for very long. They can’t know many people.
   The structure is:
   you/she/they (etc.)
   must
   can’t
   be (tired / hungry / at work etc.)
   be -ing (doing / going / joking etc.)
   get / know / have etc.
   Study this example:
   B
   Martin and Lucy expected their friends to
   be at home.
   They rang the doorbell twice, but
   nobody has answered. Lucy says:
   They must have gone out.
   (= there is no other possibility)
   There’s nobody at
   home. They must
   have gone out.
   For the past we use must have … and can’t have … :
   I lost one of my gloves. I must have dropped it somewhere.
   (that’s the only explanation I can think of)
   ‘We used to live very near the motorway.’ ‘Did you? It must have been noisy.’
   Sarah hasn’t contacted me. She can’t have got my message.
   Max walked into a wall. He can’t have been looking where he was going.
   The structure is:
   I/you/he (etc.)
   must
   can’t
   have
   been (asleep / at work etc.)
   been -ing (doing / looking etc.)
   gone / got / known etc.
   You can use couldn’t have instead of can’t have:
   Sarah couldn’t have got my message.
   Max couldn’t have been looking where he was going.

   may and might 1
   A
   Study this example situation:
   We use may or might to say that something is possible. You can use may or might:
   It may be true. or It might be true. (= perhaps it is true)
   She might know. or She may know.
   The negative forms are may not and might not:
   It may not be true. (= perhaps it isn’t true)
   She might not know. (= perhaps she doesn’t know)
   I/you/he (etc.)
   may
   might
   (not)
   be (true / in his office etc.)
   be -ing (doing / working / having etc.)
   know / work / want etc.
   Note the difg erence between may be (2 words) and maybe (1 word):
   It may be true. (may + verb)
   ‘Is it true?’ ‘Maybe. I’m not sure.’ (maybe = it’s possible, perhaps)
   You are looking for Ben. Nobody is sure where he is, but you get some suggestions.
   (= perhaps he is in his office)
   (= perhaps he is having lunch)
   (= perhaps she knows)
   For the past we use may have … or might have … :
   a: I wonder why Kate didn’t answer her phone.
   b: She may have been asleep. (= perhaps she was asleep)
   a: I can’t find my phone anywhere.
   b: You might have left it at work. (= perhaps you left it at work)
   a: Why wasn’t Amy at the meeting yesterday?
   b: She might not have known about it. (= perhaps she didn’t know)
   a: I wonder why David was in such a bad mood yesterday.
   b: He may not have been feeling well. (= perhaps he wasn’t feeling well)

   (not) have
   been (asleep / at home etc.)
   been -ing (doing / working / feeling etc.)
   known / had / wanted / left etc.
   B
   could is similar to may and might:
   It’s a strange story, but it could be true. (= it is possible that it’s true)
   You could have left your phone at work. (= it’s possible that you left it there)
   But couldn’t (negative) is difg erent from may not and might not. Compare:
   Sarah couldn’t have received my message. Otherwise she would have replied.
   (= it is not possible that she got my message)
   Why hasn’t Sarah replied to my message? I suppose she might not have received it.
   (= it’s possible that she didn’t receive it – perhaps she did, perhaps she didn’t)

   Usually you can use may or might. So you can say:
   I may go to Ireland. or I might go to Ireland.

   But we use might (not may) when the situation is not real:
   If they paid me better, I might work harder. (not I may work)
   This situation (If they paid me better) is not real. They do not pay me well, so I’m not going

   You can use should afuer:
   insist demand recommend suggest propose
   I insisted that he should apologise.
   Doctors recommend that everyone should eat plenty of fruit.
   What do you suggest we should do?
   Many people are demanding that something should be done about the problem.
   also
   It’s important/vital/necessary/essential that … should … :
   It’s essential that everyone should be here on time.
   You can also leave out should in the sentences in section A. So you can say:
   It’s essential that everyone be here on time. (= … that everyone should be here …)
   I insisted that he apologise. (= … that he should apologise)
   What do you suggest we do?
   Many people are demanding that something be done about the problem.
   This form (be/do/apologise etc.) is called the subjunctive. It is the same as the infinitive (without to).
   You can also use normal present and past forms:
   It’s essential that everyone is here on time.
   I insisted that he apologised.
   B
   We do not use to … with suggest. You can say:
   What do you suggest we should do?
   or What do you suggest we do? (but not What do you suggest us to do?)
   Jane won the lottery.
   I suggested that she should buy a car with the money she won.
   or I suggested that she buy a car.
   or I suggested that she bought a car. (but not I suggested her to buy)
   You can also use -ing afuer suggest (What do you suggest doing?). See Unit 53.

   You can say ‘if something should happen …’ . For example:
   We have no jobs at present, but if the situation should change, we will contact you.
   You can also begin with should (Should something happen …):
   Should the situation change, we will contact you.
   This means the same as ‘If the situation changes, …’ . With should, the speaker feels that the
   possibility is smaller.
   E
   You can use I should … / I shouldn’t … to give advice. For example:
   ‘Shall I leave now?’ ‘No, I should wait a bit.’ (= I advise you to wait)
   Here, I should … = ‘I would … if I were you’, ‘I advise you to …’ . Two more examples:
   ‘I’m going out now. Is it cold outside?’ ‘Yes, I should wear a coat.’

Unit 035 I’d better … it’s time …
---------------------------------

   A
   had better (I’d better / you’d better etc.)
   I’d better do something = it is advisable to do it. If I don’t do it, there will be a problem or a danger:
   I have to meet Amy in ten minutes. I’d better go now or I’ll be late.
   ‘Shall I take an umbrella?’ ‘Yes, you’d better. It might rain.’
   We’d better stop for petrol soon. The tank is almost empty.
   The negative is I’d better not (= I had better not):
   a: That jacket looks good on you. Are you going to buy it?
   b: I’d better not. It’s very expensive.
   You don’t look very well. You’d better not go out tonight.
   Remember that:
   I’d better = I had better, you’d better = you had better etc.
   I’d better phone Chris, hadn’t I?
   We had better go now.
   Had is normally past, but we use had better for the present or future, not past.
   I’d better go now / tomorrow.
   We say ‘I’d better do’ (not to do).
   It might rain. We’d better take an umbrella. (not We’d better to take)
   had better and should
   Had better is similar to should but not exactly the same. We use had better only for a specific situation,
   not for things in general. You can use should in all types of situations to give an opinion or give advice:
   It’s late. You’d better go. or You should go. (a specific situation)
   You’re always at home. You should go out more often. (in general – not ‘had better go’)
   Also, with had better, there is always a danger or a problem if you don’t follow the advice.
   Should means only ‘it is a good thing to do’. Compare:
   It’s a great film. You should go and see it. (but no problem if you don’t)
   The film starts at 8.30. You’d better go now or you’ll miss the beginning.
   B
   it’s time …
   You can say It’s time (for somebody) to … :
   It’s time to go home. / It’s time for us to go home.
   But you can also say:
   It’s late. It’s time we went home.
   When we use it’s time + past (‘it’s time we went’ etc.), the meaning is present, not past:
   It’s time they were here. Why are they so late? (not It’s time they are here)
   It’s time somebody did something = they should have already done it or started it.
   We often use this structure to criticise or to complain:
   This situation can’t continue. It’s time you did something about it.
   He’s very selfish. It’s time he realised that he isn’t the most important person in the world.
   You can also say It’s about time … :
   Jack is a great talker, but it’s about time he did something instead of just talking.

--------------

   would
   A
   We use would (’d) / wouldn’t when we imagine a situation or action (= we think of something that is
   not real):
   It would be nice to buy a new car, but we can’t afg ord it.
   I’d love to live by the sea.
   a: Shall I tell Chris what happened?
   b: No, I wouldn’t say anything.
   (= I wouldn’t say anything in your situation)
   We use would have (done) when we imagine something
   that didn’t happen in the past:
   They helped us a lot. I don’t know what we’d have done without their help.
   (we’d have done = we would have done)
   It’s a shame you didn’t see the film. You would have liked it.
   I didn’t tell Sam what happened. He wouldn’t have been pleased.
   Compare would (do) and would have (done):
   I would call Lisa, but I don’t have her number. (now)
   I would have called Lisa, but I didn’t have her number. (past)
   I’m not going to invite them to the party. They wouldn’t come anyway.
   I didn’t invite them to the party. They wouldn’t have come anyway.
   We ofu en use would in sentences with if (see Units 38–40):
   I would call Lisa if I had her number.
   I would have called Lisa if I’d had her number.
   Compare will (’ll) and would (’d):
   I’ll stay a little longer. I’ve got plenty of time.
   I’d stay a little longer, but I really have to go now. (so I can’t stay longer)
   I’ll call Lisa. I have her number.
   I’d call Lisa, but I don’t have her number. (so I can’t call her)
   Sometimes would/wouldn’t is the past of will/won’t.
   Compare:
   B
   present past
   TOM: I’ll call you on Sunday. → Tom said he’d call me on Sunday.
   aMY: I promise I won’t be late. → Amy promised that she wouldn’t be late.
   LISa: Oh, no! The car won’t start. → Lisa was annoyed because her car wouldn’t start.
   Somebody wouldn’t do something = he/she refused to do it:
   I tried to warn him, but he wouldn’t listen to me. (= he refused to listen)
   The car wouldn’t start. (= it ‘refused’ to start)
   You can also use would to talk about things that happened regularly in the past:
   When we were children, we lived by the sea. In summer, if the weather was fine, we would
   all get up early and go for a swim. (= we did this regularly)
   Whenever Richard was angry, he would walk out of the room.
   With this meaning, would is similar to used to (see Unit 18):
   Whenever Richard was angry, he used to walk out of the room.

   Compare these examples:
   (1) LISa: Shall we take the bus or the train?
   JESS: If we take the bus, it will be cheaper.
   For Jess, it is possible that they will take the bus,
   so she says:
   If we take the bus, it will be …
   (2) Lisa and Jess decide to take the train.
   Later, Jess talks to Joe.
   JOE: How are you going to travel?
   JESS: We’re going to take the train. If we took the bus,
   it would be cheaper, but the train is quicker.
   Now Jess knows they are not going to take the bus,
   so she says:
   If we took the bus, it would be …
   LISA JESS
   If we take the bus,
   it will be cheaper.
   JOE JESS
   If we took the bus, it would be cheaper.
   When we talk about something that will not happen,
   or we don’t expect that it will happen, we use
   if + past (if we went / if there was etc.).
   But the meaning is not past:
   What would you do if you won a lot of money?
   (I don’t really expect this to happen)
   If there was an election tomorrow, who would
   you vote for?
   (there will not be an election tomorrow)
   I’d be surprised if they didn’t come to the party.

   I think I left my watch at your house. If you find it, can you call me?
   but
   If you found a wallet in the street, what would you do with it?
   B
   We do not normally use would in the if-part of the sentence:
   I’d be very scared if somebody pointed a gun at me. (not if somebody would point)
   If we went by bus, it would be cheaper. (not If we would go)
   In the other part of the sentence (not the if-part) we use would (’d) / wouldn’t:

   Study this example situation:
   Sarah wants to phone Paul, but she can’t do this because
   she doesn’t know his number. She says:
   I’d phone him if I knew his number.
   (I’d phone = I would phone)
   Sarah doesn’t know Paul’s number, so she says ‘if I knew’.
   She imagines what she would do if she knew his number.
   When we imagine a situation like this, we use if + past (if I knew / if you were / if we didn’t etc.).
   But the meaning is present, not past:
   There are many things I’d like to do if I had more time. (but I don’t have time)
   If I didn’t want to go to the party, I wouldn’t go. (but I want to go)
   If you were in my position, what would you do?
   It’s a pity he can’t drive. It would be useful if he could.
   We use the past in the same way afu er wish (I wish I knew / I wish you were etc.).
   We use wish to say that we regret something, that something is not as we would like it to be:
   I wish I knew Paul’s phone number.
   (= I don’t know it and I regret this)
   Do you ever wish you could fly?
   (you can’t fly)
   It’s very crowded here. I wish there weren’t

   I wish I lived here. (I don’t live here unfortunately)
   B
   I wish I had an umbrella.
   Afu er if and wish, you can use were instead of was (if I were / I wish it were etc.).
   You can also use was. So you can say:
   If I were you, I wouldn’t buy that coat. or If I was you, …
   I’d go for a walk if it weren’t so cold. or … if it wasn’t so cold.

   In the same way we say:

   Study this example situation:
   Last month Gary was in hospital for a few days. Rachel didn’t know this.
   A few days ago they met by chance. Rachel said:
   If I’d known you were in hospital, I would have gone to visit you.
   (= I didn’t know, so I didn’t go to visit you)
   If I’d known = If I had known. This tells us that she didn’t know before.

Unit 041 wish
-------------

   A
   We also use wish to say that we regret something, that something is not as we would like it.
   When we use wish in this way, we use the past (knew/lived etc.), but the meaning is present:
   I wish I knew what to do about the problem. (but I don’t know)
   I wish you didn’t have to go so soon. (but you have to go)
   Do you wish you lived near the sea? (you don’t live near the sea)
   Jack’s going on a trip to Mexico soon. I wish I was going too. (but I’m not going)
   To say that we regret something that happened before, we use wish + had known / had said etc. :
   I wish I’d known about the party. I’d have gone if I’d known. (but I didn’t know)
   It was a stupid thing to say. I wish I hadn’t said it. (but I said it)
   See also Units 39 and 40.
   B
   I wish I could (do something) = I regret that I cannot do it:
   I’m sorry you have to go. I wish you could stay longer. (but you can’t)
   I’ve met that man before. I wish I could remember his name. (but I can’t)
   I wish I could have (done something) = I regret that I could not do it:
   I hear the party was great. I wish I could have gone. (but I couldn’t go)
   You can say ‘I wish something would happen’. For example:

   D
   It’s been raining all day. Tanya doesn’t like it. She says:
   I wish it would stop raining.
   Tanya would like the rain to stop, but this will probably not happen.
   We use I wish … would when we would like something to happen
   or change.
   We ofu en use I wish … would to complain about a situation:
   The phone has been ringing for five minutes. I wish somebody would answer it.
   I wish you’d do (= you would do) something instead of just sitting and doing nothing.
   You can use I wish … wouldn’t … to complain about things that people do repeatedly:
   I wish you wouldn’t keep interrupting me. (= please stop interrupting me)
   We use I wish … would … to say that we want something to happen. We do not use I wish … would …

   Study this example:
   When we use an active verb, we say what the subject does:
   My grandfather was a builder. He built this house in 1981.
   It’s a big company. It employs two hundred people.
   When we use a passive verb, we say what happens to the subject:
   ‘How old is this house?’ ‘It was built in 1981.’
   Two hundred people are employed by the company.
   This house was built in 1981.
   ‘This house was built’ is passive.
   Compare active and passive:
   Somebody built this house
   object
   in 1981. (active)
   subject
   This house
   subject
   was built in 1981. (passive)
   When we use the passive, who or what causes the action is ofu en unknown or unimportant:
   A lot of money was stolen in the robbery. (somebody stole it, but we don’t know who)
   Is this room cleaned every day? (does somebody clean it? – it’s not important who)
   If we want to say who does or what causes the action, we use by:
   This house was built by my grandfather.
   Two hundred people are employed by the company.
   B
   The passive is be (is/was etc.) + past participle (done/cleaned/seen etc.):
   (be) done (be) cleaned (be) damaged (be) built (be) seen etc.
   The past participle ofu en ends in -ed (cleaned/damaged etc.), but many important verbs are
   irregular (built/done/stolen etc.). See Appendix 1.

   Other verbs which can have two objects are:
   ask off er pay show tell
   When we use these verbs in the passive, most ofu en we begin with the person:
   I’ve been off ered the job, but I don’t think I want it. (= somebody has off ered me the job)
   You will be given plenty of time to decide. (= we will give you plenty of time)
   I didn’t see the original document, but I was shown a copy. (= somebody showed me a copy)
   Tim has an easy job – he’s paid a lot of money to do very little. (= somebody pays him a lot)

   have something done

Unit 046 have something done
----------------------------

   If you have something done, you arrange for somebody to do it for you.
   Compare:
   Lisa repaired the roof. (= she repaired it herself)
   Lisa had the roof repaired. (= she arranged for somebody else to repair it)
   a: Did you make those curtains yourself?
   b: Yes, I like making things.
   a: Did you have those curtains made?
   b: No, I made them myself.
   The roof of Lisa’s house was damaged.
   So she called a builder, and yesterday he came
   and repaired it.
   Lisa had the roof repaired yesterday.
   This means: Lisa arranged for somebody else to
   repair the roof. She didn’t repair it herself.
   Study this example situation:
   Study the word order:
   have object past participle
   Lisa had
   Where did you have
   We are having
   I think you should have
   I don’t like having
   the roof
   your hair
   the house
   that coat
   my picture
   repaired.
   cut?
   painted.
   cleaned.
   taken.
   We say:
   How ofu en do you have your car serviced? (not have serviced your car)
   Our neighbour is having a garage built. (not having built a garage)
   Your hair looks nice. Did you have it cut?
   B
   get something done
   You can say ‘get something done’ instead of ‘have something done’:
   When are you going to get the roof repaired? (= have the roof repaired)
   I think you should get your hair cut really short.
   C
   We also use have something done with a difg erent meaning. For example:
   Paul and Karen had their bags stolen while they were travelling.
   This does not mean that they arranged for somebody to steal their bags. ‘They had their bags stolen’
   means only: ‘Their bags were stolen’.
   With this meaning, we use have something done to say that something happens to somebody or their
   belongings:
   Gary had his nose broken in a fight. (= his nose was broken)
   Have you ever had your bike stolen?

   Reported speech 1 (he said that …)

Unit 047 Reported speech 1 (he said that …)
-------------------------------------------

   Study this example situation:
   You saw Paul yesterday and you want to tell somebody
   what he said.
   There are two ways of doing this:
   You can repeat Paul’s words (direct speech):
   Paul said, ‘I’m feeling ill.’
   Or you can use reported speech:
   Paul said that he was feeling ill.
   Compare:
   direct Paul said, ‘ I am feeling ill.’
   reported Paul said that he was feeling ill.
   In writing we use these quotation
   marks to show direct speech.
   When we use reported speech, the main verb of the sentence is usually past (Paul said that … /
   I told her that … etc.). The rest of the sentence is usually past too:
   Paul said that he was feeling ill.
   I told Lisa that I didn’t have any money.
   You can leave out that. So you can say:
   Paul said that he was feeling ill. or Paul said he was feeling ill.
   In general, the present in direct speech changes to the past in reported speech:
   am/is → was do/does → did will → would
   are → were have/has → had can → could
   want/like/know/go etc. → wanted/liked/knew/went etc.
   See also Unit 48A.
   Compare direct and reported speech:
   B
   You met Anna. Here are some of
   the things she said in direct speech:
   Later you tell somebody what Anna said.
   You use reported speech:
   I’ve lost my phone.
   I want to buy a car.
   I can’t come to the party on
   Friday.
   I don’t have much free time.
   My parents are fine.
   I’m going away for a few days.
   I’ll phone you when I get back.
   Anna said that she had lost her phone.
   She said that she wanted to buy a car.
   She said that she couldn’t come to
   the party on Friday.
   She said that she didn’t have much
   free time.
   She said that her parents were fine.
   She said that she was going away for a
   few days and would phone me when
   she got back.
   The past simple (did/saw/knew etc.) can stay the same in reported speech, or you can change it to the
   past perfect (had done / had seen / had known etc.):
   direct Paul said: ‘I woke up feeling ill, so I didn’t go to work.’
   reported Paul said (that) he woke up feeling ill, so he didn’t go to work. or
   Paul said (that) he had woken up feeling ill, so he hadn’t gone to work.

Unit 048 Reported speech 2
--------------------------

   We do not always change the verb in reported speech. If the situation is still the same, it is not necessary to
   change the verb to the past. For example:
   direct Paul said, ‘My new job is boring.’
   reported Paul said that his new job is boring.
   (The situation is still the same. His job is still boring now.)
   direct Helen said, ‘I want to go to Canada next year.’
   reported Helen told me that she wants to go to Canada next year.
   (Helen still wants to go to Canada next year.)
   You can also change the verb to the past:
   Paul said that his new job was boring.
   Helen told me that she wanted to go to Canada next year.
   But if the situation has changed or finished, you need to use a past verb. Compare:
   Paul left the room suddenly. He said ‘I have to go.’ (direct speech)
   Paul left the room suddenly. He said (that) he had to go. (not has to go)
   You need to use the past in reported speech when
   what was said is difg erent from what is really true.
   For example:
   You met Rachel a few days ago. She said:
   Have you heard? Joe is in hospital.
   Later that day you meet Joe in the street. You say:
   Joe, this is a surprise. Rachel said you were in hospital.
   (not ‘you are in hospital’ – it’s clear that he isn’t)
   B
   say and tell
   If you say who somebody is talking to, use tell:
   Rachel told me that you were in hospital. (not Rachel said me)
   What did you tell the police? (not say the police)
   Otherwise use say:
   Rachel said that you were in hospital.
   (not Rachel told that …)
   What did you say?
   You can ‘say something to somebody’:
   Anna said goodbye to me and left . (not Anna said me goodbye)
   What did you say to the police?
   C
   We say ‘tell somebody to …’ and ‘ask somebody to …’ .
   Compare direct and reported speech:
   direct ‘Drink plenty of water,’ the doctor said to me.
   reported The doctor told me to drink plenty of water.
   direct ‘Don’t work too hard,’ I said to Joe.
   reported I told Joe not to work too hard.
   direct ‘Can you help me, please,’ Jackie said to me.
   reported Jackie asked me to help her.
   You can also say ‘Somebody said (not) to do something’:
   Paul said not to worry about him. (but not Paul said me)

   In questions beginning who/what/which/where, prepositions (in, for etc.) usually go at the end:
   Where are you from? What was the weather like?
   Who do you want to speak to? Which job has Tina applied for?
   You can use preposition + whom in formal style:
   To whom do you wish to speak?
   C
   isn’t it … ? / didn’t you … ? etc. (negative questions)
   We use negative questions especially to show surprise:
   Didn’t you hear the doorbell? I rang it three times.
   or when we expect the listener to agree with us:
   ‘Haven’t we met before?’ ‘Yes, I think we have.’
   Note the meaning of yes and no in answers to negative questions:
   ‘Don’t you want to go?’
   ‘Yes.’ (= Yes, I want to go)
   ‘No.’ (= No, I don’t want to go)
   We often use negative questions with Why … ? :
   Why don’t we eat out tonight? (not Why we don’t eat)
   Why wasn’t Emma at work yesterday? (not Why Emma wasn’t)

   Questions 2 (do you know where … ? /

Unit 050 Questions 2 (do you know where … ? / he asked me where …)
------------------------------------------------------------------

   Do you know where … ? / I don’t know why … / Could you tell me what … ? etc.
   We say: Where has Tom gone?
   but Do you know where Tom has gone? (not has Tom gone)
   When the question (Where has Tom gone?) is part of a longer sentence (Do you know … ? /
   I don’t know … / Can you tell me … ? etc.), the word order changes. We say:
   What time is it? but Do you know what time it is?
   Who are those people? I don’t know who those people are.
   Where can I find Louise? Can you tell me where I can find Louise?
   How much will it cost? Do you have any idea how much it will cost?
   Be careful with do/does/did questions. We say:
   What time does the film start? but Do you know what time the film starts?
   (not does the film start)
   What do you mean? Please explain what you mean.
   Why did she leave early? I wonder why she left early.
   Use if or whether where there is no other question word (what, why etc.):
   Did anybody see you? but I don’t know if anybody saw me.
   or … whether anybody saw me.
   He asked me where …
   The same changes in word order happen in questions in reported speech. Compare:
   direct The police officer said to us ‘Where are you going ?’
   reported The police officer asked us where we were going .
   direct Clare asked ‘What time do the shops close ?’
   reported Clare wanted to know what time the shops closed .
   In reported speech the verb usually changes to the past (were, closed etc.). See Unit 47.
   Study these examples. You had a job interview and the interviewer asked you these questions:
   Are you willing to travel?
   What do you do in your spare time?
   How long have you been
   working in your present job?
   Why did you apply for the job?
   Can you speak any other languages?
   Do you have a driving licence?
   Later you tell a friend what the interviewer asked you. You use reported speech:
   She asked if (or whether) I was willing to travel.
   She wanted to know what I did in my spare time.
   She asked how long I had been working in my present job.
   She asked why I had applied for the job. or … why I applied …
   She wanted to know if (or whether) I could speak any other languages.
   She asked if (or whether) I had a driving licence.

   Gary wasn’t working, but Laura was. (= Laura was working)
   Jessica could lend me the money, but she won’t. (= she won’t lend me the money)
   We use do/does/did for the present and past simple:
   ‘Do you like onions?’ ‘Yes, I do.’ (= I like onions)
   ‘Does Simon live in London?’ ‘He did, but he doesn’t any more.’
   You can use auxiliary verbs to deny what somebody says (= say it is not true):
   ‘You’re sitting in my place.’ ‘No, I’m not.’ (= I’m not sitting in your place)

Unit 051 Auxiliary verbs (have/do/can etc.) I think so / I hope so etc.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

   We use have you? / isn’t she? / are they? etc. to show that we are interested in what somebody has said,
   or to show surprise:
   ‘I’ve just seen Steven.’ ‘Oh, have you? How is he?’
   ‘Lisa isn’t very well today.’ ‘Isn’t she? What’s wrong with her?’
   ‘It rained every day during our holiday.’ ‘Did it? What a shame!’
   ‘James and Tanya are getting married.’ ‘Are they? Really?’

   We use auxiliary verbs with so and neither:
   ‘I’m tired.’ ‘So am I.’ (= I’m tired too)
   ‘I never read newspapers.’ ‘Neither do I.’ (= I never read newspapers either)
   Sarah can’t drive and neither can Mark.
   Note the word order afuer so and neither (verb before subject):
   I passed the exam and so did Paul. (not so Paul did)
   Instead of neither, you can use nor. You can also use not … either:
   ‘I don’t know.’ ‘Neither do I.’ or ‘Nor do I.’ or ‘I don’t either.’
   C
   I think so / I suppose so etc.
   You can say I think so / I suppose so etc. when we don’t want to repeat something:
   ‘Are those people Korean?’ ‘I think so.’ (= I think they are Korean)
   ‘Is Kate working tomorrow?’ ‘I suppose so.’ (= I suppose she is working tomorrow)
   ‘Will you be at home this evening?’ ‘I expect so.’ (= I expect I’ll be at home …)
   In the same way we say: I hope so, I guess so and I’m afraid so.
   The usual negative forms are:
   I think so / I expect so → I don’t think so / I don’t expect so
   I hope so / I’m afraid so → I hope not / I’m afraid not
   I guess so / I suppose so → I guess not / I suppose not

   Question tags (do you? isn’t it? etc.)

Unit 052 Question tags (do you? isn’t it? etc.)
-----------------------------------------------

   A
   Study these examples:
   Have you? and wasn’t it? are question tags. These are mini-questions that you can put on the end of
   a sentence.
   In question tags, we use an auxiliary verb (have/was/will etc.).
   We use do/does/did for the present and past simple (see Unit 51):
   ‘Karen plays the piano, doesn’t she?’ ‘Well, yes, but not very well.’
   ‘You didn’t lock the door, did you?’ ‘No, I forgot.’
   No, I haven’t.
   You haven’t seen
   Lisa today, have you?
   Normally we use a negative question tag afu er … and a positive question tag afu er a
   a positive sentence: negative sentence:
   positive sentence
   Kate will be here soon,
   There was a lot of trafg ic,
   Joe should pass the exam,
   negative tag
   won’t she?
   wasn’t there?
   shouldn’t he?
   negative sentence
   Kate won’t be late,
   They don’t like us,
   You haven’t eaten yet,
   positive tag
   will she?
   do they?
   have you?
   Notice the meaning of yes and no in answer to a negative sentence:
   ‘You’re not going out this morning, are you?’
   + +
   ‘Yes.’ (= Yes, I am going out)
   ‘No.’ (= No, I am not going out)
   ⎧
   ⎨
   ⎩
   B
   The meaning of a question tag depends on how you say it. If your voice goes down, you are not
   really asking a question. You expect the listener to agree with you:
   ‘It’s a nice day, isn’t it?’ ‘Yes, beautiful.’
   ‘Paul doesn’t look well today, does he?’ ‘No, he looks very tired.’
   ‘Lisa’s very funny. She’s got a great sense of humour, hasn’t she?’ ‘Yes, she has.’
   But if the voice goes up, it is a real question:
   ‘You haven’t seen Kate today, have you?’ ‘No, I haven’t.’
   (= Have you seen Kate today?)
   You can use a negative sentence + positive tag to ask for things or information, or to ask somebody
   to do something. The voice goes up at the end of the tag:
   ‘You couldn’t do me a favour, could you?’ ‘It depends what it is.’
   ‘You don’t know where Karen is, do you?’ ‘Sorry, I have no idea.’
   C
   Afu er Let’s … (= Let us) the question tag is shall we:
   Let’s go for a walk, shall we? (the voice goes up)
   Afu er Don’t … , the question tag is will you:
   Don’t be late, will you? (the voice goes down)
   Afu er I’m … , the negative question tag is aren’t I? (= am I not?):
   ‘I’m right, aren’t I?’ ‘Yes, you are.’

-------------------------------------------------------

   A
   like / love / hate
   When you talk about repeated actions, you can use -ing or to … afuer these verbs.
   So you can say:
   Do you like getting up early? or Do you like to get up early?
   Stephanie hates flying. or Stephanie hates to fly.
   I love meeting people. or I love to meet people.
   I don’t like being kept waiting. or … like to be kept waiting.
   I don’t like friends calling me at work. or … friends to call me at work.
   but
   (1) We use -ing (not to …) when we talk about a situation that already exists (or existed).
   For example:
   Paul lives in Berlin now. He likes living there.
   (he lives there now and he likes it)
   Do you like being a student? (you are a student – do you like it?)
   The office I worked in was horrible. I hated working there. (I worked there and I hated it)
   (2) There is sometimes a difgerence between I like to do and I like doing:
   I like doing something = I do it and I enjoy it:
   I like cleaning the kitchen. (= I enjoy it.)
   I like to do something = I choose to do it (but maybe I don’t enjoy it):
   It’s not my favourite job, but I like to clean the kitchen as often as possible.
   Note that we use -ing (not to …) with enjoy and mind:
   I enjoy cleaning the kitchen. (not I enjoy to clean)
   I don’t mind cleaning the kitchen. (not I don’t mind to clean)
   would like / would love / would hate / would prefer
   Would like / would love etc. are usually followed by to … :
   I’d like (= I would like) to go away for a few days.
   What would you like to do this evening?
   I wouldn’t like to go on holiday alone.
   I’d love to meet your family.
   Would you prefer to eat now or later?
   Compare I like and I would like (I’d like):
   I like playing tennis. / I like to play tennis. (= I like it in general)
   I’d like to play tennis today. (= I want to play today)
   Would mind is followed by -ing:
   Would you mind closing the door, please? (not mind to close)
   B
   I would like to have (done something)
   I would like to have done something = I regret now that I didn’t or couldn’t do it:
   It’s a shame we didn’t see Anna. I would like to have seen her again.
   We’d like to have gone away, but we were too busy at home.
   We use the same structure afuer would love / would hate / would prefer:
   Poor David! I would hate to have been in his position.
   I’d love to have gone to the party, but it was impossible.

   You can say:
   prefer something to something else

   Sarah prefers to live in the country rather than in a city.
   would prefer (I’d prefer …)
   We use would prefer to say what somebody wants in a specific situation (not in general):
   ‘Would you prefer tea or coffee?’ ‘Coffee, please.’
   We say ‘would prefer to do something’ (not usually would prefer doing):
   ‘Shall we go by train?’ ‘I’d prefer to drive.’ (= I would prefer …)
   I’d prefer to stay at home tonight rather than go to the cinema.
   B
   would rather (I’d rather …)
   I’d rather = I would rather. I’d rather do something = I’d prefer to do it.
   We say I’d rather do (not to do). Compare:
   ‘Shall we go by train?’
   Which would you rather do,
   Which would you prefer to do,
   The negative is ‘I’d rather not …’ :
   I’m tired. I’d rather not go out this evening, if you don’t mind.
   ‘Do you want to go out this evening?’ ‘I’d rather not.’
   We say ‘I’d rather do one thing than do another’:

Unit 060 Preposition (in/for/about etc.) + -ing
-----------------------------------------------

   A
   If a preposition (in/for/about etc.) is followed by a verb, the verb ends in -ing:
   Are you interested
   I’m not good
   Kate must be fed up
   What are the advantages
   Thanks very much
   How
   Why don’t you go out

   languages.

   me to your party.

   at home all the time?
   ill.
   You can also say ‘instead of somebody doing something’, ‘fed up with people doing something’ etc. :
   I’m fed up with people telling me what to do.
   We say:
   B
   to + -ing (look forward to doing something etc.)
   We often use to + infinitive (to do / to see etc.):
   We decided to travel by train.
   Would you like to meet for lunch tomorrow?
   But to is also a preposition (like in/for/about/with etc.). For example:
   We went from Paris to Geneva.
   I prefer tea to coffee.
   Are you looking forward to the weekend?
   If we use a preposition + verb, the verb ends in -ing:
   I’m fed up with travelling by train.
   How about going away this weekend?
   So, when to is a preposition and it is followed by a verb, we use to -ing:
   I prefer driving to travelling by train. (not to travel)
   Are you looking forward to going on holiday? (not looking forward to go)

   prevent … from
   stop … from
   suspect … of
   thank … for
   He accused
   We congratulated

Unit 068 -ing clauses (He hurt his knee playing football.)
----------------------------------------------------------

   Kate is in the kitchen. She’s making coffee.
   You can say:
   Kate is in the kitchen making coffee.
   You can use -ing in this way when two things happen
   at the same time:
   A man ran out of the house shouting.
   (= he ran out of the house and he was shouting)
   Do something! Don’t just stand there doing nothing!
   Be careful crossing the road.
   We also use -ing when one action happens during another action:
   Joe hurt his knee playing football. (= while he was playing)
   Did you cut yourself shaving? (= while you were shaving)
   You can also say ‘while doing something’ and ‘when doing something’:
   Joe hurt his knee while playing football.
   Be careful when crossing the road. (= when you are crossing)
   -ing clause
   When one action happens before something else, we use having (done) for the first action:
   Having found a hotel, we looked for somewhere to eat.
   Having finished her work, she went home.
   You can also say afu er -ing:
   Afu er finishing her work, she went home.
   These structures are used more in written English than in spoken English.
   When we begin a sentence with ‘Having (done something)’ or ‘Afu er (doing something)’, we
   write a comma (,) afu er this part of the sentence:
   Having finished her work, she went home.
   comma
   B
   You can also use -ing to explain something, or to say why somebody does something.
   The sentence usually begins with -ing:
   Feeling tired, I went to bed early. (= because I felt tired)
   Being unemployed, he doesn’t have much money. (= because he is unemployed)
   Not having a car, she finds it difg icult to get around.
   (= because she doesn’t have a car)
   We use having (done) for something that is complete before something else:
   Having seen the film twice, I didn’t want to see it again.
   (= because I had seen it twice)
   These structures are used more in written English than in spoken English.
   When we begin a sentence with -ing (Feeling tired … / Not knowing … / Having seen … etc.), we write
   a comma (,) afu er this part of the sentence.

   Countable
   I eat a banana every day.
   I like bananas.
   Banana is a countable noun.
   A countable noun can be singular (banana)
   or plural (bananas).
   We can use numbers with countable nouns.
   So we can say one banana, two bananas
   etc.
   Examples of nouns usually countable:
   Kate was singing a song.
   There’s a nice beach near here.
   Do you have a ten-pound note?
   It wasn’t your fault. It was an accident.
   There are no batteries in the radio.
   We don’t have enough cups.
   Uncountable
   I eat rice every day.
   I like rice.
   Rice is an uncountable noun.
   An uncountable noun has only one form (rice).
   There is no plural.
   We cannot use numbers with uncountable
   nouns. We cannot say ‘one rice’, ‘two rices’
   etc.
   Examples of nouns usually uncountable:
   Kate was listening to music.
   There’s sand in my shoes.
   Do you have any money?
   It wasn’t your fault. It was bad luck.
   There is no electricity in this house.
   We don’t have enough water.
   You can use a/an with singular countable
   nouns:
   a beach a student an umbrella
   You cannot use singular countable nouns alone
   (without a/the/my etc.):
   Do you want a banana?
   (not want banana)
   There’s been an accident.
   (not There’s been accident)
   You can use plural countable nouns alone:
   I like bananas. (= bananas in general)
   Accidents can be prevented.
   We do not use a/an with uncountable nouns.
   We do not say ‘a sand’, ‘a music’, ‘a rice’.
   But you can often use a … of. For example:
   a bowl / a packet / a grain of rice
   You can use uncountable nouns alone
   (without the/my/some etc.):
   I eat rice every day.
   There’s blood on your shirt.
   Can you hear music?
   B
   You can use some and any with plural
   countable nouns:
   We sang some songs.
   Did you buy any apples?
   We use many and few with plural countable
   nouns:
   We didn’t take many pictures.
   I have a few things to do.
   You can use some and any with uncountable
   nouns:
   We listened to some music.

   Study these sentences:
   The girafg e is the tallest of all animals.
   The bicycle is an excellent means of transport.
   When was the camera invented?
   The dollar is the currency of the United States.
   In these examples, the … does not mean one specific thing.
   The girafg e = a specific type of animal, not a specific girafg e.
   We use the … in this way to talk about a type of animal,
   machine etc.
   In the same way we use the for musical instruments:
   Can you play the guitar?
   The piano is my favourite instrument.
   Compare a and the:
   I’d like to have a piano. but I can’t play the piano.
   We saw a girafg e at the zoo. but The girafg e is my favourite animal.
   Note that man (without the) = human beings in general, the human race:
   What do you know about the origins of man? (not the man)

Unit 076 the 4 (the girafge / the telephone / the old etc.)
-----------------------------------------------------------

   the old, the rich etc.
   We use the + adjective (without a noun) to talk about groups of people. For example:
   the old
   the elderly
   the rich
   the poor
   the homeless
   the unemployed
   the sick
   the injured
   the old = old people, the rich = rich people etc. :
   Do you think the rich should pay higher taxes?
   We need to do more to help the homeless.
   Note that we say: the old (not the olds), the poor (not the poors) etc.
   The rich, the homeless etc. are plural. For one person, we say:
   a rich man (not a rich) a homeless person (not a homeless)
   B
   the French, the Chinese etc.
   We use the + a few nationality adjectives that end in -ch or -sh. For example:
   the French the Dutch the British the English the Spanish
   The meaning is plural – the people of that country.
   The French are famous for their food. (not French are …)
   We do not say ‘a French’ or ‘an English’ (singular). For example, we say:
   I met a French woman / an English guy.
   We also use the + nationality words ending in -ese or -ss. For example:
   the Chinese the Portuguese the Swiss
   These words can also be singular (a Chinese, a Swiss etc.).
   With other nationality words, the plural ends in -s (usually without the). For example:
   an Italian → Italians a Mexican → Mexicans a Thai → Thais
   Italians / Mexicans / Thais are very friendly.
   In all cases you can use adjective + people. For example, you can say:
   French / Chinese / Mexican people are very friendly.

   American English ➜ Appendix 7
   A
   Sometimes we use a plural noun for one thing that has two parts. For example:
   trousers (two legs)
   also jeans/tights/shorts/pants
   pyjamas
   (top and bottom)
   glasses binoculars scissors
   These words are plural, so they take a plural verb:
   My trousers are too long. (not My trousers is)
   You can also use a pair of + these words:
   Those are nice jeans. or That’s a nice pair of jeans. (not a nice jeans)
   I need some new glasses. or I need a new pair of glasses.
   Singular and plural

Unit 079 Singular and plural
----------------------------

   Some nouns end in -ics, but are not usually plural. For example:
   athletics gymnastics economics politics
   physics electronics maths (= mathematics)
   Gymnastics is my favourite sport. (not Gymnastics are)
   News is not plural (see Unit 70B):
   I have some news for you. It’s good news!
   Some words that end in -s can be singular or plural. For example:
   means a means of transport many means of transport
   series a TV series two TV series
   species a species of fish 200 species of fish
   B
   C
   Some singular nouns are often used with a plural verb. For example:
   audience committee company family firm government stafg team
   These nouns are all groups of people. We often think of them as a number of people (= they),
   not as one thing (= it). So we often use a plural verb:
   The government (= they) have decided to increase taxes.
   The stafg at the company (= they) are not happy with their working conditions.
   In the same way, we often use a plural verb afuer the name of a company or a sports team:
   Shell have increased the price of petrol.
   Italy are playing Brazil next Sunday (in a football match).
   You can also use a singular verb (The government wants … / Shell has … etc.).
   We use a plural verb with police:
   The police are investigating the crime, but haven’t arrested anyone yet.
   (not The police is … hasn’t)
   Note that we say a police officer / a policeman / a policewoman (not a police).
   We do not often use the plural of person (‘persons’). We normally use people (a plural word):
   He’s a nice person. but They are nice people. (not nice persons)
   Many people don’t have enough to eat. (not Many people doesn’t)
   D
   We think of a sum of money, a period of time, a distance etc. as one thing. So we use a singular verb:
   Fifuy thousand pounds (= it) was stolen in the robbery. (not were stolen)
   Three years (= it) is a long time to be without a job. (not Three years are)
   Two miles isn’t very far to walk.

.. _P160:

   -’s and of … ➜ Unit 81 a week’s holiday / three weeks’ holiday etc. ➜ Unit 81E
   You can use two nouns together (noun + noun) to mean one thing/person/idea etc. :
   a bus driver income tax the city centre an apple tree
   The first noun is like an adjective. It tells us what kind of thing/person/idea etc. :
   a bus driver = the driver of a bus
   income tax = tax that you pay on your income
   the city centre = the centre of the city
   an apple tree = a tree that has apples
   a Paris hotel = a hotel in Paris
   my life story = the story of my life
   So you can say:
   a television camera a television programme a television studio a television producer
   (things or people to do with television)
   language problems marriage problems health problems work problems
   (difgerent kinds of problems)
   Sometimes the first word ends in -ing:
   a frying pan (= a pan for frying)
   a washing machine
   a swimming pool

Unit 080 Noun + noun (a bus driver / a headache)
------------------------------------------------

   Sometimes there are more than two nouns together:
   I waited at the hotel reception desk.
   We watched the World Swimming Championships on TV.
   If you want to play table tennis (= a game), you need a table tennis table (= a table).
   B
   When two nouns are together like this, sometimes we write them as one word and sometimes as two
   separate words. For example:
   a headache toothpaste a weekend a car park a road sign
   There are no clear rules for this. If you are not sure, write two words.
   C
   Note the difgerence between:
   a coffee cup (maybe empty) and a cup of coffee (= a cup with coffee in it)
   a shopping bag (maybe empty) and a bag of shopping (= a bag full of shopping)
   D
   When we use noun + noun, the first noun is like an adjective. It is normally singular, but the
   meaning is often plural.
   For example: a car park is a place to park cars, an apple tree is a tree that has apples.
   In the same way we say:
   a three-hour journey (= a journey that takes three hours)
   a ten-pound note (= a note with the value of ten pounds)
   a four-week course
   a six-mile walk
   two 14-year-old girls
   Compare:
   It was a four-week course. (not a four weeks course)
   but The course lasted four weeks.

   my sisters’ room (= their room – two or more sisters)

   If a plural noun does not end in -s (for example men/women/children/people) we use -’s:

   some and any
   In general we use some (also somebody/someone/something) in positive sentences and any
   (also anybody etc.) in negative sentences:
   We use any in the following sentences because the meaning is negative:
   She went out without any money. (she didn’t take any money with her)
   He refused to eat anything. (he didn’t eat anything)
   It’s a very easy exam. Hardly anybody fails. (= almost nobody fails)

Unit 085 some and any
---------------------

   some
   We bought some flowers.
   He’s busy. He has some work to do.
   There’s somebody at the door.
   I want something to eat.
   any
   We didn’t buy any flowers.
   He’s lazy. He never does any work.
   There isn’t anybody at the door.
   I don’t want anything to eat.
   We use both some and any in questions. We use some/somebody/something to talk about a person
   or thing that we know exists, or we think exists:
   Are you waiting for somebody? (I think you are waiting for somebody)
   We use some in questions when we ask for or offer things:
   Can I have some sugar, please? (there is probably some sugar that I can have)
   Would you like something to eat? (there is something to eat)
   But in most questions, we use any. We do not know if the thing or person exists:
   Do you have any luggage? (maybe you do, maybe not)
   Is there anybody in the house? (maybe there is, maybe not)
   B
   You can use if + any:
   Let me know if you need anything.
   If anyone has any questions, I’ll be pleased to answer them.
   The following sentences have the idea of if:
   I’m sorry for any trouble I’ve caused. (= if I have caused any trouble)
   The police want to speak to anyone who saw the accident. (= if there is anyone)
   C
   We also use any with the meaning ‘it doesn’t matter which’:
   You can take any bus. They all go to the centre. (= it doesn’t matter which bus you take)
   Come and see me any time you want.
   We use anybody/anyone/anything/anywhere in the same way:
   We forgot to lock the door. Anybody could have come in.
   Compare some- and any-:
   a: I’m hungry. I want something to eat.
   b: What would you like?
   a: I don’t mind. Anything. (= it doesn’t matter what)
   b: Let’s go out somewhere.
   a: Where shall we go?
   b: Anywhere. I just want to go out.
   D
   Somebody/someone/anybody/anyone are singular words:
   Someone is here to see you.
   But we use they/them/their afuer these words:
   Someone has forgotten their umbrella. (= his or her umbrella)
   If anybody wants to leave early, they can. (= he or she can)

   We use both/neither/either for two things.
   You can use these words with a noun (both books, neither book etc.).
   For example, you are going out to eat. There are two possible restaurants. You say:
   Both restaurants are good. (not the both restaurants)
   Neither restaurant is expensive.
   We can go to either restaurant. I don’t mind. (= one or the other, it doesn’t matter which)
   I haven’t been to either restaurant before. (= not one or the other)
   You can also use both/neither/either without a noun:
   ‘Which do you prefer, basketball or tennis?’ ‘It’s hard to say. I like both.’
   ‘Is your friend British or American?’ ‘Neither. She’s Australian.’
   ‘Do you want tea or coffee?’ ‘Either. I don’t mind.’

Unit 089 both / both of neither / neither of either / either of
---------------------------------------------------------------

   both of … / neither of … / either of …
   We use both of / neither of / either of + the/these/my/Tom’s … etc. So we say ‘both of the
   restaurants’, ‘both of those restaurants’ etc. (but not both of restaurants):
   Both of these restaurants are good.
   Neither of the restaurants we went to was expensive.
   I haven’t been to either of those restaurants.
   You don’t need of afuer both. So you can say:
   Both of these restaurants are good. or Both these restaurants are good.
   We also use both of / neither of / either of + us/you/them:
   (talking to two people) Can either of you speak Russian?
   I asked two people how to get to the station, but neither of them knew.
   We say ‘both of’ before us/you/them (you need to use of):
   Both of us were tired. (not Both us were …)
   After neither of … a verb can be singular or plural:
   Neither of them is at home. or Neither of them are at home.
   B
   You can say:
   C
   both … and …
   neither … nor …
   either … or …
   Both Chris and Paul were late.
   I was both tired and hungry when I arrived home.
   Neither Chris nor Paul came to the party.
   There was an accident outside our house, but we neither saw nor
   heard anything.
   I’m not sure where Maria’s from. She’s either Spanish or Italian.
   Either you apologise, or I’ll never speak to you again.

   We say:
   Everybody was happy. or Everyone was happy. (not all were happy)
   He thinks he knows everything. (not knows all)
   Our holiday was a disaster. Everything went wrong. (not all went wrong)
   We do not often use all alone in this way. We do not say ‘all were happy’, ‘he knows all’ etc.
   We use all in the following ways:

Unit 090 all every whole
------------------------

   all + noun (all cars, all my money etc.)
   all of + us/you/them
   we/you/they … all … (see also Unit 110D)
   all about …
   all … = the only thing(s)
   All my friends were happy.
   All of us were happy.
   We were all happy.
   He knows all about computers.
   All I’ve eaten today is a banana.
   (= the only thing I’ve eaten today)
   whole and all
   Whole = complete, entire. We use whole mostly with singular nouns:
   Did you read the whole book? (= all the book, not just a part of it)
   Emily has lived her whole life in the same town.
   I was so hungry, I ate a whole packet of biscuits. (= a complete packet)
   We do not normally use whole with uncountable nouns (water, food, money etc.).
   We say:
   Did you spend all the money I gave you? (not the whole money)
   I read all the information carefully. (not the whole information)
   We use the/my/a etc. before whole. Compare whole and all:
   I read the whole book. but I read all the information.
   B
   every day / all day / the whole day
   We use every to say how often something happens (every day / every ten minutes etc.):
   When we were on holiday, we went to the beach every day. (not all days)
   The bus service is excellent. There’s a bus every ten minutes.
   We don’t see each other very often – about every six months.
   All day or the whole day = the complete day from beginning to end:
   We spent all day on the beach. or We spent the whole day …
   Dan was very quiet. He didn’t say a word all evening. or … the whole evening.
   Note that we say all day (not all the day), all week (not all the week) etc.
   Compare all the time and every time:
   They never go out. They are at home all the time. (= always, continuously)
   Every time I see you, you look difgerent. (= each time, on every occasion)
   C
   Every/everybody/everyone/everything are singular words, so we use a singular verb:
   Every seat in the theatre was taken.
   Everybody has arrived. (not have arrived)
   But we use they/them/their afuer everybody/everyone:
   Everybody said they enjoyed themselves. (= everybody enjoyed himself or herself)

   Each and every are similar. Ofu en it is possible to use each or every:
   Each time I see you, you look difg erent. or Every time I see you …
   But each and every are not exactly the same.
   We use each when we think of things
   separately, one by one.
   Study each sentence carefully.
   (= study the sentences one by one)
   each =
   Each is more usual for a small number:
   There were four books on the table.
   Each book was a difg erent colour.
   (in a card game) At the beginning of the
   game, each player has three cards.
   We use every when we think of things as a
   group. The meaning is similar to all.
   Every window in the house was open.
   (= all the windows in the house)
   every =
   Every is more usual for a large number:
   Kate loves reading. She has read every
   book in the library. (= all the books)
   I’d like to visit every country in
   the world. (= all the countries)
   Each (but not every) can be used for two things:
   In football, each team has eleven players. (not every team)
   We use every (not each) to say how ofu en something happens:
   ‘How ofu en do you use your car?’ ‘Every day.’ (not Each day)
   There’s a bus every ten minutes. (not each ten minutes)
   We use each with or without a noun:
   None of the rooms are the same.
   Each room is difg erent. or
   Each is difg erent.
   Or you can use each one:
   Each one is difg erent.
   We say each of (the/these/them … etc.):
   Each of the books was a difg erent
   colour. (not each of books)
   Each of them was a difg erent colour.
   Read each of these sentences carefully.
   We use every with a noun:
   She’s read every book in the library.
   We don’t use every alone, but you can say
   every one:
   a: Have you read all these books?
   B: Yes, every one.

Unit 092 Relative clauses 1: clauses with who/that/which
--------------------------------------------------------

   A
   Study this example situation:
   Last week we had a party and a lot of people came. Everybody enjoyed it.
   Everybody who came to the party enjoyed it.
   A clause is a part of a sentence. A relative clause tells us which person or thing (or what kind of
   person or thing) the speaker means:
   the woman who lives next door to me
   (‘who lives next door to me’ tells us which woman)
   people who complain all the time
   (‘who complain all the time’ tells us what kind of people)
   We use who in a relative clause for people (not things):
   The woman who lives next door to me is a doctor.
   I don’t like people who complain all the time.
   An architect is someone who designs buildings.
   What was the name of the person who called?
   Do you know anyone who wants to buy a car?
   We also use that for people, but not which:
   The woman that lives next door to me is a doctor. (not the woman which)
   Sometimes you must use who (not that) for people – see Unit 95.
   relative clause
   When we are talking about things, we use that or which (not who) in a relative clause:
   I don’t like stories that have unhappy endings.
   or … stories which have unhappy endings.
   Grace works for a company that makes furniture.
   or … a company which makes furniture.
   The machine that broke down is working again now.
   or The machine which broke down …
   In these examples that is more usual than which, but sometimes you must use which. See Unit 95.
   B
   In relative clauses we use who/that/which, not he/she/they/it.
   Compare:
   I met a Canadian woman at the party. She is an English teacher. (2 sentences)
   I met a Canadian woman who is an English teacher. (1 sentence)
   I can’t find the keys. They were on the table.
   Where are the keys that were on the table? (not the keys they were)
   C
   What = the thing(s) that
   Compare what and that:
   What happened was my fault. (= the thing that happened)
   but
   Everything that happened was my fault.
   (not Everything what happened)
   The machine that broke down is now working again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

   Relative clauses 2:
   clauses with and without who/that/which
   A
   Look at these example sentences from Unit 92:
   The woman who lives next door to me is a doctor. (or The woman that lives …)
   The woman lives next door to me who (= the woman) is the subject
   Where are the keys that were on the table? (or … the keys which were …)
   The keys were on the table that (= the keys) is the subject
   You must use who/that/which when it is the subject of the relative clause. You cannot leave out
   who/that/which in these examples.
   B
   who (= the woman) is the object
   I is the subject
   that (= the keys) is the object
   you is the subject
   Sometimes who/that/which is the object of the verb. For example:
   The woman who I wanted to see was away on holiday.
   I wanted to see the woman
   Did you find the keys that you lost?
   you lost the keys
   When who/that/which is the object, you can leave it out. So you can say:
   The woman I wanted to see was away. or The woman who I wanted to see …
   Did you find the keys you lost? or … the keys that you lost?
   The dress Lisa bought doesn’t fit her very well. or The dress that Lisa bought …
   Is there anything I can do? or … anything that I can do?
   Note that we say:
   the keys you lost (not the keys you lost them)
   the dress Lisa bought (not the dress Lisa bought it)
   Note the position of prepositions (to/in/for etc.) in relative clauses:
   C
   Tom is talking to a woman. Do you know her? (2 sentences)
   Do you know the woman Tom is talking to ? (or … the woman who/that Tom is talking to)
   I slept in a bed. It wasn’t comfortable. (2 sentences)
   The bed I slept in wasn’t comfortable. (or The bed that/which I slept in …)
   Are these the books you were looking for? or
   Are these the books that/which you were …
   The man I was sitting next to on the plane talked all the time. or
   The man who/that I was sitting next to …
   Note that we say:
   the books you were looking for (not the books you were looking for them)
   the man I was sitting next to (not the man I was sitting next to him)
   We say:
   Everything (that) they said was true. (not Everything what they said)
   I gave her all the money (that) I had. (not all the money what I had)
   What = the thing(s) that:
   What they said was true. (= The things that they said)

Unit 094 Relative clauses 3: whose/whom/where
---------------------------------------------

   A
   whose
   Study this example situation:
   When we were driving home, we saw some people standing by the
   road. Their car had broken down, so we stopped to help them.
   We helped some people whose car had broken down.
   (= their car had broken down)
   We use whose mostly for people:
   A widow is a woman whose husband is dead.
   (her husband is dead)
   I met someone whose brother I went to school with.
   (I went to school with his/her brother)
   Compare who and whose:
   I met a man who knows you. (he knows you)
   I met a man whose sister knows you. (his sister knows you)
   Do not confuse whose and who’s. The pronunciation is the same, but who’s = who is or who has:
   I have a friend who’s learning Arabic. (who’s = who is)
   I have a friend who’s just started learning Arabic. (who’s = who has)
   I have a friend whose sister is learning Arabic.
   whom
   Whom is possible instead of who when it is the object of the verb (see Unit 93B):
   George is a person whom I admire very much. (I admire him)
   You can also use a preposition + whom (to whom / from whom / with whom etc.):
   It’s important to have friends with whom you can relax. (you can relax with them)
   Whom is a formal word and we do not ofu en use it in spoken English. We usually prefer to say:
   a person I admire a lot or a person who/that I admire a lot
   friends you can relax with or friends who/that you can relax with
   B
   where
   We use where in a relative clause to talk about a place:
   I recently went back to the town where I grew up. (I grew up there)
   The restaurant where we had lunch was near the airport.
   I would like to live in a place where there is plenty of sunshine.
   C
   the day, the time, the reason …
   We say ‘the day we got married’, ‘the year I was born’, ‘the last time they met’ etc. :
   I can’t meet you on Friday. That’s the day I’m going away.
   The last time I saw her, she looked great.
   You can also use that:
   The last time that I saw her, she looked great.
   We say ‘the reason I’m calling you’, ‘the reason she didn’t get the job’ etc.
   The reason I’m calling you is to ask your advice.
   You can also use that:
   The reason that I’m calling you … or The reason why I’m calling you …

Unit 095 Relative clauses 4: extra information clauses (1)
----------------------------------------------------------

   A
   There are two types of relative clause. In these examples, the relative clauses are underlined.
   Compare:
   Type 1
   The woman who lives next door to me
   is a doctor.
   Grace works for a company that makes
   furniture.
   We stayed at the hotel (that) you
   recommended.
   In these examples, the relative clauses tell you
   which person or thing (or what kind of person
   or thing) the speaker means:
   ‘The woman who lives next door to me’
   tells us which woman.
   ‘A company that makes furniture’ tells us
   what kind of company.
   ‘The hotel (that) you recommended’ tells
   us which hotel.
   We do not use commas (,) with these clauses:
   We know a lot of people who live in
   London.
   Type 2
   My brother Ben, who lives in Hong
   Kong, is an architect.
   Anna told me about her new job, which
   she’s enjoying a lot.
   We stayed at the Park Hotel, which a
   friend of ours recommended.
   In these examples, the relative clauses do not
   tell you which person or thing the speaker
   means. We already know which thing or
   person is meant: ‘My brother Ben’, ‘Anna’s new
   job’ and ‘the Park Hotel’.
   The relative clauses in these sentences give us
   extra information about the person or thing.
   We use commas (,) with these clauses:
   My brother Ben, who lives in Hong
   Kong, is an architect.
   Type 1
   You can use that:
   Do you know anyone who/that speaks
   French and Italian?
   Grace works for a company which/that
   makes furniture.
   You can leave out who/which/that when it is
   the object (see Unit 93):
   We stayed at the hotel (that/which)
   you recommended.
   This morning I met somebody (who/that)
   I hadn’t seen for ages.
   We do not often use whom in this type of
   clause (see Unit 94B).
   Type 2
   You cannot use that:
   John, who speaks French and Italian,
   works as a tour guide. (not that speaks)
   Anna told me about her new job, which
   she’s enjoying a lot.
   You cannot leave out who or which:
   We stayed at the Park Hotel, which
   a friend of ours recommended.
   This morning I met Chris, who I hadn’t
   seen for ages.
   You can use whom for people (when it is the
   object):
   This morning I met Chris, whom I hadn’t
   seen for ages.
   We helped some people whose car had
   broken down.
   What’s the name of the place where
   you went on holiday?
   Lisa, whose car had broken down, was
   in a very bad mood.
   Kate has just been to Sweden, where
   her daughter lives.
   In both types of relative clause we use who for people and which for things. But:

   In both types of relative clause you can use whose and where:

   A
   preposition + whom/which
   You can use a preposition + whom (for people) and which (for things).
   So you can say:
   to whom with whom about whom etc.
   of which without which from which etc.
   Mr Lee, to whom I spoke at the meeting, is interested in our proposal.
   Fortunately we had a good map, without which we would have got lost.
   In spoken English we often keep the preposition afuer the verb in the relative clause:
   Katherine told me she works for a company called ‘Latoma’, which I’d never
   heard of before.
   We do not use whom when the preposition is in this position:
   Mr Lee, who I spoke to at the meeting, is interested in our proposal.
   (not Mr Lee, whom I spoke to …)
   For prepositions in relative clauses, see also Unit 93C.
   all of / most of etc. + whom/which
   You can say:
   Helen has three brothers, all of whom are married.
   They asked me a lot of questions, most of which I couldn’t answer.
   In the same way you can say:
   many of whom some of whom neither of whom etc. (for people)
   none of which both of which one of which etc. (for things)
   Martin tried on three jackets, none of which fitted him.
   Two men, neither of whom I had seen before, came into the office.
   They have three cars, two of which they rarely use.
   Sue has a lot of friends, many of whom she was at school with.
   You can also say:

   The house was damaged in a fire, the cause of which was never established.
   We stayed at a beautiful hotel, the name of which I don’t remember now.

   Study this example:
   C
   relative clause
   Joe got the job . This surprised everybody. (2 sentences)
   Joe got the job , which surprised everybody. (1 sentence)
   In this example, which = ‘the fact that Joe got the job’. We use which (not what) in sentences
   like these:
   Sarah couldn’t meet us, which was a shame. (not what was a shame)

Unit 097 -ing and -ed clauses (the woman talking to Tom, the boy injured in the accident)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A
   A clause is a part of a sentence. Some clauses begin with -ing. For example:
   Who is the woman talking to Tom?
   The boy injured in the accident was taken to hospital.
   -ing clause
   TOM
   the woman
   talking to Tom
   -ed clause
   We use -ing clauses to say what somebody (or something) is (or was) doing at a particular time:
   Who is the woman talking to Tom? (the woman is talking to Tom)
   Police investigating the crime are looking for three men. (police are investigating the crime)
   Who were those people waiting outside? (they were waiting)
   I was woken up by a bell ringing. (a bell was ringing)
   You can also use an -ing clause to say what happens all the time, not just at a particular time:
   The road connecting the two villages is very narrow. (the road connects the two villages)
   I have a large room overlooking the garden. (the room overlooks the garden)
   Can you think of the name of a flower beginning with T? (the name begins with T)
   -ed clauses have a passive meaning:
   The boy injured in the accident was taken to hospital.
   (he was injured in the accident)
   George showed me some pictures painted by his father.
   (they were painted by his father)
   The gun used in the robbery has been found.
   (the gun was used in the robbery)
   Injured/painted/used are past participles. Most past participles end in -ed, but many are irregular
   (stolen/made/built etc.):
   The police never found the money stolen in the robbery.
   Most of the goods made in this factory are exported.
   Some clauses begin with -ed (injured, painted etc.). For example:
   B
   You can use there is / there was (etc.) + -ing and -ed clauses:
   There were some children swimming in the river.
   Is there anybody waiting?
   There was a big red car parked outside the house.
   We use left in this way, with the meaning ‘not used, still there’:
   We’ve eaten nearly all the chocolates. There are only a few left .

Unit 098 Adjectives ending in -ing and -ed (boring/bored etc.)
--------------------------------------------------------------

   A
   Many adjectives end in -ing and -ed, for example: boring and bored.
   Study this example situation:
   Jane has been doing the same job for
   a very long time. Every day she does
   exactly the same thing again and again.
   She doesn’t enjoy her job any more and
   would like to do something difg erent.
   Jane’s job is boring.
   Jane is bored with her job.
   Somebody is bored or gets bored if something (or somebody else) is boring.
   If something is boring, you get bored with it.
   So:
   Jane is bored because her job is boring.
   Jane’s job is boring, so Jane is bored. (not Jane is boring)
   If a person is boring, this means that they make other people bored:
   Paul always talks about the same things. He’s really boring.
   Compare adjectives ending in -ing and -ed:
   B
   boring
   interesting
   My job is tiring
   satisfying
   depressing (etc.)
   In these examples, the -ing adjective tells you
   about the job
   I’m bored with my job.
   I’m not interested in my job any more.
   I get very tired doing my job.
   I’m not satisfied with my job.
   My job makes me depressed. (etc.)
   In these examples, the -ed adjective tells you
   how somebody feels (about the job).

Unit 099 Adjectives: a nice new house, you look tired
-----------------------------------------------------

   A
   Sometimes we use two or more adjectives together:
   My brother lives in a nice new house.
   In the kitchen there was a beautiful large round wooden table.
   Adjectives like new/large/round/wooden are fact adjectives. They give us information about
   age, size, colour etc.
   Adjectives like nice/beautiful are opinion adjectives. They tell us what the speaker thinks of
   something or somebody.
   Opinion adjectives usually go before fact adjectives.
   a

   Sometimes we use two or more fact adjectives together. Usually (not always) we put fact adjectives
   in this order:
   1
   how big?
   2
   how old?
   3
   what
   colour?
   4
   where
   from?
   5
   what is it
   made of?

   a tall young man (1 → 2) a large wooden table (1 → 5)
   big blue eyes (1 → 3) an old Russian song (2 → 4)
   a small black plastic bag (1 → 3 → 5) an old white cotton shirt (2 → 3 → 5)
   Adjectives of size and length (big/small/tall/short/long etc.) usually go before adjectives of shape
   and width (round/fat/thin/slim/wide etc.):
   a large round table a tall thin girl a long narrow street
   When there are two or more colour adjectives, we use and:
   a black and white dress a red, white and green flag
   This does not usually happen with other adjectives before a noun:
   a long black dress (not a long and black dress)
   B
   We use adjectives afuer be/get/become/seem:
   Be careful!
   I’m tired and I’m getting hungry.
   As the film went on, it became more and more boring.
   Your friend seems very nice.
   We also use adjectives to say how somebody/something looks, feels, sounds, tastes or smells:
   You look tired. / I feel tired. / She sounds tired.
   The dinner smells good.
   This tea tastes a bit strange.
   But to say how somebody does something you must use an adverb (see Units 100–101):
   Drive carefully! (not Drive careful)
   Suzanne plays the piano very well. (not plays … very good)
   C
   We say ‘the first two days’, ‘the next few weeks’, ‘the last ten minutes’ etc. :

-------------------------------------------------

   A
   You can say:
   Our holiday was too short – the time passed very quickly.
   Two people were seriously injured in the accident.
   Quickly and seriously are adverbs. Many adverbs are adjective + -ly:
   adjective quick serious careful bad heavy terrible
   adverb quickly seriously carefully badly heavily terribly
   For spelling, see Appendix 6.
   Not all words ending in -ly are adverbs. Some adjectives end in -ly too, for example:
   friendly lively elderly lonely lovely
   It was a lovely day.
   Adjective or adverb?
   B
   Compare:
   We use adjectives afuer some verbs, especially be, and also look/feel/sound etc.
   Compare:
   She speaks perfect English.
   adjective + noun
   She speaks English perfectly.
   verb + noun + adverb
   Adjectives (quick/careful etc.) tell us about a
   noun (somebody or something). We use
   adjectives before nouns:
   Sam is a careful driver.
   (not a carefully driver)
   We didn’t go out because of the heavy
   rain.
   Adverbs (quickly/carefully etc.) tell us about
   a verb (how somebody does something or
   how something happens):
   Sam drove carefully along the narrow
   road. (not drove careful)
   We didn’t go out because it was raining
   heavily. (not raining heavy)
   Please be quiet.
   My exam results were really bad.
   Why do you always look so serious?
   I feel happy.
   Please speak quietly.
   I did really badly in the exam.
   Why do you never take me seriously?
   The children were playing happily.
   You can also use adverbs before adjectives and other adverbs. For example:
   reasonably cheap (adverb + adjective)
   terribly sorry (adverb + adjective)
   incredibly quickly (adverb + adverb)
   It’s a reasonably cheap restaurant and the food is extremely good.
   I’m terribly sorry. I didn’t mean to push you.
   Maria learns languages incredibly quickly.
   The exam was surprisingly easy.
   You can also use an adverb before a past participle (injured/organised/written etc.):
   Two people were seriously injured in the accident. (not serious injured)
   The conference was badly organised.

   good and well
   Good is an adjective. The adverb is well:

   enough
   Enough goes afu er adjectives and adverbs:
   I can’t run very far. I’m not fit enough. (not enough fit)
   Let’s go. We’ve waited long enough.
   Enough normally goes before nouns:
   We have enough money. We don’t need any more.
   There weren’t enough chairs. Some of us had to sit on
   the floor.
   We also use enough alone (without a noun or adjective):
   We don’t need more money. We have enough.

Unit 103 enough and too
-----------------------

   too and enough
   Compare too … and not … enough:
   You never stop working. You work too hard.
   (= more than is necessary)
   You’re lazy. You don’t work hard enough.
   (= less than is necessary)
   Compare too much/many and enough:
   There’s too much furniture in this room. There’s not enough space.
   There were too many people and not enough chairs.

   enough/too + for … and to …
   We say enough/too … for somebody/something:
   Does Joe have enough experience for the job?
   This bag isn’t big enough for all my clothes.
   That shirt is too small for you. You need a larger size.
   We say enough/too … to do something. For example:
   Does Joe have enough experience to do the job?
   Let’s get a taxi. It’s too far to walk home from here.
   She’s not old enough to have a driving licence.
   The next example has both for … and to … :
   The bridge is just wide enough for two cars to pass one another.
   C
   too hot to eat etc.
   We say:
   The food was very hot. We couldn’t eat it.
   and
   The food was so hot that we couldn’t eat it.
   but
   The food was too hot to eat. (not to eat it)

   quite, pretty, rather and fairly
   Quite and pretty are similar in meaning (= less than ‘very’, but more than ‘a little’):
   I’m surprised you haven’t heard of her. She’s quite famous. or She’s pretty famous.
   (= less than ‘very famous’, but more than ‘a little famous’)
   Anna lives quite near me, so we see each other pretty often.
   Pretty is an informal word and is used mainly in spoken English.
   Quite goes before a/an:
   We live in quite an old house. (not a quite old house)
   Compare:
   Sarah has quite a good job.
   Sarah has a pretty good job.
   You can also use quite (but not pretty) in the following ways:
   quite a/an + noun (without an adjective):
   I didn’t expect to see them. It was quite a surprise. (= quite a big surprise)
   quite a lot (of …):
   There were quite a lot of guests at the wedding.
   quite + verb, especially like and enjoy:
   I quite like tennis, but it’s not my favourite sport.

Unit 104 quite, pretty, rather and fairly
-----------------------------------------

   Rather is similar to quite and pretty. We often use rather for negative ideas (things we think are not
   good):
   The weather isn’t so good. It’s rather cloudy.
   Paul is rather shy. He doesn’t talk very much.
   Quite is also possible in these examples.
   When we use rather for positive ideas (good/nice etc.), it means ‘unusually’ or ‘surprisingly’:
   These oranges are rather good. Where did you get them?
   B
   Fairly is weaker than quite/rather/pretty. For example, if something is fairly good, it is not very
   good and it could be better:
   My room is fairly big, but I’d prefer a bigger one.
   We see each other fairly often, but not as often as we used to.
   C
   Quite also means ‘completely’. For example:
   ‘Are you sure?’ ‘Yes, quite sure.’ (= completely sure)
   Quite means ‘completely’ with a number of adjectives, especially:
   sure right true clear difgerent incredible amazing
   certain wrong safe obvious unnecessary extraordinary impossible
   She was quite difgerent from what I expected. (= completely difgerent)
   Everything they said was quite true. (= completely true)
   We also use quite (= completely) with some verbs. For example:
   I quite agree with you. (= I completely agree)
   not quite = not completely:
   I don’t quite understand what you mean.
   ‘Are you ready yet?’ ‘Not quite.’ (= not completely)
   Compare the two meanings of quite:
   The story is quite interesting. (= less than ‘very interesting’)
   The story is quite true. (= completely true)

   How shall we travel? Shall we drive or go by train?
   Let’s drive. It’s cheaper.
   Don’t go by train. It’s more expensive.
   Cheaper and more expensive are comparative forms.

   It’s cheaper to drive than go by train.
   Going by train is more expensive than driving.
   The comparative form is -er or more … .
   B
   We use -er for short words (one syllable):
   cheap → cheaper fast → faster
   large → larger thin → thinner
   We also use -er for two-syllable words that
   end in -y (-y → -ier):
   lucky → luckier early → earlier
   easy → easier pretty → prettier
   For spelling, see Appendix 6.
   We use more … for longer words (two
   syllables or more):
   more serious more expensive
   more ofu en more comfortable
   We also use more … for adverbs that end
   in -ly:
   more slowly more seriously
   more easily more quietly
   You’re older than me.

   Can you walk a bit more slowly?
   I’d like to have a more reliable car.

   We use both -er or more … with some two-syllable adjectives, especially:
   clever narrow quiet shallow simple
   It’s too noisy here. Can we go somewhere quieter? or … somewhere more quiet?
   A few adjectives and adverbs have irregular comparative forms:
   good/well → better
   The garden looks better since you tidied it up.
   I know him well – probably better than anybody else knows him.
   bad/badly → worse
   ‘How’s your headache? Better?’ ‘No, it’s worse.’
   He did very badly in the exam – worse than expected.
   far → further (or farther)
   It’s a long walk from here to the park – further than I thought. (or farther than)
   Note that further (but not farther) also means ‘more’ or ‘additional’:
   Let me know if you hear any further news. (= any more news)

   Superlative (the longest / the most enjoyable etc.)
   Look at these examples:
   The superlative form is -est or most … . In general, we use -est for short words and most … for
   longer words.
   long → longest hot → hottest easy → easiest hard → hardest
   but most famous most boring most enjoyable most difgicult
   A few superlative forms are irregular:
   good → best bad → worst far → furthest or farthest
   The rules are the same as those for the comparative – see Unit 105.
   For spelling, see Appendix 6.

Unit 108 Superlative (the longest, the most enjoyable etc.)
-----------------------------------------------------------

   What is the longest river in the world?
   What was the most enjoyable holiday you’ve ever had?
   Longest and most enjoyable are superlative forms.
   We normally use the (or my/your etc.) with a superlative:
   Yesterday was the hottest day of the year.
   The Louvre in Paris is one of the most famous museums in the world.
   She is really nice – one of the nicest people I know.
   What’s the best movie you’ve ever seen, and what’s the worst?
   How old is your youngest child?
   Compare the superlative and the comparative:
   This hotel is the cheapest in town. (superlative)
   It’s cheaper than all the others in town. (comparative)
   He’s the most patient person I’ve ever met.
   He’s much more patient than I am.
   B
   oldest and eldest
   The superlative of old is oldest:
   That church is the oldest building in the town. (not the eldest)
   We use eldest only when we talk about people in a family (you can also use oldest):
   Their eldest son is 13 years old. (or Their oldest son)
   Are you the eldest in your family? (or the oldest)
   C
   After superlatives we normally use in with places:
   What’s the longest river in the world? (not of the world)
   We had a nice room. It was one of the best in the hotel. (not of the hotel)
   We also use in for organisations and groups of people (a class / a company etc.):
   Who is the youngest student in the class? (not of the class)
   For a period of time (day, year etc.), we normally use of:
   Yesterday was the hottest day of the year.
   What was the happiest day of your life?
   D
   We often use the present perfect (I have done) afuer a superlative (see also Unit 8A):
   What’s the most important decision you’ve ever made?
   That was the best holiday I’ve had for a long time.

   Word order 2: adverbs with the verb
   Some adverbs (for example, always, also, probably) go with the verb in the middle of a sentence:
   Emily always drives to work.
   We were feeling very tired and we were also hungry.
   The meeting will probably be cancelled.

Unit 110 Word order 2: adverbs with the verb
--------------------------------------------

   If the verb is one word (drives/cooked etc.), the adverb goes before the verb:
   Emily
   I
   adverb
   always
   almost
   verb
   drives
   fell
   to work.
   as I was going down the stairs.
   I cleaned the house and also cooked the dinner. (not cooked also)
   Laura hardly ever watches television and rarely reads newspapers.
   ‘Shall I give you my address?’ ‘No, I already have it.’
   Note that these adverbs (always/usually/also etc.) go before have to … :
   Joe never phones me. I always have to phone him. (not I have always to phone)
   But adverbs go afuer am/is/are/was/were:
   We were feeling very tired and we were also hungry. (not also were)
   You’re always late. You’re never on time.
   The trafgic isn’t usually as bad as it was this morning.
   B
   If the verb is two or more words (for example, can remember / will be cancelled), the adverb
   usually goes afuer the first verb (can/doesn’t/will etc.):
   I
   Clare
   The meeting
   verb 1
   can
   doesn’t
   Are you
   will
   adverb
   never

   away next week?
   cancelled.
   You’ve always been very kind to me.
   Jack can’t cook. He can’t even boil an egg.
   Do you still work for the same company?
   The house was only built a year ago and it’s already falling down.
   Note that probably goes before a negative (isn’t/won’t etc.). So we say:
   I probably won’t see you. or
   I’ll probably not see you. (but not I won’t probably)
   C
   We also use all and both with the verb in the middle of a sentence:
   We all felt ill afuer the meal. (not felt all ill)
   My parents are both teachers.
   Sarah and Jane have both applied for the job.
   My friends are all going out tonight.
   D
   Sometimes we use is/will/did etc. instead of repeating part of a sentence (see Unit 51):
   Tom says he isn’t clever, but I think he is. (= he is clever)
   When we do this, we put always/never etc. before the verb:
   He always says he won’t be late, but he always is. (= he is always late)
   I’ve never done it and I never will. (= I will never do it)

   still any more yet already
   We use still to say that a situation or action is continuing. It hasn’t changed or stopped:
   It’s ten o’clock and Joe is still in bed.
   When I went to bed, Chris was still working.
   Do you still want to go away or have you changed your mind?
   Still also means ‘in spite of this’. For example:
   He has everything he needs, but he’s still unhappy.
   Still usually goes in the middle of the sentence with the verb. See Unit 110.

Unit 111 still any more yet already
-----------------------------------

   We use not … any more or not … any longer to say that a situation has changed.
   Any more and any longer go at the end of a sentence:
   Lucy doesn’t work here any more. She left last month. or
   Lucy doesn’t work here any longer.
   We used to be good friends, but we aren’t any more. or … we aren’t any longer.
   You can write any more (2 words) or anymore (1 word).
   You can also use no longer. No longer goes in the middle of the sentence:
   Lucy no longer works here.
   We do not normally use no more in this way:
   We are no longer friends. (not we are no more friends)
   Compare still and not … any more:
   Sally still works here, but Lucy doesn’t work here any more.
   B
   We use already to say that something happened sooner than expected.
   ‘What time is Sue leaving?’ ‘She has already left.’ (= sooner than you expected)
   Shall I tell Joe what happened or does he already know?
   I’ve just had lunch and I’m already hungry.
   Already usually goes in the middle of a sentence (see Unit 110) or at the end:
   She’s already left. or She’s left already.
   D
   We use yet mainly in negative sentences (He isn’t here yet) and questions (Is he here yet?).
   Yet (= until now) shows that the speaker expects something to happen.
   Yet usually goes at the end of a sentence:
   It’s 10 o’clock and Joe isn’t here yet.
   Have you decided what to do yet?
   ‘Where are you going on holiday?’ ‘We don’t know yet.’
   We often use yet with the present perfect (‘Have you decided … yet?’). See Unit 7C.
   Compare yet and still:
   Mike lost his job six months ago and is still unemployed.
   Mike lost his job six months ago and hasn’t found another job yet.
   Is it still raining?
   Has it stopped raining yet?
   Still is also possible in negative sentences (before the negative):
   She said she would be here an hour ago and she still hasn’t come.
   This is similar to ‘she hasn’t come yet’. But still … not shows a stronger feeling of surprise or
   impatience. Compare:
   I sent him an invitation last week. He hasn’t replied yet. (but I expect he will reply soon)
   I sent him an invitation weeks ago and he still hasn’t replied. (he should have replied
   before now)

   Tina loves watching TV.
   She has a television in every room of the house,
   even the bathroom.
   We use even to say that something is unusual
   or surprising. It is not usual to have a television
   in the bathroom.
   You can use even with the verb in the middle of a sentence (see Unit 110):
   Laura has travelled all over the world. She’s even been to the Antarctic.
   They are very rich. They even have their own private jet.
   You can use even with a negative (not even, can’t even, don’t even etc.):
   I can’t cook. I can’t even boil an egg. (and boiling an egg is very easy)
   They weren’t very friendly to us. They didn’t even say hello.
   Jessica is very fit. She’s been running quite fast and she’s not even out of breath.
   B
   You can use even + comparative (cheaper / more expensive etc.):
   I got up very early, but Jack got up even earlier.

.. _P234:

   as … as ➜ Unit 107 as (= at the same time as / because) ➜ Unit 116 as if ➜ Unit 118
   A
   like and as
   Like = similar to, the same as:
   What a beautiful house! It’s like a palace. (not as a palace)
   Be careful! The floor has been polished. It’s like walking on ice. (not as walking)
   It’s raining again. I hate weather like this. (not as this)
   ‘What’s that noise?’ ‘It sounds like a baby crying.’ (not as a baby crying)
   In these examples, like is a preposition. So it is followed by a noun (like a palace), a pronoun
   (like this) or -ing (like walking).
   Sometimes like = for example. You can also use such as:
   I enjoy water sports, like surfing, scuba diving and water-skiing. or
   I enjoy water sports, such as surfing …

Unit 117 like and as
--------------------

   As = in the same way as, in the same condition as.
   We use as with subject (S) + verb (V):
   I didn’t move anything. I left everything as it was.
   You should have done it as I showed you.
   We also use like in this way (+ subject + verb):
   I left everything like it was.
   Compare as and like. You can say:
   You should have done it as I showed you. or … like I showed you.
   but You should have done it like this. (not as this)
   We say as usual / as always:
   You’re late as usual.
   As always, Nick was the first to complain.
   We say the same as … :
   Your phone is the same as mine. (not the same like)
   B
   Sometimes as (+ subject + verb) has other meanings. For example, afuer do:
   You can do as you like. (= do what you like)
   They did as they promised. (= They did what they promised.)
   We also say as you know / as I said / as she expected / as I thought etc. :
   As you know, it’s Emma’s birthday next week. (= you know this already)
   Andy failed his driving test, as he expected. (= he expected this before)
   Like is not usual in these expressions, except with say (like I said):
   As I said yesterday, I’m sure we can solve the problem. or Like I said yesterday …
   C
   As can also be a preposition (as + noun), but the meaning is difgerent from like.
   Compare:
   D
   As a taxi driver, I spend most of
   my working life in a car.
   (I am a taxi driver, it’s my job.)
   Everyone in the family wants me to drive
   them to places. I’m like a taxi driver.
   (I’m not a taxi driver, but I’m like one.)
   As (preposition) = in the position of, in the form of etc. :
   Many years ago I worked as a photographer. (I was a photographer)
   Many words, for example ‘work’ and ‘rain’, can be used as verbs or nouns.
   London is fine as a place to visit, but I wouldn’t like to live there.
   The news of the tragedy came as a great shock.

   it sounds like … or it sounds as if …
   Sarah is very late. It looks like she isn’t coming.
   or It looks as if she isn’t coming.

   Afu er the interruption, the speaker went on talking as if nothing had happened.
   When I told them my plan, they looked at me as though I was mad.
   C
   Afu er as if, we sometimes use the past when we are talking about the present.
   For example:
   I don’t like him. He talks as if he knew everything.
   The meaning is not past. We use the past (as if he knew) because the idea is not real: he does not
   know everything. We use the past in the same way with if and wish (see Unit 39).
   We do not normally use like in this way.
   Some more examples:
   She’s always asking me to do things for her – as if I didn’t have enough to do already.
   (I have enough to do already)
   Joe’s only 40. Why do you talk about him as if he was an old man? (he isn’t an old man)
   When you use the past in this way, you can use were instead of was:
   Why do you talk about him as if he were an old man?
   They treat me as if I were their own son. or … as if I was their own son.
   (I’m not their son)

   Phrasal verbs 2–9 ➜ Units 138–145 American English ➜ Appendix 7
   A
   Phrasal verbs 1 Introduction
   We often use verbs with:
   in
   out
   on
   off
   up
   down
   away
   back
   by
   through
   about
   along
   over
   forward
   round or around
   So you can say look out / get on / take off / run away etc. These are phrasal verbs.
   We often use on/off/out etc. with verbs of movement. For example:
   get on
   drive off
   come back
   turn round
   The bus was full. We couldn’t get on.
   A woman got into the car and drove off.
   Sarah is leaving tomorrow and coming back on Saturday.
   When I touched him on the shoulder, he turned round.

Unit 137 Phrasal verbs 1 Introduction
-------------------------------------

   Ofuen the second word (on/off/out etc.) gives a special meaning to the verb. For example:
   break down
   find out
   take off
   give up
   get on
   get by
   Sorry I’m late. The car broke down. (= the engine stopped working)
   I never found out who sent me the flowers. (= I never discovered)
   It was my first flight. I was nervous as the plane took off. (= went into the air)
   I tried many times to contact her. In the end I gave up. (= stopped trying)
   How was the exam? How did you get on? (= How did you do?)
   My French isn’t good, but it’s enough to get by. (= enough to manage)
   For more phrasal verbs, see Units 138–145.
   B
   Sometimes a phrasal verb is followed by a preposition. For example:
   phrasal verb
   look up
   run away
   keep up
   look forward
   preposition
   at
   from
   with
   to
   We looked up at the plane as it flew above us.
   Why did you run away from me?
   You’re walking too fast. I can’t keep up with you.
   Are you looking forward to your trip?
   C
   Sometimes a phrasal verb has an object. For example:
   I turned on the light. (the light is the object)
   Usually there are two possible positions for the object. You can say:
   I turned on the light. or I turned the light on.
   object object
   But if the object is a pronoun (it/them/me/him etc.), only one position is possible:
   I turned it on. (not I turned on it)
   In the same way, you can say:
   take off my shoes.
   I’m going to
   take my shoes off.
   but These shoes are uncomfortable. I’m going to take them off. (not take off them)
   wake up the baby.
   Don’t
   wake the baby up.
   but The baby is asleep. Don’t wake her up. (not wake up her)
   throw away this box.
   Don’t
   throw this box away.
   but I want to keep this box, so don’t throw it away. (not throw away it)

Appendix 1 Regular and irregular verbs
--------------------------------------


1.1 Regular verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If a verb is regular, the past simple and past participle end in -ed. For example:
   infinitive clean finish use paint stop carry
   past simple
   ⎫
   ⎬
   ⎭ past participle
   cleaned finished used painted stopped carried
   For spelling rules, see Appendix 6.
   For the past simple (I cleaned / they finished / she carried etc.), see Unit 5.
   We use the past participle to make the perfect tenses and all the passive forms.
   Perfect tenses (have/has/had cleaned):
   I have cleaned the windows. (present perfect – see Units 7–8)
   They were still working. They hadn’t finished. (past perfect – see Unit 15)
   Passive (is cleaned / was cleaned etc.):
   He was carried out of the room. (past simple passive)
   This gate has just been painted. (present perfect passive)

1.2 Irregular verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   When the past simple and past participle do not end in -ed (for example, I saw / I have seen), the verb
   is irregular.
   With some irregular verbs, all three forms (infinitive, past simple and past participle) are the same.
   For example, hit:
   Don’t hit me. (infinitive)
   Somebody hit me as I came into the room. (past simple)
   I’ve never hit anybody in my life. (past participle – present perfect)
   George was hit on the head by a stone. (past participle – passive)
   With other irregular verbs, the past simple is the same as the past participle (but difgerent from the
   infinitive). For example, tell → told:
   Can you tell me what to do? (infinitive)
   She told me to come back the next day. (past simple)
   Have you told anybody about your new job? (past participle – present perfect)
   I was told to come back the next day. (past participle – passive)
   With other irregular verbs, all three forms are difgerent. For example, wake → woke/woken:
   I’ll wake you up. (infinitive)
   I woke up in the middle of the night. (past simple)
   The baby has woken up. (past participle – present perfect)
   I was woken up by a loud noise. (past participle – passive)

1.3 The following verbs can be regular or irregular:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   burn → burned or burnt
   dream → dreamed or dreamt [dremt]*
   lean → leaned or leant [lent]*
   learn → learned or learnt
   smell → smelled or smelt
   spell → spelled or spelt
   spill → spilled or spilt
   spoil → spoiled or spoilt
   * pronunciation
   see Units 42–44
   ⎫
   ⎬
   ⎭

.. _P293:

   So you can say:
   I leant out of the window. or I leaned out of the window.
   The dinner has been spoiled. or The dinner has been spoilt.
   In British English the irregular form (burnt/learnt etc.) is more usual. 
   For American English, see Appendix 7.

Appendix 5 Short forms (I’m / you’ve / didn’t etc.)
---------------------------------------------------


5.1 In spoken English we usually say I’m / you’ve / didn’t etc. (short forms or contractions) rather
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   than I am / you have / did not etc. We also use these short forms in informal writing (for
   example, a letter or message to a friend).
   When we write short forms, we use an apostrophe (’) for the missing letter(s):
   I’m = I am you’ve = you have didn’t = did not

5.2 List of short forms:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   ’m = am
   ’s = is or has
   ’re = are
   ’ve = have
   ’ll = will
   ’d = would or had
   I’m
   I’ve
   I’ll
   I’d
   he’s
   he’ll
   he’d
   she’s
   she’ll
   she’d
   it’s
   you’re
   you’ve
   you’ll
   you’d
   we’re
   we’ve
   we’ll
   we’d
   they’re
   they’ve
   they’ll
   they’d
   ’s can be is or has:
   She’s ill. (= She is ill.)
   She’s gone away. (= She has gone)
   but let’s = let us:
   Let’s go now. (= Let us go)
   ’d can be would or had:
   I’d see a doctor if I were you. (= I would see)
   I’d never seen her before. (= I had never seen)
   We use some of these short forms (especially ’s) afuer question words (who/what etc.) and afuer
   that/there/here:
   who’s what’s where’s how’s that’s there’s here’s who’ll there’ll who’d
   Who’s that woman over there? (= who is)
   What’s happened? (= what has)
   Do you think there’ll be many people at the party? (= there will)
   We also use short forms (especially ’s) afuer a noun:
   Katherine’s going out tonight. (= Katherine is)
   My best friend’s just got married. (= My best friend has)
   You cannot use ’m / ’s / ’re / ’ve / ’ll / ’d at the end of a sentence (because the verb is stressed in this
   position):
   ‘Are you tired?’ ‘Yes, I am.’ (not Yes, I’m.)
   Do you know where she is? (not Do you know where she’s?)

5.3 Negative short forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   isn’t
   aren’t
   wasn’t
   weren’t
   (= is not)
   (= are not)
   (= was not)

   don’t
   doesn’t
   didn’t
   (= do not)
   (= does not)
   (= did not)
   haven’t
   hasn’t
   hadn’t

   quicker
   quickest
   quickly
   matches
   washes

   brighter
   brightest
   brightly
   When we use these endings, there are sometimes changes in spelling. These changes are listed below.

6.2 Nouns and verbs + -s/-es
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The ending is -es when the word ends in -s/-ss/-sh/-ch/-x:
   bus/buses miss/misses wash/washes
   match/matches search/searches box/boxes
   Note also:
   potato/potatoes tomato/tomatoes
   do/does go/goes

6.3 Words ending in -y (baby, carry, easy etc.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If a word ends in a consonant* + y (-by/-ry/-sy/-vy etc.)
   y changes to ie before the ending -s:
   baby/babies story/stories country/countries secretary/secretaries
   hurry/hurries study/studies apply/applies try/tries
   y changes to i before the ending -ed:
   hurry/hurried study/studied apply/applied try/tried
   y changes to i before the endings -er and -est:
   easy/easier/easiest heavy/heavier/heaviest lucky/luckier/luckiest
   y changes to i before the ending -ly:

   If a verb ends in -ie, ie changes to y before the ending -ing:
   die/dying lie/lying tie/tying
   * a e i o u are vowel letters.
   The other letters (b c d f g etc.) are consonant letters.

.. _P299:



6.5 Words ending in -e (hope, dance, wide etc.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   Verbs
   If a verb ends in -e, we leave out e before the ending -ing:
   hope/hoping smile/smiling dance/dancing confuse/confusing
   Exceptions are be/being and verbs ending in -ee:
   see/seeing agree/agreeing
   If a verb ends in -e, we add -d for the past (of regular verbs):
   hope/hoped smile/smiled dance/danced confuse/confused
   Adjectives and adverbs
   If an adjective ends in -e, we add -r and -st for the comparative and superlative:

   If an adjective ends in -e, we keep e before -ly in the adverb:
   polite/politely extreme/extremely absolute/absolutely
   If an adjective ends in -le (simple, terrible etc.), the adverb ending is -ply, -bly etc. :
   simple/simply terrible/terribly reasonable/reasonably

6.6 Doubling consonants (stop/stopping/stopped, wet/wetter/wettest etc.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Sometimes a word ends in vowel + consonant. For example:
   stop plan rub big wet thin prefer regret
   Before the endings -ing/-ed/-er/-est, we double the consonant at the end. So p → pp, n → nn etc.
   For example:
   stop
   plan
   rub
   big
   wet
   thin
   p → pp
   n → nn
   b → bb
   g → gg
   t → tt
   n → nn
   stopping
   planning
   rubbing
   bigger
   wetter
   thinner
   stopped
   planned
   rubbed
   biggest
   wettest
   thinnest
   If the word has more than one syllable (prefer, begin etc.), we double the consonant at the end only if
   the final syllable is stressed:
   preFER / preferring / preferred perMIT / permitting / permitted
   reGRET / regretting / regretted beGIN / beginning
   If the final syllable is not stressed, we do not double the final consonant:
   VISit / visiting / visited deVELop / developing / developed
   HAPpen / happening / happened reMEMber / remembering / remembered
   In British English, verbs ending in -l have -ll- before -ing and -ed whether the final syllable is stressed
   or not:
   travel / travelling / travelled cancel / cancelling / cancelled
   For American spelling, see Appendix 7.
   Note that
   we do not double the final consonant if the word ends in two consonants (-rt, -lp, -ng etc.):
   start / starting / started help / helping / helped long / longer / longest
   we do not double the final consonant if there are two vowel letters before it (-oil, -eed etc.):
   boil / boiling / boiled need / needing / needed explain / explaining / explained
   cheap / cheaper / cheapest loud / louder / loudest quiet / quieter / quietest
   we do not double y or w at the end of words. (At the end of words y and w are not consonants.)
   stay / staying / stayed grow / growing new / newer / newest

Study guide
-----------

   This guide is to help you decide which units you need to study. The sentences in the guide are grouped together
   (Present and past, Articles and nouns etc.) in the same way as the units in the Contents (pages iii–vi).
   Each sentence can be completed using one or more of the alternatives (A, B, C etc.). There are between two and
   five alternatives each time. IN SOME SENTENCES MORE THAN ONE ALTERNATIVE IS POSSIBLE.

   If you don’t know or if you are not sure which alternatives are correct, then you probably need to study the
   unit(s) in the list on the right. You will also find the correct sentence in this unit. (If two or three units are listed,
   you will find the correct sentence in the first one.)

   There is a key to this study guide on page 372.
