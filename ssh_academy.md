What is Cloud Access Management?
================================

**_Cloud access management enables organizations to bridge the gap between identity access management and cloud services. Within the world of containerized microservices, cloud access management brings security to container-driven environments._**

When organizations use cloud-based services, it’s necessary to implement a comprehensive and consistent approach to security, to safeguard your data. With insider threats on the rise, today’s companies are often more at risk of a data breach from a privileged user than from an outside cyberattack. This means that optimizing security requires the effective management of user permissions.

Cloud access management is a critical component of IT security in today’s cybersecurity environment. In the most basic sense, cloud access management is the practice of monitoring, changing, and detecting threats based on user identity.

Identity threats take on many forms, and so does cloud access management. For the wide range of modern businesses that run on the cloud, successful and reliable cloud access management also requires managing access to containers. To understand how cloud access management works, it’s important to also understand the basics of identity access management in a containerized environment

Cloud Access Governance vs. Cloud Access Management
---------------------------------------------------

In cloud-based access management, IT administrators are responsible for ensuring that data is accessed by the right person, at the right time in the cloud environment. Cloud access management is a broad area of IT security that can include password and key management, just-in-time access control, and user authentication.

Cloud access governance is a subset of cloud access management. In cloud access governance, organizations are tasked with managing security risks within cloud access management. A wide range of security systems can be used for cloud access governance, allowing IT admins to control the privileges and access credentials of users in a cloud environment.

Cloud access governance establishes the set of policies, often dictated by industry security standards, that are used to implement cloud access management. While every business will need to determine its unique cloud governance solution for audit compliance, the core concepts of cloud access management are relevant to any cloud governance strategy.

What is Cloud Identity and Access Management?
---------------------------------------------

Cloud [identity and access management (IAM)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam) brings security to the cloud, by establishing the right privilege levels for users, and by managing user access credentials. Privileged access is a requirement for a secure modern enterprise, and cloud-based IAM requires monitoring. With services in the cloud, organizations still need to manage access credentials securely, with authentication measures in place that can verify the identity of privileged users.

As businesses expand across workstations and time zones, cloud identity and access management are increasingly necessary. The basic tenets of cloud-based IAM solutions are identity management (verifying the identity of a user) and access management (making sure the right users are granted access to the right resources, at the right time). Bringing these concepts together requires a centralized solution that can monitor cloud-based services across multiple clouds, including containerized environments.

With an effective approach to cloud identity and access management, businesses can move to the cloud, while minimizing the risk of identity-based cyberattacks.

What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Cloud Over On-Premises?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The use of cloud environments are increasingly common in today’s IT landscape — [and for good reason](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/computing/advantages-and-disadvantages). Cloud computing facilitates access from anywhere, enabling businesses to expand across distance and workstations. Compared to on-premises servers, cloud computing offers a range of financial and practical benefits, including:

*   **Lower upfront costs.** On-premises computing involves physical IT infrastructure that can be costly to set up, and requires constant security monitoring and continuous maintenance. Cloud computing brings a lightweight approach to infrastructure, without the need for equipment.

*   **A scalable solution.** Because cloud computing does not require in-house infrastructure, you can expand your business as quickly as you need to — and adjust the parameters of your services without buying or getting rid of hardware.

*   **Streamlined user experience.** Employees and customers often find it easier to use cloud-based services, which allow for a streamlined login process, and authentication from anywhere.

*   **Audit compliance.** Because cloud solutions are flexible, systems can be easily updated to accommodate new audit requirements. [Complying with audits is crucial](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance) in many industries, and security audit requirements are constantly changing with new technology.

In addition to the benefits of cloud computing, there are also some challenges to keep in mind when moving to the cloud. It’s important to understand that the total cost of ownership (TCO) for cloud-based solutions can be equal to or more than on-premises systems, even though the upfront costs are generally lower. While increased productivity and efficiency can help to offset these costs, it’s important for cloud administrators to consider the maintenance costs of cloud computing.

Cloud Access Management Options: Build or Buy?
-----------------------------------------------

Building a cloud computing infrastructure may sound difficult — but it can be a cost-efficient and autonomous alternative to buying cloud SaaS. Despite this, a notable benefit of buying cloud services from cloud providers is that businesses can start immediately, streamlining the systems setup and user experience. So the question is, should you build or buy your cloud infrastructure?

While pre-made cloud services are fast and easy to implement, they aren’t customized to the specific needs of each business. It’s likely that a prepackaged cloud storage provider will include more services than is absolutely necessary for your business, which can increase overhead costs. Additionally, many businesses have privacy concerns regarding hosting data with a cloud provider. By building a cloud infrastructure, any business can create a custom cloud-based system with exactly the services necessary, and complete control over private data.

Building Containerized Microservices
------------------------------------

Today’s businesses often find that containerized microservices are a great way to build autonomous cloud services using only the dependencies necessary for each application.

*   **What are containers?** Containers use application code to create a package of services, based in the cloud. Each container uses only the dependencies necessary for an application to run, which helps to streamline the implementation, management, and usability of applications.
*   **What are the benefits of containers?** Containers are lightweight, easy to use, and easy to secure. During the development stage, containers can run on dependencies based on the OS kernel, and data can be replicated across multiple containers. Because containers are custom cloud-based services, they have security advantages due to increased privacy and application isolation.

**What are containers used for?** Containers are abstracted. When a container is used instead of a cloud computer, each application uses an abstraction of the services within an initial cloud environment. With this approach, businesses can deploy new applications quickly, keep applications safe from anywhere, and minimize costs by eliminating unnecessary services.

The Future is Serverless
------------------------

Aside from significantly increased security, there are plenty of other [major benefits of passwordless and keyless authentication](https://www.ssh.com/just-in-time-passwordless-privileged-access-management?hsLang=en). These include:

*   **Increased usability.** When static credentials are out of the picture, users can access the right information without jumping through hoops. Traditional password-based authentication has required users to create complex passwords, then store them somewhere “safe” and remember them when it comes time to log in. Additionally, plenty of enterprises require users to manually rotate passwords or keys periodically. Passwordless and keyless authentication removes the burden of management, so users can access the right data without obstacles.

*   **Cost-effective operations:** Password and key management is an expensive endeavor for IT teams. To manage passwords for a large organization, an entire team of admins may be necessary to answer customer questions, help reset passwords, and rotate and retire passwords. This process can be time-consuming and inefficient compared to a passwordless approach. Implementing passwordless authentication allows your enterprise to reduce IT management costs by avoiding the time-consuming process of password management. The same applies to key management with one fundamental difference — keys are notoriously difficult to find. In fact, most Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions are not equipped to handle keys properly, so many keys are going undetected and unmanaged.
*   **Better security:** Passwordless and keyless authentication have the potential to be a much more secure option than permanent credential-based access control. Passwords and keys have the potential to fall into the wrong hands — no matter how often they are rotated. When passwordless and keyless authentication is adopted, there is little doubt that the right user is accessing the right information.

Is a Purely Cloud-based IT Environment Possible?
------------------------------------------------

The answer is yes. Plenty of businesses buy IT environments as a service or build them virtually in-house. However, most companies end up using a mix of in-house or outsourced on-premises data centers, in-house virtual servers and purchased cloud services. This is especially true for established big businesses that have a lot of legacy applications to support that cannot be migrated to the cloud that easily.

These hybrid environments pose an access management challenge to companies, since they end up using a number of different vendor tools to access targets that are hosted using a variety of different technologies. This leads to inconsistent user experience, operational bottlenecks, cumbersome credentials management and auditing & tracking that is not uniform.

PrivX for Scalable & Centralized Cloud Access Management
--------------------------------------------------------

Passwordless and keyless authentication solutions allow you to verify access at each step in the process. Combining passwordless and keyless authentication with the Zero Trust approach means access can become faster and easier for users, [while improving security](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/credential-risk-mitigation/). For Zero Trust enterprises, passwordless and keyless access is a great way to save time and money — and maintain a strong approach to privileged access management.

Passwordless and keyless access management are consistently more secure than traditional solutions. Because passwordless and keyless authentication doesn’t rely on static access credentials, you’re eliminating the threat of unmanaged or stolen credentials from a password vault. Additionally, you can avoid the resources necessary to repeatedly rotate and manage all your enterprise passwords and keys.

As technology progresses, making certain changes just makes sense — and migrating to passwordless and keyless authentication is one of those changes.

* [Smart Devices (Internet of Things, or IoT)](#smart-devices)

Thin Clients, Smarts, and Data in the Cloud
-------------------------------------------

Cloud applications are usually written with fairly thin clients and most of the heavy computation happening in the cloud. Data is usually stored in the cloud.

The benefits of this approach include writing most of the application code only once, even though multiple operating systems and many different mobile devices need to be supported. Power consumption on handheld devices is also greatly reduced when the computation is moved to the cloud.

Most cloud-based applications require an active Internet connection to function. This makes them dependent on the continued operation of networks.

Web Browser as an Enabling Technology
-------------------------------------

Modern web browsers have become the universal client technology. Most applications no longer require the installation of a separate client.

Most new cloud-based applications are written using HTML5 and Javascript to implement the user interface. Frameworks like React can be used to implement the whole client application in Javascript.

Applications typically communicate with servers on the cloud using [REST APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), that is, using JSON-formatted data objects sent over HTTP. The applications increasingly rely on TLS and PKI for security and [OAUTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) or user-specific authentication tokens for authentication.

Mobile Applications
-------------------

Mobile applications can be implemented either using a mobile browser or as native applications that have to be installed.

Most mobile devices today are based either on Google's Android operating system or Apple's IOS. Thus, many companies prepare versions of their applications for both of these platforms. The same platforms also cover tablets.

Smart Devices (Internet of Things, or IoT)
------------------------------------------

Smart devices also usually rely heavily on the cloud. Often, they just act as sensors that send information to the cloud, the actual computation being performed in the cloud, and results are then returned to the device for display and control adjustment.

* [NIST Cloud Computing Definition](#nist-cloud-computing-definition)

Cloud Security Alliance Definition of Cloud Computing
-----------------------------------------------------

[Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)](https://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/) defines cloud computing as:

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services).

NIST Cloud Computing Definition
-------------------------------

NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology) has published a dedicated document defining cloud computing as [NIST Special Publication 800-145](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf).

NIST defines cloud computing as:

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.

The NIST definition includes the following essential characteristics:

*   On-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
    
*   Broad network access. Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
    
*   Resource pooling. The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.
    
*   Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
    
*   Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability1 at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.
    

Characteristics of cloud computing services
-------------------------------------------

Cloud services, particularly[public cloud services](https://www.ssh.com/cloud/computing/models)share certain characteristics that are expected from all cloud service providers.

### Available On-Demand

Cloud services are expected to be available on-demand. A customer can typically create a new instance or a new customer relationship online at any time using a credit card, without having to wait for delivery and without having to go through a complicated purchasing process.

### Accessible from a Network

Cloud services are generally accessible fromt the public Internet. Private cloud services would generally be accessible from anywhere within the enterprise. Additional security restrictions, such as a virtual firewall, may be configured to limit what services may be accessed from where. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection may also be offered between on-premise resources and an isolated set of servers in a public cloud ("virtual private cloud").

### Resource Pooling ("Overbooking")

Much of the[cost advantage](https://www.ssh.com/cloud/computing/advantages-and-disadvantages)of cloud services comes from resource pooling and overbooking. Statistically, most applications and services don't operate at their peak capacity most of the time, and different applications peak at different times. Cloud services utilize this to overbook capacity so that most of the time all services get enough capacity. Some services may be configured to have guaranteed service, while others may run opportunistically only when there is spare capacity. In most cases, customers are willing to accept that services may run somewhat slower at times.

### Elastic Scalability

A key characteristic and benefit of cloud computing is elastic scalability. For example, if a web application gets an unusual amount of traffic, more servers may be created to provide that service. Thus, the application can gracefully and automatically scale with demand.

Scalability also allows cost-effectively running workloads that need a very high number of servers but only for short periods of time or occasionally. Many customers have such workloads, and especially if they can utilize the spare capacity, they can be run very cost-effectively.

### Measured Service

Cloud services generally charge users per hour of resource usage, or based on the number of certain kinds of transactions that have occurred, amount of storage in use, and the amount of data transferred over a network. All usage is measured.

The measurements are also used by the cloud service provider to determine how to best allocate its physical computing resources to all of its customers to best meet its SLA (Service Level Agreement) commitments and minimize the cost of providing the service (thus maximizing its margins and competitiveness).

### Service Level Agreements

Many cloud services provide service level agreements that guarantee a certain level of availability, performance, or capacity. Lowest-cost service tiers usually come without any guarantees, while higher-paying tiers are specified to offer certain guarantees. Large enterprises are generally able to negotiate custom service guarantees.

### Multitenancy

A key distinguishing characteristic of public cloud services is multitenancy. The infrastructure serves multiple customers, and in[SaaS](https://www.ssh.com/cloud/saas/), even the same virtual machine may serve multiple customers. Sometimes[compliance](https://www.ssh.com/compliance/)requirements mandate that a service must run on a dedicated infrastructure that is not shared. Such an arrangement eliminates certain security risks, such as escaping virtual machines and spreading an attack to other customers running on the same infrastructure. Many cloud services offer dedicated servers to counter this. Some service providers will even create a dedicated cloud infrastructure, complete with dedicated and isolated provisioning tools, for larger customers on demand.


/. 005 [Cloud Computing Models](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/computing-models)
=========================================================

Cloud Computing Models (IaaS, PaaS & SaaS)
==========================================

[Cloud computing](/academy/cloud-computing-definition) refers to offering computing services from servers in a network. Typically cloud services are available on demand, can be accessed over a network, share resources between multiple applications and tenants, scale elastically based on dynamic computing needs, and provide measured service.

Cloud computing and services are typically based on the ownership of the infrastructure (and to whom services are offered) and based on the general architecture visible to users (e.g., are generic computing instances provided, are they providing a platform for applications, or are they providing complete application software solutions as a service).

* [Cloud vs. Virtualization](#cloud-vs.-virtualization)


Based on Infrastructure Ownership
---------------------------------

### Public Cloud

Cloud most often means a public cloud. Most well-known and popular cloud services are public clouds. A public cloud basically offers services to any number of customers (the general public) and is accessible from the public information (subject to security restrictions - see cloud security.

Public clouds are offered by a plethora of [cloud service providers](/academy/cloud/cloud-service-providers).

### Private Cloud

A private cloud uses the infrastructure to provide services only to a single customer. A private cloud is close related to [virtualization](/cloud/virtualization/)but provides many of the benefits of public clouds, such as elastic scaling and resource sharing.

Many large enterprises run sizable private clouds using various technologies.

### Virtual Private Cloud

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is an isolated set of servers within a public cloud. Typically, the VPC would have a VPN connection to the enterprise network, and might logically seem to be part of the internal enterprise network.

### Community Cloud

A community cloud extends the private cloud to incorporate multiple customers within a defined community (e.g., within an industry, such as health care or a cloud service serving diverse agencies and departments of the same government). This model is often preferred when the data is regulated and sensitive, and a degree of trust is required between the customers to accept the risks of cloud computing.

### Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid cloud has characteristics of both a public cloud and a private cloud. For example, some resources could be offered to the public, while some are reserved for internal use.

Based on Service Model, Architecture, and Flexibility
-----------------------------------------------------

Another way to classify cloud services is by their service model and architecture.

### IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)

In IaaS, the cloud service provides computing infrastructure, such as [virtual machines](/cloud/virtualization/virtual-machine), storage, containers, and [serverless computing](/cloud/providers/amazon-aws/lambda/).

### PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)

In PaaS, the cloud service provides a computing platform, typically tied to a particular set of programming languages, tools, and applications. Generic operating system access (command line) is typically not permitted and the same virtual machines may be shared by multiple users. Typical examples include [Google App Engine](/cloud/providers/google/app-engine) and many web hosting services.

### SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)

In SaaS, an application running in the cloud is offered as a service. The cloud service provider handles all infrastructure and upgrades and provides the application software. The customer basically just gets to use the software. The software may run in a customer-specific virtual machine, multiple software instances may run in the same virtual machine, or the same application server instance could even serve multiple customers.

Software offered as a service is generally offered on a subscription basis - for example, the customer pays a monthly fee per user to use the software. However, not all software offered on a subscription basis is SaaS - these days it is increasingly common to offer even software run on customer premises as a typically annual subscription, as it provides lower initial costs for customers and higher and smoother run-rate income for vendors and their investors.

Cloud vs. Virtualization
------------------------

[Virtualization](/academy/cloud/virtualization) is a technology that allows many logical computers (virtual machines) to run on the same physical hardware. It is the underlying technology in cloud services. However, cloud computing has certain [characteristics](/cloud/computing/characteristics), such as elastic scalability, that are not always offered by virtualization alone.


/. 006 [Cloud Computing Pros and Cons](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/computing/advantages-and-disadvantages)
=========================================================

Cloud Computing Pros and Cons
=============================

Most major enterprises continue to migrate to the cloud. Many new systems are being built directly as cloud services and [software is increasingly offered "as-a-Service"](/academy/cloud/computing-models) from the cloud. While there are strong drivers for the adoption of cloud services, there are also important risks and barriers.

This page provides a basic overview of the advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing.

### Contents

* [Advantages of cloud computing](#advantages-of-cloud-computing) 
* [Disadvantages of cloud computing](#disadvantages-of-cloud-computing)

Advantages of cloud computing
-----------------------------

1.  **Cost**. The most important driver for cloud adoption is cost reduction. CIOs are under tremendous pressure to minimize costs. Some sources claim up to 12x cost savings by moving services to the cloud.
2.  **Reliability**. Cloud services are designed with redundancy and fault tolerance and have lots of Internet bandwidth, making them fairly tolerant to e.g. Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks.
3.  **Skills**. Moving services to the cloud can simplify on-premises infrastructure and can eliminate many specialized system administrator roles, such as database administration. Fewer specialized skills are required in the IT department.
4.  **Scalability**. The elasticity of the cloud can improve performance, especially at times of peak load (e.g. when a product launch causes greater demand than expected).
5.  **Outsourcing**. Moving to cloud services is part of the bigger trend of IT outsourcing. IT is increasingly seen as a necessary part of running the business, not as a core competence that must be in-house.
6.  **Managed services**. Increasingly, enterprises just want to buy a solution that is already fully deployed and integrated with other services they use. They are wary of engaging in complex integration projects and having permanent staff involved in maintaining applications and infrastructure.

  

Disadvantages of cloud computing
--------------------------------

1.  **Security**. The most cited barrier is security. There is concern over the security of the cloud service providers themselves (e.g. their insiders may be able to access customer resources), isolation of tenants, patching and cybersecurity practices of the service provider, and concern over the security and reliability of the connection to the cloud service.
2.  **Privacy**. Cloud services may be subject to surveillance and corporate or state espionage. Many countries have laws forcing CSPs to hand over customer data to local intelligence agencies, which commonly share intelligence with allied countries. This violates privacy, but also makes access codes and critical data available to other countries for cyberwarfare and for boosting their own competitiveness.
3.  **Vendor lock**. Many cloud services try to subtly make it very difficult to stop using their services. This takes many forms, such as data lock-in (not able to easily extract the company's data from the service/application), software lock-in (the application or software is not available from anyone else and extensive retraining would be required), platform lock-in (the applications run on a platform that, in all its complexity, is expensive to maintain yourself or not available from multiple vendors), API lock-in (integrations, deployment mechanisms, etc. use proprietary APIs). It is very common for companies to say they use open source, but in practice have many ways to lock customers in.
4.  **Provider viability**. Cloud service provision benefits from economics of scale, and it is difficult for small players to find a competitive differentiator. It can be expected that many smaller players will disappear. Even for established players, their service offering may change, causing discontinuities outside the customer's control as services are phased out or modified.
5.  Expertise. The availability of people with expertise in cloud services, software development for the cloud, and DevOps is still limited, though improving.


/. 007 [Cloud Computing Security](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/computing-security)
=========================================================

Cloud Computing Security
========================

Cloud computing security is a hot topic and one of the main concerns in transitioning to the cloud. It relates to the broader topic of cloud security.

### Contents

* [Cloud Computing Security Risks](#cloud-computing-security-risks) 
* [Application and Development Security](#application-and-development-security)

Cloud Computing Security Risks
------------------------------

*   Careless **management of accounts and access credentials**. Cloud services often have their own user credentials, which need to be integrated with enterprise [identity and access management](/iam/) solutions. Furthermore, many cloud servers have [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) on them, which can be used to access the servers without passwords. Most cloud applications also allow users to configure API credentials that can be used to perform operations on behalf of the user for application integration. API credentials are typically permanent and never expire unless manually removed.
    
*   Loss or leakage of **master passwords**. Cloud services are typically owned by an account created with the [cloud service provider](/academy/cloud/cloud-service-providers). The master account can do anything with the services - including destroying them all. Thus access to the master account is critical and should be protected. Two-factor authentication should be employed. However, there is also a risk of the access being lost (and the account becoming inaccessible) when employees leave or the password leaking to outsiders. Restricted sub-accounts should be created for API operations and administrators whenever feasible.
    
*   Loss or leakage of **database or application credentials**. Generally databases in the cloud use database-specific credentials that remain unchanged forever. Access to the credentials may provide access to any data in the database. Therefore procedures should be in place for protecting and periodically changing database credentials.
    
*   **Leaking secrets**. Many services require private keys for SSL/TLS certificates and API keys they use to access other applications and databases. Especially in elastically scaling services or containers, it may not be sensible to store secrets in the operating system images. Cloud secrets vaults are often used for providing access to secrets without storing them in virtual machine images or containers.
    
*   **Infrastructure breach** means some breaking into the cloud infrastructure (e.g., the virtualization system). This could be, e.g., by **escaping a virtual machine** using a vulnerability, **escaping a container** using a vulnerability or design flaw, or **escaping a serverless computing sandbox**. The breach could also be due to an **insider** or by someone who manages to **hack** into or **physically penetrate** the cloud service provider's facilities.
    
*   **Service provider viability** is a major issue for continuity. If the service provider goes under, data and access to applications could be suddenly and permanently lost. Off-cloud backups are important, as are vendor evaluations.
    
*   **Data leakage concerns** include leakage via bugs (e.g., the CloudFlare leak) or as a result of data exfiltration using any of the above issues.
    
*   **Mass surveillance and espionage** are a real risk. Cloud data often contains passwords into [Active Directory](/iam/active-directory/) domains, VPN passwords, Wifi passwords, and even server passwords. This data is highly sensitive and extremely valuable for penetrating enterprises in cyberwarfare situations. The data may also be used for industrial espionage and gaining a competitive advantage for domestic enterprises. Intelligence agencies are known to widely exchange obtained data.
    
*   **Compliance issues** are a concern in regulated industries. Cloud services may not meet the requirements of mandatory regulations. On the other hand, if the cloud service is properly certified, it may also reduce the [compliance](/compliance/) burden.
    

Application and Development Security
------------------------------------

One way to break into applications and data in the cloud is to inject malicious code into applications. The security of the development process is thus critical, including the security of source code repositories, build systems, the deployment process, and developer access to production.

Applications may also contain bugs that may allow an attacker to exfiltrate or modify data and impersonate privileged users.

/. 009 [Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/ciem)
=========================================================

What is Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management (CIEM)?
============================================================

Cloud systems are one of the most useful tools for multi-device data storage, use, and sharing — but they’re also highly vulnerable to cyberattacks, making cloud infrastructure entitlement management solutions a necessity for cloud-based organizations.

Cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) is the missing piece to the complete cybersecurity puzzle: it accounts for human error and abused access privileges in [cloud environments](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/computing-security) that are traditionally very complex and difficult to mitigate. By automatically revoking and limiting internal entitlements to the least possible degree, CIEM patches vulnerabilities that other cybersecurity tools, such as [privileged access management](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam) (PAM) solutions and [SSH key managers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ssh-key-management), don’t have the ability to address.

Moreover, multi-cloud infrastructures are becoming the norm, revealing integration issues that most security programs have yet to seamlessly resolve. Let’s take a closer look at how CIEM protects cloud entitlements and infrastructures as more and more companies embrace a remote and dynamic operational system.

What Is Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management?
----------------------------------------------------

Managing resources and configurations on the cloud can get complicated as overwhelming amounts of data migrate to this digital platform. With enterprises eagerly [shifting to multi-cloud environments](https://www.ssh.com/blog/three_tips_for_admin_access), manually keeping track of access privileges and the millions of servers and services they’re tied to becomes nearly impossible.

It’s important to ensure that all IT and OT framework areas are properly safeguarded with cloud infrastructure entitlement management, or CIEM for short. CIEM aims to spot, organize, audit, and flag cloud entitlements that grant different levels of permission to users for certain tasks.

### What Are Cloud Entitlements?

Cloud entitlements define user permissions as they engage with access credentials and undergo authentication processes for privileged tasks. Entitlements, and how they’re administered and configured, are unique to each [cloud provider](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/cloud-service-providers). This means that multi-cloud systems need to find a way to accommodate all these nuances while centrally managing user privileges. Many resources within the cloud are also transient, but how authorized users access them requires careful consideration and surveillance. Fortunately, CIEM tools can help.

### What Is a CIEM Tool?

CIEM tools are applications that bring much-needed automation and interoperability to singular cloud and multi-cloud environments by continuously scanning for anomalies in entitlement usage.

On the enterprise level, CIEM tools operate by analyzing existing entitlement inventories, associated users, and privileged tasks as they’re being performed to determine the [least privilege](https://www.ssh.com/blog/why-pam-should-come-before-iam) necessary to perform an action. Think of it this way: a new hire that needs to clock in their work hours on a secure cloud-based database shouldn’t be able to view and edit the hours of their fellow coworkers. In this case, a CIEM tool would notify an administrator that this employee has excessive access to [prevent any malicious behavior](https://www.ssh.com/blog/cybersecurity-trends-to-track) or unauthorized changes from occurring. The CIEM solutions will also suggest ways to limit or revoke this level of access to ensure that the employee can still resume their tasks without disruption.

What Are Common Threats to Cloud Security?
------------------------------------------

The open, sharable nature of cloud infrastructures inherently enables a high risk for data leaks, but they also shield organizations from being able to properly view and manage information stored and used within the cloud. For example, organizations very rarely deploy their own cloud infrastructures and often rely on third-party providers to set up a cloud-based operational ecosystem. While administrators are offered privileges to extensively tweak cloud settings to their organization’s preferences, they don’t have as much visibility or control over these environments as providers do.

Moreover, cloud users still fall victim to [weak passwords and improper key management](https://www.ssh.com/blog/centralized-password-ssh-key-management), with organizations unable to fully view the scope of internal credentials used for cloud access without some sort of management tool. At the same time, it’s incredibly tricky to restrict access to certain users on the cloud because it was designed to make data-sharing effortless and collaborative. This makes cloud environments valuable to hackers and even internal malicious actors hoping to slip into cloud systems undetected.

Why CIEM Is Essential to Your Cloud Strategy
--------------------------------------------

While [identity and access management](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam) (IAM) tools practically share the same function as CIEM applications, some of them are only viable in locally wired and stable environments. Organizations are realizing the limitations that on-premises infrastructures carry as [IoT and wireless capabilities](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iot) provide a level of convenience, flexibility, and possibility that IAM systems can’t compete with or fully safeguard.

Privileged access management systems run parallel to CIEM’s purpose in safeguarding role-based credentials; however, often they don’t offer much visibility into cloud entitlements and simply aren’t equipped to properly handle [ephemeral](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ephemeral-certificates-and-access) and shifting cloud features. Ultimately, CIEM goes beyond managing credentials — it defends against the possibility of human errors and suspicious behavior even after credentials have been used.

What Are the Components of CIEM?
--------------------------------

Cloud infrastructure entitlement management primarily consists of rules and policies that govern the following:

*   **User identities:** CIEM allocates and keeps track of the extent to which each user can access and control resources, tools, and services within a cloud.
*   **Security protocols:** Guidelines help decipher the highest level of workload access a user should be able to obtain at any given time.
*   **Metric logging:** CIEM organizes, rotates, and flags entitlement inventories for misuse to prioritize least privilege access and prevent exploitative gaps.
*   **Compliance certification:** Automated assessments continuously compare existing entitlements to security regulations and requirements for guaranteed compliance.
*   **Control center:** A comprehensive dashboard facilitates quick surveillance to detect operational efficiency and anomalies caused by manual setting changes.

How Is CIEM Used?
-----------------

Since cloud components are constantly shifting and evolving to accommodate growing technologies, CIEM must update and adapt an individual user’s workload and responsibilities to this fluctuating environment.

A CIEM typically assists the initial [SSH key verification process](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication) as a user connects to a machine or server via a cloud. Once the verification process is complete and the user enters their intended destination to perform a task, CIEM revokes access to this task and prompts the user to request the verification keys again the next time they use their credentials. With each entry, the CIEM compares the user’s permissions with their tasks to accurately determine the highest level of privilege that should be given to them, and repeatedly conducts this cycle to eliminate discrepancies in entitlements and user identities.

Administrators are able to oversee this cycle for additional visibility via a centralized CIEM dashboard with easy scalability, allowing them to navigate to particular problem areas and gain insight into general organizational functionality.

Cloud Security Benefits of CIEM
-------------------------------

Simply put, cloud environments are complicated. Trying to individually monitor the actions of all users (as well as their permissions, identities, and privileges as they change or become obsolete) is a staggering challenge — particularly when the organization is managing up to millions of volatile entities at a time. Machine learning and AI technologies embedded in CIEM systems keep enterprises several steps ahead of malicious actors hoping to steal sensitive information or inflict harm without being detected. Specifically, CIEM helps companies:

*   Acquire comprehensive visibility into all entitlements and how they’re used.
*   Dispose of credentials and revoke access privileges from individuals no longer associated with an organization or who can no longer gain entry into sensitive internal information.
*   Audit existing privileged accounts and entitlements to maintain accountability and reduce human error.
*   Automate all monitoring processes, giving developers and IT experts more time for challenging, complex tasks.
*   Encourage internal teams to remain within the parameters of their access roles.
*   Remediate issues related to possible breaches through excessive access privileges, such as floating credentials, internal abuse, and stolen credentials.

As clouds cover more real estate in the digital sphere, organizations without a CIEM tool in place risk being prime targets for cybersecurity attacks.

Are CIEM, IAM, and PAM Converging in Cloud-First Environments? 
-------------------

The shift to multi-cloud and hybrid IT/OT environments does not only have a big impact on the technology platforms businesses are adopting to host their business-critical applications and data. It is also challenging traditional management categories in the market analyst strategies.

KuppingerCole Analysts recently published their 2022 Leadership Compass for CIEM & Dynamic Resource Entitlement & Access Management (DREAM) platforms. DREAM is a new

classification for access management and entitlement platforms that can manage the challenges associated with computing environments that are dynamic and operate at cloud speed.

In the report, SSH was recognized as a:

*   Market Leader
*   Market Champion
*   Product Leader
*   Innovation Leader

Cloud Security Buyer’s Guide
============================

_Cloud service providers offer helpful security features for rudimentary data protection, but it’s not enough to keep vulnerabilities at bay. Here’s what to look for in a cloud security solution._

Without [cloud computing](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud-computing-definition), organizations would be stuck with on-premises servers and hardware flash drives, greatly limiting efficiency and interoperability between devices, applications, and data systems. While the internet has relieved companies of this inconvenience, it has also opened up new vulnerabilities that, if left unchecked, could result in disastrous breaches and data leaks.

Every cloud-based ecosystem is unique because each comprises a personalized mix of software programs, services, and applications used to transfer, edit, and store data online and across these platforms. Some organizations also embrace [multi-cloud or hybrid cloud infrastructures](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/computing-models), further complicating management and security. In this buyer’s guide, we’ll explain what cloud security is, common risk factors associated with cloud environments, and key features to look for when searching for a reliable cloud security system.

[PrivX: Delivering Optimal Cloud Security](#delivering-optimal-cloud-security)

What Is Cloud Security?
-----------------------

Cloud computing generally refers to the ability of users to access and transmit critical resources, such as data and applications, remotely using the internet. It involves a wide range of capabilities, from information storage and automated security tool deployment to real-time project collaboration and enterprise-wide communication.

While broad in definition, there are certain qualities that further differentiate cloud computing from any other internet-based capability. According to the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/cybersecurity-framework) (NIST), cloud computing involves:

*   **Instantaneous Self-Service:** Users can deploy and access online resources and data on their own, at any time, without the help of an intermediary.
*   **Management Capabilities:** Activity on the cloud can be monitored, audited, recorded, and logged for efficiency, data protection, and breach mitigation.
*   **Highly Accessible Networks:** Anyone with a [mobile device](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iot), from smartphones and tablets to laptops and anchored computers, can connect with networks using standard protocols.
*   **Limitless Scalability:** Users can utilize resources individually or share access with other users without restriction while also expanding their applications to other services and capabilities.
*   **Multi-Level Resource Distribution:** A cloud provider can house resources and facilitate data transactions for multiple users at one time, with adherence to identity-based authentication measures to ensure proper distribution and assignment of data.

  
Cloud computing often comes with base-level security features, but implementing a full-scale cloud security infrastructure requires additional moving parts. In fact, effective cloud security requires policies, applications, and technologies designed specifically to secure every channel, touchpoint, account, and asset present within a cloud system. It considers [access privileges](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/privileged-account), identity authentication, device compatibility, and the volatility of cloud environments as organizational and individual demands constantly shift and new vulnerabilities surface.

What Are the Security Risks of Cloud Computing?
-----------------------------------------------

Anything that takes residence on the internet is at risk of becoming exposed to the public, even with native security measures in place. Without appropriate management, automation tools, and centralized visibility, an undetected anomaly can quickly escalate into a [devastating breach](https://www.ssh.com/academy/operational-technology-breaches). Listed below are common risks all cloud users and administrators should flag and address as soon as possible.

### Insufficient Credential and Account Management

Organizations should [manage their credentials](https://www.ssh.com/blog/how-to-solve-the-most-common-credential-management-errors) and access privileges — even more so when cloud infrastructures are integrated into their operational framework. Often, cloud computing uses credentials, such as passwords, [SSH keys](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh-keys), and [tokens](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/just-in-time-security-tokens), to connect users to servers hosting applications and programs. The problem is that hackers can bypass traditional password-username combinations and infiltrate an organization’s cloud environment by leveraging just one of these credentials, which often aren’t [rotated](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/password-key-rotation) and remain active for long periods.

What’s worse, cloud services are used typically for short periods of time but access credentials, such as passwords and keys, are permanent in nature making them a bad match. Credentials get lost in the cloud easily.

Internal threats also pose risks if accounts are shared or contain broad access privileges. For instance, allowing all employees to use an administrative account to access company files leaves room for a malicious worker to tap into and exploit sensitive data that isn’t meant for their eyes. Authentication steps help to dispel suspicious behavior and alert admins about attempted logins.

### Wider Attack Surface

By nature, cloud infrastructures and the company assets they store are sprawled out but interconnected, meaning a [successful account hack](https://www.ssh.com/blog/ssh-key-scan-attack-honeypot) can lead an adversary to most, if not all, of an organization’s resources. Often, cloud data contains credential information for related directories, servers, and domains, making granular security all the more vital. By fortifying every single touchpoint and connection channel, admins can greatly reduce the threat surface available for hackers to take advantage of.

### Incomplete Compliance and Governance

In the cybersecurity space, [regulations, standards, and laws](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance) abound to help enterprises around the world to better align with expert recommendations surrounding asset protection and breach mitigation. However, many cloud providers offer baseline security capabilities that don’t always tick all the boxes needed for a fully compliant cloud environment.

Adopting several comprehensive security solutions, such as [IAM](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam) and [PAM](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam) platforms, extended backup and recovery configurations, and additional authentication and authorization tools not only expands your organization’s breadth of security but helps maintain reputability by consistently meeting legal requirements.

### Hybrid Cloud Complexity

There is no single cloud. Typically, companies host some of their services in private clouds that they manage themselves but they also purchase services from cloud service providers, such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. In addition, there are services that are hosted on-premises.

[Cloud service providers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/cloud-service-providers) (Azure, AWS, GCP) have proprietary point solutions to access their own environments but they use different logics, offer different capabilities, log activities in different ways, and lack consistency overall. The same goes for private and on-prem host access management.

In a hybrid cloud environment, access management gets complicated quickly.

### Shifting Workloads in the Cloud

The agility and scalability of cloud services are built on the foundation that cloud assets can be provisioned and decommissioned dynamically, fast, and at scale. As a result, enforcing policies, managing credentials, and restricting access to least privilege becomes a challenge with traditional security tools.

### On- and Off-Boarding Employees

Companies often employ the services of IT consultants, since they do not have all the expertise in-house. When an expert is needed quickly, onboarding subcontractors in hybrid cloud environments might be surprisingly slow without proper tools. Furthermore, revoking access as soon as the job is done can take too long.

### Discovering the Multi-Cloud Estate

Just like workloads, cloud targets are ephemeral, and they are just as easily discarded as they are bought. This leads to situations where a company might lose track of how many cloud targets they at a given moment even have. This is why they end up paying for cloud services that are not in reality needed but since nobody knows that for sure, they remain available in case they are needed. It’s also a risk for the company if they lose track of how many servers they maintain in their infrastructure since such servers tend to lack proper oversight and auditing.

### Provider Credibility

_Who_ hosts your cloud infrastructure is as important as _what_ a provider can offer. If a provider’s services are prone to blackouts or if the provider itself is retiring its services, it will drastically affect customers’ cloud environments and pose a risk of data loss and exposure. Shopping for a cloud provider with a viable long-term outlook ensures that your cloud services and overall environment will stay solid and secure. It’s also highly recommended that all assets are regularly backed up and updated to preserve data in its most recent iteration.


Cloud Security Best Practices
-----------------------------

A key aspect of establishing a strong cloud security system is finding the best cloud service provider for your business, but the other half of the equation lies in how well your organization enforces internal IT practices that keep personal assets safe. Experts strongly advise that all cloud-reliant enterprises practice these seven habits:

### Embrace Automated Management Solutions

IAM and PAM programs take care of all the minutiae associated with proper data handling and organization. IAM and PAM solutions rely heavily on automation and customization, allowing administrators to set configurations to define and monitor user identities and generate, distribute, and retire credentials before leaks can happen. Automation ensures that all management tasks are performed swiftly and accurately.

### Centralized Management Panes

[Centralization](https://www.ssh.com/blog/centralized-password-ssh-key-management) becomes key when overseeing the entire scope of a cloud system and is especially helpful in gauging the efficiency and safety of a multi-cloud or hybrid environment. By visually understanding how the cloud functions with respect to the users accessing it and which targets are available at a given moment, administrators can better spot and resolve failing structures or adjust existing configurations for enhanced performance and security.

Having visibility into the entire cloud estate under a single pane of glass and receiving notifications and alerts in one place helps admins prioritize their data’s safety, ultimately encouraging further investigation into recurring abnormalities.

### Audit, Track, Monitor, and Record Sessions

A proper cloud access management solution is able to identify, track, and log all user activities consistently regardless of the target.

When it comes to cybersecurity, no action is better than preventative action. Regular session recording and live monitoring can help log organizational behavior on respective clouds, enabling admins to analyze popular access areas, user tendencies and activity, and more. Consistent record-taking helps admins catch onto malicious schemes and hidden vulnerabilities before they unfold — covering everything from unsolicited modifications to faulty cloud components.

### Adopt Built-for-Cloud Solutions

Cloud offers great agility, speed, and scalability. What if the rest of your software stack can’t keep up? To truly leverage the benefits that the cloud offers is to ensure that security solutions don’t slow you down. Prefer solutions that are built using the microservices architecture just like cloud services are and that can natively leverage cloud functionality and scalability. Many solutions have been retrofitted to include support for cloud targets but their underlying architecture might be too rigid to match cloud speed.

### Pay Attention to Immutable Infrastructure

[Immutable Infrastructure](https://www.ssh.com/blog/immutable-infrastructure-admin-access) is built around the idea that you introduce as few changes into your environment as possible to keep it predictable. A software solution that doesn’t require agents, changes to existing configurations or scripts, and minimizes even temporary changes is a great example of this.

For example, using one-time passwords and rotating them through a vault is a process that typically requires tampering with the target environment, whether it is permanent or temporary. If every cloud session requires such a process, your environment is under constant change and requires processing power to keep up. It is better to use passwordless and keyless, [ephemeral certificate](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ephemeral-certificates-and-access)-based authentication that keeps your environment intact.

### Update All Software Consistently

Most cloud providers update connected software and hardware components automatically, but there may be external applications and services that are unaccounted for and left outdated. This can cause latency issues, susceptibility to bugs, and incompatibility with updated safety features. Ensure that all resources are updated to their latest versions and track how often they’re updated for optimal asset protection.

It certainly helps if your cloud access management solution is easy to update with as few software components as possible.

### Establish a Backup System

Even if your organization is working with a dependable cloud provider, it helps to always have an alternative plan. If your servers and networks experience a malfunction, is there an alternative solution or accessible storage space that your company could use to keep operations running smoothly? If not, you’ll need to start thinking about ways to automatically duplicate and transmit data and resources to an internal reservoir that doesn’t depend on the internet. Or, find a cloud provider that offers this perk as part of their package.

How to Evaluate Cloud Service Provider Security?
------------------------------------------------

The market’s [leading cloud providers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/cloud-service-providers) aren’t enough to keep your cloud environment compliant and secure. While Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure offer a range of protective features, like vulnerability detection and brute force defense mechanisms, developing an impenetrable cloud ecosystem requires installing several safety nets in case native features fail.

When shopping for a cloud security solution, ensure that your chosen solution works seamlessly with private, public, and hybrid cloud environments. Also, you’ll want to look for features like:

*   **Built-in cloud integration** that doesn’t require separate management panes
*   **Quick deployment and rapid scalability** to catch up with user demands and activity
*   **High availability** to accommodate vast quantities of data, users, devices, and accounts
*   **Zero Trust authentication** that relies on [ephemeral, just-in-time credentials](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework)
*   **Smooth passwordless and keyless migration** that doesn’t compromise existing credentials or security
*   **Central access to all targets** for both broad and granular visibility
*   **Automated access control processes** for immediate and meticulous behavior analysis
*   **Monitoring and recording of privileged sessions** for concrete and comparable [audit](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/pass-audits) logs

Fortunately, there’s a solution that checks all these boxes, and more.

/. 011 [Cloud Security Maturity Model](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/cloud-security-maturity-model)
=========================================================

The Cloud Security Maturity Model
=================================

_Keeping cloud environments secure can be tricky, but the cloud security maturity model can help steer your organization toward compliance — even in the midst of changing security demands._

The introduction of the [cloud infrastructure](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud-computing-definition) ushered in an era of heightened security and flexibility — but along with it came new vulnerabilities. While international [regulations, laws, and policies](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance) exist to provide benchmark guidance for cloud security, organizations still lack universal guidelines for implementing and maintaining a well-guarded cloud environment as internet-based technologies continue to evolve.

The cloud security maturity model is a step towards common ground, offering more concrete direction for developing and enforcing an effective security plan that’s designed to last. Let’s take a closer look at what this looks like in an organization and explore why having a widely accepted framework is crucial for safe and reliable remote data access.

What Is a Cloud Security Maturity Model?
----------------------------------------

The cloud security maturity model is a list of general criteria that helps organizations gauge their security posture as they gradually adopt more advanced measures and tools. It’s important to note that unlike established rules, such as the [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/pci) (PCI DSS) and the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/eu-gdpr) (GDPR), the cloud security maturity model isn’t as detailed or specific in its instruction — but that’s the point.

Organizations are incredibly unique in operation and form, meaning security capabilities will vary based on available resources. The cloud security maturity model accounts for this variation, allowing enterprises to define how they achieve security objectives at each stage of their risk mitigation plan while keeping them aligned with industry standards.

The cloud security maturity model assesses how strong your existing security program is across three domains:

*   **Foundational:** This encompasses the baseline security goals your organization embraces and gradually builds upon for a stronger, more comprehensive protective framework across all functional areas.
*   **Structural:** This covers the connective tissue of your organization’s [operational network](https://www.ssh.com/academy/operational-technology/ot-security), including how devices and users connect to each other and internet-based entities; it also considers manual and automation features to tackle management tasks.
*   **Procedural:** This consists of the protocols and behavioral standards needed to enforce and adapt existing security procedures to best protect assets against advancing threats.

By helping your organization analyze all moving parts within your security plan and how they work together, the cloud security maturity model supports an iterative approach that makes advancement a priority, so you can stay ahead of [cyber threats](https://www.ssh.com/blog/breach_consequencies_are_long_lasting).

Why Is the Cloud Security Maturity Model Important?
---------------------------------------------------

Having a cloud security maturity model in place keeps security top of mind and a part of every conversation involving remote interactions. It helps align all internal priorities with security objectives to safeguard every inch of an enterprise’s functional and social architecture. Moreover, the cloud security maturity model helps leaders track how well their teams abide by set standards and pinpoint areas of risk across their cloud environment for better security management.

Due to its progressional nature, the cloud security maturity model also makes it easy to map out action plans for achieving the next level of security. Essentially, it’s a living and breathing vision board that prioritizes cloud security in all internal decisions.


The Need for Cloud Security Standards
-------------------------------------

With troves of data being shared, accessed, and edited on the internet, it becomes easy for cybercriminals to leverage vulnerabilities that inevitably arise through human error or poor management practices. What’s more, cloud compositions are incredibly complex, making each and every internet-based communication channel challenging to monitor and keep safe.

For example, for sufficient security, organizations must consider all parties involved in computing, networking, and cloud storage; the applications, software, and hardware mechanisms at hand; and the type of cloud infrastructure being utilized. For a large-scale company dealing with hundreds of terabytes of information on any given day, undetected security risks can quickly escalate to devastating [breaches](https://www.ssh.com/academy/password-credential-breaches) and data leaks.

As mentioned, there isn’t a universal playbook businesses can use to ensure they’re maintaining a well-secured cloud network; however, there _are_ regulations and laws that serve as sound, expert-driven guidelines for cloud security development and deployment.

Common Compliance Standards for the Cloud
-----------------------------------------

From [identity and access management](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam) to endpoint visibility, global compliance standards provide comprehensive guidance to adequately protect every corner of your cloud infrastructure. Notable standards include:

*   **ISO-Established Standards:** The International Organization for Standardization ([ISO](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/iso-27001)) outlines various requirements for cloud-based services, covering cloud computing activities and roles, data handling, on-premises hardware components, personal information security, and more.
*   **HIPAA:** The [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/hipaa/security-rule), a U.S. mandate, features instructions on how to manage and store personal healthcare information within practices, across applications, and in all patient communications.
*   **PCI DSS:** Short for the [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/pci), this list of recommendations describes safe measures for protecting financial information as consumers perform transactions online.
*   **GDPR:** Expanding further on information privacy, the General Data Protection Regulation is composed of comprehensive laws detailing baseline requirements for cloud services regarding housing and transmitting personal data. This includes proper [privileged access management](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/what-is-privileged-access-management-pam), data log storage, encryption techniques for data in transit and at rest, and more.
*   **CSA Controls Matrix:** For [cloud service providers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/cloud-service-providers) like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, the Cloud Security Alliance created a playbook for passing security audits with ease. The CSA also issues STAR certifications to keep vendors engaged and aware of the latest updates to cybersecurity standards.
*   **CIS Foundations Benchmarks:** Developed by the Center for Internet Security, these guidelines offer support for every touchpoint in a cloud environment, down to the account level.

While helpful in setting the stage for what security should look like across a cloud’s entire infrastructure, these standards may not always clearly explain _how_ an organization can achieve these compliance goals. This is where the cloud security maturity model becomes useful.

What Are the Stages of Security in Cloud Computing?
---------------------------------------------------

There are five stages organizations must go through to seamlessly fortify all touchpoints and communication channels across a cloud environment and transform it into a robust, impenetrable remote data system:

*   **Stage 1:** This stage involves traditional data systems that lack any form of automation or security protocol. Identity, privileged access, and [credential management](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/what-is-credential-management) are all performed manually, albeit haphazardly.
*   **Stage 2:** More defined security measures are introduced with the implementation of basic management tools and resources, but full-scale integration needs improvement. [Automation](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/automated) features are also incorporated but typically reserved for individual, ad-hoc purposes.
*   **Stage 3:** Cloud accounts are more closely managed with the widespread use of multi-factor authentication for added security support. Third-party services are also adopted for more comprehensive troubleshooting and landscape monitoring, but automation is not fully deployed at the organizational level.
*   **Stage 4:** Automation expands further across multiple touchpoints for better security integration and interoperability, with the aid of a centralized security management platform. Granular visibility provides the ability to partake in preventative threat mitigation.
*   **Stage 5:** Every single cloud surface is monitored and secured by automatic security features, with smooth interoperability across all domains. Multiple management interfaces, such as IAM, [PAM](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam), and [Zero Trust](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework) solutions, run concurrently without latency or disruption. Additionally, a clear set of security policies are well understood and followed by all internal teams.

Leveraging platforms and software applications that comply with government regulations and laws surrounding cloud security helps organizations quickly scale up this ladder of compliance — but ultimately, it’s up to the enterprise to maintain the efficacy of their security program as technology continues to change.

Best Practices for Implementing a Cloud Security Maturity Model
---------------------------------------------------------------

The cloud security maturity model is designed to make complete cloud security achievable and less overwhelming for organizations of all sizes. The aim is to constantly analyze how a security program is functioning and where it’s headed. Each stage of the model serves as a checkpoint, but there are best practices to consider while building your organization up for the next stage of security.

At each level, a thorough self-assessment should be conducted to understand where your organization stands — specifically, if your security program merits an upgrade or warrants more development. Being intentional and meticulous about the state of your cloud security helps you pinpoint areas that work and areas that don’t so that no gaps are left exposed or unaddressed.

Once notes are made, develop a plan to get your security framework to the next stage. This entails checking off all security requirements across all domains for that level: foundational, [structural](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/computing-models), and procedural. To make actionable change, establish deadlines and involve the necessary stakeholders to get things moving. Ensure that your organization is on pace with reaching the next maturity stage and has the resources to do so. Only advance to the next level of maturity once all areas have been improved upon.

After your plan has been executed, perform an audit to view how your security measures perform in tandem with each other. This becomes particularly vital as new technologies and threats are introduced in the cloud landscape, which may bump your maturity level back a stage depending on how well-fortified and integrated your current security blanket is. Organizations should continuously perform audits even after achieving the final maturity stage to keep up to date with recommended security trends.

/. 012 [Cloud Service Providers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/cloud-service-providers)
=========================================================

Cloud Service Providers
=======================

With hardware’s limitations, organizations are looking to cloud computing for expanded capabilities. However, choosing the right cloud service provider is important if you hope to maintain operational efficiency and security.

[Cloud computing](/academy/cloud-computing-definition) remotely centralizes IT capabilities to keep users connected to the information and device settings they need using any mobile device. Cloud services help supplement the IT experience by allowing seamless mobile integration and accessibility, from storing data to accessing software applications.

However, with a handful of reliable cloud service providers on the market, it can be challenging to determine which cloud service provider is best suited to your organization. This guide explains what enterprises can expect from cloud service providers, what each provider type features, and what characteristics to look out for to find the best cloud service solution for your IT environment.

What Are Cloud Service Providers?
---------------------------------

Cloud service providers are vendors that supply and establish [cloud computing IT services](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/computing/definition). Often contracted on a pay-as-you-go basis, these companies offer a wide variety of packages to manage, transfer, and support applications within a secure and remote virtual database. The three primary models cloud service providers offer are [Infrastructure-as-a-Service](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/iaas) (IaaS), [Platform-as-a-Service](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/paas) (PaaS), and [Software-as-a-Service](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/saas) (SaaS), which we will explore in more detail later in this article. Popular examples of cloud service providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, to name a few.

Why Use a Cloud Computing Service Provider?
-------------------------------------------

Without a dependable cloud computing service provider, your organization has to tackle all of its infrastructure, platforms, and software needs on its own. This covers everything from how each device interacts with networks and servers to how operating systems and downloaded applications transport data between [wireless devices](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/applications) — all of these activities would have to be manually controlled and monitored.

As one can imagine, this takes considerable time, effort, and expertise; manually managing these activities can result in a human error occurring and compromising the efficiency or security of your environment. But besides taking the guesswork out of IT management, cloud computing service providers bring many benefits (as well as some challenges) to digital landscapes that should be considered.

### Advantages of Using a Cloud Service Provider

Unlike traditional IT implementations that require hefty equipment expenses up-front, cloud service providers typically offer subscription plans where customers are charged based on how much of the vendor’s services are used.

For example, one cloud service many smartphone users are familiar with paying for is additional data storage. Users can elect to pay a few dollars each month for hundreds of gigabytes in cloud storage, allowing them to continue saving pictures, videos, documents, and other files on their phones once their local storage has reached capacity. Similarly, cloud service providers possess a portfolio of products that are paid for over time, meaning you use what you pay for — nothing more and nothing less.

[Scalability](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/computing/advantages-and-disadvantages#advantages-of-cloud-computing) is another strong advantage of using a cloud service provider. From a household member to a multinational corporation, anyone can purchase, apply, integrate, remove, and stack cloud components depending on fluctuating demands and needs. Scalability also comes in handy as new technologies emerge, helping organizations upgrade their legacy systems as necessary to maintain operability.

In emergencies, such as cases of hardware disruption, cloud service providers make it easier to retrieve data that would otherwise have been corrupted or erased. Thanks to backups and recovery protocols, data is kept safe in the cloud until users can access it from a viable device using a stable internet connection. However, it is worth noting that network outages and internet issues will render such data inaccessible until a Wi-Fi connection can be restored.

### Disadvantages of Using a Cloud Service Provider

While cloud service providers only charge consumers for what they use, these expenses can quickly add up if demand unexpectedly booms. For organizations transitioning to a cloud-based IT system, the migration process can be lengthy, particularly if the data being transferred has been collected and managed outside of the cloud for potentially years. As a result, this process can boost service costs further.

Organizations should pay close attention to contractual terms and agreements from cloud service providers or consult legal counsel to ensure that the cost of services and early termination fees are reasonable. Contracts should also be transparent about how cloud computing service providers assist customers in avoiding [cybersecurity threats and attacks](https://www.ssh.com/blog/cybersecurity-trends-to-track). Since cloud environments are heavily targeted and vulnerable spaces for malware, bolstering security measures on both sides is essential.

Categories of Cloud Computing Service Providers
-----------------------------------------------

Cloud service providers are categorized by what they offer and how they function. As previously mentioned, there are [three main cloud models](/academy/cloud/computing-models) providers focus on based on the type of services needed:

*   **[IaaS](/academy/cloud/iaas):** Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers focus on the IT architectural framework of an organization, supporting processes that traditional stationary devices are responsible for, such as automation, security, networking, and storage in a remote environment.
*   **[SaaS](/academy/cloud/saas):** Software-as-a-Service providers specialize in business-related operational applications like management and productivity suites, internal databases, and employee interfaces, allowing organizations to stay updated while on the go.
*   **[PaaS](/academy/cloud/paas):** Platform-as-a-Service providers concentrate on developing and administering clouds — venues where operational software and applications can seamlessly and remotely work together.

However, a majority of cloud computing providers like to offer a combination of all three structures so that consumers can enjoy more flexibility, variety, and value in service. Besides available packages, cloud service providers can also be distinguished by the type of cloud system they have available.

Widely-used providers such as Oracle Cloud and Salesforce are known as public cloud providers. With public cloud providers, all cloud computing services clients request are installed and controlled by these companies. Despite its name, public clouds are _not_ available for anyone to see — only the provider can access the public cloud and, as such, they are responsible for its security and maintenance. Public cloud providers are popular because of their affordability and convenience.

On the other hand, private cloud providers sell solutions that organizations must implement and maintain themselves. This is a more expensive option because it involves constant _internal_ management and a well-established data center, making it suitable for large enterprises that already have the resources for both. While private clouds promise a higher level of security than their public counterpart, they take a significant amount of labor, time, and capital to properly deploy. Nonetheless, private clouds are easily customizable, which businesses can use to align their IT infrastructure with internal management goals.

Hybrid cloud providers reap the benefits of both public and private clouds, with consumers determining who has control over certain services. Many cloud service providers that predominantly work with public clouds offer private cloud functionalities for those wanting more flexibility and control over their data without entirely investing in a full-scale private cloud system.

Standard Services Across Providers
----------------------------------

Despite the intricacies that make each cloud computing service provider unique, consumers can expect to find broad network compatibility, stackable solutions, monitored service usage, on-demand capabilities, and consumer control to be [standard features](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/computing/characteristics) across providers. Generally, a cloud service provider should make it easy for consumers to edit, save, access, secure, and organize their operations and data at any time, and at a reasonable price.

### The Top Five Cloud Service Providers on the Market

For organizations looking to collaborate with a provider to optimize internal management, these five cloud service providers are worth exploring.

#### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Launched in 2002, [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/?nc1=f_cc) has earned over 40 compliance certifications worldwide. Not only is AWS easy to navigate, but it offers solutions for a huge range of industries, from aerospace organizations to retail stores. The AWS website also provides free tools and resources customers can use to budget service costs, learn valuable cloud computing skills, and train employees on cybersecurity measures. For organizations small and large, and for novices and veterans alike, Amazon Web Services is a safe bet for all-around support and reliability.

#### Microsoft Azure

Artificial intelligence (AI) gives [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-azure/?&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwz96WBhC8ARIsAATR251CCmRZh84BaciGjQcHS0DR5i3gwhbDMFvmWB7uX0dqgts_5SDsOqYaAuSzEALw_wcB:G:s&OCID=AIDcmm5edswduu_SEM_Cj0KCQjwz96WBhC8ARIsAATR251CCmRZh84BaciGjQcHS0DR5i3gwhbDMFvmWB7uX0dqgts_5SDsOqYaAuSzEALw_wcB:G:s&gclid=Cj0KCQjwz96WBhC8ARIsAATR251CCmRZh84BaciGjQcHS0DR5i3gwhbDMFvmWB7uX0dqgts_5SDsOqYaAuSzEALw_wcB) a competitive edge among cloud service providers, granting consumers the ability to make the most of the latest technologies. With advanced services that cater to machine learning and AI use cases, Microsoft Azure is built for innovation. There is even a special cloud dedicated to government entities for robust and exclusive cloud security. Microsoft Azure boasts 90 compliance certifications globally, with support extending beyond Windows applications. However, some of the content on Microsoft Azure’s website can be difficult to comprehend for those new to cloud computing.

#### Google Cloud

Perhaps the most familiar cloud service provider to users around the world, [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) is favored by IT managers and small businesses wanting additional cloud functionality with minimal setup. Google Cloud is also widely used in everyday household use cases, with over 25 free cloud products available. High interoperability and compatibility with existing applications can be expected, as well as a comprehensive set of security and detection services to keep all data and activity confidential, as it should be.

#### Oracle Cloud

Private cloud and public cloud capabilities merge effortlessly with Oracle Cloud’s all-in-one infrastructure. Oracle encourages customer control, allowing businesses to manage their own security settings, data migration, and on-site data centers via Oracle Cloud’s databases. [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/why-oci/) prioritizes a high-end management experience, with the hybrid cloud infrastructure offering a centralized user interface for ease of access, reduced latency, and quick migration. Like Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud can be tricky to navigate because of its complex features. However, its built-in automated services grant customers the flexibility of a private cloud with the assistance of a self-running public cloud service.

#### Salesforce

Developed and deployed in suites, Salesforce’s cloud services center on the business-consumer relationship. Best for juggling customer engagement, internal management, data organization, social connectivity, and marketing analytics in one place, Salesforce’s library of cloud-based databases is also AI-powered to help users optimize their data to meet business goals. Salesforce’s Customer 360 bundles all of its services into one highly integrative and responsive environment, spanning sales and marketing initiatives to IT assistance and external outreach. [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/products/what-is-salesforce/?d=70130000000i7zF) is an unconventional cloud service provider that helps organizations holistically run their operations.

Choosing the Best Cloud Service Provider for Your Business
----------------------------------------------------------

With many reputable cloud service providers to choose from, it is crucial to reflect on how internal business objectives will benefit from cloud-based solutions. Not every organization will need a complete suite of products, just as not every enterprise can optimally function with just a few services. Finding an organization's ideal cloud service provider requires aligning financial, management, security, and operational goals with what a cloud service provider can offer.

To start, consider:

*   **Pricing Options:** Every enterprise has its unique budget, but all of them want to get the most bang for their buck. Most providers have extremely affordable service options, but look out for bundled packages that may reap savings in the long run.
*   **Services Provided:** Determine how much cloud-based integration is necessary and how user-friendly it needs to be. For instance, a digital marketing agency will most likely require a simple infrastructure like Salesforce, whereas a government entity might lean more towards the extensive services offered by Microsoft Azure.
*   **Security Measures:** Clouds are vulnerable if left unprotected. Be sure to look into how a cloud service provider keeps data safe, as well as what [security features](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/computing/security) can be accessed and customized by your organization for extra safeguarding.
*   **Vendor Assistance:** At the end of the day, a cloud service provider should assist an organization, especially when obstacles arise. Be wary of hidden customer support costs and research how a cloud service provider typically handles disruptions on their side.
*   **Additional Resources:** For those unfamiliar with cloud computing, it may be worth finding a cloud service provider that offers free courses, guides, and toolkits to ensure that cloud solutions are being properly deployed and every feature appropriately employed.

Make the Most of Multi-Cloud Access with SSH
--------------------------------------------

SSH’s [PrivX privileged access management solution](https://www.ssh.com/products/privx/) establishes a secure connection as users interact with their multi-cloud servers. It automatically discovers all cloud targets (Azure, AWS and Google) and keeps them updated for you under a single pane of glass.

Founded on zero-trust architecture and just-in-time access, users obtain temporary authoritative access with the use of [ephemeral certificates](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ephemeral_access) that expire once a connection is made. This dynamic model leaves no credentials behind to manage or vault nor do users see any secrets during the process.

As users work alongside their cloud solutions, PrivX monitors and audits all cloud activity while flagging and resolving suspicious behavior for preventative protection. Moreover, PrivX is made for complex, multi-cloud, and stackable implementations for quick syncing and smooth integration. [Get in touch with us today](https://www.ssh.com/contact) to learn how adding PrivX to your cloud infrastructure will bolster the security of your organization’s cloud-based data.


/. 013 [IaaS](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/iaas)
=========================================================

IaaS: Security Issues and Solutions
===================================

IaaS, or Infrastructure-as-a-Service, is the traditional cloud model provided by, e.g., Amazon AWS. Essentially, the cloud service provider offers virtual machines, containers, and/or serverless computing services. There are very few limitations on what applications can be run on the infrastructure or what tools can be used to run the applications. Many service providers also offer databases, cloud storage, security services, etc.

The general business model for IaaS is to charge for resources by the hour or based on volume. Resources can generally be purchased on demand and terminated when no longer needed. For more information, see [cloud computing models](/cloud/computing/models).

### Contents

* [Insider Threats](#insider-threats) 
* [Escaping Virtual Machines, Containers, or Sandboxes](#escaping-virtual-machines,-containers,-or-sandboxes) 
* [Breaking Authentication](#breaking-authentication) 
* [Breaking Encryption](#breaking-encryption)

Security Considerations for IaaS
--------------------------------

The security of any service run in the cloud depends on the security of the cloud infrastructure. Generally, it is not possible to protect a virtual machine (or a container or a serverless computing sandbox for that matter) against a compromised hypervisor. Thus, breaches involving the infrastructure are a major additional security concern beyond those facing traditional servers. On the other hand, the cloud service provider will generally keep its infrastructure well patched and properly configured, and thus the risk of certain exploitable vulnerabilities is reduced.

### Insider Threats

Employees of the cloud service provider have direct access to hardware and networks, and many have access to the hypervisors, provisioning systems, and authentication infrastructure. Thus, those privileged insiders are a potential threat.

### Escaping Virtual Machines, Containers, or Sandboxes

If a customer is able to escape from a virtual machine, container, or serverless sandbox, that may permit access to the hypervisor or operating system running other customers' workloads. Once in a hypervisor, the attacker can modify code, steal secrets, and install malware on any instance on the same hardware.

The risk of such break-outs can be reduced by minimizing the number of virtualization drivers and other features supported by the hypervisor (minimize attack surface), tight use of SELinux in enforcing mode, and intrusion detection tools.

### Breaking Authentication

Access to the accounts used to provision (and terminate) virtual machines and other cloud services enables the attacker to simply use the cloud service's API or user interface to destroy services or grant additional access as desired. The credentials to access the cloud service could be obtained by, e.g., installing a keylogger on an administrator's desktop as a part of a broader breach on the internal network.

Obtaining any API credentials, database credentials, or private keys used by the cloud service could also provide an attacker free access to those services.

### Breaking Encryption

One way to gain access to the cloud is to break encryption. Most cloud services and APIs are protected using the TLS protocol, which in turn relies on [PKI](/pki/) for authentication. The typical way to break encryption is to break the PKI.

A PKI generally provides a good level of security against casual attackers. However, browsers trust something like a hundred different root-level certificate authorities in different countries. Any of the certificate authorities can create a certificate for any user.

If the attacker (typically a government) can obtain a CA certificate from any of the certificate authorities (e.g., ostensibly for their national PKI or their military PKI), they can create new certificates for any site and, combined with network-level attacks, potentially perform a [man-in-the-middle attack](/attack/man-in-the-middle) on any end-user or API or database connection associated with the application. The attack can then be used for stealing or modifying data, or even injecting the attacker's own commands into the connection (e.g., to install new credentials to give future access without resorting to such intrusive attacks).


/. 014 [PaaS](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/paas)
=========================================================

PaaS: Security Problems, Solutions, Vendors
===========================================

Platform-as-a-Service (Paas) is a cloud computing model where the service provider offers a platform that enables customers to develop, run, and manage applications. The service provider maintains the infrastructure for developing and running the applications.

Typically, the customer develops the application for a sandbox having limited supported languages and configuration options. The service provider offers the computing infrastructure, operating systems, middleware, and preinstalled software packages to facilitate running the applications.

PaaS is commonly used for web server hosting, as well as for services like [Google App Engine](/cloud/providers/google/app-engine), which allow users to develop their own code to be run in a limited sandbox.

### Contents

[Security Issues](#security-issues)

Security Issues
---------------

For performance reasons, applications from multiple customers are typically run in the same operating system instance. The applications may be isolated from each other using containers or some language-specific sandbox mechanism (e.g., the Java virtual machine).

A major security risk, beyond those for [IaaS](/cloud/iaas/), is an application breaking out from its sandbox. Containers were not originally designed to be secure against breakout (particularly if the user is able to utilize some vulnerability to obtain [root](/iam/user/root) privileges). Programming language sandboxes have been found to be even more fragile; for example, new vulnerabilities are typically found and patched in the Java virtual machine every month.


/. 015 [SaaS](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/saas)
=========================================================

SaaS: Security, Challenges, Solutions
=====================================

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a cloud service model where the vendor runs a software application in the cloud, and customers are only given access to that application (not the operating system or even the platform, middleware, or programming environment used to develop the application). However, some applications may offer their own programming interfaces to customers.

A SaaS application is often hosted in an [IaaS](/cloud/iaas/) cloud offering provided by a different service provider - most commonly the Amazon Cloud.

Sometimes a software business model based on annual (or monthly) license fees is also called SaaS. However, we distinguish that as a separate topic and use SaaS to strictly refer to software offered from the cloud.

### Contents

[Security Considerations](#security-considerations)

Security Considerations
-----------------------

SaaS raises new security concerns related to vendor security practices, [identity and access management](/academy/iam), backups, and business continuity.

### Infrastructure Risks Hidden but Still There

The SaaS model hides traditional security risks relating to physical access, operating systems, storage, and applications from the customer. However, the risks have not disappeared; they simply get ignored because they are no longer under the control of the customer. Most cloud service providers, however, offer no guarantees of their security practices, at least not to smaller customers.

### Identity and Access Management Integration

The integration of access control to the enterprise's [identity and access management (IAM)](/iam/) practices typically remains a task performed by the customer. It is important to ensure that access to cloud services is properly provisioned and terminated when people change roles or leave the organization.

### Data Encryption

Some applications support encrypting the stored data using keys held by the customer. Others encrypt the customer's data using keys held by the service provider. Most applications do not perform or document any data encryption.

### Backups

Taking backups of the data stored in the application in a different cloud service or on the customer's premises may be essential for continuity in the event the service provider suddenly ceases to exist.

### Cloud Access Security Brokers

Cloud access security brokers are policy enforcement points on-premise or in the cloud, that may perform integration between the organization's IAM and encryption solutions and applications in the cloud.


/. 016 [Virtualization Technology](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/virtualization)
=========================================================

Virtualization Technology - The Basis of Cloud Computing
========================================================

Virtualization refers to running multiple virtual computers, or [virtual machines](/cloud/virtualization/virtual-machine), inside a single physical computer. While the basic idea of virtualization is old (dating back to mainframe computers in the 1960s), it has become mainstream only in the last 10-15 years. Today, most new servers are virtualized.

Virtualization is the basis of modern [cloud computing](/academy/cloud-computing-definition).

### Contents

[Why Virtualize?](#why-virtualize)  
[Hypervisor](#hypervisor)  
[Virtual Machine](#virtual-machine)  
[Container](#container)  
[Virtual Network](#virtual-network)  
[Virtualization Software](#virtualization-software)  
  

Why Virtualize?
---------------

Virtualization drivers in recent years have included:

*   More powerful hardware, allowing each machine to run multiple applications simultaneously
    
*   Pressure to lower IT costs and simplify IT administration
    
*   Need to manage large-scale installations and clusters, such as server farms
    
*   Improved security, reliability, scalability, and device independence
    
*   Ability to mix multiple operating systems on same hardware.
    

Hypervisor
----------

A hypervisor is an operating system instance, or a software package, that creates and managesvirtual machines. The hypervisor typically runs on real hardware and allows multiple virtual machines to run on the same hardware. Virtual machines are also called guests.

Modern hypervisors in the PC world include VMware ESX, VMware Player, Xen, Citrix XenServer, Microsoft Hyper-V, VirtualBox, and QEMU. VMWare Player, VirtualBox, and QEMU are application-layer hypervisors (essentially like normal programs), though they rely on some specialized operating system support for virtualization. Linux KVM and FreeBSD's bhyve are kernel modules that effectively convert a normal operating system into a hypervisor. In fact, it is often possible to log into a hypervisor (e.g., using[SSH keys](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/key/)and use it like a normal operating system.

For more information, seevirtualization software.

Virtual Machine
---------------

A virtual machine is a virtual operating system instance run under ahypervisor. A virtual machine may run in acloud serviceor may be running on a user's desktop or some server hardware.

Generally, a virtual machine looks like just a normal computer and operating system to anyone logging into it over a network. A virtual machine will usually havevirtual disks,virtual network interfaces, and often a virtual display.

A typical server will run up to several dozen virtual machines. Some servers may run hundreds or even thousands of virtual machines.

### Guest Operating System and Remote Access

A virtual machine can run almost any guest operating system, including Linux and Windows. Linux virtual machines are typically accessed over the network using[SSH](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/). Windows virtual machines are often accessed remotely using Windows remote desktop. Many virtualization systems also give access to the host's virtual console display.

### Virtual Machine Device Access

A virtual machine uses virtual devices to interact with the host operating system. The host operating system may emulate actual hardware to allow the guest operating system (i.e., the operating system running on the virtual machine) to access storage, network, and other resources.

Many hypervisors and guest operating systems support paravirtualized device drivers. This means that the guest operating system driver does not actually access emulated hardware; instead, it recognizes it is running on a particular hypervisor, and uses a hypervisor-specific communication mechanism to access the hypervisor's device drivers. The hypervisor may control and map access to its device drivers to enforce security and direct the virtual machine to its own virtual storage.

Container
---------

Acontaineris a special kind of virtual machine that has no guest operating system. Instead, it is a group of processes isolated from other processes on the same host using special namespaces. In Linux, these are called`cgroups`or[control groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups).

Virtual Network
---------------

A virtual network is a network defined inside a computer using a virtual switch that one or more virtual machines or containers may connect to using virtual network interfaces.

From an IP address configuration perspective, a virtual network looks just like any other network segment. A virtual switch is used to pass packets between virtual machines and containers. Sometimes, network address translation is also performed.

### Virtual Networks Spanning Multiple Computers

A virtual network may also extend to multiple servers. In this case, it's virtual switch is also connected to a physical network interface. Often the physical network interface is configured to use[VLAN tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q)to enable multiple virtual networks to share the same physical cable.

Virtualization Software
-----------------------

Several virtualization software packages are available for Linux and Windows:

*   [VMware ESX and VMware Player](http://www.vmware.com/)
    
*   [Microsoft Hyper-V](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/server-virtualization)
    
*   [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
    
*   [Citrix XenServer](https://www.citrix.com/products/xenserver/)
    
*   [QEMU](http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Main_Page)
    
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
    

Various Linux distributions, such as[Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/), contain virtualization features built-in.

Cloud services also provide virtualization. See the[cloud service providers](/academy/cloud/cloud-service-providers)page.

Compliance is a critical component of any security program. Compliance lives by the rule that states **We Trust but Verify**. The concept is that we must obtain evidence of compliance with stated policies, standards, laws, regulations, etc. in order to issue the proper attestations as required.

Compliance, which is only a point in time, is directly impacted by the ever changing and always evolving rules and regulations which makes it quite challenging for organizations to maintain a sound compliance posture. The continuous expansion and extension of our production environments also adds to the compliance challenges we all face today.

SSH and Compliance
------------------

We recognize these challenges and always strive to align our solutions’ functions, features and reports with the laws, regulations, and technologies that potentially impact what the industry defines as **trusted access**.

When organizations are faced with having to comply with key controls such as privileged access, segregation of duties, third-party access and much more, it becomes an apparent nightmare to ensure continuous authorized access. SSH.COM solutions are designed with compliance in mind.

[SSH key](/ssh/key/) based access has been labeled the dark side of compliance. It has been ignored or simply slipped under the audit radar for years. Organizations must take action and assess their SSH key situation and pursue means to inventory, control, remediate and govern SSH keys within their production environments.

How Do Frameworks Come into Play?
---------------------------------

[HIPAA](/compliance/hipaa/security-rule) law along with the **HITECH** act are actively being audited in health organizations to ensure compliance. Access to electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) must be controlled and authorized while data is at rest, in use and in transmission.

[Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS)](/compliance/pci) clearly specify how merchants and acquirers must protect card holder data. The twelve (12) domains of PCI DSS cover a wide range of security requirements that are designed to protect card holder data from point of creation to destruction or obsolescence.

[Sarbanes-Oxley](/compliance/sarbanes-oxley/), which is also referred to as **SOX**, is a government act from 2002 that hit all financial organizations as a tidal wave that caused them to scramble to identify and implement internal controls to ensure effectiveness of their financial statements and attestations. The controls were designed to ensure effectiveness as it relates to key controls such as logical access, privileged access, segregation of duties and much more.

**National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, which has been around for over 115 years, has supported the smallest of technologies to the largest and most complex of human-made creations. NIST has released many special publications and Internal or Interagency Reports over the years that supported all aspects of our industries. Please visit our NIST pages to learn more how NIST recognizes the SSH keys access gap and what recommendations are suggested to minimize risks to your production environments. Of particular importance are [NIST SP 800-53](/compliance/nist-800-53/), the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](/compliance/cybersecurity-framework/), and [NIST IR 7966 - guidelines on SSH access management](/compliance/nist-7966/).

**Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)** an Act to establish a corporation to be known as the MAS, to provide for the exercise of control over and the resolution of financial institutions and their related entities by the MAS and other authorities, and to establish a framework for the issue of securities by the MAS and the regulation of primary dealers of such securities, and for matters incidental thereto and connected therewith.

Our Compliance Goal

At SSH Communications Security we continue to evaluate the above mentioned frameworks, review current vulnerabilities and threats to confidential and sensitive information and assess risks associated with access to **protected data**. We label what is important as **Protected Data** which encompasses ePHI, Credit Card Data, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and much more. Our sole purpose is to ensure access to protected data is authorized and approved. We support the security principle of least or minimal privileges which requires that access to information is only granted as necessary and required for its legitimate purpose.

Secure access solutions are a critical component to privileged access and identity access management programs. We continue to evangelize the fact that excluding SSH keys access from security assessments, compliance assessments and audits will only open the door to potential audit exceptions and security breaches. As you navigate our website, you will learn about our solutions and will further understand the need to address SSH keys access today.

SSH Keys for Compliance, Regulations, Audit
===========================================

Organizations in regulated markets and industries (finance, banking, energy, healthcare) continue to face major regulations, standards & laws that impact their operations. These regulations cover all aspects of the organizations' operations, and exert their influence also over the trusted access to IT resources. Many customers of SSH Communications Security are driven by the compliance mandates that these regulations put forth. Our [SSH key management](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager) offering addresses these compliance requirements.

This page presents a summary of a few regulatory directives that compliance, risk and audit professionals struggle to keep up with and satisfy their requirements:

The Basel accords comprise a set of international standards for the capital reserves banks must maintain in order to weather the potential consequences of financial and operational risks. The Basel committee determined that IT governance, risk and compliance (GRC) plays a crucial role in determining risk adjusted capital reserve requirements.

Secure Shell plays a vital role in IT operations. In the highly automated data centers of today, Secure Shell also enables automated data transfers, backups, cloud provisioning, log management, system health monitoring and so on. The Basel mandates contain objectives for IT security that include requirements that pertain to Secure Shell.

/. 020 [Basel III](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/basel-iii)
=========================================================

Basel III Summary and SSH Key Based Authentication
==================================================

The Basel accords (known as Basel I, Basel II, and Basel III) comprise a set of international standards that the capital reserves banks must maintain in order to weather the potential consequences of financial and operational risks. Given that banking operations are highly IT intensive, the Basel committee determined that IT governance, risk and compliance (GRC) must play a role in determining risk adjusted capital reserve requirements.

Basel III uses a "three pillars" concept:

1.  minimum capital requirements (addressing risk)
    
2.  supervisory review
    
3.  market discipline.
    

All three pillars are underpinned by and pose requirements on the IT systems.

Basel III IT Operational Controls
---------------------------------

Basel III places several demands on IT. The first and foremost is to minimise operational risk arising from the IT infrastructure and its management.

In short, a bank operating with substandard IT controls requires greater capital reserves in order to compensate for the increased operational risk. Thus, Basel II establishes incentives for banks around the world to maintain robust operational controls over their IT operations. It should be noted that Basel II does not create a new set of standards for IT operational controls. Instead, the Basel committee determined that the COBIT framework would provide the basis for these controls.

Secure Shell (SSH) Related Requirements
---------------------------------------

Because Secure Shell is pervasive in IT operations and has the potential to create great operational harm if misconfigured, the Basel II control objectives for IT security also include requirements that pertain to Secure Shell and particularly SSH key based access. Read the white paper for more details.

Comparing Basel II and III
--------------------------

Basel III is an extension of the existing Basel II Framework, and introduces new capital and liquidity standards to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and risk management of the whole of the banking and finance sector. While Basel III does not introduce any new IT-related controls or requirements as such, the increasingly stringent standards in other areas further raise the importance of sufficient IT risk control measures.

/. 021 [Fips 200](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/fips-200)
=========================================================

FIPS 200 - Minimum Security Requirements for Federal
====================================================

FIPS 200 specifies the minimum security requirements for non-military federal information systems. It implements the authority given to NIST (US National Institute of Science and Technology) by the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2014.

### Contents

* [Essence of FIPS 200 - Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems](#essence-of-fips-200---minimum-security-requirements-for-federal-information-and-information-systems) 
* [Further Information](#further-information)


The FISMA Law
-------------

The FISMA law mandated the created of federal standards for: (i) the security categorization of federal information and information systems based their risk levels in order to provide the appropriate level of security for each system; and (ii) the minimum security requirements for each such category.

FIPS 200 addresses the specification of minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems. FIPS 199 addresses the classification divides systems. It divides the systems into **high**, **moderate**, and **low** impact systems based on their impact on individuals and organizations.

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
-----------------------------------------------

The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are standards published by NIST for use by the United States federal government and government contractors in relation to computer systems. Generally compliance with the FIPS standards is mandatory, but waivers are sometimes available.

Relation to FedRAMP
-------------------

FedRAMP is a government-wide program that builds on the FIPS requirements to provide a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. The objective is to save government costs by implementing once, and then reusing the implementation and security assessments in many government agencies.

Scope of Applicability
----------------------

FIPS 200 generally applies to all Federal Government information and information systems, except national security systems and certain classified information.

Essence of FIPS 200 - Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIPS 200 itself is very brief. It basically says that there are 17 security-related areas where federal agencies must meet certain minimum requirements. For the actual requirements, it refers to [NIST Special Publication 800-53](/compliance/nist-800-53) and says that federal agencies must meet its requirements.

The seventeen areas are:

*   Access Control
    
*   Awareness and Training
    
*   Audit and Accountability
    
*   Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments
    
*   Configuration Management
    
*   Contingency Planning
    
*   Identification and Authentication
    
*   Incident Response
    
*   Maintenance
    
*   Media Protection
    
*   Physical and Environmental Protection
    
*   Planning
    
*   Personnel Security
    
*   Risk Assessment
    
*   System and Services Acquisition
    
*   System and Communications Protection
    
*   System and Information Integrity

=========================================================

GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) introduction
======================================================

EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a far-reaching privacy regulation in the European Union. It covers personal information and activities taking place within the European Union even when the party processing the personal information is not in the EU. GDPR is a law established at the European Union level and comes with hefty penalties. It is automatically in force in all EU countries and will start being enforced on May 25, 2018.

The definition of personal information in the legislation is extremely broad. It basically covers any information that has been or can be associated with a particular natural person.

HIPAA Security Rule - Summary, Guidance, Risks
==============================================

The US government has started to crack down on health care providers who have failed to implement controls required by the HIPAA Security Rule. The fines alone can be millions of dollars and resulting security breaches can expose organizations to substantial civil liability, loss of reputation, higher credit card processing margins, substantial penalties (even personal criminal and civil liability).

Overview of the HIPAA Security Rule and SSH Keys
------------------------------------------------

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ([HIPAA](http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations)), was enacted by the United States Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996. The major objectives of the law were to:

1.  Ensure that individuals were able to maintain health insurance between jobs.
    
2.  Ensure the security and confidentiality of patient information/data.
    

[HIPAA Security Rule](http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security) establishes a national set of security standards for protecting health information in electronic form. The standards operationalize the protections contained in the Privacy Rule by addressing the technical and non-technical safeguards that _covered entities_ must put in place to secure individuals’ Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

Protecting ePHI starts from **controlling who is able to access that data**. This requires [identity and access management](/iam/identity-management), including [management of SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management/). [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) often grant access to privileged accounts and databases. In many organizations their number far surpasses traditional user names and passwords.

SSH in Healthcare IT
--------------------

Large-scale health care environments employ considerable numbers of servers, routers, switches, database and application servers, and other networked systems. These systems are maintained and administered with the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) that provides secure administrative login, application tunneling, and secure file transfer. The SSH protocol is a standard component of every server and networked device. All [UNIX, Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X), and [mainframe](/products/tectia-ssh-zOS) systems include SSH. It is also widely used on Windows computers and servers. In 2015, Microsoft announced [plans](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2015/06/03/looking-forward-microsoft-support-for-secure-shell-ssh/) to make it a standard component of Windows.

Enforcement of the Security Rule
--------------------------------

Organizations across all industries, independent of what regulations and standards they must comply with, are faced with the ongoing challenge of ensuring authorized and trusted access to protected health information. The security rule, enforced by the [Office for Civil Rights](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/) (OCR) and [Health and Human Services](http://www.hhs.gov/) (HHS), is leading the pack in that realm as far as audit activities within the health industry.

[SSH Communication Security](/) solutions enable the key controls required to ensure [logical access](/iam/identity-management), privileged access, and third party access are effective. These controls are a major component of HIPAA Security Rule and the HHS/OCR audit guidance issued earlier in 2016.

Compliance In the Spotlight
---------------------------

With the ongoing audits conducted by HHS/OCR under the HIPAA security rules, organizations are scrambling to ensure ongoing compliance. As with any government audit, the outcome of non-compliance comes with a hefty price.

The OCR is working on selecting approximately 350 covered entities, including 232 health care providers, 109 health plans and 9 health care clearinghouses, for Phase 2 Audits. OCR’s ambitious plan appears to include more organizations and audit each one less. This would appear to be in favor of the auditees, but may turn out the opposite since each audit will focus on prior audit phase findings. The audit criteria will include:

*   Risk analysis and risk management
    
*   Content and timeliness of breach notifications
    
*   Notice of privacy practices
    
*   Individual access
    
*   Privacy Standards’ reasonable safeguards requirement
    
*   Training to policies and procedures
    
*   Device and media controls
    
*   Transmission security.
    

Additionally, healthcare industry security breach and [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware) incidents continue to flood the news. A recent story for a hospital in Kentucky that had its [records scrambled by ransomware](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/your_money_or_your_life_another_hospital_goes_down_to_ransomware). These attacks aim purely to financial gain. Victim organizations have been paying the demanded ransom in order to get back into normal operations.

Ramifications of Non-compliance
-------------------------------

Health organizations which have experienced a breach or had a non-compliance violation resulting from an audit, face a long way to recovery. The table below highlights the types of violations and associated penalties:

Violation

Minimum Penalty

Maximum Penalty

Individual did not know (and by exercising reasonable diligence would not have known) that he/she violated HIPAA

$100 per violation, with an annual maximum of $25,000 for repeat violations (Note: maximum that can be imposed by State Attorneys General regardless of the type of violation)

$50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum of $1.5 million

violation due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect

$1,000 per violation, with an annual maximum of $100,000 for repeat violations

$50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum of $1.5 million

violation due to willful neglect but violation is corrected within the required time period

$10,000 per violation, with an annual maximum of $250,000 for repeat violations

$50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum of $1.5 million

violation is due to willful neglect and is not corrected

$50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum of $1.5 million

$50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum of $1.5 million

Additionally, organizations experiencing a breach of 500 records or more are listed on the HHS/OCR breach portal. This site is also known as the [Wall of Shame](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf).

HIPAA Regulations and SSH Mapping Guidance
------------------------------------------

HIPAA requires organizations implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations. SSH communication solutions help identify all the components’ activities including all the hardware and software that used to collect, store, and process ePHI. In this process, a scan of SSH authorized keys can also be proceeded to confirm deployment.

Implementing proper policies for [defining roles and granting access](/iam/identity-management) is critical for compliance with the law. All methods must be considered, including those using key-based credentials.

The following table highlights the key requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule and how we can help pave the way to compliance.

Regulation

Mapping to SSH Solution

**Workforce Security (§ 164.308(a)(3))**: Implement policies and procedures to ensure that all members of its workforce have appropriate access to electronic protected health information.

The requirement of **segregation of duties** applies to any kind of access, including [access using SSH keys](/iam/identity-management). We frequently see key-based access from test and development systems into production, which violates segregation of duties.

**Information Access Management (§ 164.308(a)(4))**: Implement policies and procedures for authorizing access to electronic protected health information.

Implement [identity and access](/iam/identity-management) management. [Assess](/products/ssh-risk-assessment/) and [manage](/iam/ssh-key-management/) SSH key based access. Ensure that [tunneled access from the public Internet to intranet](/ssh/tunneling/) is not possible.

**Access Control (§ 164.312(a)(1))**: Implement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain electronic protected health information to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights.

[Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) and [CryptoAuditor](/products/cryptoauditor/) Care critical components of your access controls. Adopting best practices and employing leading implementations provide you with complete control as well as a view into the access management in your production environment.

**Audit Controls (§ 164.312(b))**: Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information.

Hardened SSH key deployments with best practice configurations for your defined scope of ePHI environments will support the desired access controls required to comply with this requirement.

**Transmission Security (§ 164.312(e)(1))**: Implement technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to electronic protected health information that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network.

The [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) 1) encrypts traffic between two end points, providing confidentiality and integrity in transit; 2) secures the transmission of files with [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/); and 3) prevents [man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle).

What Should Healthcare Organizations Do?
----------------------------------------

Assess your HIPAA compliance program. Does it sufficiently address [SSH](/ssh/) and [SSH keys](/ssh/key/)? Be ready for when the OCR comes knocking. Make sure to implement security measures beyond what the law states since ePHI has become the hottest item in cybercrime.

Boost staff members security awareness to prevent and detect breaches. Invest in security tools that help you reduce and even eliminate the risk of ePHI being compromised.

Expand your compliance program to include on-premise networks, off-shore systems, mobile devices, and \]cloud installations\](/devops/).

* [Other sources of information](#other-sources-of-information)

Background
----------

ISACA and SSH Communications Security have partnered in an effort to bring visibility to an unknown access gap - [SSH keys](/ssh/key). Contributions for the guidance have come directly from practitioners, industry experts and SSH Communications Security to help the audit community be able to identify potential risks and then how to take action to address assurance considerations. The collective compliance and audit community have been able to leverage best practices in order to deliver a new guidance titled “SSH: Practitioner Considerations.”

SSH keys are everywhere in enterprises and they aren’t just an IT issue. Many organizations are unknowingly putting themselves at risk of not properly managing SSH keys and when combined with new compliance regulations such as [GDPR](/compliance/eu-gdpr/) the risks can easily be compounded.

Overview
--------

Given the fact that organizations have their own unique infrastructure, SSH keys remains the common technology deployed across all regardless of industry or geography. As a result of years of unmanaged deployments, out of the box enabled access and proliferating from one infrastructure component to the next, it is now more critical than ever to bring awareness to SSH keys.

The guidance is designed to help bring about awareness and instructs auditors, practitioners, risk assessors and governance professionals to include SSH keys in their risk plans, audit plans and ongoing governance activities.

How the guidance can assist audit engagements
---------------------------------------------

The guidance is a tool for audit and compliance professionals and it provides clear direction on why and how SSH keys need to be part of their compliance, audit and governance assessments. The document highlights, from an assurance point of view, the need to assess SSH keys and usage, associated privileged identity, complete logging and compliance. It also suggests controls, configuration options and other techniques to ensure robust and compliant management of SSH keys with actions to consider for the following:

1.  Usage procedures: Implement access periodic reviews, document and disseminate security policies and standards and implement required IT controls.
    
2.  Configuration Management: Create and Implement hardening configuration, periodically review the configuration, consider automated tools to manage configuration and apply integrity control checks and monitoring over critical files.
    
3.  Ownership and accountability: Who owns SSH key management? Defined roles and responsibilities.
    
4.  Deployment: Automation is critical for the success of SSH key deployments, standardization is required and access restrictions are required.
    
5.  Provisioning: Inventory of keys, usage tracking and make part of the overall provisioning of users and accounts.
    
6.  Governance: SSH keys are part of the overarching risk assessment process and part of IT audit plans.
    

Conclusion
----------

The use of SSH keys is everywhere! It is a critical component but it is often overlooked and has created an “Unknown Access Gap”. SSH Communications Security is uniquely positioned to be able to address a potential customer’s compliance and security needs for SSH keys with our proven solutions.

=========================================================

ISO 27001 Summary for the Practitioner - How to Comply
======================================================

ISO 27001 is a standards for cybersecurity management. It is widelty used and relied upon in the financial industry and other industries for structuring their internal processes. It is also widely used for assessing the cybersecurity capabilities of vendors.

### Contents

* [What is the ISO/IEC 27001 standard](#what-is-the-iso/iec-27001-standard) 
* [ISO/IEC 27001 and SSH](#iso/iec-27001-and-ssh) 
* [ISO/IEC 27001 controls and SSH guidance](#iso/iec-27001-controls-and-ssh-guidance) 
* [What organizations need to do next?](#what-organizations-need-to-do-next?)

What is the ISO/IEC 27001 standard
----------------------------------

The International Standard for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of international standards through technical committees. The ISO/IEC 27001 was prepared by Join Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information Technology, Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.

ISO/IEC 27001 standard has been prepared to provide a model for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). The design and implementation of an organization’s ISMS is influenced by their needs, objectives and security requirements.

The information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed.

Lastly, the standard adopts the “Plan-Do-Check-Act” (PDCA) model which is applied to structure all ISMS processes:

*   **Plan**: basically establish the ISMS policies and objectives relevant to managing risk;
    
*   **Do**: implement and operate the ISMS policy;
    
*   **Check**: assess and measure process performance against policy;
    
*   **Act**: take corrective and preventative actions based on results of internal ISMS audit.
    

ISO/IEC 27001 and SSH
---------------------

The requirements within ISO/IEC 27001 are generic and intended to be applicable to all organizations, regardless of type, size and nature. The standard promotes the definition or risk assessment approach that allows organizations to identify, analyze and treat security risks.

Unauthorized access to protected information is a key risk that needs to be continually addressed. ISO/IES 27001 controls clearly spells out the need to define roles and responsibilities, ensure authorized access and monitor all access on a regular basis. Given the fact that the SSH protocol comes bundled with all production components, has been propagating over the years without visibility and poorly (if at all) managed as part of the provisioning or governance processes makes it a critical access gap that must be addressed as organizations seek ISO/IEC 27001 certification.

ISO/IEC 27001 controls and SSH guidance
---------------------------------------

The ISO/IEC 27001 framework paves the way for organizations to establishing a security program from inception, to leadership, to evaluation and continuous improvement and auditing. Organizations seeking the ISO/IEC 27001 certification typically undergo a rigorous sequence of events in an effort to ensure a solid ISMS spanning the entire organization.

As with any framework, organizations must adhere to a mandatory list of requirements that are tested and audited regularly. Below is a sampled list of few key controls and how SSH communications security solutions help ensure compliance:

Control description

SSH Guidance

**A.6.1.2** Segregation of duties: Conflicting duties and areas of responsibilities shall be segregated to reduce opportunities for unauthorized or unintentional modification or misuse of the organization’s assets.

Properly configured and deployed Our products will further enhance your logical access controls. It can support your defined roles and responsibilities and only grant access based on approved roles.

**A.9.1.2** Access to networks and network services: controls should be in place to ensure users only have access to the network resources they have been specially authorized to use.

Our products help identify connections from unknown sources and alert on any changes to configurations or SSH keys. It also provides monitoring and logging capabilities in combination with a DLP solution to detect and automatically terminate any unauthorized sessions.

**A.9.2.3** Management of privileged access rights: The allocation and use of privileged access rights shall be restricted and controlled.

Our products are critical in supporting privileged access controls. They support three basic principles of privileged access: Approval, logging and monitoring and the post activity reviews.

**A.9.1.1** Review of user access rights: a process to review access rights to their assets on a regular basis.

Our products support the activity review process and the basic principles of approval, logging, monitoring, and post activity reviews.

**A.9.2.6** The access rights of all employees and external party users to information and information processing facilities shall be removed upon termination of their employment, contract or agreement.

Properly configured and deployed Our products will further enhance your logical access controls. They support your defined roles and responsibilities and only add, change and remove access based on approved requests.

What organizations need to do next?
-----------------------------------

Organizations seeking ISO/IEC 27001 certification must adhere to key requirements and undergo audits on a regular basis. These mandatory requirements vary from ISMS scope definition, security policy definition, risk assessment process, risk assessment treatment, evidence of competence, evidence of monitoring, evidence of audits, and many more. The one common theme to many of these mandatory requirements is “trusted access.” As organizations learn more about the hidden credentials – SSH keys – the more they realize the critical need to manage this elevated type of access.

Encrypted and unmanaged privileged access is a security risk that no organization should face. Organizations that want to ensure compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 access controls, took the initiative to start identifying where are these SSH keys granting that are access to their production environment. As with any access provisioning or governance processes, access must be locked down, adjusted per roles and responsibilities and monitored for ongoing compliance. SSH Communications Security offers solutions and services that ensures compliance with the stated controls. They provide the assurance that all SSH keys access is accounted for, monitored and audited.


/. 027 [NIS Directive](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/nis-directive)
=========================================================

An Overview of the NIS Directive
================================

_Businesses with operational tech (OT) environments, especially those within the EU, must understand and comply with the NIS Directive. Here’s a comprehensive overview — and an outline of how organizations can ensure compliance._

NOTE: The NIS Directive is going to be replaced by the NIS2 Directive. [Learn more about NIS2 here.](/academy/compliance/nis2-directive)

When it comes to operational technology (OT), compliance is critical. Many regulations, rules, and directives have recently been formed — especially in the EU — in order to promote the secure sharing, storage, and management of sensitive data.

The Directive on Security of Network and Information System, known as the NIS Directive, was the first cybersecurity legislation passed by the EU in 2016. The NIS Directive aims to widely establish shared NIS security standards and practices across the EU.

The NIS Directive instructs member states to implement laws that follow the “spirit” of the Directive. For this reason, it is of the utmost importance that organizations fully comprehend the NIS Directive, its objectives, and how to meet all compliance requirements that apply to them.

This article will discuss the purpose of the NIS Directive, to whom it applies, and how organizations can execute effective and enduring compliance. We will also cover the difference between the NIS and the GDPR, a well-known cybersecurity regulation for EU data, and address the unique significance of the NIS Directive.

What is the NIS Directive?
--------------------------

The NIS Directive establishes specific security technical practices, measures, and requirements for companies in EU member states. These rules apply to the operators of essential enterprise services (OES) and digital service providers (DSPs) of EU data. The [NIS Directive](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-digital-service-providers-nis-directive) classifies a digital service as “any service normally provided \[…\] by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient.”

The aim of the NIS Directive is to promote more robust, reliable cybersecurity between European nations. In the not-so-distant past, EU member states handled cybersecurity challenges at the national level, which created weak links between international digital networks. By supporting secure cross-border communications, the NIS Directive encourages safe and seamless proprietary collaboration between enterprises across the EU.

In addition to guiding individuals towards better cybersecurity practices, the NIS Directive encourages “effective, proportionate, and dissuasive” penalties for non-compliance. However, each member state must decide and enforce NIS penalties within its own nation.

EU member states must also possess a national framework that meets the Directive and monitors cybersecurity incidents. However, DSPs who must adhere to the NIS Directive require less rigid frameworks than operators of essential services.

Who are the Operators of Essential Services (OES)?
--------------------------------------------------

The NIS Directive does not directly define which organizations are to be regarded as OES. However, it includes a set of criteria for member states to identify which enterprises fall under the purview of the directive as OES.

According to Article 5(2), the criteria for the identification of the operators of essential services are as follows:

*   The entity provides a service that is essential for the maintenance of critical societal and/or economic activities.
*   The provision of that service depends on network and information systems.
*   An incident would have significant disruptive effects on the provision of that service.

Furthermore, Article 4(4) of the NIS Directive states that an OES is a “public or private entity of a type referred to in Annex II” meeting the criteria above. Examples include:

*   Energy
*   Electricity, oil, and gas
*   Transport: air, rail water, and road
*   Drinking water supply and distribution

When you add the manufacturing industry into the mix, you can see that operational technology is strongly covered by the NIS Directive.

Who does the NIS Directive apply to?
------------------------------------

The NIS Directive applies to all companies within the 27 EU member states, as well as any enterprise outside of the EU that leverages services available to individuals within the European Union.

Non-EU companies that must comply with the NIS Directive must assign an EU-based representative who can act on their behalf to ensure appropriate implementation of the Directive.

Incidents the NIS Directive is intended to prevent
--------------------------------------------------

The NIS Directive is intended to prevent many different types of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and related attacks, including but not limited to:

*   **Ransomware.** When ransomware finds its way into an enterprise system, it can quickly jump from network to network. Take the WannaCry virus, which exposed a specific vulnerability in Microsoft Windows that spread through the internet. This ransomware afflicted more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, ultimately costing up to £6 billion globally.
    
*   **Cyberattack side effects.** When malicious software weaves its way into international enterprise networks, issues unrelated to cybersecurity arise. For example, infrastructure crashes and transport paralysis can lead to delayed operations and roadblocked or compromised communication. These problems can spiral into even more drastic consequences, all of which occur alongside the damage associated with the data compromise.
    
*   **New-wave cyberattacks.** Hackers are getting smarter every year, and the NIS Directive accounts for this by ensuring NIS practices are designed to prevent new and emerging forms of cyberattack. For instance, the infamous NotPetya malware used a non-authentic decryption-for-payment approach that resulted in a complete lack of decryption keys. NotPetya attacked the websites of Ukrainian organizations, including banks, newspapers, ministries, and electricity firms. Similar infections were reported across Germany, France, Italy, the United States, and other countries. This is just one example of the new, malicious cryptography emerging today. NotPetya also caused a power surge that left 75,000 people stranded and cost roughly £100 million.
    

Penalties for failing to comply with the NIS Directive
------------------------------------------------------

Instead of enforcing specific penalties, the NIS Directive gives individual EU member states the right to determine distinct non-compliance penalties. However, NIS clearly explains that these penalties should be “effective, proportionate, and dissuasive” — that is, they be appropriate to the nature of the non-compliance and prevent repeat charges.

NIS fines can reach up to £17 million. In addition to imposing financial penalties, the NIS Directive can:

*   Conduct assessment inspections of NIS obligations
*   Demand information notices that provide proof of NIS compliance
*   Impart enforcement notices telling organizations how to fix identified NIS failures

Organizations need to know that _they can be penalized more than once_ under the NIS Directive. That means businesses can be fined and punished for every separate NIS violation under each aspect of the legislation.

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a document that seeks to promote the privacy, security, and management of personal data in the EU. GDPR defines personal data as any information that could directly or indirectly be linked back to a person and used to identify them. Personal data includes names, email addresses, locations, and web cookies.

Like the NIS Directive, GDPR laws apply to any organization that provides services to and collects data associated with residents of the European Union — even if the organization is outside of the EU itself. But the key difference between GDPR and the NIS Directive is what they pertain to. The NIS Directive aims to secure network and information systems, as well as their digital data; it covers personal data, enterprise data, and other critical information. Meanwhile, GDPR only applies to information that malicious actors could use to identify individuals.

Other differences between GDPR and the NIS Directive include the following:

1.  The NIS Directive does not apply to operators of essential services (OES) or relevant digital service providers (RDSPs) — instead, these enterprises must follow GDPR security requirements.
    
2.  By default, “digital data” does not include manual data — meaning the NIS Directive does not cover manual data. GDPR, on the other hand, covers data forms that are involved in filing systems.
    
3.  As Dennis ’t Jong, specialist inspector at the Dutch Telecom Agency, put it: “GDPR is aimed at protecting the privacy of citizens, and the NIS at protecting the cyber resilience of organizations.”
    

Best practices for NIS Directive compliance
-------------------------------------------

In order to follow best practices for the NIS Directive, organizations should adhere to the four objectives and 14 principles of NIS compliance laid out by the Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF). The CAF was released in 2018 by the UK’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) and highlights ways for organizations to ensure NIS compliance.

The four objectives, and their corresponding principles, of the CAF are as follows:

### _Managing_ _Security_ _Risk_

The four principles within this objective help organizations employ the appropriate policies, structures, and processes for systematically assessing and understanding NIS security risks.

1.  **Governance:** Putting processes and policies in place for properly conducted, controlled NIS security.
2.  **Risk management:** Identifying, assessing, and understanding present security risks, and establishing a steady risk management approach within an organization.
3.  **Asset management:** Determining all systems and services that support essential functions.
4.  **Supply chain:** Recognizing NIS security risks resulting from external suppliers.

### _Protecting Against Cyberattack_

The six principles within this objective help organizations leverage suitable security measures around critical structures for protection against cyberattacks.

1.  **Service protection and policies:** Denoting appropriate processes and procedures for securing essential systems and data.
    
2.  **Identity and access control:** Comprehending, documenting, and controlling access to NIS properties that support essential functions.
    
3.  **Data security:** Preventing harm from coming to electronically transmitted and stored data, which could lead to adverse impacts.
    
4.  **System security:** Protecting critical NIS and other technology from cyberattacks.
    
5.  **Resilient networks and systems:** Fostering resilience against cyberattacks.
    
6.  **Staff awareness and training:** Ensuring training helps staff make positive contributions to NIS cybersecurity.
    

### _Detecting Cybersecurity Events_

The two principles within this objective help organizations form security defenses that can properly, consistently, and rapidly detect cybersecurity incidents without negatively impacting essential operations.

1.  **Security monitoring:** Detecting potential cybersecurity issues and tracking the effectiveness of existing measures.
    
2.  **Proactive security event discovery:** Spotting anomalous, irregular, and unexplained NIS events.
    

### _Minimizing the Impact of Cyber Security Incidents_

The two principles within this objective help organizations shrink the extended impact of a cybersecurity event and restore critical functions when necessary.

1.  **Response and recovery planning:** Ensuring incident management and mitigation best practices are in place.
    
2.  **Lessons learned:** Taking past incidents and implementing lessons learned from these experiences, for improved resilience of essential NIS functions.
    

Secure remote OT and access governance in the spotlight
-------------------------------------------------------

Reading through all the above requirements is a hefty task, and that’s without attempting to implement all the required security measures in critical infrastructures.

But there are some fundamentals every serious company in the industrial automation business should take action on.

Article 4(7) describes an incident as “any event having an actual adverse effect on the security of network and information systems.” The term ‘security of network and information systems’ is then described under Article 4(2) as “the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level of confidence, any actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored or processed data or the related services offered by, or accessible via, those network and information systems.”

The above is an important point. It places special emphasis on how secure remote OT access to data and systems is being managed and how well the credentials that grant such access are being controlled.

We believe all OT businesses should be able to answer the following five questions.

*   What are my critical data and systems?
    
*   Where are my critical data and systems?
    
*   Who can access them?
    
*   Where are my keys and passwords?
    
*   Is my OT security future-proof?
    

If a company can give a sensible answer to all of the five questions above, their OT cybersecurity foundation is already in really good shape.

More OT regulations: ISA/IEC 62443 and NIST 800-82
--------------------------------------------------

ISA/IEC 62443 is the global standard for the security of Industrial Control System (ICS) networks that help organizations maintain a high-security posture and mitigate the risk of ICS networks being victim to cyber-attacks.

NIST 800-82, Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security, provides guidelines on how to protect ICS, including Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Distributed Control Systems (DCS), and other control system configurations such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC).

ISA/IEC 62443, NIST 800-82, and NIS 2.0 all put special emphasis on OT security, system and data access, and credentials management.

/. 028 [A Guide to NIS2 Directive](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/nis2-directive)
=========================================================

A Guide to the NIS2 Directive
=============================

The [Network and Information Security (NIS) directive](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/nis-directive) has existed since 2016, when it was established as the first comprehensive cybersecurity directive of the European Union. Since its debut, there have been plenty of changes to the world of IT security — and NIS compliance needs to reflect the new challenges of today’s cybersecurity landscape.

To accommodate rapidly evolving cyber threats, the EU announced a NIS2 directive proposal in 2022. NIS2 aims to build on the requirements of NIS, broadening the scope of the original cybersecurity directive. By covering additional services, increasing reporting requirements, and strengthening other areas of cybersecurity, NIS2 is the EU’s answer to cybersecurity in post-COVID-19 Europe.

Let’s take a closer look at the EU NIS2 directive — and how organizations can comply with the updated EU regulations.

**Contents**

[Meeting NIS 2.0 Head-On with Solutions from SSH Communications Security](#meeting-nis2-headon-with-ssh)
What is the NIS2?
-----------------

The NIS2 aims to make the cybersecurity of EU states stronger and more uniform, with requirements for compliance beginning in 2024. Under the new NIS2 directive proposal, a wide range of new organizations will now need to take steps to ensure compliance — expanding on the number of organizations that were subject to the requirements in the original NIS compliance directive of 2016.  
  
According to the NIS2 directive proposal, any organizations that provide an “essential function” will require NIS2 compliance. This is because the primary objective of the NIS2 directive is to better protect organizations that are critical to economic and social development in the EU. By safeguarding themselves against cyber attacks, organizations (both businesses and non-profit institutions) can mitigate the risk of data compromise, which can threaten security, cost money, and damage trust.

Does the NIS2 Affect Your Organization?
---------------------------------------

Understanding the requirements of the NIS2 directive is important for any essential organization in the European Union — whether you’re a government organization or non-profit. Even certain businesses must comply with NIS2 guidelines.

If your organization is a party to [existing NIS compliance requirements](/academy/compliance/nis-directive), then it will continue to abide by NIS2 compliance. The original NIS directive established a significant range of organizations that were considered “essential”.

These core industries are called ‘Sectors of high criticality’ and include:

*   Banking (and other financial institutions)
*   Health and healthcare (including pharmaceuticals, medical devices and research)
*   Transportation
    *   Air
    *   Rail
    *   Water
    *   Road
*   Energy
    *   Electricity
    *   District heating and cooling
    *   Oil
    *   Gas
    *   Hydrogen
*   Water suppliers
    *   Drinking water
    *   Waste water
*   Digital service providers
    *   Providers of online marketplaces
    *   Providers of online search engines
    *   Providers of social networking services platforms
*   ICT service management (business-to-business)
    *   Managed service providers
    *   Managed security service providers
*   Digital infrastructure
    *   Internet Exchange Point providers
    *   DNS service providers, excluding operators of root name servers
    *   TLD name registries
    *   Cloud computing service providers
    *   Data centre service providers
    *   Content delivery network providers
    *   Trust service providers
    *   Providers of public electronic communications networks
    *   Providers of publicly available electronic communications services
*   Public administration (central and regional)
*   Space

In addition to these original organizations, the NIS2 directive adds new organizations under its umbrella of “essential services”. These are called ‘other critical sectors’ and include, but are not limited to:

*   Production, processing and distribution of food
*   Manufacturers of critical products

*   Manufacture of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices
*   Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products
*   Manufacture of electrical equipment
*   Manufacture of machinery and equipment
*   Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers
*   Manufacture of transport equipment
*   pharmaceuticals and healthcare equipment)

*   Food manufacturers
*   Postal and courier services
*   Waste management
*   Public electronic communications providers
*   Social networking sites (and other data center services)
*   Research

Regardless of where in the EU an organization is located, the NIS2 directive requires security compliance to avoid retributive fees. It’s important to note that even some organizations outside the EU must comply with the NIS2 directive if they provide essential services for an EU member state.

Whether your organization is already meeting the demands of the original NIS, or is brand new to NIS compliance, it’s important to understand how NIS2 works, why it was developed, and how to comply.

  

Why Was NIS2 Developed?
------------------------

Although NIS has been an effective tool in protecting EU critical infrastructure, several areas of weakness have become known in the past few years. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that the EU needs to set stricter security standards in a work environment that is increasingly remote and digitalized.

In short, the NIS2 was developed to reduce the risk of cyberattacks by addressing some of the gaps in the original NIS protocol. More specifically, the NIS2 was designed to:

*   **Improve preparedness for collective cyber threats in the EU.** When essential organizations operate with sufficient cybersecurity protections, everybody benefits. In an increasingly interconnected EU, NIS2 aims to increase joint situational awareness among essential organizations. With collective preparedness, organizations can quickly communicate with each other and identify threats before they can expand to other victims. Additionally, the NIS2 includes a joint response protocol in case of a major multi-faceted cyberattack.

*   **Increase resilience against cyberattacks.** Resilience against cyber attacks is as important as defense. When a cyberattack occurs, the affected organization must resume essential services as quickly and securely as possible. The NIS2 directive outlines increased measures for resilience against cyberattacks, to minimize vulnerabilities and improve cyber defense.

*   **Establish streamlined resilience standards with stricter penalties.** The third and final core objective of the NIS2 directive is to streamline resilience to cyberattacks. Regardless of the type of organization, every essential service must possess the same capabilities to defend itself against threats. The original NIS directive allowed for flexibility with many of its resilience requirements, which created vulnerabilities — especially in smaller businesses. The new NIS2 directive outlines stricter penalties and tougher security measures to reduce these inconsistencies.

What’s Changing in NIS2?
-------------------------

As the NIS2 becomes the new standard, it’s important for all essential organizations to understand what’s changing. Some of the most notable changes included in the NIS2 directive include:

*   **Expanding the range of essential services.** With an expanded range of essential services, the NIS2 directive operates on a scale much larger than its predecessor. As organizations become increasingly interconnected, NIS2 essential services also operate across a wider range of industries. From food and water production to postal services and aerospace technology, previously underregulated organizations must now comply with NIS2.

*   **Essential entities are regularly assessed** for their security posture, important entities most likely only after a significant threat or incident occurred
*   **Staff headcount and financial ceilings determining enterprise categories.** NIS2 appliest to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well, in addition to those that are larger. A company is considered an SME if it employs more than 50 but fewer than 250 persons and it has an annual turnover exceeding EUR 10 million but not exceeding EUR 50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total exceeding EUR 10 million but not exceeding EUR 43 million.
*   **Subcontractors**, the supply chain, consultants managed service (security) providers along with their software and libraries are now part of the scope

*   **The end of OESes.** An [OES is a category of essential service](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/pass-audits) unique to France. OESes are organizations that must be protected from cyber threats due to their significant impact on the functioning of France’s economy, society, or defense. With the NIS2 directive, OESes are eliminated as a category — instead, more uniform categories are announced. Across EU countries, essential entities (EEs) will be distinguished from important entities (IEs) to establish their level of security requirements.

*   **Greater incident response obligations.** With the NIS2 directive, managers for essential organizations are given more responsibility in complying with NIS2 requirements. Instead of delegating all responsibility to an IT team, senior management must proactively oversee compliance with NIS2 regulations. The NIS2 has also changed other details of its incident response protocol — including a shortened window for notifying the necessary parties of disruptions and greater transparency in alerting users to cyber threats.

*   **Stricter fines and penalties.** Cybersecurity is of vital importance to the functioning of a cohesive EU economy. To increase compliance with these critical directives, NIS2 outlines stricter fines and penalties for noncompliance. More severe fines for high-level management offer an evidence-based way to improve compliance and resilience.

*   **Encouragement to share** threat and vulnerability intelligence and use knowledge and experience to enhance capabilities to assess, monitor, defend and respond to cyber threats between organizations.

Adoption Timeline for NIS2 and Next Steps
-----------------------------------------

For organizations currently under NIS compliance, security spending is projected to increase under NIS2. For organizations that aren’t currently under the supervision of NIS, the percentage of security spending is expected to increase even more.

Implementation of NIS2 is not yet official in the European Union. In early 2022, the provisional text of the NIS2 directive was written and agreed upon by EU member states. On November 15, 2022, the NIS2 directive was adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council. It is unlikely that EU states will adopt NIS2 into law until 2024. This gives organizations some control over their adoption timeline — and allows them to budget for increased cybersecurity spending.

However, given the changes that need to be made in many organizations to meet these new NIS2 requirements, it is crucial that you begin the transition toward compliance sooner rather than later.

/. 029 [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/cybersecurity-framework)
=========================================================

NIST Cybersecurity Framework - Summary & Guidance
=================================================

The [NIST](https://www.nist.gov) Cybersecurity Framework is US Government guidance for private sector organizations that own, operate, or supply critical infrastructure. It provides a reasonable base level of cyber security. It establishes basic processes and essential controls for cybersecurity.

* [US federal agencies](#us-federal-agencies) 
* [Additional information](#additional-information)

Overview of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
--------------------------------------------

From process view, cybersecurity starts from understanding the organization, its mission, its risk tolerance. Part of this is understanding the organization's role in critical infrastructure. These are used to define roles, responsibilities, policies, and processes. Cybersecurity is realized as technical controls, monitoring, and planned responses. The processes are reviewed and improved based on experience.

From a technical standpoint, cybersecurity starts from [managing identities, credentials, and their privileges](/iam/identity-management) and related access.

[SSH](/ssh/) is central in cybersecurity, because it is used in every data center for managing and securing networks, hardware, virtualization, systems, and/or data transfers.

Some of the most essential controls and SSH guidance are summarized in the following table. A more detailed listing of controls can be found later on this page.

Control

Relating to

SSH Guidance

PR.AC-1

Managing identities and credentials

In addition to users and passwords, [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) are access credentials and need to be managed. Many organizations have 10x more SSH keys than traditional users and passwords, and they often grant privileged access. [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/) is an essential part of [IAM](/iam/identity-management) and risk management.

PR.AC-3

Remote access

Remote access must be properly managed and monitored. Encrypted protocols, such as [SSH](/ssh/), Remote Desktop, or HTTPS, are typically used. Access should be [monitored](/network/monitoring/) and [tunneling](/ssh/tunneling/) back into the internal network from the outside should be prevented.

PR.AC-5

Network integrity

A [firewall](/products/firewall/) should be used to protect the boundary and [back-tunneling](/ssh/tunneling/) should be prevented.

PR.DS-2

Data in transit

File transfers should use secure protocols. [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) is the secure file transfer standard supported by all major vendors. [SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) is the standard for remote system administration. [CryptoAuditor](/products/cryptoauditor/) provides auditability, analytics, and forensics capabilities for both.

PR.DS-5

Protection against data leaks

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems should be deployed. Such systems should also [monitor encrypted file transfers](/data-loss-prevention/) and terminal sessions.

PR.DS-7

Dev/test separation from production

[SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/) needed as key-based access from dev/test to prod is a common finding.

PR.IP-3

Configuration change control

[SSH keys](/ssh/key/) are part of security-related configuration, uncontrolled self-provisioning is not acceptable.

PR.MA-2

Remote maintenance

All 3rd party connections should be [monitored](/network/monitoring/) and access authorized according to process.

PR.PT-4

Communications & control networks protected

[SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) or SSL/TLS should be used to protect data transfers and control connections.

DE.CM-4

Malicious code detected

Anti-virus systems should also [inspect files inside encrypted protocols](/data-loss-prevention/) entering the organization.

The role of [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) in access management has to be emphasized. Their use has become extremely prevalent, to the degree that they now constitute over 90% of all credentials in many organizations. Proper [assessment](/products/ssh-risk-assessment/) and [management](/iam/ssh-key-management/) of SSH keys is a critical priority. SSH keys are already being exploited by [malware and hackers](/malware/).

Cybersecurity process
---------------------

The following diagram from NIST illustrates the Cybersecurity Framework process.

![Cybersecurity Framework Proces Overview](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Cybersecurity_Framework_Proces_Overview-2.png)

Detailed view of core controls
------------------------------

The framework provides core controls and processes in several areas essential to cybersecurity. It defines the five concurrent functions **Identify**, **Protect**, **Detect**, **Respond**, **Recover**. Several of these functions relate to processes and policies. The Protect function, in particular, relates to concrete protections that need to be implemented for systems and data.

Actual controls fall into a number of categories:

Category

Explanation

Asset management (ID.AM)

Inventorying of devices, systems, software platforms, applications, external information systems; mapping organizational communications and data flows; prioritization of resources; definition of cybersecurity roles and responsibilities

Business environment (ID.BE)

Why should an organization adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework?
------------------------------------------------------------------

The framework helps organizations understand, structure, manage, and reduce cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity violations can cause substantial financial losses, damage reputation, or cause outages that may permanently damage a company's market position.

The framework assists in identifying the most important activities to assure critical operations and service delivery. It helps prioritize investments and provides a common language inside and outside the organization for cybersecurity and risk management.

US government defines critical infrastructure utilities (water and energy) and also other critical sectors such as financial services, transportation, communications, healthcare, food food supply, key manufacturers, chemical facilities, dams, and emergency services.

Implementation of the framework is currently voluntary. It is based on well-known standards and practices, and represents the best current practice in cybersecurity. However, each organization and industry will have to identify their special themes and topics to pay particular attention to. Most topics, however, are common to all sectors.

Implementation tiers
--------------------

The framework defines tiers that describe the level to which the requirements are implemented. The tiers are sometimes referred to as maturity levels, but according to NIST they are more a tool for internal communication between cybersecurity risk management and operational risk management, and should not be seen as maturity level. Nevertheless, higher tiers represent higher degree of sophistication and maturity in the management of cybersecurity risks and responses.

Tier

Name

Explanation

Tier-1

Partial

Informal practices; limited awareness; no cybersecurity coordination

Tier-2

Risk Informed

Management approved processes and prioritization, but not deployed organization-wide; high-level awareness exists, adequate resources provided; informal sharing and coordination

Tier-3

Repeatable

Formal policy defines risk management practices processes, with regular reviews and updates; organization-wide approach to manage cybersecurity risk, with implemented processes; regular formalized coordination

Tier-4

Adaptive

Practices actively adapt based on lessons learned and predictive indicators; cybersecurity implemented and part of culture organization-wide; active risk management and information sharing.

Other compliance mandates
-------------------------

*   Many organizations combine Cybersecurity Framework application with COBIT.
    
*   Any organization accepting credit card payments must also comply with [PCI](/compliance/pci), either themselves or by using a payment processor that handles compliance.
    
*   All US public companies are affected by [Sarbanes-Oxley law](/compliance/sarbanes-oxley/); violations can result in criminal liability.
    
*   Energy companies are required to apply NERC CIP.
    
*   Health care and public health organization must adhere to the [HIPAA security rule](/compliance/hipaa/security-rule).
    
*   Financial institutions must consider [Basel III](/compliance/basel-iii/) and various other regulations.
    

All these regulations are fundamentally compatible with the cybersecurity framework. Some may provide additional requirements, or different emphasis, but for the most part they complement each other.

US federal agencies
-------------------

Cybersecurity requirements for US civilian agencies are set by the FISMA law and [NIST SP 800-53r4](/compliance/nist-800-53/). For military and intelligence agencies, [NSA](https://www.nsa.gov/) establishes the requirements and guidelines.

[Executive Order 13636](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity) gives Federal Departments and Agencies the responsibility to aid in improving cybersecurity for critical infrastructure.

/. 030 [NIST 7966](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/nist-7966)
=========================================================

NISTIR 7966 SSH key management requirements
===========================================

One area of the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) responsibility is the establishment of cybersecurity standards and guidelines for US Federal government agencies. The private sector must be prepared for regulatory and standards bodies to follow suit.

* On October 30th, 2015, the Computer Security Division of NIST released the final version of Interagency Report 7966 (NISTIR 7966), “Security of Interactive and Automated Access Management Using Secure Shell (SSH).” The purpose of this document is to assist organizations in understanding the basics of [SSH](/ssh/) and [SSH access management](/iam/ssh-key-management/) in an enterprise, focusing on the management of [SSH user keys](/ssh/key/). It describes the primary categories of vulnerabilities in SSH user key management and recommends practices for planning and implementing SSH access management based on (SP) 
* [800-53](/compliance/nist-800-53/) and the President’s [Cybersecurity Framework](/compliance/cybersecurity-framework/).

The use of SSH grew in a grassroots fashion from system administration, and its deployment never got much management attention or planning in most organizations. It was a standard component requiring no purchasing decision. It is the “Invisible Plumbing” that runs in nearly all systems and is most often seen as being owned by the “IT department”.

As a result, the Computer Security Division of NIST concluded that poor SSH access controls within Information Technology (IT) environments constitute a major operational and security risk that could be best addressed by publishing IR 7966.

What vulnerabilities does NIST bring forward?
---------------------------------------------

[Public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) is inherently more secure than other forms such as passwords. That is why NIST recommends public key, especially in support of process automation. Improperly managed SSH keys can be leveraged by attackers to penetrate the IT infrastructure and move freely across a network without detection. NIST has identiﬁed many categories of vulnerabilities that organizations are most often exposed to and should evaluate within the scope of their security assessments. Let’s name a few:

*   Vulnerable SSH implementation that may allow for unauthorized access to systems.
    
*   Improperly configured access controls is highly susceptible to enabling unauthorized access.
    
*   Stolen, leaked, derived, and unterminated SSH user keys.
    
*   Backdoors (unaudited user keys) can be used to create a “backdoor”.
    
*   Unintended usage of user keys for purposes for which they were not intended.
    
*   Lack of knowledge and human errors.
    

What risks do organizations face today?
---------------------------------------

Vulnerabilities of course introduce risks!! Organizations across many industries with varying regulations have excelled over the years with governing access to production systems. Unfortunately, the majority missed the hidden access - SSH keys. Production environments leverage SSH keys access across the board from local data centers, to off shore locations and of course into the cloud.

NIST did an excellent job in identifying the risks related with poorly managed SSH keys environments. To name a few:

*   Employees who may have left or transferred out of an organization may have leftover unauthorized access to production.
    
*   Lack of segregation of duties where individuals have unauthorized access to production systems.
    
*   Unneeded keys remain authorized on system.
    
*   Private keys without passphrase protection.
    
*   Keys not rotated regularly or at all. Key rotation is a basic requirement for protecting credentials.
    
*   Ineffective access controls resulting in audit findings and exceptions.
    
*   Human errors in manual key setup and removal process.
    

Why is this important?
----------------------

Controlling access to information systems is critical for information security. Access controls exist on many levels and use many technologies. The levels include physical restrictions on access to hardware; logical controls for accessing network interfaces, hardware management ports on servers, virtualization hypervisors, operating system (OS) user accounts, and information through database systems; and logical controls implemented by applications.

Considering the fact that SSH keys have been deploying to all production environments, unnoticed, unmanaged and uncontrolled just opens the door for intentional or unintentional harm. To ensure effective controls to protect what’s important, organizations cannot delay the inclusion of SSH keys access in [identity and privileged access management](/iam/identity-management) programs, provisioning programs and access governance programs.

Taking it a step further, as auditors and regulators are becoming aware of this access gap, you can be rest assured that the next audit checklist you face will include [SSH keys](/ssh/key/).

Recommendations
---------------

The new guideline NIST IR 7966 from the Computer Security Division of NIST is a direct call to action for organizations regardless of industry and is a mandate for the US Federal government. [NIST 800-53](/compliance/nist-800-53/) and associated Interagency Reports are widely accepted industry standard best practices, even for commercial entities that are not doing business with the Federal government.

NIST puts forth some excellent best practice recommendations that paves the way to better security and compliance:

*   Implement clearly defined [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/) policies and procedures.
    
*   Secure your SSH implementations
    
*   Control SSH [identities](/ssh/identity-key) and [authorized keys](/academy/ssh/authorized-key)
    
*   Establish continuous [monitoring](/network/monitoring/) and audit process
    
*   Inventory and remediate
    
*   Automate the process
    
*   Educate, Educate and Educate the masses.
    

The good news is that the initial steps in dealing with these issues are not difficult or costly. Initially organizations must find out to what extent their environments are exposed to the risks identiﬁed. Skilled personnel with the right tools can accomplish these initial steps within a matter of days.

Organizations that acquire and use [automated SSH key management products](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) should be able to significantly decrease their risks related to SSH access with a reasonable amount of effort. Without automation, most organizations will struggle to remediate the existing SSH environment and to properly secure new SSH usage.

[SSH Communications Security](/) offers training, [services](/products/services) and products that help organizations address the issues NIST has raised. Working together with your staff, we can provide a comprehensive evaluation of your current environment and recommend effective approaches for remediation.

NIST 800-53 SSH key management requirements
===========================================

US law specifies a minimum information security requirements for information systems used by the federal government. The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2014 (**FISMA**) authorizes NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to specify the technical requirements.

[FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) 200](/compliance/fips-200/), **Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems**, sets out these requirements. This in turn refers to NIST Special Publication 800-53 as the mandatory minimum controls that federal agencies must implement.

NIST SP 800-53 has undergone several revisions as the state of the art and understanding of cyber attacks and defences has improved. It is now at revision 4, also called NIST SP 800-53r4.

The basic purpose of NIST SP 800-53 is to establish cybersecurity standards and guidelines for US Federal government agencies and federal information systems. It is also widely followed in the private sector. It generally represents industry best practice in cybersecurity.

Use of NIST 800-53 is recommended for state, local, and tribal governments and for critical infrastructure maintained by the private sector.

NIST 800-53 controls and SSH
----------------------------

Security controls described in this publication have a well-defined organization and structure and are broken up into several families of controls. SSH key management touches multiple families within NIST SP 800-53. To ensure effectiveness of these controls and yet be compliant with the requirements, organizations must not ignore the risks and vulnerabilities introduced due to the lack of security around the management of SSH keys.

Table below reflects a sample of how some of these control families and [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) are related:

NIST 800-53 control family

SSH Implications

Account Management

SSH user keys [authorize access](/iam/identity-management); make sure they are [properly managed](/iam/ssh-key-management/). Enhanced auditing is SSH enabled to provide audit trails. Valid authorization before installing keys. SSH keys monitored periodically. Ensure timely rotation of SSH private keys.

Access Enforcement

Approvals for key-based access should be enforced. Prevent users from propagating access through new private keys.

Least Privilege

Command restrictions configured for SSH keys. SSH keys for privileged accounts configured only if non-privileged account cannot do the task. No unauthorized access to private keys that grant privileged access.

Remote Access

Enforce policies when allowing SSH key-based remote access. Host key management should be required for preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

Continuous Monitoring

SSH-based access should be regularly analyzed.

[NIST 7966](/compliance/nist-7966) outlines these requirements in more detail and contains a mapping of its recommendations on SSH access control to NIST 800-53 and the NIST [Cybersecurity Framework](/compliance/cybersecurity-framework/) controls.

Ramifications of non-compliance
-------------------------------

Non-compliance with the NIST 800-53 could be catastrophic for government agencies and, from a best practice perspective, have a huge impact on the security programs within the private sector. FISMA holds federal agencies accountable to secure government information. Failure to pass an inspection can result in (to name a few):

*   Significant administrative sanctions
    
*   Unfavorable publicity
    
*   Reduction of IT budget.
    

Recommendations
---------------

Adhering to NIST 800-53 controls simply paves the way to compliance with laws and regulations such as FISMA and [HIPAA](/compliance/hipaa/security-rule). It also provides the guidelines for the controls required for federal information systems. By the nature of complying simply ensures organizations have effective controls in their efforts protecting what’s important and that their infrastructures are secure.

On that token, organizations must attend to the security around [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/). It is no longer enough to address credentials and other types of access and not including the access granted by SSH keys. SSH keys access by default is an elevated type of access so it must be controlled as you would any type of privileged access.

As you navigate our site, you will surely pick up on the risks and vulnerabilities related to poor SSH key management and hopefully walk away with best practice recommendations to help you inventory, control, remediate and govern SSH keys access.

/. 033 [PCI-DSS](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/pci)
=========================================================

Access using SSH keys & PCI DSS compliance
==========================================

Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council (SSC) was founded in 2006 by major credit card companies American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, etc., with the following two priorities:

*   Helping merchants and financial institutions understand and implement standards for security policies, technologies and ongoing processes that protect their payment systems from breaches and theft of cardholder data.
    
*   Helping vendors understand and implement standards for creating secure payment solutions.
    

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) was developed to encourage and enhance cardholder data security and facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures globally. The standard provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements designed to protect account data.

With the new version 3.2 of the standard, it has become apparent that security requirements are added, changed or removed mostly based on mitigating current vulnerabilities identified in breach reports. The changes are also intended to help organizations maintain an effectively test compliance between security assessments.

SSH and PCI DSS
---------------

The [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) is the de facto gold-standard for securing data transfers and remote system administration in enterprises of all types and sizes. To automate the authentication process of application-to-application data transfers and interactive administrator access over [SSH](/ssh/), it is an industry best practice to use [public-key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication), which relies on the use of [SSH keys](/ssh/key/).

Given the purpose of the standard, which is to secure the handling of credit card transactions, the SSH protocol:

*   Encrypts traffic and [file transfers](/ssh/sftp/) between two endpoints and protects of cardholder data (CHD) in transit.
    
*   Is a secure alternative/replacement for obsolete tools such as [telnet](/ssh/telnet), [FTP](/ssh/ftp/), [rsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Shell), etc. SSH prevents unauthorized CHD access that could lead to a security breach.
    
*   Provides strong authentication of users and devices.
    
*   Provides secure access to the cardholder data environment (CDE) for application developers and [system/network administrators](/network/monitoring/).
    
*   Secures mission critical backups and business continuity processes.
    
*   Secures the thousands of [automated processes](/ssh/automated) that drive day-to-day IT operations, including moving CHD within and between enterprises that are in scope of PCI DSS.
    
*   Prevents [man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle) and protects CHD.
    

Ramifications of non-compliance or consequences of breaches
-----------------------------------------------------------

As with any non-compliance or breach scenario, organizations may be impacted by any of the following:

*   Customers lost confidence resulting in loss of business
    
*   Sales may be impacted which would impact the bottom line
    
*   Revenue and sales impacts will surely lead to loss of jobs
    
*   Typical costs incurred from a breach such as attorneys, fees, issuing new credit cards, etc.
    
*   Become an auditor target for almost every PCI DSS requirement applicable to your merchant level
    
*   The ability to process card payments may be terminated
    
*   And last but not least, potentially going out of business
    

Organizations must be diligent and continuously assessing their compliance with PCI DSS. Regularly conduct risk assessments when standards or infrastructures change is critical to ensure ongoing compliance.

PCI compliance SSH mapping guidance
-----------------------------------

Below we highlight some of the key requirements the standard puts forth and shed some light on how we can help pave the way to compliance:

Requirement

Guidance

**1.1.2** Current network diagram that identifies all connections between the cardholder data environment and other networks, including any wireless networks.

[SSH keys](/ssh/key/) create connections, access, and data transfer routes between systems that must be documented.

**1.1.5** Description of groups, roles, and responsibilities for management of network components.

The network diagram will identify the connectivity for all components. This will assist in identifying all communications requiring SSH. A scan of authorized keys is recommended to confirm deployment specs - see [SSH Risk Assessment](/products/ssh-risk-assessment/). Deploying [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) in your cardholder data enviroment (CDE) will further assist and confirm authorized access as dictated by roles and responsibilities.

**2.2.3** Implement additional security features for any required services, protocols, or daemons that are considered to be insecure - for example, use secured technologies such as [SSH](/ssh/), [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/), [FTPS](/ssh/ftp/ftps), TLS, or IPSec VPN to protect insecure services such as NetBIOS, file-sharing, [Telnet](/ssh/telnet), [FTP](/ssh/ftp/), etc.

[Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) provides secure encrypted file transfers and can tunnel legacy applications inside an encrypted tunnel. [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) controls access within and across the boundary of the CDE. [CryptoAuditor](/products/cryptoauditor/) prevents [tunneling](/ssh/tunneling/) into the CDE.

**3.5.1** Restrict access to cryptographic keys to the fewest number of custodians necessary.

[SSH keys](/ssh/key/) can provide access to cryptographic keys used for encrypting cardholder data (CHD) and should be restricted accordingly on any system that stores keys used to secure stored CHD against misuse. At the minimum, it must be understood who (including what processes or systems) has access to the encryption keys (including access using commercial SSH user authentication keys).

**7.1** Limit access to system components and cardholder data to only those individuals whose job requires such access.

Properly configured and deployed Our products will further enhance your logical access controls. It can support your defined roles and responsibilities and only grant access based on approved roles.

**8.3** Requires multi-factor authentication for all personnel with non-console administrative access to the CDE. New requirement 8.3.2 addresses multi-factor authentication for all personnel with remote access to the CDE (incorporates former requirement 8.3).

Our products are critical in supporting privileged access controls. They support three basic principles of privileged access: Approval, logging and monitoring and the post activity reviews.

**10.7** Retain audit trail history for at least one year, with a minimum of three months immediately available for analysis (for example, online, archived, or restorable from backup).

SSH Communications Security exceeds this requirement with out of the box configuration.

Visa non-compliance penalty table

Next steps
----------

Exploiting data security weaknesses in the cardholder data environment remains a popular tactic for cyber criminals. With the added risks associated with ineffective access controls along with the most common threat – human error – organizations must remain diligent in enforcing and continuously monitoring their security controls whether driven by PCI compliance or simply to protect what is important.

We provide services and tools to address compliance in relation to [SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management/) and encrypted access. We also provide tools to prevent [SSH tunneling](/ssh/tunneling/) from the Internet into the internal network.

We recommend that you contact us for:

*   An [assessment of the use of SSH](/products/ssh-risk-assessment/) and related risks and compliance violations.
    
*   Introduction to [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/), the leading solution for managing access to servers using [SSH keys](/ssh/key/).
    

Organizations are also simultaneously facing other IT challenges and transformations into cloud and IoT. We play into several aspects of the ongoing transformation.

*   Migrating servers into the cloud and adopting agile development processes to react faster and save costs.
    
*   Using 3rd parties such as managed services providers and offshore services to lower costs. This requires proper [monitoring and control](/network/monitoring/).
    
*   Keping up with the rapid expansion of IoT.
    
*   Ensuring effective cybersecurity controls, including application of the [US Cybersecurity Framework](/compliance/cybersecurity-framework/) in critical infrastructure.
    
*   Controlling [who/what has access](/iam/identity-management) to critical and sensitive information.
    

The offering of [SSH Communications Security](/) is a compliance enabler for all of the above. Conversely, lack of visibility into how [SSH](/ssh/) is deployed and who has access to what data using SSH keys in the cardholder data environment and otherwise exposes an organization to grave risks and liabilities. For example, the [Sarbanes-Oxley law](/compliance/sarbanes-oxley/) for public companies even has criminal penalties for negligent or fraudulent certifications by the CEO and CFO.

What is the best way to prepare for a PCI DSS audit? Be your own auditor first! This can be accomplished by conducting a thorough control gap assessment which will pave the way for an easier audit and an achievable compliance attestation.

What are the SANS 20 controls
-----------------------------

The SANS CIS Critical Security Controls (SANS CIS) are a recommended set of actions for cyber defense that provide specific and actionable ways to stop today’s most pervasive and dangerous attacks. The controls are applicable for all kinds of business and IT organizations, and they analyze all the data about attacks and intrusions. The objective of the SANS CIS top 20 Controls is to protect your critical assets, infrastructure, and information. The controls will help identify your network vulnerabilities, strength your organization’s defensive posture and to monitor of your sensitive information. Benefits include (to name a few):

*   compromises will be reduced,
    
*   the need for recovery efforts will be minimized,
    
*   and the associated costs will be cut down.
    

SANS CIS suggests that you conduct a security control gap assessment to compare your organization’s current security stance to the detailed recommendations of the critical controls. SSH communication solutions support your gap assessment effort and offers up reports that further confirms the effectiveness of your access controls. Additionally, our solutions are key to the organizations’ provisioning systems and access governance processes.

SANS Top 20 critical security controls and SSH
----------------------------------------------

Information security is a complex and multi-faceted topic. Security requires attention on multiple levels, all the way from individual users and applications and down to the level of systems and networks. While some aspects of information security have all along been in focus and under tight security scrutiny, there are also areas that have received less attention. The user- and application-level identity and security management appears to be an area that the security industry players have placed their emphasis on, while system-level issues have traditionally seen less attention.

Given the purpose of SANS CIS CSC which is defensive actions to stop dangerous cyberattacks, the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) contributes to the defense bottom line by:

*   Scanning and detecting the network such as IP addresses and identify hosts based on analyzing their traffic. In this way, both authorized and unauthorized devices and system would be detected.
    
*   Encrypting traffic between two end points, and supporting the protection of secure access.
    
*   Is a secure alternative/replacement for older tools ([telnet](/ssh/telnet), [FTP](/ssh/ftp/), rsh, etc.) that prevents unauthorized access to the network which could lead to security breach.
    
*   Ensuring only authorized users access to the system.
    
*   Securing mission critical backups and business continuity processes.
    
*   Most of all, preventing [man-in-the middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle), and provide a secure network environment.
    

SANS controls and SSH guidance
------------------------------

Many of the SANS CIS CSC are directly or indirectly impacted by your [SSH key](/ssh/key) deployment. The following table highlights a few best practices and security control implementations that will help to ensure your compliance with SANS CIS:

SANS CIS Control description

SSH Guidance

**1.4** Maintain an asset inventory of all systems connected to the network and the network devices themselves, recording at least the network addresses, machine name(s), purpose of each system, an asset owner responsible for each device, and the department associated with each device.

Our solutions maintain inventory of keys and host information.

**4.3** Perform vulnerability scanning in authenticated mode either with agents running locally on each end system to analyze the security configuration or with remote scanners that are given administrative rights on the system being tested.

Our solutions provide vulnerability scans for SSH key strengths, age, operating system versions and SSH versions. Additionally, they identify versions with known vulnerabilities.

**8.1** Employ automated tools to continuously monitor workstations, servers, and mobile devices with anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewalls, and host-based IPS functionality. All malware detection events should be sent to enterprise anti-malware administration tools and event log servers.

Our solutions monitor incoming and outgoing traffic real time and alerts appropriate security monitoring tools (DLPs, SEM, SIEM, ...).

**12.1** Deny communications with (or limit data ow to) known malicious IP addresses (black lists), or limit access only to trusted sites (whitelists). Tests can be periodically carried out by sending packets from bogon source IP addresses (non-routable or otherwise unused IP addresses) into the network to verify that they are not transmitted through network perimeters.

Our solutions monitor, audit and control encrypted privileged access. Our products also enhance logical access controls and support the defined roles and responsibilities. Therefore, access is granted only for approved roles including SSH access.

**14.4** All information stored on systems shall be protected with le system, network share, claims, application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will enforce the principal that only authorized individuals should have access to the information based on their need to access the information as a part of their responsibilities.

Our solutions monitor, audit and control encrypted privileged access. Our products also enhance logical access controls and support the defined roles and responsibilities. Therefore, access is granted only for approved roles including SSH access.

**16.1** Review all system accounts and disable any account that cannot be associated with a business process and owner.

Our solutions enhance the logical access controls and support the defined roles and responsibilities. Access is granted only for approved roles.

Recommendations
---------------

The consequences of cyber-attacks are very severe since unauthorized individuals can gain access to private networks to steal important and sensitive data. Organizations should pay attention to critical security controls to ensure unauthorized devices and individuals are blocked from accessing or connecting to systems.

The CIS Controls are particularly significant because they are upgraded by digital specialists taking into account real threat information pulled from various open and private danger sources. Professionals from different associations joined their insight to make this agreement of controls, and it is an incredible reference point for any association hoping to enhance their data security stance. The superiority of SANS CIS Control is the prioritization. The Controls are intended to help organizations define the starting points for their defenses by guiding them to perform vulnerability assessments. Additionally, the Controls will direct organizations focus on the risks that are unique to their business and provide suggestions and methods for them to pay attention. As a result, organizations will receive immediate and high-value results by taking on actions followed the instructions of the SANS CIS Controls.

Organizations should improve their security processes by including the numerous existing SSH [identities](/iam/identity-management) as part of their overall identity and access management practices. Because lack of understanding how SSH is deployed and managed could lead severe consequences, your system could be attacked by unauthorized individuals, and your organizations are also under a risk of compliance perspective.

SSH Communications Security products contribute to ensuring all controls states are implemented effectively. By using the products with proper deployment and configuration, organizations will be able to enhance their security procedures further. The SSH Communications Security tools will also detect the authorized and unauthorized devices to make sure only authorized devices connect to the system. By detecting into the secure connections and transmissions across your system, our product would evaluate, monitor and remediate all risks that associated with your SSH infrastructure. Thus, your organization will be on the progressing of achieving continuous compliance.

The financial industry has been under audit scrutiny ever since the enactment of the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes–Oxley_Act). Sarbanes-Oxley, also known as SOX-404 or Sarbox, mandates that all publicly-traded companies must establish internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and must document, test and maintain those controls and procedures to ensure their effectiveness.

Overview of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
----------------------------------

When the U.S. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the intent was to drive improvements in companies’ internal controls. The benefits were seen as greater assurance to shareholders and other stakeholders in published financial reports, while compliance costs were of lesser significance and were dramatically underestimated.

However, cost is of tremendous importance to corporate executives. While they have an obligation to provide an effective system of internal control that provides assurance regarding the integrity of financial reporting and the safeguarding of assets, there should be a balance between the cost of those controls and the risks they are managing.

SOX-404 dove organizations to define, document and communicate their Information Technology Internal Controls. These controls basically cover four (4) domains:

*   **Logical Access** - This control provides reasonable assurance that financial/critical reporting systems and subsystems are appropriately secured to prevent unauthorized use, disclosure, modification, damage or loss of data. Segregation of duties is an essential step for access controls because we want to assign the right personnel to access the right data and software in the right business tasks.
    
*   **System Administration and Monitoring** - This control provides reasonable assurance that IT components, as they relate to security, processing, and availability, are well protected, would prevent any unauthorized changes, and assist in the verification and recording of the current configuration. For example, the control requires that system audit logs are active and monitored to ensure unauthorized activity is detected.
    
*   **Change (program) Management** - This control provides reasonable assurance that system changes of financial reporting significance are authorized and appropriately tested before being moved into production. Any changes should be documented and maintained.
    
*   **IT Operations** - This control provides reasonable assurance that recorded, processed and reported data remain complete, accurate and valid during the update and storage process. It is highly recommended to implement operating system security patches to evaluate the relevant security vulnerabilities and to ensure that security risks are mitigated as soon as possible.
    

Why is this important
---------------------

Auditors have been focusing on IT General Controls as dictated by audit governing bodies such as the [PCAOB](https://pcaobus.org/). [SSH keys](/ssh/key) have been under the radar being a critical part of production plumbing that has not gotten the deserved attention. Industry reports draw attention to the fact that financial audit outcomes are consistent year after year. Whereby the majority of audit findings and exceptions further highlight new or unforeseen weaknesses for the logical access, privileged access, program or change management and operations controls. The findings in many cases are associated with new applications, new technologies, or are identified based upon discovered vulnerabilities which were not considered during prior audits.

Organizations within the financial industry continually face audits year after year to ensure that they are compliant with various laws and regulations whether they are government or association based. Financial organizations take extra measures to ensure trust is in place for their customers by adhering to industry best practice standards and guidelines to minimize the risks that could lead to a potential data breach or loss in trust. The common digital security theme across all organizations is “It’s Not a Matter of If, But When!”. As a result, many leading experts in the security industry state that organizations may have already suffered a breach, but they don’t yet know it.

It goes without saying, the threat landscape is always changing based upon the evolving vectors being utilized to try and gain access to protected data. Protected data goes beyond information such as social security numbers; the government, regulating bodies and industry standards have become more stringent as government agencies are conducting compliance audits which come with hefty fines; and much more. SSH Communications Security product offerings can help your organization achieve compliance related to common issues and exceptions that are repeat findings among financial organizations audits.

Ramifications of non-compliance
-------------------------------

All applicable companies must establish a financial accounting framework that can generate financial reports that are readily verifiable with traceable source data. This source data must remain intact and cannot undergo undocumented revisions. In addition, any revisions to financial or accounting software must be fully documented as to what was changed, why, by whom and when.

Besides lawsuits and negative publicity, a corporate officer who does not comply or submits an inaccurate certification is subject to a fine up to $1 million and ten years in prison, even if done mistakenly. If a wrong certification was submitted purposely, the fine can be up to $5 million and twenty years in prison.

The threat landscape is constantly changing based upon the evolving vectors being utilized by internal and external attackers that seek access to protected data. Protected data goes beyond information such as a social security numbers. The government, regulating bodies, and industry standards have become more stringent as government agencies are conducting compliance audits which come with hefty fines and in some cases personal criminal liability on executive management. SSH Communications Security product offerings can help your organization achieve compliance related to common issues and exceptions that are repeat findings among financial organizations audits.

SOX-404 and SSH mapping guidance
--------------------------------

Audits to date have included user credentials and access they are granted on production systems. Financial organizations have excelled in that arena and have a well-documented and executed corporate governance process overseeing all that type of activity. Unfortunately, they fall short when it has to deal with [SSH keys](/ssh/key) and management of the access they grant. We must consider the following:

Cryptography Explained
----------------------

Cryptography is the art and science of secret writing. It is the foundation of online identity, privacy, and security. Only careful and well-executed application of cryptography will allow keeping private information hidden from prying eyes and ears. The origins of the term 'cryptography' itself stem from two words of the Greek language - κρυπτός (kryptós) meaning secret or hidden, and γράφειν (graphein) meaning writing.

Our modern world relies on electronic means for creating, storing, and transferring information. The security of this digital life owes much to cryptography. Cryptography intersects our daily lives in more ways people commonly realize.

Practical Everyday Applications
-------------------------------

Our mobile phones, computers, online services, and nearly all personal online communications rely on different cryptographic algorithms and methods for the protection of the privacy and integrity of the identities and data involved.

Over the course of an ordinary day, we use many, sometimes rather advanced, cryptographic devices - there are smartcards in our wallets, laptops on our desks, mobile phones in our pockets, vehicle information systems in our cars, electronic locks on our doors, and so on.

Algorithms - Transforming Data
------------------------------

Cryptographic algorithms are the basic tools of this trade. An algorithm is a method or a technique that is applied to data. When an algorithm is used to encrypt (hide) the data, the readable information (often referred to as "plaintext") is transformed to an unreadable (encrypted) form. When an encrypted data (or "ciphertext") is returned to its readable form the process is called decryption.

Some algorithms are bi-directional (or symmetric) which means that the same algorithm (and key) are used for both encryption and decryption. In contrast, a one-directional algorithm works in only one way (ie. the operation cannot be reversed). An example of a one-directional cryptographic algorithm is a hash algorithm that produces a hash - a digital "fingerprint" of the processed data. The hash reliably identifies the origina data and no two data sets produce the same hash, yet this digital fingerprint cannot be turned back into the original data.

There are three main categories of these algorithms:

*   _Public key_ cryptography algorithms
    
*   Data _integrity protection_ algorithms
    
*   _Symmetric cipher algorithms_.
    

Roughly these three categories of algorithms cater for three different basic needs:

*   Reliable _authentication_ (of users and other entities)
    
*   Data _integrity protection_
    
*   Protection of data _privacy_.
    

This division is somewhat of a simplification, but will serve for this article. For a more thorough analysis, see an authoritative source such as [Applied Cryptography by Mr Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/books/applied_cryptography/).

Authentication with Public Keys
-------------------------------

While public key cryptography allows data encryption for privacy protection (and is used for that in some cases such as the [PGP email protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) scheme), it is cumbersome and computationally expensive to be used for bulk data protection. Instead, it is most commonly used to implement strong online authentication.

Strong authentication is the most prominent use case of public key cryptography, and in this role we (often unknowingly) use it daily.

Important concepts in public key cryptosystems are:

*   Key pairs that consist of [a public key and a private key](/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys)
    
*   Public key cryptography algorithms such as [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)), [DSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm), and [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm)
    
*   Key lengths. For more information, see [key size guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_size)
    

Practical Uses of Asymmetric Crypto
-----------------------------------

Asymmetric cryptography and private/public key pairs are used extensively in [smart card authentication](/ssh/cac-card-piv-card-smartcard-authentication), [SSH public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication), and authenticating the servers of HTTPS-secured online services.

![PKI Certificate](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/PKI_Certificate-2.png)

Asymmetric cryptography is the central technology behind [Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)](/academy/pki) that allows scalable issuance, revocation, and management of digital certificates. Certificates are used for strong authentication, and digital signatures and they form the basis of trust for other security methods and protocols, such as SSL/TLS. PKI has sometimes been called the ID card office of the Internet, as PKI allows for reliable, 3rd party vouched for identity verification of peers that have not encountered each other before.

Integrity Protection
--------------------

Our daily lives break down into amazing volumes of data every day - our health records, financial information, employment records, service subscriptions, and other parts of our everyday life, are recorded in and transmitted between various online systems. The fabric of our lives is dependent on the integrity of that staggering mass of data - every bit of this information must stay exactly as it is. The integrity of data keeps us alive - in some cases quite literally.

Cryptography offers methods for protecting and inspecting the integrity of digital data in the form of hashing and message digest algorithms. These one-way functions can take a given piece of data of arbitrary size and calculate a unique, small fingerprint of that data. This fingerprint, the hash, is unique to that particular piece of data, and even a tiny change in the data results in an entirely different hash. These hashes allow the detection of modifications in data and are an essential component of any cryptosystem that requires the protection of data integrity.

[SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) and [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) are common hash algorithms.

Practical Uses of Hash Algorithms
---------------------------------

Ensuring the integrity of data that has been received from online sources is one of the most common practical applications of hash algorithms. A rather simple and manual example of using hashes are various file download scenarios, where published hashes allow downloaders to verify the integrity of the file they receive.

![SHA-1 Checksums of Linux ISO Images](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/SHA-1_Checksums_of_Linux_ISO_Images-2.png)

In a more advanced and automated way, the different hash algorithms have been integrated in secure communications protocols, virus scanners, content management systems, and e-commerce platforms. In these practical applications, cryptographic hashes and message digests are being used to ensure the integrity of data as it traverses between systems and networks.

### Data Privacy Protection

The most common and probably easiest understood use of cryptography are the symmetric ciphers. A symmetric encryption algorithm is a method that renders data "hidden" when applied in one direction and returns the data readable when used in the other direction. The symmetric (secret) key functions like the password for the protected data. These algorithms are typically rather fast to execute, and they are used extensively to guarantee the privacy of data in network communications, databases/hard drives, and other applications where relatively large volumes of data need to be cryptographically processed in real time (or close to real time).

Since the key that is used for data encryption and decryption needs to be shared with each endpoint of the encrypted connection, or with every recipient of the encrypted data, the key generation and exchange are a critical feature of cryptosystems that use symmetric ciphers. A common key exchange mechanism in security protocols is the [Diffie-Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie–Hellman_key_exchange).

Common symmetric ciphers are for example:

*   [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
    
*   [3DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES)
    
*   [Blowfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher))
    

Practical Uses of Symmetric Ciphers
-----------------------------------

Symmetric ciphers are used in secure online communications in countless ways. The Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that connect remote branches into a single corporate network protect data communications with protocols that use symmetric ciphers - encryption is the magic behind SSL, IPsec, [SSH](/ssh/), and other network security protocols. Symmetric ciphers also protect data privacy in mobile telephony, most WiFi networks, and in practically every online banking and e-commerce service.

Data at rest solutions utilize fast symmetric encryption algorithms for encrypting disk contents against illegitimate use. A common encryption algorithm in this use case is the [AES-XTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption_theory#XEX-based_tweaked-codebook_mode_with_ciphertext_stealing_.28XTS.29).

Cryptographic Keys and Key Management
-------------------------------------

A cryptosystem is a multiple of its parts - an essential security concern on any system is the way the encryption keys are managed. Even the strongest encryption algorithm offers no security if the attacker can get access to the encryption [keys](/ssh/key/).

Enterprise networks in general have been designed with careful considerations for [identity and access management](/academy/iam). The guiding principles of providing access to resources based on the role of an individual (be it a user or a process) or of segregation of duties provide a starting point for a well-designed access control implementation. These principles need to be applied to practice in all aspects of enterprise access. So far the user-level access control has been in the spotlight of IAM, but in recent times the focus has been shifting towards the so far unaddressed issues of trusted access.

Background and Introduction Post-Quantum Cryptography
------------------------------------------------------

Since mid 1990’s [_Public Key Cryptography_ (PKC)](/academy/pki) has become a basic building component of global communication digital infrastructure. Protocols like TLS (Transport Layer Security), [SSH (Secure Shell)](/academy/ssh), and IPsec (IP security) support applications that are important to our economy, our security, and our way of life, such as mobile phones, banking, internet commerce, social networks, cloud computing, and connected devices.

In addition to using PKC, these communications protocols utilize symmetric key encryption cryptosystems, such as _Authenticated Encryption_, and _Random Bit Generators_.

### Public Key Cryptosystems (PKC)

Most communication protocols rely on Public Key Cryptographic (PKC) functions: _public key encryption_, _digital signatures_, and _key exchange_ to enable scalability and usability by removing need for prior key agreement before communications. Currently these functions are primarily implemented using the

*   _RSA_ (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptosystem for signatures and encryption
*   _Elliptic Curve_ (ECDH, ECDSA) cryptosystems for key exchange and signatures
*   _Diffie-Hellman_ (DH) key exchange

Collectively these are called as _Classical PKC_. The security of these algorithms depends on difficulty of number theoretic problems such as _Integer Factorization_ and _the Discrete Logarithm Problem_ over various groups, and the theory behind these systems was derived between late 1960’s and early 1980’s.

On online communications security application domain these algorithms are used for

1.  _[Session KeyAgreement](/academy/ssh/session-key)_ using key exchange for agreeing upon Symmetric Session keys for Authenticated Encryption.
2.  _Peer Authentication_ using digital signatures provides Identification, Access Control, and Data Origin authentication.

### Symmetric Key Cryptosystems - Authenticated Encryption (AE)

Authenticated Encryption (AE) is used to protect utility data while in transit.

AE works by enciphering the secret _plaintext_ data with the _session encryption key_ using a Cipher function, such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and further authenticating the encrypted data with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) - which may be a keyed Hash MAC (hmac-sha2-512) or may be combined with encryption as is done in case of AES-GCM - producing an _authenticated ciphertext_. The same session key can be used to decrypt the data and verify that it was not altered during transit.

### Random Number Generation (RNG)

High quality (high entropy) random data is crucial for correct operations of PKC and some symmetric algorithms, and also for the future Post-Quantum Cryptography/ Quantum-Safe Cryptography algorithms.

We at SSH believe classical Deterministic Random Bit Generators (DRBG) are good for years to come when properly seeded during run-time. Seeding may be performed from devices based Quantum Mechanics, although most of the time classical environmental noise is sufficient.

For some use cases - such as AES-GCM nonces that require collision resistance - RNG may need to be replaced with a deterministic function over data being encrypted to avoid encrypting different data with the same nonce.

Quantum Computers and Quantum Threat
------------------------------------

Recently there have been great improvements on the area of [Quantum Computing (QC)](/academy/cryptograhy/quantum-computing-and-algorithms) which means leveraging the physical properties of matter and energy to perform calculations.

Quantum Computers allow solving some of the mathematical problems behind current crypto systems in an efficient manner not possible in today’s classical computers. From cryptography's point of view, the following algorithms are particularly interesting:

*   Grover’s algorithm - Lev Grover described an algorithm allowing a QC to perform a brute force key search using quadratically fewer steps than would be required classically (Grover’s algorithm)
*   Shor’s algorithm - Peter Shor showed that QC can efficiently solve integer factorization and and discrete logarithm problems used on existing public key crypto systems, thereby rendering these systems impotent (Shor’s algorithm).

Together these two algorithms form the basis of the _Quantum Threat_ towards current PKCs. When used within a powerful Quantum Computer they will put many forms of modern communication — from key exchange to encryption to digital authentication— in peril.

For the Quantum Threat to become real, it would need a _sufficiently large QC with number of good noiseless cubits relatively close to double the public key size in bits (__n__)_ and the ability to implement a circuit with 64\*n^3\*lg(n) gates. Such computer is called a _Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer_ (CRQC). \[3\]

At time of writing it is fair to say that we’re still far away from having practical CRQC both in number of qubits and the quality of qubits required to implement multi-gate computation. The level of error correction needed for high fidelity requires a large number of additional qubits and a supporting infrastructure, making CRQC unfeasible today - but as said, progress is fast, and CRQC will become viable eventually.

### Impact of Grover’s algorithms

Grover’s algorithms can target Symmetric Key Crypto systems.

Grover’s algorithm for key search suggests that an attacker with CRQC could break a symmetric cipher with a key up to twice as long as without QC. However Crystof Zalka proved in 1997 that to obtain the full quadratic speedup, the algorithm must be performed in series. In the real world, where attacks on cryptography use massively parallel processing, the advantage of Grover’s algorithm will be smaller.

Taking this into account along with the cost of building CRQC it is quite likely that Grover’s algorithm will provide only little or no advantage in attacking AES, and AES 128 will remain secure.

Even if QCs were less expensive than anticipated, the problems on parallelizing Grover’s algorithm suggests that AES with a longer key size will be safe for a very long time, assuming new attack vectorsare not found.

The relevance of Grover’s algorithm is even more reduced considering the current protocol trend of having short symmetric cryptoperiods and the dynamic nature of symmetric encryption keys.

According to U.S. NIST and UK National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), respective Governmental entities may continue to use AES with key sizes 128, 192, or 256 bits until further notice despite Grover’s algorithm.

To meet compliance, AES 256 may be required. For example, the U.S. Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 mandates 256 bit AES keys to be used for all classification levels.

### Impact of Shor’s algorithm

Shor’s algorithm can target Public Key Cryptosystems.

The impact of Shor’s algorithm is far more serious than that of Grover’s, as it reduces the time complexity of Integer Factorization and Discrete Logarithm from sub-exponential to polynomial, and targets keys that can have long cryptoperiods.

The CRQC running Shor’s algorithm can be used to attack two aspects on the application protocols in the order of importance.

1.  Key Exchange (aka Key Agreement)

*   Attacks against Key Exchange aim to recover the [_session keys_](/academy/ssh/session-key) used for encrypting data and therefore are attacks towards data confidentiality.
*   If the data transferred over a protocol needs to retain its confidentiality for a long period of time, it is important to prepare for the emergence of CRQC. This is because an eavesdropper that has read access to an encrypted session today can record the data, and later, when CRQC’s have evolved, use one to recover the session key and get access to the data.

2.  Digital signatures (aka Authentication)

*   AttacksagainstSignatures aim to recover signature keys and to forge signatures used for authenticating data, user, or server by calculating the private signature key. These attacks target data integrity and authentication. An attack against signatures can only be launched when CRQC is available (day one) and the impact depends on the protocol.
    
*   Signatures constructed with classical PKC and verified before day one are safe. After day one, the bad actor may use CRQC to acquire a signature key and use that to sign arbitrary documents still verifying correctly - as if the original key had been disclosed. Classical PKC Signatures will not be usable for their purpose.
    

_Post-Quantum Cryptography_ or Quantum-Safe Cryptography addresses the Quantum Threat towards Public Key Cryptosystems.

### Post-Quantum Cryptography

Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is Quantum-Safe Cryptography (QSC) designed to be quantum-safe and operate on existing computers and networks. PQC replaces PKC algorithms already five decades old with ones that can resist the Quantum Threat.

PQC (or QSC) algorithms are built on problems that are hard for the Quantum Computers, and they are executed on classical computers. Examples of such algorithms are based on problems of Lattice such as Modulo Learning With Errors\[Kyber\] , Modulo Learning with Rounding \[Saber\], Ring Learning With Rounding\[NTRU\] andLearning With Errors \[FrodoKEM\], or problems of codes such as Goppa codes \[Classic McEliece\].

New applications could be built entirely using PQC algorithms, but the existing applications need to transfer to new cryptography in an incremental and managed manner. To ease the transition, cryptographic agility - the ability to use mixed algorithm suites - is needed.

As PQC algorithms are new, and have not been as widely studied as their traditional counterparts, there is an inherent risk that they may contain flaws that make them less secure to traditional cryptanalysis.

To mitigate this risk, hybrid (composite) algorithm suites should be used whenever possible.In a hybrid mode, both traditional and PQC algorithms contribute to the key material using a Key Derivation Function (KDF) \[6\] that is well studied. The resulting key is at least as hard to break as the strongest composite.

Both PKC and PQC algorithms in Hybrid Key Exchange use Ephemeral (temporary, one-time) key pairs. We recommend a combination of ECDH and CRYSTALS-Kyber for online interactions.

Classical DH may be used instead of ECDH if there is hardware supporting the public key exponentiation operations.

CRYSTALS-Kyber is preferredover other lattice-based algorithms for being faster \[1\]. Additional algorithms may be implemented for constrained systems or to meet external requirements and interoperability needs.

As described earlier, there are two distinct PKC problems to solve.

Correcting problems in Key Exchange is urgent, but fortunately rather straightforward, and easy to implement. Also adopting the hybrid approach provides additional assurance so there is no reason to delay.

Digital Signatures/Authentication requires long-term keys to be regenerated. These keys include the [SSH User Identification Keys](/academy/ssh-keys)/Certificates, and [SSH Host Keys](/academy/ssh/host-key)/Certificates, and TLS Server/User public key certificates, and IPsec device certificates.

To further complicate the issue these keys may be enclosed within [Public Key Certificates](/academy/pki/certificate) issued by external Certificate Authorities (CA), whose keys shall also need to be redone - full Post-Quantum Identification solution requires industry-wide effort \[4\], \[7\], \[8\].

Alternatives to Mitigating the Quantum Threat
---------------------------------------------

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) addresses the Key Agreement problem via Quantum Mechanics. QKD requires specialized hardware and networking resources. It can be seen as a partial expensive point solution, but not viable for the Internet scale or general purpose use.

Classical Key Agreement and Authentication can be augmented by using pre-placed symmetric keys that are mixed into key using KDF auxiliary input data.

Pre-placing these keys creates additional key management and usability problem nullifying the upsides of PKC - therefore this solution is not suitable when communications are needed without prior agreement and arrangements.

For short term data protection - with periods of short confidentiality or only integrity requirement, such as measurements and actions on IoT and OT domain - the Quantum Threat towards Key Exchanges can be mitigated by having short term sessions with Classical Key Exchange, or having long term sessions rekeyed frequently.

Overall the best mitigation is to gradually move to use the PQC algorithms via a [Hybrid mode](/academy/cryptograhy/quantum-computing-and-algorithms#hybrid-approach).

Global standard on PQC & certificates
-------------------------------------

Many algorithms for PQC have been proposed and there is a wide variation in performance characteristics between these, more so than for conventional PKC \[5\]. This means that some algorithms will be more suited to particular use-cases than others.

Also there is an expanding set of requirements for cryptography, including deployment in resource constrained devices, and therefore it is unlikely there will be a single algorithm suitable for all applications.

NIST standards for quantum-safe cryptography will be available between 2022-2024. These standards establish a new baseline for PQC Key Encapsulation and digital signature algorithms suitable for general use cases.

In 2022 NIST selected the firstpublic-key encryption and key-establishment algorithm that will be standardized: CRYSTALS–KYBER. The NIST Fourth Round selects the alternate KEM(s)based on differentunderlying mathematical problem.

The NIST preferred signature algorithm afterThirdRound is CRYSTALS-Dilithium and the alternates were selected as well. However, NIST is looking for new submissions for alternate signature algorithm candidates during the fourth and likely final round.

Standards bodies such as [NIST](/academy/compliance/cybersecurity-framework) and [ETSI](https://www.etsi.org/) are working with industry to develop guidance for the transition to PQC, which will allow organizations to mitigate risks in PQC transition effectively.

### German recommendation

BSI-TR-02102-1 \[2\] section 3.2 recommend the use of FrodoKEM or Classic McEliece. This recommendation is unchanged even after NIST no longer considers theconservative lattice-basedalgorithm FrodoKEM as potential alternate key-establishmentalgorithm.

### US recommendations

As of July 2022, NIST has selected CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium as the preferred algorithms forstandardization. NIST willselect the preferred and alternate algorithms including recommended parameters for various use cases after the PQC competition has concluded.

The U.S. Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 requires Level V parameters, that target 256-bit security, for all classification levels.Migration from current CNSA 1.0 to CNSA 2.0 is expected in 2025-2030.

The transition management process is independent of thestandardisationefforts. In 2021, US Department of Homelands Security together with NIST published a guideline[Preparing forpost-quantum cryptography.](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/post-quantum_cryptography_infographic_october_2021_508.pdf)By May 2023,U.S. government agencies are required to provide a[full inventory of active cryptographic systems of high-priority assets and systems](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M-23-02-M-Memo-on-Migrating-to-Post-Quantum-Cryptography.pdf).

Legislation like[Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7535)mandates even more ambitious timelinefor the Quantum-Safe journey.

### UK recommendations

As of May 2021, UK National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) \[4\] states:

NCSC recognises the serious threat that quantum computers pose to long-term cryptographic security. QSC using standards-compliant products is the recommended mitigation for the quantum threat, once such products become available.

*   NCSC does not endorse QKD for any government or military applications.
*   NCSC does not endorse any particular PQC algorithm at the moment.
*   NCSC advises on the deployment of suitable mitigation for long term secret data.
*   NCSC advices to wait for standardized and interoperable set of algorithms.

NCSC guidance for quantum-safe algorithms will follow the outcome of the NIST process by recommending specific algorithms for representative use cases.

### Preparation for Migration

Right now, large organizations should factor the Quantum Threat into their long-term roadmaps, and conduct investigation to identify which of their systems will be a high priority for transition.

Priority systems could be those that process sensitive personal data and are hardest to replace. The standardization of the use of PQC protocols is progressing, and in practice now that there is the NIST recommendedfirstset of PQC algorithms: it is time for early adapters to start the migration process.

The transition to PQC for Key Exchange is an incremental and staged process that can be commenced already during 2022. There is some risk - as always when new software versions are deployed - but with proper hybrid implementation the security concerns and operational aspects are limited.

Transition to full PQC is a complex and expensive process that must be planned and managed with care. There are risks to security as systems and cryptographic keys are changed, and risks to business continuity if there are unforeseen dependencies on said components that require replacement.

### ETSI

ETSI describes an organizational process of upgrading systems to PQC \[7\]. This document provides pointers to other related ETSI specification documents.

### PQC and FIPS 140-2 validation, and FIPS 140-3 validation

FIPS 140 validation does not cover PQC algorithms. These algorithms cannot get FIPS validation for the time being.

The FIPS 140 series cryptographic of validation allows additional inputs for the validated key derivation functions. The PQC algorithms are used for generating such inputs, and therefore the use of PQC is allowed on FIPS-140 validated cryptosystems.

Introduction to Encryption Key Management
=========================================

Encrypted keys are a central component of any effective database management solution. Traditionally, companies use encryption protocols — like the SSH protocol — to keep their data secure from unauthorized access. Once data is encrypted, even cyberattackers with the right credentials are unable to unencrypt information without the right key.

Making the most out of encryption key management (EKM) is an important component of any cybersecurity operation. But even the most password-protected businesses often remain unaware of the benefits of a strong encryption key management solution. Organizations may juggle thousands of keys, with little understanding of how often keys need to be retired — or how to keep them away from cyberattackers.

In addition to Privileged Access Management (PAM),encryption key management is [one of the central components of cybersecurity](https://www.ssh.com/blog/centralized-password-ssh-key-management). Moving your enterprise into a secure environment will require an understanding of some basicencryption key management properties. Let’s take a look at how encryption keys work and whyencryption key management is so important for enterprise security.

What is Encryption Key Management?
----------------------------------

The basic concept behind encryption is simple: encryption encodes data [in order to protect information from unauthorized access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke_M3t_L3iY). With the right encryption mechanism, data can remain secure even when privileged access credentials are compromised. Encryption uses ciphertext to encode data, which is achieved using an encryption algorithm.

Once data is encrypted, an encryption key is necessary to access ciphertext. Growing businesses often underestimate the number of encryption keys necessary to access their data — many organizations make use of thousands of keys for effective encryption. All too often, businesses protect encryption keys with passwords that are easily compromised, using on-premises servers for storage.

The effectiveness of encryption depends on the security of your encryption keys. That’s where encryption key management comes into the picture.

In order to move forward with an effective encryption solution, enterprises will need an effective strategy for managing encryption keys. To prevent a cyberattacker from using encryption keys to access sensitive data, businesses will need more than just a password-protected key vault. The idea behind encryption key management is to actively manage encryption keys in a separate location from the rest of the enterprise data.

Within encryption key management, there are plenty of strategies for secure key management — from an on-premises key management server to cloud-based key management using SaaS. The uniting factor among these different approaches is thatencryption key management involves an active, continuous approach to key management. Using encryption key management, keys aren’t just stored — they are actively being protected against evolving threats.

Encryption Key Management Best Practices
----------------------------------------

When it comes to maintaining secure encryption keys, strategy is everything. With a good understanding ofencryption key management best practices, you can help to ensure your entire organization is minimizing the risk of data compromise. In the long run, keeping up withencryption key management best practices is a reliable way to save money, with improved efficiency and effectiveness for your entire security system.

Here are some basic strategies IT admins can implement for a successful approach to encryption key management.

### **1. Set up a secure algorithm**

The encryption algorithm is the central component of anyencryption key management process. No principles of key management will be effective if your enterprise uses a weak algorithm for encryption. The algorithm is the first line of defense against cyberattackers, and it’s important not to overlook this crucial step. RSA and AES are both common encryption algorithms, and each requires a unique type of encryption key. Asymmetric keys are typically used for data in motion.

**2. Plan out your Encryption Key Management approach**

A successfulencryption key management system will be accessible to high-privileged IT admins from a centralized location. As an enterprise grows, an increasing number of keys will be necessary to decipher encrypted data. Businesses can quickly accumulate thousands of keys — and a centralized approach toencryption key management can make this process much more manageable.

### **3. Document your authorization history**

For many businesses, some form of documentation will be necessary to ensure proper security standards. When it’s time for a security audit from a regulatory organization, keeping records of your authorization history is crucial for a successful audit. Documentation allows you to ensure your data hasn’t been accessed by any unauthorized users — a task that’s important for external audits, as well as internal security checks.

### **4. Understand the lifecycle of an encryption key**

An effective key won’t last forever. As time goes on, an encryption algorithm will inevitably grow weaker, with an increased risk of security compromise. Encryption key management requires an understanding of the lifecycle of an encryption key, paired with the appropriate amount of rotation for your keys. There are three basic phases in the lifecycle of any encryption key: generation, rotation, and retirement.

During the rotation process, it’s important to ensure that a new algorithm is ready to go before an old algorithm is retired. Third-partyencryption key management providers often include secure rotation services to ensure data isn’t exposed during the rotation process.

### **5. Make sure your infrastructure is secure**

Your encryption algorithm shouldn’t be your only line of defense against cyberattackers. A high-security, on-premises environment allows you to protect your data from attackers before they even have the chance to access encrypted data. Hardware security devices can include physical barriers to entry, contingency plans in case of fire or natural disaster, and many other measures to prevent damage or tampering with your infrastructure.

Choosing the Right Encryption Key Management Software
-----------------------------------------------------

Actively managing keys involves more than just keeping track of where keys are and what they do. Without a key management approach, maintaining a database of keys — whether a spreadsheet or another type of file — doesn’t take into account the key lifecycle. Additionally, maintaining a static list of keys won’t allow you to take the security precautions that a more dynamic management system allows.

The most effective way to implement dynamicencryption key management is with software that allows you to manage a large number of keys securely, with an understanding of which keys need to be retired. Encryption keys can either be stored on-premises or in the cloud. Plenty of SaaS providers offer similarly dynamic encryption key management via off-premises managed services.

The security ofencryption key management software is of vital importance to overall enterprise security. Even though authentication is a separate discipline from encryption key management, the two work hand-in-hand to provide reliable and strong enterprise security. Regardless of what type ofencryption key management software a business chooses to use, access to key management must be protected by a privileged access management system that allows for secure authentication. Additionally, access to keys must be [recorded for security auditing purposes](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance).

[The Zero Trust security model](https://www.ssh.com/ssh-zero-trust-access-key-and-secrets-management) offers a solution to the demands of enterprise key management. As cybersecurity becomes increasingly sophisticated, user-level access credentials are becoming simpler. The principle behind Zero Trust software is to combineencryption key management with privileged access management (PAM) to form a unified security solution.

It’s important to note that Zero Trust security will not be available on traditionalencryption key management software. Because Zero Trust architecture requires an active, dynamic approach to password and key management, cloud-based Zero Trust software — either in-house or SaaS — is necessary to maintain Zero Trust capabilities.

The Future is Keyless
----------------------

Remote work is more common than ever, and businesses need a security solution that goes beyond just password-protected devices. When an enterprise is no longer working with a closed network, a new security environment demands new solutions. By providing a security threshold at the level of the device and then the application, the Zero Trust model allows authorized users to access the right information from any secure device.

In the realm of key management, Zero Trust ensures that enterprise data remains protected by a dynamicencryption key management system. With regards to PAM, Zero Trust security demands application-level access credentials, without drastically increasing the time it takes for users to access applications. In other words, Zero Trust allows the right users to move from application to application without hassle.

[A keyless encryption key management solution](/solutions/credential-risk-mitigation/?hsLang=en) is a highly effective solution for enterprises hoping to adopt a Zero Trust approach. A dynamicencryption key management policy is crucial to security — and keyless access is as dynamic as possible, with ephemeral access keys for each instance of access. By establishing short-lived access credentials and encryption keys with Just-In-Time access, enterprises can document keys securely and rotate keys every time data needs to be accessed.

Not only is keyless access more efficient than traditionalencryption key management solutions — it’s more secure, too. Even with regular key rotation, an enterprise with a centralized key vault runs the risk of data compromise if cyberattackers ever access the encrypted data. With Zero Trust keys, [no long-term keys exist](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ssh-key-management). In this way, keyless access drastically reduces security threats while also reducing sprawl.

Authentication and Identity Key Management Solution
---------------------------------------------------

Our SSH [Universal Key Manager](https://www.ssh.com/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) (UKM) offers a user-friendly solution for key management, as well as privileged access management. By combining passwordless access with keyless access, your enterprise can effectively eliminate the threat of compromised access credentials and authentication keys. With continuous rotation, security documentation, [and risk detection](https://www.ssh.com/products/ssh-risk-assessment/), UKM allows you to automate encryption key management. UKM is a hybrid solution, which allows you to manage your existing keys while migrating to a keyless environment at a pace that suits you.

UKM is your new Zero Trust solution for high-level security, with user-friendly access — from any device, not just ones in your network. Authentication and identity key management requires a dynamic approach. Using ephemeral access certificates, UKM from SSH helps to ensure your encryption solution has never been more dynamic.

=========================================================

Private & Public Keys
=====================

In [public-key cryptosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), a private key is a key used for digitally signing documents. Apublic key is a key that can be used for verifying digital signatures generated using a corresponding private key.

In some cryptosystems,public keys can also be used for encrypting messages so that they can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key.

Public keys and private keys come in pairs. The pair is called a key pair. The basic idea of a public key cryptosystem is that the public key can be easily derived from the private key, but the private key cannot be practically derived from the public key. Generally, deriving the private key would be theoretically possible, but the computation would be so complex that it would take millions of years with current computers, or would consume more energy than will be released by our sun during its lifetime.

Private Keys in SSH
-------------------

In [SSH](/ssh/), a private key is used for authenticating computers and users. A [host key](/ssh/host-key) authenticates servers, and an [identity key](/ssh/identity-key) serves as an authentication credential for a user. Together they are called [SSH keys](/ssh/key/).

SSH keys grant access to servers, similar to user names and passwords. Therefore, they should be part of [identity and access management](/academy/iam) in enterprises. All cybersecurity-related [laws and regulations](/compliance/) also require managing SSH key-based access.

It turns out that in many organizations, SSH keys have not been properly managed, and they have literally millions of keys configured as [authorized keys](/academy/ssh/authorized-key) granting access to their servers. An [assessment of risk](/products/ssh-risk-assessment/) and deployment of [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/) tools is strongly recommended.

Public Keys in SSH
------------------

In [SSH](/ssh/), public key cryptography is used for authenticating computers and users. [Host keys](/ssh/host-key) authenticate hosts. [Authorized keys](/academy/ssh/authorized-key) and [identity keys](/ssh/identity-key) authenticate users.

The most common type of SSH key is an [authorized key](/academy/ssh/authorized-key), which is a public key.

Management of Keys in SSH
-------------------------

Over the years, the number of SSH keys in existence has grown steadily. There have not been formal provisioning or termination processes for them. In some customer cases, we have found literally millions of them granting access to the environment. Some of the keys have been more than ten years old. Some have used algorithms or key lengths that have been broken. Most of all, they grant access in ways that violate most [cybersecurity laws and regulations](/compliance/).

It is important to manage SSH keys properly. Please see more information on [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) and [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/).

Quantum Computing & Post-Quantum Algorithms
===========================================

Businesses and organizations often ask which algorithms are safe to use and which are worth retiring. For over 25 years, the [Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)](/academy/ssh) has protected businesses and personal workspaces from privacy breaches by supporting viable encryption key algorithms. But as we usher in the quantum computing age, this question has become increasingly difficult to answer.

Current algorithms will be vulnerable regardless of the protocol used, and won’t be able to thwart breaches from quantum computers, which can process complex, nonlinear computations at an unimaginable speed. And although these quantum machines lack the efficiency to inflict damage today, their potential lies in the near future.

In this article, we will cover what quantum computing is, why and how it is a threat to cybersecurity, what it means for your existing classic algorithms, and how the hybrid quantum-safe algorithms can ensure optimal cybersecurity for your enterprise.

What is Quantum Computing?
--------------------------

[Quantum computing](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cryptograhy/cryptographic-protocols-and-quantum-threat) involves solving problems with an unknown amount of variables and answers using quantum mechanics. Just like quantum mechanics tries to account for the spontaneous and random behavior of atomic particles, quantum computing accounts for the “what-ifs” of every possible scenario and outcome by analyzing and experimenting with qubits, or simple units of quantum data.

To put it in comparison, the problems our computers can solve today resemble a multi-step ladder, where the only correct answer lies at the top. Quantum computers, on the other hand, can solve problems that resemble a web surrounded by a multitude of possible solutions that can shift at the introduction or omission of a single factor.

Additionally, quantum computers work significantly faster than our current computers. In 2019, Google’s Sycamore quantum computer solved a problem in under four minutes, while it would have taken the world’s greatest supercomputer, IBM’s Summit, 10,000 years to do — that’s [158 million times faster](https://medium.com/predict/googles-quantum-computer-is-about-158-million-times-faster-than-the-world-s-fastest-supercomputer-36df56747f7f).

As a result, the potential for advances in big data analysis, the medical industry, and battery technologies is huge. But as always, there are risks.

Why is Quantum Computing a Threat to Cybersecurity?
---------------------------------------------------

To understand the full threat of quantum computing, it’s essential to highlight the security processes at risk, specifically those needed for [public-key cryptography](/academy/cryptography/what-is-quantum-safe-cryptography#public_key_cryptosystems_(PKC)) (PKC). PKC is the most widely used security protocol for online browsing, data storage, and server connection. It requires a key and sometimes a signature, which are used to verify users, authenticate access, and provide confidentiality to a server. Think of it as a proverbial lock and key system.

The authentication process can unfold in two ways: symmetrically and asymmetrically. Symmetric encryption occurs when the same key is used for decryption and encryption — this is commonly used for data storage (for example, a shared USB device, laptop, or desktop computer) and to protect payment information on secure websites.

Asymmetric encryption is a lengthier process and uses a private and a public key pair to decrypt and encrypt sensitive data and/or to sign and verify a signature in authentication. It is used for session keys to protect data in transit, for example between your browser and this TLS protected website, in SSH (Secure Shell) and IPsec (IP Security) that form the bedrock of secure connections. Asymmetric key pairs are also used for server and often also user authentication, for example in Secure Shell, as well as in all digital certificate-based authentication.

Although keys are composed of lengthy numerical values that are hard to crack, quantum computing makes them easy to uncover. Two specific quantum algorithms form this [quantum threat](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cryptograhy/cryptographic-protocols-and-quantum-threat): Grover’s algorithm, which can target Symmetric Key Crypto systems, and Shor’s algorithm, which can quickly decode the integer factorization process used to generate asymmetric key pairs used in PKC.

As of now, quantum computing is too early in development to factor numbers higher than 21 with Shor's algorithm — but that doesn’t mean cybersecurity measures should relax. Protecting long-term secrets with systems that rely on Public Key Cryptography for session keys withclassic algorithms is no longer sufficient as data can be recorded already now and decrypted later when cryptographically relevant quantum computer becomes available. At that point, anyone with thehelp of a quantum computer who has recorded classically secured data, for example while in transit over the internet or any network, will be able to access everything enterprises and users have been striving to protect and secure.

What Does This Mean for Classic Algorithms?
-------------------------------------------

Because quantum computing can process and solve multidimensional problems within mere minutes, large-scale mathematical factorization algorithms responsible for generating keys are highly vulnerable. Such algorithms — like the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve PKC algorithms — are not considered “quantum-safe”, even with keys of almost 1,000 decimal digits in length. Shor’s algorithm solves these algorithms too quickly and accurately.

As a result, we must restructure how asymmetric encryption algorithms mathematically work. Here’s a closer look at how each algorithm functions and the flaws that make them vulnerable to quantum intrusion:

*   **Diffie-Hellman:** A generating number is shared between two parties, with a private number kept secret to each party. When both parties communicate, they each multiply their private number with the generating number to create a public number. They then exchange that number with each other and raise it to the power of their original private number, ultimately giving them the same result through proof of factorization and, as such, the same shared secret in the form of a hashed moduli. Shor’s algorithm breaks the difficult problem of factoring numbers in a constant time, while previously — in classical computing — breaking such cryptosystems has been exponentially tied with the length of the secret.
*   **RSA:** A public and a private key are generated by multiplying huge prime numbers, which makes it difficult to trace backward from the resulting number. Digital signatures are often used to further safeguard and authenticate the use of keys. However, RSA algorithms are only as strong as the length of their keys and shorter key-lengths even suffer against classical computing, so they won’t stand a chance against quantum computers.
*   **Elliptic Curve:** Unlike the previous two algorithms, elliptic curve algorithms leverage characteristics of mathematical functions that produce curved graphs, making them significantly more tricky to solve. This allows for smaller keys for smaller processing power — however, quantum computers can still figure out the patterns that support elliptic curve cryptography, and smaller keys make the process quicker to solve.

It may seem impossible to conceive of ways to combat quantum threats, but the good news is that we still have time to smoothly transition to more robust and dependable algorithms, and production-ready PQC solutions already exist, that will outsmart what’s to come.

When Is It Time to Say Goodbye to Classic Algorithms?
-----------------------------------------------------

If there are long-term secrets that need to remain secret also in a few years from now, the time to act is now. Even if we had solid quantum-safe alternatives to our classic algorithms for all use cases, it wouldn't be in your best interest to completely wipe the slate clean of existing protocols and implement something new just to stay several steps ahead quantum threats in the future. However, enterprises should make the move towards a safe, impenetrable, and widely applicable security protocol system that can full-fill the [two requirements for post-quantum cryptography](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7535):

1.  it is secure against decryption attempts using a quantum computer or classical computer and
2.  it can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.

The question is, how to prioritise?

### It depends on the use case

Systems protecting long-term secrets that rely on Public Key Cryptography (PKC) for session keys, need to be prioritised and upgraded to a quantum-safe solution first because existing data can be recorded already now and decrypted later.

The authentication keys based on Public Key Cryptography can wait longer, as sufficiently long Elliptic Curve and RSA keys can be used for authentication until day one when cryptographically relevant quantum computer becomes available.

Symmetric ciphers relying on AES likely survive even longer in the post-quantum world unless new attack vectors are discovered.  
  
In practice, many applications such as most TLS for HTTPS web connections, SSH for file transfers and administrative access, most RDP and VPN remote access utilise both asymmetric key agreement and authentication keys as well as symmetric ciphers so it is also important to ensure easy upgradability of the system with new quantum-resilient algorithms going forward.

Different PQC algorithms needed for the various use cases to replace for example Classic Diffie-Hellman, RSA and Elliptic Curve algorithms reach maturity in different stages during this pre-quantum era, and just like for classic algorithms, there won’t be a one-size-fits-all quantum-safe algorithm or solution.

Cryptography must also be certified, tested, and verified before being deployed with confidence and used by enterprises and households worldwide. This means incremental process that will take a substantial amount of time before we can rely on a completely quantum-safe algorithmic bedrock.

### Let go of classic algorithms when breach costs drop

A good key metric to use to determine when to give up an algorithm for good and fully adopt a stronger quantum-safe option is how much it costs to break the classic algorithm. If an institution or government entity has the financial means, it can pay to acquire the resources needed to breach an algorithm.

For instance, a cost of just a few million dollars may be acceptable enough for a government with significant resources and a strong incentive to successfully conduct a breach. As time passes and technology evolves, breaking an algorithm costs less. Therefore, once an algorithm is given an affordable price tag, it’s best to consider it defunct.

### Follow industry authorities for insights

Following updates from top-tier industry officials will clue you in on when you should drop a specific algorithm. Once an algorithm becomes vulnerable, the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/), [the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), and [the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)](https://www.etsi.org/) will flag it and begin devising solutions. All three organizations continually seek expert opinions and alert the public on emerging cybersecurity threats and trends.

In the face of quantum computing, NIST (US) and ETSI are workshopping alternatives, while NCSC is publishing information surrounding any innovations that come from these efforts. NIST has been working with cryptography researchers and experts since 2015 to thoroughly evaluate and test run algorithms that could be deemed quantum-safe. Discussions, webinars, and panels are conducted and published online to keep ideas circulating, with standards for post-quantum cryptography set to be established between 2022 and 2024.

The [NIST post-quantum cryptography program has already selected CRYSTALS-Kyber](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms)for general encryption along with several signature algorithms, and are now in final fourth round considering alternatives. Both the availability and requirement for standardized quantum-safe algorithms for both encryption and digital signatures is likely a reality in just a few years.

Why Adopt a Hybrid Approach?
----------------------------

It’s common for there to be oversights in cryptographic designs, especially for newer algorithmic breeds that will have to outsmart quantum computing. The best route to take as we move towards a post-quantum future is a hybrid approach whenever possible. This allows your enterprise to utilize existing algorithms concurrently with quantum-safe algorithms to forge a two-step, fail-safe solution, such as the Hybrid Key Exchange for Secure Shell (SSH) or TLS. If weaknesses are discovered in a quantum-safe algorithm itself or in its implementation, the classic algorithms already in place will protect confidential data instead of leaving it exposed and decrypted.

Developing and implementing quantum-safe algorithms will also cost a hefty amount of time and money, especially for legacy software and hardware that may not be entirely compatible with new algorithms that emerge in the coming years. The hybrid approach enables you to make a smooth transition and spread the cost, with minimal risk to your return on investment. Systems that support hybrid algorithms can provide migration path when high priority assets are protected first with PQC hybrid algorithms, and while the migration process in the environment is in progress, low priority assets can continue to use classic algorithms without service interruptions.

What is File Encryption?
========================

_File encryption keeps data safe — even when hackers get to it. Here’s how file encryption maintains a base level of security while preparing organizations for developing threats._

In today’s security climate, exposed data is a surefire way to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of your entire enterprise. The best way to ensure that data is safe even in the event of a breach is to ensure that files are always encrypted. Think of it this way: a hacker could break into a healthcare facility and reach a file where patient medical documents are stored. If the files are encrypted, the hacker won’t be able to do much with this indecipherable data and will feel inclined to move on to an easier target.

However, how file encryption is performed determines the degree of security it can provide. In this guide, we’ll explore what file encryption consists of, when data is most vulnerable, how to encrypt a file, and what types of file encryption should be used for optimal data protection.

What is File Encryption?
------------------------

File encryption transforms data into code that only intended recipients can decipher, preventing unauthorized users from being able to access, view, and understand sensitive information. It often relies on [public key cryptography](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cryptography), where key pairs are generated by particular mathematical algorithms that are hard to crack. These [key pairs](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh-keys) are issued only to predetermined recipients and senders and no one else, forming a lock-and-key mechanism that encrypts and decrypts data in transit, in use, and at rest.

What is File Encryption Used For?
---------------------------------

Businesses, organizations, enterprises, and agencies all have data in need of safeguarding. From a healthcare facility updating a patient’s medical record to a national bank interacting with consumer financial data — a wide range of personal information needs to be shielded from the public eye and must only be accessible to administrators with restricted privileged access.

With [data breaches](https://www.ssh.com/academy/password-credential-breaches) and identity theft on the rise, encrypting files not only means protecting an organization’s reputation and trustworthiness — it means protecting people and their valuable assets.

File encryption is also a key pillar of cybersecurity, with national and global policies requiring its use. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ([CCPA](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1121)), the US’s Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ([HIPAA](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-104publ191/pdf/PLAW-104publ191.pdf)), the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679)), and Canada’s Federal Information Processing Standards ([FIPS](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-3.pdf)) are just a few of many regulations setting standards and guidelines for sufficient file encryption.

Which Files Do You Need To Encrypt?
-----------------------------------

All confidential or sensitive files should be encrypted at all times, although specific data types warrant extra care and caution. These include:

*   **Business Operations Data:** Files containing client contracts, financial transactions, payment histories, and customer negotiations should be kept secret. Otherwise, lax data security measures can compromise client relationships and cost an enterprise its brand and business.

*   **Legal Data:** By law, all legal data surrounding ongoing proceedings must be encrypted and protected in all its states, to prevent the case’s outcome from being jeopardized. Moreover, all communications with lawyers, paralegals, business partners, and all other parties to a case must be protected.

*   **Human Resources Data:** Employers possess a lot of personal data about their employees, including their wage and banking accounts, contractual obligations, contact information, social security numbers, medical documentation, and more. This diverse array of data makes companies a prime target for hackers and malicious internal actors looking to exploit financial and identity-based assets.

Bear in mind that all applications that facilitate the sharing, editing, and storage of this data should be closely monitored and adequately fortified with encryption features for end-to-end protection.

When Should Files Be Encrypted?
--------------------------------

It also matters _when_ data is encrypted and, ideally, it should be encrypted at all times. Leaving data in plain, readable text, even for a few moments, is often just enough time for an adversary to wrongfully obtain private data. As a result, end-to-end encryption should be prioritized — this means data should be encrypted in transit, in use, and at rest. [This is also mandated by the US Government.](/blog/us-government-moves-to-zero-trust-jit)

### Data in Transit

Data in this state is on the move. It’s being shared, sent, and transferred back and forth between users and devices. Whether through [email communications](https://www.ssh.com/products/email-encryption-solution), video chat platforms, or social media channels, unencrypted data can easily fall into the wrong hands when traveling across the internet.

Perimeter-based security measures like firewalls and VPNs help maintain data security and user anonymity on networks. However, adopting additional security solutions for well-rounded coverage is recommended — for example, privileged access management ([PAM](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam)) software and data loss prevention ([DLP](https://www.ssh.com/academy/data-loss-prevention)) systems that restrict access to sensitive material, automate monitoring tasks, and deploy vulnerability notifications.

### Data in Use

Data being manipulated or accessed in real-time is highly vulnerable because it’s already in an instantly usable state. For example, let’s say a customer is accessing their financial information through a banking app on their mobile device. Here, the customer is already logged in, with their routing number, transaction history, and balance in clear sight.

If a hacker were to breach this account in this state, they’d be able to act with the same privileges as the account owner, essentially [posing as them](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam) as they illegally withdraw, send, and spend money as they please.

One of the greatest threats to data in use is [human error](https://www.ssh.com/blog/in_defense_of_dumb_user), which makes automated encryption solutions crucial. In today’s hybrid on-premises and [cloud](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/cloud-service-providers) work environments, such encryption must also be an interoperable process, translating and moving with data as it’s used in different contexts and applications.

### Data at Rest

Most organizations have a secure way of archiving confidential files so they are incredibly challenging to access without the proper credentials. However, in doing this, data is left in plain sight behind a locked door that hackers and internal adversaries can learn to bypass.

To keep files irretrievable and incomprehensible, it’s best to encrypt them at rest so that, should a breach occur, data is not lost or stolen. In this case, identity access management ([IAM](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework)) systems and strict privileged access policies are key to warding off cybercriminals harnessing stolen credentials to access private files.

How to Encrypt a File?
----------------------

As mentioned, encryption typically uses public key cryptography, but there are several types to be aware of, as they hold unique benefits for differing use cases. The first is [asymmetric cryptography](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication#asymmetric-cryptography---algorithms), which consists of public and private keys assigned to users for secure and encrypted interaction. [Public keys](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys#public-keys) are used to encrypt files, while [private keys](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys#private-keys), which differ per user, decrypt files explicitly intended for them. Asymmetric encryption is commonly used for activity over public networks and internet connections, such as a user sharing a picture with friends on an instant messaging platform like WhatsApp.

On the other hand, [symmetric encryption](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cryptography#practical-uses-of-symmetric-ciphers) uses just one private key to encrypt and decrypt data that’s exchanged between users. This creates a vulnerability, as a stolen private key means quick and painless access to a trove of sensitive data. Nonetheless, symmetric encryption is helpful when a vast quantity of information has to be encrypted at once, such as when organizations transfer all their data from one software application or device to another.

The type of algorithm used to encrypt files varies according to software program, but widely-used methods include:

*   **PGP and OpenPGP:** [PGP](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/passphrase#pgp-/-gpg-private-key-protection) stands for “pretty good privacy” and was developed in the 1990s by Phil Zimmermann as one of the earliest approaches to encrypted communication. It functions using asymmetric cryptography. Due to patent rights, PGP is only available through licensing with Symantec. To make PGP more widely accessible, Zimmermann released its source code, OpenPGP, for all organizations to use and apply to develop their own encryption system.
*   **[Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)](/academy/ssh):** SSH is known as the [ssh-keygen](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen) program in its open-source format. It helps connect SSH clients to SSH servers through both asymmetric and symmetric cryptography. Asymmetric cryptography is used for initial identification and connection setup, whereas symmetric cryptography is used to sustain and secure ongoing communications thereafter. SSH supports several [popular algorithms](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen#choosing-an-algorithm-and-key-size), including RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and ED25519.
*   **ZIP with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):** Relying instead on symmetric encryption, ZIP with AES compresses and encrypts files using the substitution permutation network (SPN) algorithm. Officially mandated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([NIST](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance/cybersecurity-framework)), SPN generates keys that are a minimum of 128 bits long so that adversaries using brute force will have to go through an impossible amount of combinations — potentially taking million of years to crack. ZIP with AES provides one of the strongest encryption methods to date.

The Future of File Encryption
-----------------------------

Aside from significantly increased security, there are plenty of other [major benefits of passwordless and keyless authentication](https://www.ssh.com/just-in-time-passwordless-privileged-access-management?hsLang=en). These include:

*   **Increased usability.** When static credentials are out of the picture, users can access the right information without jumping through hoops. Traditional password-based authentication has required users to create complex passwords, then store them somewhere “safe” and remember them when it comes time to log in. Additionally, plenty of enterprises require users to manually rotate passwords or keys periodically. Passwordless and keyless authentication removes the burden of management, so users can access the right data without obstacles.

*   **Cost-effective operations:** Password and key management is an expensive endeavor for IT teams. To manage passwords for a large organization, an entire team of admins may be necessary to answer customer questions, help reset passwords, and rotate and retire passwords. This process can be time-consuming and inefficient compared to a passwordless approach. Implementing passwordless authentication allows your enterprise to reduce IT management costs by avoiding the time-consuming process of password management. The same applies to key management with one fundamental difference — keys are notoriously difficult to find. In fact, most Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions are not equipped to handle keys properly, so many keys are going undetected and unmanaged.
*   **Better security:** Passwordless and keyless authentication have the potential to be a much more secure option than permanent credential-based access control. Passwords and keys have the potential to fall into the wrong hands — no matter how often they are rotated. When passwordless and keyless authentication is adopted, there is little doubt that the right user is accessing the right information.

What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)?
=============================================

Identity and access management (IAM) helps businesses to maintain optimal data security by ensuring the appropriate users get access to only the information essential to their role. As computing becomes more sophisticated, there is an increasing number of threats to traditional IAM systems. To ensure that your IAM solution is effective and secure, businesses large and small need to understand the limits of their existing IAM solution, and how to adapt access credentials to meet today’s challenges.

With the right IAM solution and processes, businesses can establish secure authentication and authorization methods, as well as encryption for in-transit and at-rest data. Let’s take a look at how a complete IAM system works.

What is Identity and Access Management
---------------------------------------

Before we get into the specifics of IAM and how to implement the right IAM solution, it’s important to clarify some key concepts. In the field of IT security, there are two main approaches to credentials management — authentication and authorization.

_Authentication_ refers to the process of assessing the identity of a subject so that an IAM system can ensure the right person is accessing secure information. _Authorization_ refers to the levels of permission allowed for authorized users. So, some authenticated users might not be authorized to access certain data.

For comprehensive access and identity management, businesses need a secure approach to both authentication and authorization. With every action a user takes, an IAM system needs to be able to identify whether the right user is accessing the right level of information. A range of IAM systems are popular in today’s IT marketplace, and this includes sub-categories like [multi-factor authentication](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/multi-factor-authentication) and [privileged access management (PAM)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam), the latter of which is intended for managing superuser, administrator, and power user level access.

It’s a common misconception that only large businesses need IAM infrastructure. While it’s true that major enterprises certainly have large amounts of information to protect against cyberattackers, small businesses are just as susceptible to cyber threats. Regardless of the scale of an organization, a data breach has the power to become a major financial setback.

To make sense of the many variations of IAM systems, it’s important to understand the key components of every identity and access management protocol. A comprehensive IAM system is able to authenticate the right users, as well as authorize the right access credentials to users based on permissions. IAM systems also include services that allow management to monitor and modify permissions, assign access capabilities, and change access credentials.

[IAM also deals with data encryption](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/identity-management) outside the realm of user credentials. Any effective approach to identity and access governance will deploy authentication/authorization technology, combined with data encryption, to protect against unauthorized access to data — whether it’s in transit or at rest.

The Importance of IAM
---------------------

The goal of any IAM solution is to ensure an organization’s data is secure. Finding the right solution to IAM is crucial to saving time and money for any organization in the internet age. Once IT admins establish an IAM framework, managing the IAM system offers a bird’s-eye view of an IT system’s access credentials.

Access and identity management are a constant in our lives, whether we know it or not. Whether you’re using two-factor authentication to access your bank account or smartphone, or using a single sign-on for a work desktop, secure networks are constantly requiring authentication. Once a user has accessed these systems, IAM technology is working in the background to ensure data is transmitted securely and stored using effective encryption.

The main objective of IAM is to prevent access to sensitive data by unwanted third parties. Whether the nefarious user is a cyberattacker or an unauthorized employee, the wrong person can do a lot of damage with sensitive information. No matter the size of a business, every business has information that needs to be transmitted and stored securely.

The Benefits of IAM
-------------------

There are plenty of obvious advantages of IAM, and some benefits that may be less evident. Preventing a data breach is perhaps the central reason why IAM is so important — a data breach can lead to massive loss in profits and productivity, not to mention a loss in customer confidence. Other advantages include increased operational efficiency, fewer computing errors, and successful security audits.

Another major advantage of IAM is its ability to adapt to new threats. Traditional access control, like passwords and manual credentials allocation, can only go so far in securing your IT systems against innovative threats. IAM providers offer a range of security services to keep up with an evolving IT security landscape, with threats ranging from dynamic access control to quantum computing threats.

With the right IAM systems, businesses are able to expand the scope of their operations, without compromising data security. As a business expands, an effective IAM system will be able to provide secure access to customers and business partners alike, on widely-distributed devices. With a scalable network of devices with secure access credentials, businesses can use IAM to grow quickly and get ahead of the competition.

The Components of Access and Identity Management
------------------------------------------------

IAM systems make sense of who is accessing your IT infrastructure. Although different IAM systems include different types of access control, there are certain features that are essential for every IAM system. When it comes to regulating access permissions, there are three main components to consider:

*   **Collecting login data.** A wide variety of strategies are used to collect login information, and to determine the accessibility of a device for the attempted user. Multi-factor authentication is a common IAM approach that uses two or more identifiers to confirm the identity of a user. Biometric data is also used, which can include facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, iris recognition, and sometimes even DNA recognition.

*   **Managing user credentials.** IAM systems aren’t just complex ways to authenticate users — they also store and manage credentials of authorized users. Managing credentials allows organizations to control their protected information, and to understand who has access to data. User credentials determine who is allowed to view and edit information, and which users have lost access to data.
*   **Assigning access permissions.** In any organization, there are levels of permissions required to access certain information. Assigning access permissions helps to ensure that the most sensitive company data is available only to the most authorized users. IAM systems can automatically determine which permissions are available to lower-privileged users, and which ones require a higher level of authorization.

An IAM system can be on-premises, in the cloud, or a hybrid model. When implementing an IAM solution, large and small organizations often turn to a third-party IAM provider with a trustworthy reputation for data protection. Third-party providers can provide authentication and identity as a service, with added security and reliability.

Automation in Identity and Access Management
--------------------------------------------

Automating IAM has benefits that reach far beyond just the convenience of a hands-off credentials management system. In today’s IT landscape, automation is practically a necessity for secure and efficient credentials management. Third-party IAM services provide key benefits that aren’t readily available with manual IAM. Automation allows users to save time and money, with benefits that include:

*   **Operational efficiency.** Automated IAM systems allow organizations to provision and deprovision users in real time, which helps to streamline operations. As soon as a change in authority is detected, automated IAM can change credentials instantly. For large organizations, this can make a huge difference in operational speed.

*   **Data security.** Security and automation are deeply connected in the world of identity and access governance. Automation allows IAM to operate with more precision than manual provisioning, which allows automated systems to reduce human error. With an automated IAM system, organizations can manage large amounts of sensitive information, and immediately deprovision a user who has lost access privileges.

*   **Financial savings.** Automation in identity and access management offers major financial savings. By improving operational efficiency, companies can avoid paying for the extensive labor involved in manual IAM — not to mention the very real cost of human error. Better security and faster results can lead to a significant return on investment.

Implementing Identity and Access Governance for the Enterprise
--------------------------------------------------------------

Innovative IAM systems aren’t just for major companies with thousands of credentials — the financial and security benefits of automation are just as readily available for smaller businesses, too. Before investing in IAM automation, it is always wise to implement new IAM processes in phases. By deploying an IAM system in tiers, with the least sensitive information first, enterprises can avoid overwhelming users with new technology. Plus, tiered deployment allows IT admins to ensure the new IAM system actually works before applying it to their entire IT infrastructure.

As IAM technology continues to evolve, administrators are able to increase both the accuracy and efficiency of access provisioning for even the largest user networks. The right IAM system should offer a maximum degree of security, while still offering IT admins the ability to view and modify credentials manually, if necessary. Access to IAM systems should also involve multiple levels of review, to ensure security in managing high-level data.

[Privileged access management (PAM)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam) is an effective component of any IAM solution, allowing admins to rotate and store passwords, and manage passwords with a centralized vault. Key encryption is another effective way to ensure secure access to IT systems. Some more advanced PAM solutions allow organizations to [rid themselves of managing, vaulting and rotating passwords and keys entirely](https://www.ssh.com/blog/better-without-permanent-access). With a wide range of options available for automated IAM, businesses can decide which approach is best for their security needs.

There’s also an argument to be made for [implementing a robust PAM system before implementing IAM](https://www.ssh.com/blog/why-pam-should-come-before-iam). After all, it’s the admins, power users, and superusers who set up your IAM system, and their access is managed by PAMs.

The SSH Zero Trust Access Management Suite
------------------------------------------

SSH is bringing an innovative approach to IAM/PAM with the [Zero Trust Access Management](https://www.ssh.com/ssh-zero-trust-access-key-and-secrets-management) suite of solutions, which includes our Universal Key Manager (UKM) Zero Trust and PrivX PAM solutions. It combines PAM and enterprise key management into a powerful and centralized solution.

With both UKM Zero Trust and PrivX Zero Trust, you can secure your existing privileged passwords and SSH encryption keys while migrating to a passwordless and keyless environment at your own pace. This means you can radically reduce the number of keys and credentials you need to rotate, delete, vault, upgrade, and manage.

UKM Zero Trust and PrivX Zero Trust offer zero touch and immutable SSH access governance, so you can ensure your users only get the least privilege and just enough access (JEA) to get the job done — this is achieved without making changes to the SSH configuration files. You are able to onboard machine connections to Zero Trust access models without touching the application code, enabling you to make your infrastructure immutable.

By combining secure PAM password management with enterprise key management, you can manage both passwords and encrypt privileged access keys. To start implementing your new IAM solution, read our [white paper on the topic](https://info.ssh.com/passwordless-keyless-white-paper) or [request a demo](https://info.ssh.com/get-a-demo-now-of-any-ssh.com-product-or-service?hsCtaTracking=7c9fe0c3-72da-4c1c-a508-84923d8da2e7%7C161607c2-3c99-424b-8365-5fd24fd0a73b) and take control of your IT security just in time.

What is the Zero Trust Framework?
---------------------------------

The Zero Trust framework describes a strict approach to cybersecurity in which every individual or device that attempt to access a private network, whether they are located inside or outside of that network, must be identified and authorized. Unlike other security models, which automatically trust individuals and devices that are already within the corporate network, zero trust advocates trusting no one at any time. The model was first described by John Kindervag, then a principal analyst at Forrester Research, in 2010.

Principles of Zero Trust
------------------------

Zero Trust can best be described by the axiom “don’t trust, always verify.”

It acknowledges that traditional IT security models that seek to protect networks from outside threats but that inherently trust individuals or devices already within the network, are flawed. The reason is because that trust could be misplaced: there may be insider threats within the network in the form of an employee who wants to compromise corporate data, or a device that has been compromised by an outside attack, or a set of user security credentials that has been stolen by a bad actor outside of the organization.

Zero Trust proposes that by inherently trusting all users or devices within a network, traditional IT security models leave open the possibility that unchecked bad actors could roam freely within the corporate network, accessing more corporate data along the way, and raising the potential scale and severity of a cyberattack.

Zero Trust strategies
---------------------

By comparison, the argument with Zero Trust is that organizations should assume their network has already been compromised and implement strategies or technologies to minimize further risk. Several of those strategies include:

### Segregation of Duties (SoD)

This principle (also know as separation of duties) describes the idea that no one individual or device should have full access to all of an organization’s critical IT sources. If that were to happen, then a hacker who gains control of that individual or device’s security credentials would have unfettered access to everything in the corporate network.

Examples of too broad access include network firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs). They isolate and limit access to technology resources and services but once you gain entry, you are trusted by default.

Another important dimension of SoD is that no individual should have multiple roles especially in the critical parts of the software publishing pipeline. For example, no developer should have access from test to production or be able to self-elevate privileges without proper oversight.

### Least privilege access

In practice, the segregation of duties is achieved by giving each user a role with least privilege access, meaning that every user or device within the network can access only the most essential resources they need, and nothing else. The benefit is that if that user’s credentials or device is compromised by an outside attack, a hacker would only have access to that device’s environment, and nothing more than that, which reduces the potential security risk.

### Microsegmentation

Similarly, the Zero Trust model favors microsegmentation, which involves splitting up the corporate IT environment into security zones and requiring separate authorization in order to access each of those zones. This practice limits the chance that a hacker could “jump” from one part of the network to another in order to access and compromise more sensitive data.

### Multifactor authentication

This principle requires more than one method of authentication to verify user credentials. For example, rather than relying on a password alone, multifactor authentication might require that a user also input a secret code that has been sent to an email address or a mobile phone number that only the user should have access to.

### Just-in-time access

[Just-in-time access](/academy/iam/just-in-time) is built around the idea that no user or machine identity should have permanent, always-on access to a critical resource. Instead, the identity is verified each time a connection is established but the authorization to access a resource disappears automatically after establishing the connection. This ensures that the identity requesting access goes through the required security controls every time.

### Auditing and tracking

A proper audit trail of activities ensures that there's always an up-to-date log of every connection along with a verified identity. Moreover, many Zero Trust solutions offer session recordings for knowing exactly what actions were taken in a session. This is very useful for forensics and for reporting in [Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)](/academy/ssh/security-orchestration/siem) systems.

### Zero Trust technologies

A number of technology solutions have been created to address aspects of the Zero Trust framework, including but not limited to:

*   [Identity access management (IAM)](/iam)
    
*   [Privileged access management (PAM)](/iam/pam)
    
*   Multifactor authentication
    
*   Encryption software
    

SSH.COM has developed a comprehensive set of Zero Trust solutions to mitigate the risk of managing digital keys, privileged passwords and other secrets (like API tokens or certificates) by greatly reducing their numbers in IT infrastructures.

=========================================================

What is Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)?
=========================================

Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) is a concept where secure remote access is granted to an organization’s data, applications, network devices, industrial control systems (ICS), and services based on a [‘don’t trust, verify’ framework (Zero Trust framework)](/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework). This means that no person, device, or machine has always-on access or authorization to a target, but the validity and the legitimacy of access are verified every time it’s granted.

ZTNA has one particular difference to virtual private networks (VPNs): in a Zero Trust Network Access model, access is granted only to specific targets, whereas VPNs grant access to an entire network or at least a significant portion of it. Work from home, outsourcing, and distributed services make secure remote access increasingly common, and ZTNA solutions were developed to meet the demands of this shift.

[](#solutions)[Deploying ZTNA](#deploying-ztna)  
[Just-in-Time Zero Trust Access Management for ZTNA](#jit-zero-trust-access-management-for-ztna)  
  

How Does ZTNA Work?
-------------------

When ZTNA is properly applied, every user needs to authenticate to the ZTNA service or authority before access to a specific resource is granted. The user is always verified and identified every time they attempt to access a target. If the target requires elevated access privileges, access is limited to the minimal level required to get the job done in order to mitigate risks and align with the [principle of least privilege](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/what-is-least-privilege).

Once the connection is established, the ZTNA solution grants access to the specific application and encrypts the connection to offer an extra layer of security even if the connection is from inside the network.

There are two main reasons for this. First, in the Zero Trust model, there are no trusted zones, devices, or users, so every connection should be protected as if it was made over a public cloud. Secondly, restricting privileges and encrypting connections prevents other users from getting visibility into other applications or servers that they are not entitled to access. Too broad access privileges increase the risk of lateral movement inside the network, meaning that the user can hop from one server or application to another or get an overview of the network setup if the access privilegesallow so.

Benefits of ZTNA
----------------

### Zero Trust Network Access for distributed workforce

Enterprises employ a mix of in-house experts, subcontractors, consultants, and temporary workforce, and they all need different types of access for different durations of time, from various geographical locations. A dynamic ZTNA solution helps with the joiners-movers-leavers process by linking the right identity with the right target for the right time duration with the right level of privilege for the task at hand.

### ZTNA for multi-cloud & hybrid environments

Applications, critical data, and servers are also scattered around the globe. Companies host and manage cloud servers in-house, maintain legacy ones as on-premise installations, buy cloud computing services from multiple vendors for temporary and permanent needs.

Zero Trust Network Access ensures that regardless of the maturity of the technology in use or where the applications are hosted, access is granted from a single centralized system, in a uniform fashion, and with a solid audit trail of activities.

### Eliminating permanent, always-on authorization with ZTNA

Shared credentials (like SSH keys or passwords) are always armed and can cause a lot of harm in the wrong hands. The traditional way to solve the problem is to store them in a vault, but this approach doesn’t change the fact that there is an element of permanent trust in play.

An advanced ZTNA solution authenticates and authorizes the user just-in-time for the connection and ensures that the authorization expires automatically afterward. This [ephemeral certificate](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ephemeral-certificates-and-access)-based approach eliminates permanent encryption keys and passwords from the environment, doesn’t expose secrets to the users, and leaves nothing behind to be managed.

### Continuous verification with ZTNA

Zero Trust Network Access should not only offer granular access controls and restrictions but also verify the legitimacy of the device, user, and access privileges based on a number of variables (location, context, IP address, etc.) during the session. If there is an unwanted change in any of the conditions (for example, the device is infected with a virus), a ZTNA solution should be able to disconnect the user from a critical target to mitigate risks.

Deploying ZTNA
--------------

### **Endpoint-Initiated ZTNA**

Gartner states in their “Market Guide for Zero Trust Network Access” that endpoint-initiated ZTNA is similar to how the Cloud Security Alliance defines software-defined perimeters (SDPs). Unlike traditional perimeter with a ‘castle-and-moat’ approach, a ZTNA is one type of SDP that wraps users, devices, and applications around micro-perimeters and is virtualized.

The process of information transfer in an endpoint-initiated ZTNA is as follows:

1.  The user device agent sends the user’s security context to a ZTNA controller. The security context contains, for example, geographic location, time, or date. The context typically informs the ZTNA controller about the legitimacy of the authentication request. For example, when a user tries to access an application from a PC and a mobile device from a different location, it likely means that one of those devices is compromised or otherwise violating policies.
2.  The ZTNA controller investigates the identity of the user and device to determine if they are valid and if the user is requesting access to an application that they are entitledto access. If everything is valid, both the user and the device are authenticated.
3.  The controller grants connectivity to a gateway, such as a next-generation firewall (NGFW), enforcing multiple security policies and blocking applications from being accessed directly from the internet.
4.  With access granted, the session is opened to the gateway and to the application through an end-to-end encrypted connection. In ZTNA architectures, the gateway is considered to be at the center of the network.

### Service-Initiated ZTNA

According to Gartner’s “Market Guide for Zero Trust Network Access”, a service-initiated ZTNA is similar to the Google BeyondCorp technology. A service-initiated architecture is hosted in the cloud and works without agents.

In Gartner’s description, a connector replaces a controller. The connector operates on the same network as the application and maintains a connection to the application’s cloud.

The cloud service authenticates users who request access to the application, after which an identity management solution validates the request using, for example, single sign-on (SSO). The user has access to an application proxy, which isolates applications from direct access and attacks.

=========================================================

A Guide to Zero Trust Architecture
==================================

Traditional cybersecurity allows users to move freely within a corporate network once the individual has made it past the authentication or authorization stage. However, this approach is susceptible to insider threats and misuse from privileged users, who have access to significant amounts of information — information that isn’t strictly necessary for many users’ privileged access levels.

The concept of Zero Trust architecture aims to address these vulnerabilities by ensuring that every user is authenticated at all times — eliminating the concept of a security perimeter altogether. With authentication and authorization at every level, Zero Trust is meeting the challenges of today’s cybersecurity environment head-on.

What is Zero Trust?
-------------------

The idea behind Zero Trust is simple: trust no one — even privileged users who have already proven their credentials in the network.

In a basic sense, Zero Trust architecture applies [the principle of least privilege](https://www.ssh.com/ssh-zero-trust-access-key-and-secrets-management) — that no user should be able to access any more information than their position requires. By authenticating each user at every access point, businesses can apply the principle of least privilege every step of the way. To avoid security breaches by privileged users, Zero Trust utilizes a simple mantra: never trust, always verify.

It’s important to note that Zero Trust typically involves biometric authentication and other passwordless authentication methods to authorize users. This is because privileged users, in a truly Zero Trust system, should be able to quickly navigate their network without needing to log into each access point with inconvenient passwords. By using passwordless biometric authentication, Zero Trust can make navigating within a corporate network easier, faster, and more efficient.

Zero Trust Architecture Explained
---------------------------------

Zero Trust architecture assumes that every device is compromised. With this basic assumption, Zero Trust solutions can prevent cyberattacks from even privileged users who have already been verified by the system. If a user cannot authenticate themselves at a certain access point, the Zero Trust architecture will prohibit entry. But if a verified user with the right credentials is using their privilege to attack the system, Zero Trust architecture helps to ensure the damage can be mitigated quickly and easily.

Before Zero Trust, cybersecurity relied on establishing a perimeter for any secure network. To ensure security, only privileged and verified users were allowed access to the information within the perimeter. Additionally, the perimeter allowed for free movement within the corporate network, so users didn’t have to enter passwords and other inefficient access credentials repeatedly.

A security perimeter usually consists of only on-premises devices and secure VPN connections. That means remote access is limited to devices within the perimeter of a remote VPN. With Zero Trust architecture, constant identity-based authorization allows users across networks to access the system without requiring businesses to establish a separate VPN for remote users.

Key Zero Trust Architecture Principles
--------------------------------------

Zero Trust architecture involves three basic principles for secure access: reducing risk, terminating permissions, and securing the network. Each of these Zero Trust principles allows enterprises to adapt security solutions to make their systems more secure — and easier to navigate — than ever before.

Combined, the three Zero Trust principles allow for [a sustainable and comprehensive security solution](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework). Here’s what each concept means in the context of Zero Trust.

*   **Reduce risk.** Reducing the chance of a cyberattack is the most basic principle of Zero Trust architecture. In the context of Zero Trust, reducing risk means only allowing the users to access the parts of the network they need — nothing more. Gone are the days of a security perimeter that anyone with credentials can access.
*   **Terminate permissions.** Traditional security approaches allow users access to a network but cannot terminate the permission once the user has gained access. With this system, cyberattackers can continue to operate even after they’ve been detected by a security alert. Zero Trust architecture continuously inspects network traffic, so every connection is terminated after each access point in the network.
*   **Secure the network.** Securing your network may seem like a vague concept, but protection as a Zero Trust principle is quite specific — to assess each access request using context clues. Instead of simply allowing anyone with credentials (like a password) to access the network, Zero Trust protection requires you to set policies that continuously assess the context of each login attempt.

Benefits of Zero Trust Architecture
------------------------------------

Zero Trust has become increasingly popular since its inception in 2010 — and for good reason. The three core principles of Zero Trust have continuously proven their ability to prevent cyberattacks and facilitate easy access for authorized privileged users. By reducing the amount of access, terminating connections, and protecting every part of the network, Zero Trust architecture has quickly become the gold standard for cybersecurity.

By reducing the attack surface, Zero Trust architecture can bring an unprecedented level of protection to your enterprise. More specifically, some of the key benefits of Zero Trust include:

*   **Secure cloud computing.** With decentralized devices across networks, today’s businesses often use cloud, hybrid, and multi-cloud operating systems. Zero Trust helps to protect decentralized networks while eliminating the inefficiencies and security risks of a VPN for remote access.

*   **Increased visibility.** With visibility for every access point, IT admins can view each user’s movement through the enterprise network. Using context-based authorization, Zero Trust allows administrators to flag unusual access attempts and terminate their permissions faster than ever.

*   **Better authentication of users.** Zero Trust combines biometric authentication with context-based authentication to understand which users should have access to what information. These access credentials are much more granular than traditional security permissions.
*   **Protection against insider threats.** If a verified user with the right credentials is planning a cyberattack, traditional security measures can have difficulty keeping the user from moving laterally within the organization. With authorization at each step of the way, Zero Trust allows you to prevent insider threats from wreaking havoc on your business.

Zero Trust Architecture Use Cases
---------------------------------

There are plenty of contexts where Zero Trust architecture has real-world applications. Instead of learning about the benefits of Zero Trust in an abstract sense, let’s look at some common use cases of Zero Trust security solutions.

One important use case is cloud migration. Plenty of organizations are in the process of moving to the cloud for increased flexibility, scalability, and efficiency. But the security of cloud-based organizations is often up in the air — as users move to remote devices on different networks, how can you maintain a secure perimeter? And how does cybersecurity work during the transition phase while on-premises services are being moved to cloud-based applications? With Zero Trust architecture, you can gain control and visibility over hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments, with security attached to workloads and not to devices themselves.

Audit compliance is another real-world use case for Zero Trust architecture. For businesses that need to show proof of security to comply with an industry standard, Zero Trust architecture allows you to show auditors a highly-controlled security approach with granular documentation. Any security threats and vulnerabilities can be quickly addressed, and the highly segmented recordkeeping is great for audit compliance.

These are just two examples of many potential use cases for Zero Trust architecture.

Zero Trust vs. Other Frameworks
-------------------------------

Even though Zero Trust may be an intuitive and effective way to protect network security, traditional security perimeter models are still being adopted by new enterprise systems. A potential explanation for this is the prevalence of password-based authorization, which could make Zero Trust architecture very difficult to achieve — or at least highly inefficient. But biometric security is an easy way to streamline Zero Trust access and avoid burdening your users with constant authentication requests.

Other, newer frameworks exist in competition with Zero Trust architecture. A major alternative is the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework, which provides a detailed set of security standards for minimizing cyber threats in the context of modern enterprise systems — whether on-premises or in the cloud.

While [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) hasn’t traditionally included Zero Trust, it is gradually beginning to adopt many protocols that were introduced by the Zero Trust framework, like per-session authentication. As other security frameworks begin to look more like Zero Trust, it’s easy to see why Zero Trust is at the vanguard of enterprise cybersecurity.

Zero Trust Architecture is the Future
-------------------------------------

Since its inception, Zero Trust architecture has proven highly effective in real-world scenarios. “Never trust, always verify” allows organizations to implement principles that almost entirely eliminate the risk of security breaches — and greatly reduce the scale of security breaches that occur.

The effectiveness of Zero Trust is apparent in organizations that are beginning to use Zero Trust services. Even [the US government has begun](https://www.ssh.com/blog/us-government-moves-to-zero-trust-jit) implementing Zero Trust security measures, which President Joe Biden formally identified in a recent move towards greater cybersecurity. This Executive Order (called Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles) shows how much Zero Trust has become the gold standard in today’s cybersecurity landscape.

Even when data is encrypted, traditional security perimeters are woefully inadequate at defending against insider threats. Additionally, the expansion of today’s cloud computing means that perimeter security must be increasingly expanded, causing inefficiencies and frustration with frequent password and access credential requests. With an answer to all of these concerns, it’s clear why the Zero Trust model has become widely recognized as the future of cybersecurity.

/. 048 [Active Directory](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/active-directory)
=========================================================

How Does Active Directory Work?
===============================

Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft’s solution to information management. Using Active Directory Domain Services, network administrators can access all the sensitive information available in an enterprise network, using a hierarchical structure typical of all directory services.

To help you make sense of IT roles and responsibilities, passwords, and other information that only privileged administrators should access, Active Directory offers policy-based directories to facilitate clear, structured management.

Ensuring the security of your Active Directory domain is an essential aspect of Active Directory management. For optimum security in today’s cyberscape, Active Directory management requires a Zero Trust approach, which eliminates the risk of compromise at the highest level.

This article will provide an introduction to how Active Directory works, and how Active Directory Domain Services are facilitating network organization, even as networks become increasingly complex.

[What Are the Benefits of Active Directory?](#benefits)  
[Managing Active Directory Security](#security)  
[Securing Your Active Directory Infrastructure with PrivX](#privx)

What is Active Directory?
-------------------------

Active Directory (AD) was founded in 2000 and offers directory services for networks that use Windows domain services. Active Directory was to enable Windows users to manage networks using a centralized directory, where data is stored for administrative access. The directory contains important details about servers, resources, computers, scanners, and other in-network IT devices that are grouped together into units known as “domains”.

Managing the Active Directory requires a hierarchical approach. Like other directories, access to all of the directory data is granted to a very small number of privileged users at the highest tier. Other users are given credentials to access information at their appropriate levels.

In Active Directory, there are several services that provide different administrative capabilities for domains, trees, and entire forests of users. Active Directory Domain Services is the service that offers security management, as well as convenient access to queries and filters. Aside from Domain Services, other AD services include Rights Management Services, Lightweight Directory Services, and more. Multiple domains are managed from the Active Directory global catalog, where network device data is centrally stored.

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is also the AD service that oversees privileged access management (PAM), which determines who can access which levels of information and when. Understandably, Active Directory has the potential to be a gold mine of sensitive data for cyber attackers, if compromised.

Because Domain Services are the headquarters of overall Active Directory security management, it’s critical that you protect Domain Services with a comprehensive PAM solution. PAM in Active Directory requires admins to continuously manage privileged accounts, protect and rotate passwords, and employ encryption solutions to protect data at rest and in transit.

How Is Active Directory Structured?
-----------------------------------

Like other directory services, [Active Directory is structured hierarchically](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/understanding-the-active-directory-logical-model). At the top of the AD structure are forests — these are the ultimate security boundaries that unite objects in your inventory. Because forests offer the final security wall, objects within a tree can potentially interact with one another, but not with objects outside their forest. To interact with an object under another forest, an IT administrator will need to assign special permissions (known as a “trust”) between the two disparate objects.

Some organizations may operate with just one forest, but larger businesses might use multiple forests to separate different employee groups that have no need for interaction. Within each forest, trees refer to the hierarchical structure of domains. Domains are a collection of objects that have related credentials, and multiple objects from a single administrative user or office can exist within one domain.

Which Protocol Is Used By Active Directory?
-------------------------------------------

Within Active Directory’s forest-tree-domain structure, Domain Services allows you to manage your domain security from a server known as a domain controller. Each domain can have its own domain controller, which contains a working knowledge of the objects within its AD domain. Using a global catalog server, IT admins can manage multiple domain controllers within a single AD server.

Traditionally, Active Directory domain controllers aren’t available from just any device. Domain Services run on specific protocols, which are available using infrastructure from Microsoft. These feasible protocols include DNS, LDAP, and Kerberos. It is also possible to deploy Active Directory Domain Services from the cloud using Microsoft Azure Active Directory.

What Are the Benefits of Active Directory?
------------------------------------------

For the past two decades, Active Directory has become an industry standard for network security and management. Although Active Directory has evolved from a purely on-premises service to a potentially hybrid or cloud-based service, there are several benefits that make Active Directory a highly secure — and user-friendly — way to manage your network.

Active Directory uses a variety of effective methods for managing network security and user permissions. These include:

*   **Streamlined network management.** Effective IT management requires a centralized control system, with an efficient interface. With Active Directory, you can view an intuitively-structured tree of domains, each with relevant objects and permissions available with a single click.

*   **User-friendly access.** End-users find AD to be a smooth experience, which helps to avoid frustration from customers and employees alike. With clear permission policies, users don’t have to log in any more than absolutely necessary, avoiding multiple layers of passwords or blocked access for something within their privilege.

*   **A wide range of AD services.** Since its inception in 2000, Active Directory has taken many shapes and sizes. Whether you’re managing your network with on-premises Domain Services, or a hybrid/cloud Azure Active Directory, you can find AD services that match your enterprise needs.
*   **Secure device management.** Administrators can identify objects based on a variety of security identifiers, like passwords and login times. All these identifiers are visible from Active Directory Domain Services, which offers a bird’s-eye view of domain objects, management hierarchies, and security protections.

Managing Active Directory Security
----------------------------------

Because Active Directory offers a centralized management solution for passwords, access credentials, and security hierarchies, it’s crucial that you secure AD with a strong PAM solution. Cyber attackers often attempt to use passwords and other stolen credentials to access privileged user accounts. By providing privileged user management and no more data availability than absolutely necessary, Active Directory allows you to manage who can access what data and what each user is allowed to do.

Because Active Directory is the key to accessing so much sensitive information, industry audits, from HIPAA to SOX, require secure AD management. To ensure effective AD security, it’s important to minimize the permissions of each user in your organization. This basic principle of privileged access management allows you to minimize damage from a single password leak or an unintended insider threat.

In addition to managing permissions, AD security requires constant monitoring for security threats. This means you must regularly view Group Policy controls in your AD Domain Services and identify any potential vulnerabilities in your domain objects. By reviewing and updating Group Policy, you can ensure each object is accessible to only the most necessary users. Regular monitoring also allows you to identify security compromises by flagging suspicious changes to policies.

Securing Your Active Directory Infrastructure with PrivX 
-------------------

In Microsoft Active Directory, the “directory” is a collection of objects within a single domain. When it’s time to manage your IT infrastructure, each directory is different. Objects can include individual computers, scanners, printers, and users with specific permissions. Ensuring Active Directory security requires security monitoring for these domain objects, as well as access credentials for your entire organization.

Enter [PrivX](https://www.ssh.com/products/privileged-access-management-privx). From the minds at SSH, [PrivX syncs with Active Directory](https://www.ssh.com/products/privileged-access-management-privx) for a comprehensive PAM solution for Active Directory admins. PrivX is a Zero Trust solution that allows for automated password management — including automated password rotation and vaulting. Plus, PrivX offers passwordless access with ephemeral access certificates based on biometric authentication. This means you can maintain your current passwords while migrating to passwordless at a pace that suits you.

For IT admins at all levels, PrivX offers a streamlined and automated approach to Active Directory security. You can keep audit trails, automate credential management, and keep track of on-premises or cloud-based AD environments.

/. 049 [Ephemeral Certificates & Ephemeral Access](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ephemeral-certificates-and-access)
=========================================================

Ephemeral Certificates and Ephemeral Access
===========================================

One of the most common methods of establishing a secure remote connection between a client and a server is by using the [Secure Shell protocol](/academy/ssh) and [SSH key](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/) pairs which are configured for the client and the server separately. Typically, this type of access is called [privileged access](/academy/iam/pam), since the connection is made to environments with highly valuable or sensitive information.

However, key configuration is often manual and time-consuming, especially in fast-moving multi-cloud and hybrid environments, where access needs are often temporary and changes are constant.

Moreover, SSH keys never expire by default and can be self-provisioned without proper governance, and often provide too much privilege for the task at hand, which decreases the security posture of the environment.

Ephemeral, certificate-based access operates differently. While the connections are still established using existing encryption protocols (SSH/RDP/HTTPS), the primary method of access to the target host is authorized using various industry-standard certificates.

Even if the target server does not support certificate-based access, there are other options available.

* [Windows RDP access](#windows-rdp-access) 
* [Non-certificate access](#non-certificate-access) 
* [Ephemeral certificate-based solutions](#ephemeral-certificate-based-solutions)

How do ephemeral certificates work?
-----------------------------------

In ephemeral certificate-based authorization, the target systems are accessed without the need for permanent access credentials, explicit access revocation or traditional SSH key management.

For each session, the ephemeral certificate:

*   is issued from the [Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority), which serves as the trusted third party
    
*   is based on various industry-standard methods, the chief example being the short-lived X.509 certificate
    
*   encodes the target user ID for security
    
*   has a short lifetime (5 minutes) after which it auto-expires
    

The access is also called ‘credential-less, keyless or passwordless, since on establishing the connection the user does not handle or see privileged access credentials at all.

Instead, the user logs in to the Certificate Authority each time he or she wants to establish a secure remote connection without having permanent authorization to the environment.

This always-temporary access aligns well with the [Zero Trust framework](/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework) which stipulates that every connection should be verified each time it is made.

It also supports the [Just-in-Time authentication](/academy/iam/just-in-time) paradigm where the secrets needed to access a target are created on the fly at the time of establishing the connection, but then expire soon after. This leaves no secrets behind to misuse and ensures that every connection is established every time as a fresh instance without permanent, always-on authorization.

User access configuration
-------------------------

The Certificate Authority controls access to the target system based on user roles, which are created based on rules. The rules for particular roles are generated according to security policies and access requirements.

The Certificate Authority fetches the rules for each role from the IAM system and uses them to determine proper authentication. This system alleviates setting up access for each individual user and enables streamlined updates to groups of users.

Target system access configuration
----------------------------------

The target systems must be configured to support credential-less access. The configuration is static, meaning that it needs to be done only once when the servers are provisioned.

Credential-less access does not change if the user roles/job functions change or users are added or removed from the identity management system. The target systems must be re-provisioned only if there are changes in the roles and their mappings to the operating system level accounts that define which access roles have the right to perform which functions on the target server.

The configurations that allow credential-less access are like templates that serve a function. This means that multi-cloud instances (such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud or OpenStack) can be scaled up and down at will, but the templates remain immune to the changes and continue to provide access as per purpose, for example, access to financial data, system databases, production environment etc.

Ephemeral certificates in conjunction with secure protocols
-----------------------------------------------------------

### OpenSSH certificates

The SSH access is implemented with [OpenSSH](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/openssh/) certificates. The certificates encode the user roles and the SSH server configuration on the target server maps the roles into the operating system level accounts.

### Windows RDP access

The Windows RDP access is implemented with a virtual smart card. The Certificate Authority acts as the smart card in RDP authentication. The smart card’s certificate is created on-demand when the user opens the RDP connection.

The certificate is enrolled for an ephemeral keypair which is discarded after the authentication has been completed. The virtual smart card authentication is fully automated and invisible for the end users.

### Non-certificate access

If the target server does not support [OpenSSH](/academy/ssh/openssh) or RDP certificates, the Certificate Authority uses role keys instead. The role keys are standard SSH keypairs. The public key associated with the role key is configured for the file that defines which private keys are allowed to access the target host, and the corresponding private key is held in the Certificate Authority secure key storage.

The user will never get access to the [private key](/academy/cryptography/private-key) that is associated with the role. Users can only use it indirectly via the Certificate Authority to authenticate and authorize the access, based on their access role defined in the Certificate Authority.

Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment (CARTA)
=====================================================

The Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment ([CARTA](https://www.gartner.com/en/webinars/3891406/the-7-imperatives-of-continuous-adaptive-risk-and-trust-assessme)) is a strategic approach to IT security that favors continuous cybersecurity assessments and contextual decision-making based on adaptive evaluations of risk and trust. CARTA was introduced by [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com) in 2010 as an evolution of its [Adaptive Security Architecture](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/build-adaptive-security-architecture-into-your-organization/).

* [CARTA principles](#carta-principles) 
* [How to implement CARTA](#how-to-implement-carta) 
* [The three phases of CARTA IT security and risk management](#the-three-phases-of-carta-it-security-and-risk-management)

CARTA principles
----------------

CARTA seeks to make sense of the “gray” world of modern IT security, where not all security decisions can be black and white.

Traditional IT security solutions favor black and white decisions, essentially decide whether to fully block or allow access to IT networks based on the potential for risk. However, digital transformation has created an IT environment where those black and white decisions are no longer possible.

Companies that offer digital services to consumers must, by nature, open up aspects of their corporate network to many more users than they ever would have in the past. Employees are now bringing more unmanaged devices into the workplace, and they are using those devices to connect to corporate networks. Businesses must open up their IT networks to a larger group of third-party partners and service providers, who might connect via their own apps and services. And the nature of remote work means that a corporation’s IT perimeter is no longer restricted to its own four walls – users who might need to access corporate data via public networks in airports, coffee shops, and more.

CARTA proposes that all of these factors have created a reality where traditional block/allow security solutions don’t allow for enough contextual decision-making and real-time security evaluation. Security solutions cannot simply block user access to corporate networks because the user is not located within the organization’s four walls – that would inhibit the daily flow of work.

Indeed, the block/allow security strategy may create more risk overall, because it inherently trusts all users or devices that have been “allowed” within the network, failing to re-evaluate any users or devices that may be unknowingly compromised, which leaves open the possibility of [zero-day attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)), insider threats, or risk from compromised credentials.

At the same time, the organization cannot open the flood gates to all new users at all times – that would create a tremendous security risk.

How to implement CARTA
----------------------

CARTA advises continuously evaluating all users or devices and making contextual access decisions. It's [rooted in the Zero Trust framework](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3895267/zero-trust-is-an-initial-step-on-the-roadmap-to-carta), which advocates that no user or device – even those that are already within the network – should be inherently trusted.

The three phases of CARTA IT security and risk management
---------------------------------------------------------

**Run**: In this phase, organizations rely on analytics to detect anomalies in real time. Automated solutions allow this detection to happen regularly and much sooner than if this evaluation were done manually. The net benefit is that the organization can respond to potential threats much sooner.

**Build**: This phase goes hand-in-hand with the concept of DevSecOps. It involves baking security into the development process by always evaluating and identifying security risks before they are built into production code. Since many modern applications are pieced together using publicly available libraries mixed with custom code, organizations need to make sure they are scanning those libraries for security risks before adding it to their program. Similarly, companies must evaluate ecosystem partners, including third-party developers or digital service providers, who need to interact with their environment.

**Planning**: Finally, organizations need to set their priorities. How much security risk are business leaders willing to accept in order to tap into the new opportunities afford by modern IT environments? If your organization decides it wants to move to the public cloud, how will you address the security implications inherent in that decision? If remote work is preferred among your staff, how will the IT environment need to evolve in order to support that? By thinking through modern IT and establishing priorities, businesses will be in a better position to make contextual decisions and avoid the black/white decision-making of traditional IT.


/. 051 [Identity Management](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/identity-management-and-ssh-keys)
=========================================================

Identity and Access Management & SSH Keys
=========================================

[Identity and access management (IAM)](/academy/iam) is the foundation of information security. IAM addresses the basic need of any organization to be able to **reliably identify users**, and to be able to **control which users get access** to which resources.

These two basic controls - identity and access - lay the foundation of security in the corporate environment. Every regulatory system in cybersecurity starts from the requirement to control who has access to which systems and data and having a well-defined process for granting and revoking such access. It is the basis of information security. The rest is mostly just about enforcing this access.

SSH Keys Grant Access
---------------------

[SSH keys](/academy/ssh/ssh-key-basics) are access credentials that are typically used for provisioning operating system-level access to servers for automatic processes, file transfers, and system administrators. The basic idea is to configure a private key on a client machine, and the corresponding public key on a server machine. Possession of the private key grants access to the server. In [SSH](/ssh/), this is called [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication).

Most existing identity management frameworks focus on access control for normal end users. Service accounts used for running application software generally receive much less attention, yet such accounts can provide much more powerful access.

Many identity and access management projects focus on _privileged access_, typically meaning access by system administrators to [root](/academy/iam/root-user-account) accounts and service accounts. Privileged access is typically controlled by forcing users to log into a [jump server](/academy/iam/jump-server) that logs all their access. This is generally achieved by having the passwords for controlled accounts stored in a password vault and changed frequently by an automatic process.

It is common for system administrators to install SSH keys on privileged accounts or root accounts that they regularly use, so that they can **bypass going through jump servers**. While this may be convenient, it violates policy and compliance, and eliminates accountability.

SSH Keys Can Be Self-Provisioned and Never Expire
-------------------------------------------------

SSH keys are special that they allow **self-provisioning** and **never expire**. A user who logs into an account can install new [authorized keys](/ssh/authorized_keys/) that permit that user (or anyone in possession of the key) to log into the account in the future, as long as the authorized key remains configured. This can be combined with [port forwarding](/ssh/tunneling/) to allow access to the internal network from the outside and is a very common way for hackers to create backdoors into the corporate network.

It is possible to configure SSH to prevent self-provisioning by moving keys to root-owned locations. This generally involves modifying SSH configuration files to change the location of the [authorized_keys](/ssh/authorized_keys/) files, and is often called _lock-down_. This is usually one of the first steps in [managing SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management/).

SSH Keys Are Surprisingly Common
--------------------------------

SSH is used for managing routers, server hardware, virtualization platforms, operating systems, and inside systems management and file transfer applications. It is present in every data center and ships by default with every Unix, Linux, and Mac server.

System administrators have been using and installing SSH keys for the last 15-20 years. They were a very technical concept, in the system administration domain, and very few people realized they had access management implications. Even most CISOs weren't aware of SSH keys or grossly underestimated their usage. We still frequently encounter organizations that initially say they don't use SSH, or that they don't use SSH keys, but upon closer examination turn out to use it massively with hundreds of thousands of SSH keys in place.

In large Fortune 500 companies, we generally find anywhere from several hundred thousand to **over four million** SSH keys. The number is generally 5-200 keys per server, and typically about 5-20 times the number of employees in the organization. The bigger and more complex information systems, and the more Unix/Linux usage, the bigger the problem with unmanaged SSH keys tends to be. [SSHerlock](https://info.ssh.com/ssherlock-ssh-key-discovery-and-post-quantum-resilience-assessment) is a self-service software that helps understand the extent of SSH and SSH key usage in an organization.

In many cases, **more than 90% of all access credentials are SSH keys**. Typically, the identities are existing accounts, but SSH keys can be used to add more access credentials for them. It is analogous to having multiple passwords for each account.

It is typical to find SSH keys granting access from one data center to another, including to disaster recovery data centers. Access from test and development systems into production is very common in unmanaged environments, violates separation of duties, and allows passwordless access to critical systems from systems that are not as well protected. We frequently see access to credit card payment processing environment using SSH keys that crosses the PCI boundary in violation of the [PCI-DSS](/compliance/pci).

Gaping Hole in Identity and Access Management Strategy
------------------------------------------------------

[IDC](http://www.idc.com//home.jsp) published a white paper [A Gaping Hole in Your Identity and Access Management Strategy](//info.ssh.com/a-gaping-hole-in-your-identity-and-access-management-strategy-secure-shell-access-controls) in 2013 on SSH [key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/), and a Technology Spotlight [SSH Governance Is Needed to Reduce Risk and Bridge the Trusted Access Gap](//info.ssh.com/idc-white-paper-ssh-risk-governance-2016) in 2016.

[NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) published [Security of Interactive and Automated Access Management using Secure Shell](/compliance/nist-7966/) (NIST IR 7966) in 2015, which provides guidelines for managing SSH keys and maps compliance requirements into the US Government [Cybersecurity Framework](/compliance/cybersecurity-framework/) and [NIST SP 800-53](/compliance/nist-800-53/).

There is ample evidence of [malware and hackers leveraging SSH keys](/malware/). SSH keys have been used as [system level backdoors](http://moneyandstate.com/looting-of-the-fox/) in attacks that have been made public, and there are likely to have been many attacks that have not been publicized. They can be combined with [SSH back-tunneling](/ssh/tunneling/) to get inside corporate networks from the public Internet.

Unmanaged SSH keys expose organizations to grave, even existential risks. The risk is as grave as not managing user accounts and passwords. Given the government and analyst attention and the hundreds of articles written on SSH key management, nobody can claim ignorance anymore.

Compliance Requirements for SSH
-------------------------------

Unmanaged SSH keys frequently lead to access that is in violation of the [compliance regimes](/compliance/) that require **controlling who can access what systems and data**, **segregation of duties**, and **enforcing boundaries**. It is common to see configured key-based access from test and development systems into production environments, access from personal system administrator accounts into critical Oracle database accounts **bypassing privileged access controls** (e.g., bypassing Cyberark, Powerbroker, Xceedium, or Lieberman installations that are supposed to provide visibility into privileged access) and **violating** [**PCI**](/compliance/pci)**,** [**Sarbanes-Oxley**](/compliance/sarbanes-oxley/)**, or** [**NIST 800-53**](/compliance/nist-800-53/) **boundaries**.

SSH Key-Based Access to Financial Data Environments
---------------------------------------------------

Of particular concern is access into financial data environments in public companies, in violation of [Sarbanes-Oxley](/compliance/sarbanes-oxley/). Sarbanes-Oxley involves potential civil and criminal [penalties](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=223&itemId=2510) for top management. For example, Section 302(a)(4)(B) requires the CEO and CFO to certify that they "have designed internal controls to ensure that material information relating to the issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to such officers by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which the periodic reports are being prepared." A knowing or willful misrepresentation can result in **fines of up to $5 million and/or up to 20 years in prison**.

If SSH keys allow access to the service accounts holding the databases and applications related to financial systems, financial data may be modified by an attacker to hide evidence of fraud, botched deals, theft, or injection of fraudulent or manipulative data. Clearly internal controls must reasonably prevent resulting misrepresentation. Given the ubiquity of SSH keys, it would be reckless not to control SSH key based access to financial systems.


/. 052 [Jump Server](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/jump-server)
=========================================================

What is a Jump Server?
======================

_Although jump servers are phasing out, they can still offer valuable capabilities for smaller businesses needing a basic security and access management solution._

For years, jump servers (also known as jump box servers) have been used to safely bypass firewalls and allow cross-network navigation for remote devices. While not as widely used today, jump servers still provide practical applications for businesses wishing to grant remote network access to customers and employees — allowing for quick integration and interaction.

Newer, more advanced cybersecurity technology, such as [SSH-fueled tunneling](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling) and [privileged access management](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam) solutions, have diminished the popularity of jump servers. Still, jump servers can be valuable in organizations that lack the resources to upgrade their IT infrastructure.

What Does a Jump Server Do?
---------------------------

A jump server is an intermediary device responsible for funneling traffic through firewalls using a supervised secure channel. By creating a barrier between networks, jump servers create an added layer of security [against outsiders](https://www.ssh.com/blog/cybersecurity-trends-to-track) wanting to maliciously access sensitive company data. Only those with the right credentials can log into a jump server and obtain authorization to proceed to a different security zone. Administrators can also use a jump server for auditing traffic and user activity for real-time surveillance.

This connection can also move the opposite way. Virtual network computing servers, or VNC jump servers, support cross-platform screen sharing, allowing a privileged account to access a device remotely with their own mouse and keyboard controls. Those working in IT, or who have needed IT assistance, may be the most familiar with this service, where clients grant access to an authorized user to troubleshoot hardware and software issues.

Who Uses Jump Servers?
----------------------

Jump box servers are intended to manage several client-server connections simultaneously — which might be needed, for example, in a bustling data center. Typical household environments won’t benefit much from a jump box server because its capabilities aren’t needed for a personal network that only a handful of individuals use. For this reason, large and small businesses benefit the most from using jump servers, as they can enhance control and visibility over internal servers and domains, and stratify security zones for heightened breach prevention.

How Do Jump Servers Work?
-------------------------

In a typical office setting, employees have varying levels of privileged access that determine what they can do within an organization’s private network. For instance, most employees will have basic access to platforms that solely enable them to complete work tasks, whereas executives and higher-level employees are given more comprehensive access to configure settings and manage features to monitor who is using their internal servers and networks.

However, before any employee or administrator can start work, the main network must ensure that only authenticated users are entering it. Usually, at least one firewall is set up as a foundational security measure, with a jump server housed between it and an untrusted public network, such as the internet.

The jump server prompts both users and administrators for credentials and, once approved, they are granted access to their organization’s private network and servers. Based on how the administrator configured the jump server, it will authenticate users through [SSH protocol](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol) and tunneling (typically used for Unix operating systems) or via Remote Desktop Protocol (reserved for Windows devices).

It’s important to note that the role of a jump server isn’t to _grant_ segmented levels of privileged access once a user passes through it; instead, it _authenticates_ a user’s preassigned privileged credentials and serves as a gateway to an organization’s sensitive assets and resources. Privileged access is a separate feature that the administrator manually configures to each internal account.

Pros of Using Jump Box Servers 
-------------------

Before being implemented, jump box servers are hardened, meaning they have very few touchpoints. This makes it difficult for hackers to discreetly install malware or infiltrate jump box servers through brute force attacks. By their nature, jump box servers separate internal workstations from the private servers they work on so that device-related breaches can remain isolated from the entire system. Additionally, jump box servers never house sensitive data, although leaked access credentials, such as [keys](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh-keys) or passwords, can compromise the whole private network it aims to protect.

Jump box servers also improve productivity by eliminating the need to constantly log in and out of separate security zones to access certain assets and resources. Instead, authorized users can seamlessly utilize what they need without interruptions.

Cons of Using Jump Box Servers
------------------------------

Having a single access point limits any other avenues hackers can take to infiltrate a demilitarized zone — but it can also make it easier. All it takes is just one user’s credentials to gain unlimited access to an organization’s entire infrastructure. The same goes for VNC jump servers, where an ill-intentioned actor could gain complete control of a device to do whatever they please.

Jump servers also require coding expertise to configure and set up, making it difficult for those unfamiliar with script writing to install the appropriate safety precautions. This can ultimately lead to human error and vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can harness.

Jump servers should also not be relied on for complete security as they only provide front-end security, much like a firewall. Once a hacker bypasses either barrier, they can peruse an organization’s network and resources as if they were an internal user, essentially rendering the jump server obsolete.

Redefining Privileged Access with SSH
-------------------------------------

There’s a better way to access and manage devices securely: SSH’s [PrivX](https://www.ssh.com/products/privileged-access-management-privx) solution. PrivX streamlines and centralizes credentials and access management, eliminating the need for manual work.

With an emphasis on just-in-time, zero trust, and passwordless access, PrivX offers enhanced automated protection to reduce the risk of human error and leaked credentials. PrivX also functions in hybrid cloud environments, providing the flexibility and scalability today’s IoT workspaces depend on for optimal productivity. As a hybrid passwordless solution, PrivX gives users the opportunity to manage their existing credentials while migrating to a passwordless environment at their own pace.

Just-in-Time Access Provisioning
--------------------------------

Just-in-Time (JIT) access provisioning grants a user temporary, on-demand (privileged) access to IT. It’s a form of [identity access management](/academy/iam) or [privileged access management](/academy/iam/pam) that is often meant to address scenarios in which a user - who may not typically need to use certain applications or services - can receive timely access to those resources when they need it, but only for a short period of time.

Just-in-Time access provisioning can also be viewed as an alternative to the concept of standing privileges, in which a user has broad, “always-on” access resources.

In contrast, Just-in-Time access ensures that all access is alway temporary and granted just at the time of making the connection to the target.

In most cases, access is also limited per role. This is way it also follows the principle of least privileged (POLP) which is required by many policies and regulations.

The idea of no one having permanent authorization or permanent access to critical infrastructures has gained more momentum. Just-in-Timeaccess allows companies to make all access temporary by default and ensure the validity of each user, connection, role and the level of privileges at the time of establishing the connection repeatedly.

This basically eliminates implicit trust from the equation. which is also one of the core philosophies of the [Zero Trust framework](/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework) where the operating model is 'never trust, always verify'.

How is Just-in-Time Access Delivered?
-------------------------------------

One of the most effective ways to deliver Just-in-Time access to users is to use [ephemeral certificates](/academy/iam/ephemeral-certificates-and-access).

Ephemeral certificates are types of limited access security tokens that are

*   automatically created on-demand at the time of making the connection
*   configured to contain all the secrets (passwords, ssh keys) needed to establish the session
*   automatically expire after establishing the connection, leaving no secrets behind
*   and typically require no agents or configurations on the client or the server, keeping the environment [immutable](/blog/immutable-infrastructure-admin-access).

The access is also called passwordless, keyless or ‘credential-less’, since on establishing the connection the user does not handle or see access credentials at all. Find more information about [ephemeral certificates here](/academy/iam/ephemeral_access).

--------------------------------------

Just-In-Time (JIT) security tokens are any technology that grants users temporary, on-demand privileged access to IT resources. They are a technical solution to the concept of [Just-in-Time access provisioning](/iam/just-in-time), which is a form of [identity access management](/iam/identity-management) that is meant to limit the amount of time that users have access to sensitive resources, while also eliminating the [cybersecurity](/compliance) risk of lost or stolen access credentials.

Why Use Just-In-Time Security Tokens?
-------------------------------------

Just-in-Time access follows the principle of least privileged access, which is one of the core philosophies of the [Zero Trust framework](/iam/zero-trust-framework). By using limited access security tokens to grant temporary, on-demand access to critical IT resources, admins are able to shorten the window of potential attack, and eliminate the potential that misplaced or stolen access credentials can be used by bad actors to compromise corporate IT systems.

=========================================================

2FA for datacenters without installing agents
=============================================

The most common authentication method is the password. It is a single-factor authentication that is based on the user knowing a secret. It is also a rather weak form of authentication. Many organizational security policies today require their high-value assets to be secured with [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)

Adding additional factors - "something you have" in addition to the "something you know" - improves security and makes the authentication considerably more resilient to attacks. There are many approaches to implementing the second factor of a two-factor authentication (2FA) - the second factor may be, for example, a security token (such as [RSA SecurID](http://www.rsa.com/en-us/products-services/identity-access-management/securid)) or a mobile phone of the user (such as in [Duo Security 2FA](https://duo.com/solutions/features/two-factor-authentication-methods)).

Deploying Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA) for Server Farms
----------------------------------------------------------

Regardless of the technical implementation, most two-factor authentication solutions require an agent component on the server-side. This means that large deployments that cover many server instances require the installation of an agent component in **each of the protected servers**.

Many of Fortune 500 companies operate internal networks and data centers that include thousands, sometimes tens of thousands, of servers. Covering such massive back-end server volumes imposes a heavy cost - in licenses, manual work and maintenance commitments.

Deploying 2-factor authentication in corporate server volumes may be prohibitively expensive. An approach that offers equal security with considerably reduced cost is required.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication layer on top of [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth), an authorization framework. OAuth allows an end user’s account information to be used by third-party services, without exposing the user’s password. But while OAuth addresses authorization issues, it doesn’t touch authentication, which addresses processes and issues around logging in. OAuth’s lack of guidance around authentication led to complex, confusing integration scenarios in the past, and led to a need for the OIDC layer.

OIDC adds an authentication layer to OAuth
------------------------------------------

OIDC adds support for authentication, providing the ability to verify the identity of end users. It also provides the ability to obtain basic profile information about those end users. OIDC allows a range of clients, including web-based, mobile and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. It can be extended, with optional features like encryption of identity data, the discovery of OpenID Providers, and session management.

OIDC integration for identity providers and privileged access management software
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OIDC is a very useful protocol for [IAM (identity and access management)](/iam/) software vendors to integrate and connect their services as it enables different types of applications to support authentication and identity management in a secure, centralized, and standardized way.

Services that are compatible with the OpenID Connect protocol rely on identity providers to handle authentication processes and securely verify user identities. SSH.COM supports OIDC with PrivX, which enables our [privileged access management software](/products/privx/) to connect with a variety of identity providers.

* [Non-User Account](#non-user-account) 
* [Privileged Account Management](#privileged-account-management)


What Is a User Account?
-----------------------

A user account is an identity created for a person in a computer or computing system. User accounts can also be created for machine entities, such as service accounts for running programs, system accounts for storing system files and processes, and [root](/iam/user/root) and administrator accounts for system administration.

These are all a type of [privileged account](/iam/user/privileged-account) which is a user account that has more privileges than a normal user account. Other examples include database accounts, service accounts, root accounts, administrator accounts, and system accounts.

Interactive Account - a Standard User Account
---------------------------------------------

The normal user account for a person is also called an interactive account or a standard user account. Such users can usually be used to log in using a password and can be used for running programs on the computer.

Non-User Account
----------------

The term non-user account is sometimes used for referring to all user accounts that are not standard user accounts.

Privileged Account Management
-----------------------------

Privileged accounts, and particularly root and administrator accounts, grant high level privileges on computers. They can be used to surreptiously steal information, modify important data, change system configuration, and hide one's actions. They may also be used for installing and removing software and upgrading the operating system. Monitoring privileged accounts is thus very important for preventing cybercrime by employees and for detecting [malware](/malware/).

[Privileged access management](/iam/pam/) is a technology for controlling and monitoring access to privileged accounts.


/. 060 [User IDs](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/user-id)

User Id
=======

In Linux and Unix, the kernel identifies users by their user id. User ids are integers. User ids are mapped to user names in user mode programs.

[Root users](/iam/user/root) have user id 0.

Many other operating systems also use user ids. In those other systems, user ids may also be strings.

What Is the Internet of Things?
-------------------------------

IoT (Internet of Things) refers to devices that are connected to the Internet. It is a very varied field, with the devices ranging from lightbulbs and switches to cameras, printers, cars, and heavy industrial machinery. The number of such devices is expected to grow to tens of billions in a few years. It is also related to digitalization, which is one of the megatrends driving higher productivity in the industry.

Many connected devices are sold to consumers and used at home. Others are used in offices. Yet others are used in the industry or logistics. Smart cities and smart power grids are bringing the degree of connectedness to a whole new level.

IoT Security and Risks
----------------------

Security is a major limiting factor for IoT. There will be a staggering number of such devices, and some of them perform functions that can cause loss of life or disrupt important functions of the society.

Many of the first-generation devices have default passwords that are shared by all devices. Many contain design flaws that allow attackers to take full control of the devices. We have seen several attacks where the number of IoT devices taken under control has been in the millions.

A major security concern arises from the sheer number of the devices. They can be programmed to send traffic to a particular destination. When millions of devices do the same simultaneously, even the best connected sites in the world become so congested they can no longer operate. This is called a Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack, or DDoS.

Many connected devices also come with cameras and microphones. They have already been used by both criminals and intelligence agencies to snoop on individuals. Smart TVs are particularly lucrative for this, as they are often centrally placed in apartments, many come with microphones and cameras, and a recent study found that 85% of current smart TVs could be hacked over the TV broadcast channel. The CIA (US Central Intelligence Agency) has been reported to [already have used Smart TVs for espionage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/03/07/cia-wikileaks-samsung-smart-tv-hack-security/).

IoT Breach Examples
-------------------

Some examples of recent IoT breaches include:

*   [Report: Millions (and Millions) of Devices Vulnerable in latest Mirai Attacks](https://securityledger.com/2016/11/report-millions-and-millions-of-devices-vulnerable-in-latest-mirai-attacks/)

*   [Over 300 Cisco Switch Models Vulnerable](http://thehackernews.com/2017/03/cisco-network-switch-exploit.html)
    

Every day, companies and services are faced with DDoS attacks of unprecedented magnitude. It is only going to get worse as devices from toothbrushes to toasters to fridges to televisions become widely sold and exploited.

What Can the Society Tolerate?
------------------------------

People will eventually be injured and die as a result of IoT attacks. Cars will drive off the road; millions might watch their houses freeze while heating contractors are flooded with bogus calls; and emergency calls won't go through to get an ambulance to a heart attack or car crash victim.

In many cases, the connected devices are very badly designed from a security viewpoint. Manufacturers make design choices that are known to make the devices vulnerable. Attackers may render the devices vulnerable, may use them to conduct illegal activity (including drug dealing and terrorism) making the traffic look like it comes from ordinary people's homes, and may cause life-threatening harm to the society. It is not a theoretical posibility; it is happening all the time.

Eventually the society will not take it any more.

How Will the Society Solve It?
------------------------------

There are several ways the society might approach the problem.

1.  Outright ban on IoT. Not likely, because they are useful and important for economic productivity via digitalization.
    
2.  Regulations on minimum level of security, perhaps combined with certification.
    
3.  Product liability, personal injury, or wrongful death litigation and resulting substantial civil liabilities.
    
4.  Liability insurance companies requiring a certain level of security (possibly combined with certification) to provide liability insurance or to give lower premiums.
    
5.  Technical solutions that mitigate the impact of attacks. However, DDoS attack and phone call flooding mitigation is really hard, and even small-scale attacks like committing serious crimes through other people's Internet connections can be quite harmful to the parties involved. It is unlikely that technical solutions alone will solve the problem.
    

Minimum Acceptable Level of Security
------------------------------------

One very possible approach will be defining a minimum acceptable level of security for consumer IoT devices. The requirement could be driven by legal liability, insurance, or regulation. Products that meet the acceptable level would be safer from liability claims than those that blatantly disregard basic security controls and sell products that can be reasonably expected to cause unnecessary serious harm to others.

The minimum standard would likely to be a moving target, with the bar rising as new vulnerabilities are found and the worst ones have been addressed.

Key elements of the minimum acceptable security controls would include:

*   No default passwords that are the same for many devices. If passwords are used, an acceptable practice would be to manufacture each device with a unique password and print it on a sticker attached to the bottom of the device.
    
*   A way of practically getting nearly all deployed devices upgraded in reasonable time - in many cases without consumer intervention. This would probably mean automated upgrades being enabled by default.
    
*   A web user interface and overall operating system design that does not let latest versions of standard automated penetration testing suites to break in.
    
*   No unnecessary services accessible from the Internet.
    
*   No plaintext passwords (e.g., no [telnet](/ssh/telnet)).
    
*   Proper management of trusted roots and certificates.
    
*   Secure communications protocols, such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) or [SSH](/ssh/).
    
*   Proper source randomness for encryption keys - preferably a hardware random number generator.
    

How Does a Typical IoT Attack Work?
-----------------------------------

In a typical attack, the attacker gains control of an Internet-connected device using any of several means. Once the device is under control, the attacker installs additional software on the device. The device is then enlisted to perform further attacks or is used for the attacker's purposes.

Often the whole process is automated, and hacked devices are used to attack other devices. The devices often take commands from one or more command-and-control centers, which are typically just other devices on the Internet.

Sometimes access to thousands of hacked devices is sold for nefarious purposes. Such collections of devices are often called **botnets**.

How Does the Attack Penetrate a Device?
---------------------------------------

In principle, any cyberattack can be used to penetrate a device. Some of the most common are:

1.  Default passwords configured by the manufacturer that the user never changed.
    
2.  Easily guessable passwords that the attacker tries, and often succeeds.
    
3.  Well-known vulnerabilities in software that haven't been patched. Many IoT devices are never upgraded and consumers don't know to or how to upgrade them. Besides, who wants to be upgrading their toaster or fridge all the time?
    
4.  Basic Web user interface design flaws.
    
5.  Basic flaws in an authentication sequence.
    
6.  Flaws in key management, such as in verifying the authenticity of upgrades.
    

Back-End Servers in the Cloud
-----------------------------

Many IoT devices also connect to back-end systems, such as [cloud](/academy/cloud-computing-definition) servers. Some devices are paired with mobile phones, so that they can be controlled remotely. These techniques require the use of secure cryptographic protocols to be secure. They must be properly designed. They also require managing cryptographic keys and trusted [certification authorities](/pki/).

There are also many privacy issues involving data sent to such back-end systems. The data often carries a wealth of sensitive information related to location, activity, health, presence, and capacity of individuals, groups, and employees, in both public and private facilities. It may also be subject to regulations such as [HIPAA](/compliance/hipaa/security-rule) or [EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)](/compliance/eu-gdpr/).

Field Service Access
--------------------

In many heavier Internet-connected devices, the manufacturer wants to collect data about the device's operation for preventative maintenance, licensing, and service operations. Often, the customer's field service organization logs into the device. Sometimes these devices cost many millions of dollars and can cause substantial damage if a malicious party gains control. Examples include paper mills, mining machinery, and harbor cranes.

Generally, security for high-end devices is driven by the cost of process failures, local physical damage that the devices could cause, environmental impact that malfunctions could have, or immediate risk to human life.

Medical Device Security
-----------------------

Medical device security is of particular concern, as such devices often perform life-critical functions.

*   [FDA Warns that Certain Pacemakers Are Vulnerable to Hackig](https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/09/fda-warns-that-certain-pacemakers-are-vulnerable-to-hacking/)
    
*   [Hackers Can Send Fatal Doses to Hospital Drug Pumps](https://www.wired.com/2015/06/hackers-can-send-fatal-doses-hospital-drug-pumps/)
    

For medical devices, the bar on minimum acceptable controls must be much higher than consumer devices. A single medical device may kill or injure a person, while usually a single consumer devices only cause loss of privacy or risk to property. Millions of consumer devices, however, can collectively be just as dangerous as a medical device - or even more so.

Research Tool to Find Vulnerable Connected Things
-------------------------------------------------

[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) is a service for finding IoT devices on the Internet. It is targeted for researchers, but can be used for all sorts of purposes from market research to finding vulnerable devices to target in attacks. It now also has a feature for [finding cameras known to be vulnerable](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/43901/hacking/shodan-vulnerable-webcams.html).

IoT Remote Access: Accessing IOT devices for SSH
================================================

_SSH makes accessing remote IoT devices securely possible, but keeping client-server connections private requires careful management and proper configuration._

IoT devices offer automation, efficiency, and convenience, but leaving them unmonitored can open up [avenues of vulnerability](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iot). In business settings, IoT remote access is key to maintaining and monitoring IoT activity in real time to ensure safe use. Yet, common shortcuts and risky backend methods can lead cybercriminals straight into a bustling network.

  
With SSH, however, IoT remote access to devices is safe, easy to deploy, and dependable. This guide will explain how to harness the [SSH protocol](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol) to securely supervise IoT networks, keeping data confidential and people safe.

What is IoT Remote Monitoring?
------------------------------

IoT remote monitoring involves the surveillance of smart technology as they operate in tandem with each other. Typically, an administrator uses a software program or application to view the status of each IoT device from a centralized digital control center. From here, administrators can change machine settings, address malfunctions, and even log activity for auditing.

For enterprises heavily reliant on hundreds of IoT devices to meet daily business objectives, remote monitoring helps save time and money that would otherwise be spent on in-person visits, extended downtime, and troubleshooting costs.

Why is IoT Remote Access Important?
-----------------------------------

Implementations for IoT technology are scalable and virtually endless. IoT helps us manage utility usage in office buildings, automate production lines, update supply chain inventories, drive transportation vehicles, and more. However, the fact that IoT is extensively used worldwide is both an advantage and disadvantage. While more devices mean enhanced interoperability, they also mean a wider variety of access points for [hackers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/operational-technology-breaches) to infiltrate.

A lack of IoT remote access grants more time for cybercriminals to find and exploit sensitive data, disrupt [operational technology (OT)](https://info.ssh.com/secure-remote-access-management-for-operational-technology), and even inflict physical harm. For example, sensors and timers that shift traffic lights can be interrupted, potentially causing automobile accidents. Or a temperature-controlled drum could be discretely turned off, spoiling a vital ingredient in a food product. IoT remote access to IoT devices allows administrators to address unauthorized activity before any damage is done.

What Are the Benefits of IoT Remote Access to IoT Devices?
----------------------------------------------------------

Besides preventing and resolving breaches before they can inflict harm, remote access to IoT devices builds on the capabilities that come with wireless interconnectivity. For instance, from a bird’s-eye-view perspective, administrators can see where energy is being consumed and set function timers on specific devices to preserve power and extend the life of equipment and machinery. Additionally, regular firmware updates can be set to mitigate latency and operational issues arising from outdated software and application versions.

Many IoT remote access management systems for IoT infrastructures employ predictive and real-time analytical data for informed decision-making — this can alleviate issues related to internal organization, labor allocation, and cybersecurity for enhanced productivity and protection. By taking a proactive approach, businesses can eliminate costs and enjoy better time management.

Access IoT Devices with SSH
---------------------------

The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol is widely used for remotely accessing IoT devices because of its emphasis on [encryption](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication) throughout the server connection process. From user-generated credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to [public key infrastructures (PKI)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/pki) and even zero-trust [keyless solutions](https://www.ssh.com/blog/passwordless-ssh-password-ssh-authentication), SSH provides layers of added security to support legitimate users while keeping malicious actors at bay.

By default, the SSH protocol is installed in recent iterations of UNIX, Mac, and Windows systems. Command-line configurations are needed to implement specific authentication measures on a device for remote access management. For further instructions on successfully enabling SSH-driven IoT remote access management on any IoT device, see our [OpenSSH client configuration guide](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config).

Since IoT devices are guarded by firewalls and publicly shielded IP addresses, reaching them remotely can be quite challenging. As a result, some users cut corners to gain remote access to their IoT devices, but in the process, they’re leaving doors open for lurking cybercriminals to sneak in undetected.

Risky IoT Remote Access Practices to Avoid
------------------------------------------

A common method for quickly accessing IoT devices remotely with SSH is to open up SSH and HTTP/HTTPS ports in a gateway router or firewall. Usually, a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) solution is deployed to keep track of the gateway router’s IP address as it’s being accessed remotely. Users who partake in this method often assume that with SSH protocols running in the background, their activity is sufficiently armored.

While SSH runs on extensive encryption processes, it can’t protect against attacks when a hacker has already infiltrated a private server through an exposed port. Moreover, ongoing SSH protocol will help disguise a hacker as they acquire sensitive data and manipulate administrative controls, making it harder for an administrator to find and address a breach in time.

Another practice that experts discourage is enabling [root-level access](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/user/root) in remote applications. Root-level access refers to accounts in Linux and Unix systems that have the highest level of authority within a server; thus, they have total system access. Ideally, one root-level password should be used per server, and a root access account should only be utilized locally for IT maintenance and troubleshooting. Otherwise, extending these privileged credentials to other servers makes it easier for hackers to gain unrestricted access to an entire enterprise once they enter through an exposed port.

Best Practices for SSH-Driven IoT Remote Access
-----------------------------------------------

[SSH tunneling](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling) is the primary method for users to securely communicate with remote servers, networks, and devices through established firewalls and gateway routers using an assigned, protected port. It allows internet traffic to travel between local and remote devices. There are three types of SSH tunneling: local port forwarding, remote port forwarding, and dynamic port forwarding.

Local port forwarding connects local users to remote devices and servers on a different network, whereas remote port forwarding works the opposite way, granting remote networks access to a local server or device. Dynamic port forwarding involves both types of tunneling working simultaneously for inbound and outbound traffic. What makes this process of bypassing firewalls more secure is that the information being exchanged, as well as the connection between the local and remote servers, are encoded with SSH keys. See our [SSH port forwarding guide](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling/example) for a more detailed explanation of how SSH tunneling works.

It’s crucial that all keys used in these interactions are adequately [managed](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ssh-key-management), disposed of, and regenerated as needed. Leaving keys unsupervised is like publishing a list of login credentials online for everyone to see — it leaves a trail of crumbs for hackers to use to breach a vulnerable target without being flagged as an unauthorized user.

Keeping IoT Remote Access Secure with SSH
-----------------------------------------

While the SSH protocol offers secure channels to access IoT devices remotely, administrators must adopt a best-in-class management solution to surveillance, flag, and fix issues that can disrupt operations. SSH offers a suite of privileged access management (PrivX) solutions founded on zero trust and just-in-time architecture for one-time certificate use, preventing credential leaks that hackers exploit.

The [PrivX OT Edition](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/privx-ot-secure-access-management) offers a centralized, user-friendly platform to manage both IT and OT environments, with scalable applications compatible with legacy and novel machinery. From financial data to technical troubleshooting, PrivX OT grants administrators complete control and maneuverability over their entire operational, data-driven framework without the need to perform complex configurations.

/. 064 [What is IIoT?](https://www.ssh.com/academy/what-is-the-industrial-internet-of-things)
=========================================================

What is the industrial internet of things (IIoT) and how to secure it?
======================================================================

The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to applying the [Internet of Things (IoT)](/academy/iot) in industrial sectors. IIoT enables industries to manage and control complex manufacturing environments and processes.

IIoT consists of smart devices and sensors that monitor machinery or applications, the networks between the devices, and their connections. These devices collect data related to the machinery or production processes and deliver it to the cloud and/or servers. The smart devices can also be controlled remotely via a connection run over the internet.

IIoT is focused on machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, machine learning, and big data, enabling industries to be more efficient and operate on a much more reliable level.

**Contents**

[Benefits of IIoT](#benefits-of-iiot)  
[Main security threats concerning IIoT adoption](#IIoT-adoption)  
[How to secure your IIoT networks?](#how-to-secure-iiot-networks)

What is IIoT and how does it work?
----------------------------------

IIoT enables industries to optimize their production by offering numerous ways to control the manufacturing processes both remotely and in real-time.

IIoT is a combination of information technology (IT) and [operational technology (OT)](/academy/operational-technology-ot-security). OT refers to the operational processes and industrial control systems (ICSs), such as human-machine interfaces (HMIs), distributed control systems (DCSs), and programmable logic controllers (PLCs).  
  
In short, IIoT combines machines, automation, data, and the internet in a way that makes it possible to gain new insights into manufacturing processes and further enhance the development of production.

The [combination of IT and OT](/academy/operational-technology/it-ot-convergence) not only provides industries automation and optimization but also a better understanding of operational processes. Data gathered from smart devices allows for better decision-making that in turn enhances productivity.

Benefits of IIoT
----------------

By adopting IIoT, businesses are able to gather and analyze greater amounts of data at a greater speed. IIoT makes it easier to monitor and manage physical infrastructures in various industrial operations, for example, the manufacturing of heavy machinery, railways, or logistics.

Generally, IIoT plays a big role in bridging the production processes to big data and analytics.

IIoT enables:

### Efficient monitoring

Operations performed by smart devices can be monitored and managed in real-time, regardless of location. For example, an operator or machine manufacturer can collect data from devices that are operating around the world in order to improve their functionality or product development.

### Enhanced insight

The data collected by an industrial company can be gathered, combined, and analyzed in a much shorter time span. This can provide new information and solutions to various productivity or operational issues.

### Enhanced anticipation

Data can be used to anticipate changes or potential problems in the manufacturing processes. For example, smart sensors can be used to monitor machines and collect data about their malfunctions. This data can be then analyzed and used to predict potential future malfunctions.

Main security threats concerning IIoT adoption
----------------------------------------------

Adopting IIoT undoubtedly revolutionized and will further improve how industrial businesses operate. The challenge is to maintain appropriate levels of security while, at the same time, boosting digital transformation and increasing connectivity.  
  
There are many security threats associated with IIoT, and they are mostly caused by the lack of efficient security measures and systems. Gaps in security lead to an increasing number of security risks threatening the IIoT environment.

These risks are even further enhanced by having the IIoT network connected to the internet (which is almost a must nowadays).

The more automated, remotely operated, and connected the IIoT systems are, the more they are open to security risks, for example:

*   Malicious activities like hacking, targeted attacks, and data breaches
    
*   System manipulation
    
*   Software vulnerabilities
    
*   System malfunctions
    

IIoT businesses that aren't appropriately protected and secured can experience, for example, serious operational disruptions, prolonged downtime, and subsequent monetary loss.

As automation and data analytics are the key elements of IIoT, the need for secure connections and data protection is crucial for further business developments. The need for IIoT cybersecurity is increasing as security threats potentially lead to large-scale events combining cybersecurity and physical security.  
  
Hackers gaining access to IIoT systems threatens not only the business's cybersecurity but can also potentially disrupt physical security measures. For example, hackers gaining control over heavy machinery and related IIoT devices can lead to a data breach as well as physical harm to on-site workers.

How to secure your IIoT networks?
---------------------------------

As much as industries and companies are investing in the development and increase in productivity that IIoT offers, they should also invest in their security systems and protocols.

The IIoT landscape is shifting rapidly and like with any new technological advancement, new kinds of security risks are quick to follow. That is why a new kind of (cyber)security approach to IIoT is also needed.

Among the more traditional tools used to secure IloT networks are, for example, VPNs, firewalls, or simple Secure Remote Access (SRA) solutions. However, these tools are not enough, considering the changing landscape.

Having protection that is embedded into the different layers of IIoT systems enables businesses to securely manage and keep their operations running. Embedded security solutions protect all the different layers of the IIoT system: devices, IIoT networks, connections, servers, and the cloud.

IIoT systems and connections are best protected with a comprehensive secure access management solution, like our [PrivX](/solutions/privx-ot-secure-access-management), that:

*   Integrates with your IIoT systems
    
*   Manages the entire industrial remote access lifecycle
    
*   Supports granular, [least-privilege](/academy/pam/what-is-least-privilege), and just-enough-access (JEA) models that are not available in VPNs/Firewalls
    
*   Is prepared for the era of Quantum-Safe Cryptography (QSC) solutions and [utilizes QSC algorithms already now](/blog/quantum-safe-privileged-access-management)

What is operational technology (OT) Security?
=============================================

Every Internet user has heard of Informational Technology, better known as IT. But the term OT may not ring a bell for those unfamiliar with industrial processes. Operational Technology (OT) includes all the equipment responsible for the operation of an infrastructural facility. It’s a niche system that can have incredibly damaging and even life-threatening repercussions if comprehensive and effective otsecurity is not achieved.

What operational technology (OT) Security Means
-----------------------------------------------

Unlike IT, the goals of OT security focus on safety and reliability rather than confidentiality and accessibility. Effective OT security involves using [OT cybersecurity software](https://info.ssh.com/secure-remote-access-management-for-operational-technology) to [monitor, analyze, and control](https://info.ssh.com/secure-remote-access-management-for-operational-technology?) industrial systems and machinery either on-site or remotely. Such software allows for centralized access to all working hardware, providing OT teams with a bird’s-eye view of their entire operational infrastructure from endpoint to endpoint. This makes it significantly easier to address and resolve anomalies as soon as they’re detected, and before they can inflict significant harm.

OT security is a relatively new necessity, ushered in as the demand for the [Internet of Things (IoT)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iot) grows. IoT allows devices to communicate with each other seamlessly, bringing households and businesses the convenience their busy schedules demand. To increase efficiency, accuracy, and productivity, many warehouses and plants have upgraded their industrial hardware with interoperable capabilities, using Internet-reliant platforms to keep operations running without the need for constant human intervention.

Technological progress, however, often comes with new vulnerabilities. The cybersecurity risks generally associated with Internet use are brought to bear on industrial systems once they adopt IoT. But existing IT cybersecurity solutions won’t provide the best protection for OT interfaces.

  

The Difference Between IT and OT Security
-----------------------------------------

To best understand how IT security and OT security differ in approach, we have to look at why cybercriminals breach IT and OT environments in the first place. IT hackers want valuable information, whereas OT hackers want physical disruption. In an OT facility, hackers often use unprotected IoT-enabled equipment as a trail of crumbs to lead them to a central control system sans credentials. Imagine a water bottling plant that runs through three primary stages: collection, purification, and packaging. Without an OT security system in place, one apparatus can be discreetly disrupted, causing contaminated water to be shipped off to consumers without immediate notice and leading to widespread legal, health, and economic consequences.

In strictly IT-backed enterprises, [hackers fish for credentials](https://www.ssh.com/academy/password-credential-breaches) that will get them into a server housing highly sensitive and personal information, which they can use for personal and financial gain. However, IT hackers cannot control the equipment settings and functions to the extent that OT malware can.

Therefore, OT security aims to protect _physical_ assets, including equipment, products, and people, while IT security focuses on protecting _data_ and how it is used. For example, an excellent OT solution can shut down an entire operation as soon as a piece of equipment goes awry, giving leadership ample time to fix the issue and trace it to a single source. Since OT processes move on a step-by-step basis, such breaches are much easier to spot and patch. On the other hand, IT breaches can take months to resolve due to the sheer number of possible entry points that could be used to infiltrate a private network.

Why is OT Security Important?
-----------------------------

Cyberattacks have already [cost several companies millions](https://www.ssh.com/academy/operational-technology-breaches) — from a [shipping terminal](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-maersk-cyberattack-20170817-story.html) to an [electric power grid](https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2019/02/02/reports-duke-energy-fined-10-million-for.html) — and they won’t stop. According to the [2022 Global Risks Report](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2022.pdf), digital commerce will reach an $800 billion growth in value by 2024. However, three million cyber professionals are needed worldwide to keep up with current online threats, signaling a need for broader security initiatives for OT-based institutions.

The main problem with lackluster (or a lack of) OT security is rooted in the grand scope of OT use across industries. A significant proportion of our institutions— hospitals, manufacturing plants, transportation systems, utility firms, and even office buildings — use OT daily. Anything from the temperature of perishable foods to the availability of electricity on an ICU floor can all be altered if effective and complete otsecurity is not achieved. An inability to invest in a solid OT cybersecurity solution can ultimately mean the difference between profits and revenue loss, safety and danger — even life and death.

Common Security Challenges That Require OT Security
---------------------------------------------------

With operational technology, malware can enter critical systems via external hardware or the Internet. When a dongle, such as a USB flash drive, is used on several computers or equipment, it runs on the network to which each device is connected, increasing the probability that the dongle will be infected with malicious code. It’s recommended to assign specific external hardware to a particular network to reduce the risk of this kind of exposure. Anti-virus programs can also serve as an extra barrier of protection in case external hardware has to be used outside of its assigned domain.

Additionally, cybersecurity experts warn enterprises and institutions against being ill-prepared for “air gaps” as they upgrade their OT infrastructure with IoT technology. Prepping and ensuring industrial control systems security by safely managing and storing existing data before IT is integrated helps prevent possible pockets of exposure that hackers could take advantage of. Once OT environments are optimized with IT, bots and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks become of great concern since they can harness a single network connection to disable entire OT systems or flood them with spam-like activity.

But even the most comprehensive OT cybersecurity solution is not immune to one inevitable vulnerability: human error. Irregular surveillance, shared credentials, unorganized emergency protocol, and general negligence can happen at any moment — which is why hackers rely most on human error. Consistently training and refreshing employees on essential IT and OT security practices will keep them vigilant and quick to respond to suspicious behavior.

The Components of OT Security
-----------------------------

An extensive and reliable OT security framework should be scalable, meaning that every component of an OT environment must be accounted for. From groups of hardware to individual devices and sensors, OT security measures should cover both ICS and SCADA security:

*   **Industrial Control Systems (ICS):** While OT refers to the hardware _and_ software components of a functioning industrial facility, ICS refers to the _physical_ functions of all machinery, equipment, and devices as they operate in tandem with each other (think of a flavor manufacturing facility, wastewater treatment plant, and so on). Industrial control systems security prioritizes machine performance and staff safety.
*   **Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA):** As its name implies, SCADA makes up the informational component of OT. A subset of ICS, SCADA is a centralized control hub that allows a manager to monitor equipment status, pinpoint alarms, and adjust hardware settings in real time.

By mapping out an ICS and SCADA security plan to keep all systems running and employees safe, facilities can avoid coverage gaps that hackers are waiting to exploit.

Remote Secure Access Management Is the Key
------------------------------------------

Because of the [IT/OT convergence](/academy/operational-technology/it-ot-convergence), the management of both ICS and SCADA systems is increasingly being handled remotely. The manufacturer of industrial equipment may no longer send a maintenance engineer on-site to make adjustments or upgrades, but rather conduct the process remotely. The same is true if a site manager needs to make adjustments to the performance of critical machinery, such as in a paper mill or power plant.  
  
These tasks are critical since a malicious user might bring the operation of an entire site to a grinding halt or inject the system with malware that spreads from site to site.  
  
On-site safety and security has been top-notch in the OT world for years, but remote access management introduces new types of requirements. Industries often find themselves lacking in both the IT/OT tools and the skills.  
  
What’s worse, IT experts lack the skills required to manage remote access to industrial equipment, because the protocols used are often non-standard and vendor-specific.  
  
An ideal solution is an access lifecycle management tool that covers both the IT and OT aspects of cybersecurity. The requirements include:

*   Supporting vendor-agnostic access to industrial and IT targets alike through a single pane of glass
*   Identifying each user and leaving a solid audit trail of activities
*   Easy-to-use access management tool for maintenance engineers and administrators alike
*   Workflow approvals for each maintenance job
*   Restricting access privileges to the minimum required to get the job done
*   Managing passwords and encryption keys used to access industrial targets

/. 067 [What is the IT/OT Convergence?](https://www.ssh.com/academy/operational-technology/it-ot-convergence)
=========================================================

What is IT/OT Convergence?
==========================

The IT OT convergence means that real-world events can communicate with a digital network. Operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) both transmit information, store data, and serve as the backbone of many business processes. By combining these two systems, organizations can transmit information gathered from OT processes to their digital IT networks, for a unified approach to systems monitoring.

Let’s take a look at how the IT OT convergence works, plus some of the advantages and challenges of convergence. With the right tools, businesses can execute comprehensive monitoring systems that run securely and cohesively.

The Difference Between IT and OT
--------------------------------

IT refers to any systems that store and communicate data electronically. IT systems can operate within physical, cloud, or hybrid environments, and they’re connected to a network with other IT devices. Computers, servers, applications, and other IT devices are some of the most crucial parts of any business operation.

OT — short for operational technology — gathers information from real-world events, and logs data to provide actionable insights. OT is commonly used in industries where sensors and other equipment take measurements, then communicate their OT data for internal analytics.

Traditionally, IT uses digital venues to communicate data with other members of the IT network. OT, on the other hand, often involves singular measurements that are recorded and monitored all in one place. When IT and OT are combined, it can open up a whole new world of possibilities opens for your business.

What is the IT/OT Convergence?
------------------------------

When OT systems are plugged into IT networks, the emerging technology is called IT OT convergence. IT OT convergence isn’t a brand new concept — convergence has been around for many years, as long as industries have gathered data from external sources for internal processing. But, as IT and OT convergence becomes more sophisticated, a wide range of industries are seeing new opportunities for growth.

In practice, IT OT convergence uses inputs from sensors and other OT measurement devices to deliver practical results. Today’s cars make extensive use of IT OT convergence for automated features that increase safety, and improve the passenger experience. For example, when a car’s backup sensor (OT) detects an approaching bicycle, it can communicate with the car’s internal IT system to quickly activate the brakes.

Automated brakes aren’t the only use for IT OT technology. As IT OT systems continue to expand across new industries, organizations need to understand how to implement and manage new IT OT technologies. New technology is only effective when employees know how to use it. With proper training, planning, and integration, IT OT convergence offers many enterprises an exciting new opportunity for growth and innovation.

Different Types of IT/OT Convergence
------------------------------------

IT OT convergence allows businesses to connect their OT devices to IT networks. With machine-to-machine communication, IT OT convergence has the potential to help with automation and improve both efficiency and security.

Within the world of IT OT convergence, there are several unique types of convergence worth discussing. Broadly, different types of convergence can be categorized into three different groups — physical convergence, software convergence, and organizational convergence.

*   **Physical convergence.** Physical convergence is the most basic type of convergence, with little IT assembly required. With physical convergence, two processes are literally connected through physical means — usually when an existing OT device becomes connected to a new IT network. Physical convergence tends to be most commonly used to modernize older OT equipment.

*   **Software convergence.** The goal of software convergence is to link OT data with IT systems. Software convergence allows businesses to collect OT data digitally, to view input from OT systems, then use OT data to improve external operations.
*   **Organizational convergence.** Organizational convergence (also known as process convergence) uses external data for internal purposes. With organizational convergence, IT and OT teams operate separately, but they will need to continually exchange information to create an effective operational system.

Examples of IT/OT Convergence
-----------------------------

IT OT convergence is an abstract concept with real-life applications. To understand the broad scope of application for IT OT systems, it’s important to understand exactly where IT OT systems are used. From industry to retail, IT OT systems can make a wide variety of business operations more efficient and more secure.

Some of the most common applications of IT OT technology are:

*   **Industry.** IT OT convergence continues to create innovative new technologies in industry and manufacturing. From factory production to inventory management and emissions management, IT OT systems are at the forefront of today’s industry landscape.

*   **Retail.** Retail uses IT OT technology to identify which products are popular where — and who’s buying them. With OT devices set to measure product performance and revenue, retailers can analyze data from across locations to optimize inventory levels, goods production, and even store hours.

*   **Pharmaceuticals.** With data available from medical trials, pharmaceutical companies can adjust medications with patients in mind. In this case, OT devices are used to collect medical data from healthcare providers and observe the effects of drugs to assess their success. Fast and reliable medical data helps pharmaceutical companies to get the information they need to optimize drug effectiveness.
*   **Transportation.** In the shipping industry, data from vehicles is collected to identify the most efficient routes and the ineffective vehicles within shipping fleets. To facilitate getting goods from point A to point B, shippers can use IT OT technology to observe the effectiveness of delivery, and to adjust transportation methods accordingly.

What is IoT OT Security?
------------------------

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of OT devices that converge to form a single, unified network. Because OT devices don’t naturally operate within an IT network, IT OT convergence is used to create an IoT system. In IoT, data from different OT devices converges for storage and analysis.

Maintaining secure IoT and OT systems is an important part of any IT OT operation. When OT devices are linked within an IoT network, they communicate important information that can be highly sensitive. IoT uses data analytics to create real-world results, which means a data breach can be expensive, at best — and dangerous, at worst.

IoT security has some specific demands that differ from traditional IT security. Businesses using IT OT systems must understand how to set up access credentials for OT devices without compromising data integrity. A traditional VPN isn’t always sufficient in protecting IoT OT security, which means secure access combined with data encryption is essential.

IT/OT Convergence Challenges
----------------------------

There are plenty of IoT and OT security challenges that may arise with IT OT convergence — especially when low-tech OT devices are retrofitted to a newer IoT system. When devices aren’t accustomed to network connection, they often do not have the [privileged access credentials](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam) necessary to keep information safe. Effective access management, as well as data encryption, are necessary for any secure IoT infrastructure.

Implementation is a major challenge associated with IT OT systems since OT devices need to be integrated with IT infrastructure securely and effectively. Physical convergence requires trained IoT professionals and network admins need to understand how to manage both IT and OT devices. In addition to setup challenges, enterprises will also need to ensure both employees and IoT admins are properly trained in how to use their new IT OT infrastructure.

IT/OT Convergence Benefits
--------------------------

Despite a handful of challenges, IT OT convergence offers lasting benefits for businesses across industries. With an effective implementation, management, and security plan, IT OT systems have the potential to significantly improve efficiency and productivity.

Because IT OT allows for accurate and rapid monitoring of OT conditions, enterprises that use IoT systems can quickly analyze and improve their performance based on OT data. For effective OT monitoring, organizations need to have a secure and efficient IoT infrastructure, with the capability for centralized analytics. With real-time OT data, a business can improve all kinds of performance indicators — from resource utilization to regulatory compliance to safety measures.

Aside from directly improving the output of products and services, IT OT convergence can greatly improve internal business processes, too. When IT OT infrastructure is running smoothly, businesses can expect less disjointed operations, less downtime, and more efficient internal communications.

Facilitating the IT/OT Convergence in Your Enterprise
-----------------------------------------------------

IT OT convergence offers significant technological advancements and opportunities across industries. But how can you tell if IT OT convergence is right for your business? And, even if IT OT convergence is appealing, how can you implement it in your business?

With the right planning, large and small businesses across industries can implement IT OT systems. To avoid some of the common pitfalls of IT OT convergence, it’s important to train your employees in IT OT systems before the new technology is introduced. For everything to run smoothly, it’s also important to work with an IoT administrator who is qualified in managing IT OT convergence. Many admins have specific certifications in IoT management.

Why Do Businesses Need Passwordless Authentication?
---------------------------------------------------

Passwords are everywhere. Since the dawn of the computer age, passwords have been the centerpiece of access and authentication technology. Since password-protected entry first came into use, IT security has advanced in many ways — we now have access to data encryption, secure file transfers, and multifactor authentication, among many other capabilities. But passwords have remained a mainstay of cybersecurity.

For basic security, passwords can be effective at preventing unwanted access into cybersystems. But passwords are a static solution. This means that once a password is established, it can’t change on its own. For a sustainable security solution, passwords and encryption keys must be changed regularly to effectively protect sensitive information.

Until recently, passwords and encryption keys have been the standard for data protection in enterprise systems. With an understanding that permanent credentials are less secure than dynamic passwords, businesses have spent countless hours and resources managing privileged access management (PAM) and enterprise key management (EKM) systems, ensuring access credentials are rotated regularly.

With passwordless authentication, ephemeral access credentials are now available for widespread use. This eliminates the need to manually rotate passwords and access keys — once the file or data has been accessed, the credential disappears, just in time. This means that passwordless authentication is highly secure, ensuring that enterprise passwords don’t fall into the wrong hands.

What is Passwordless Authentication?
------------------------------------

Before we explore how SSH is changing the cybersecurity landscape, it’s important to understand exactly what passwordless authentication entails. The goal of passwordless authentication is simple: to avoid the security pitfalls associated with passwords while improving the user experience.

Since passwords gained prominence in the mid-20th century, secure systems have added additional layers of protection to ensure data integrity. Most recently, multi-factor authentication (MFA) has become a widespread alternative to simple password-based authentication. With MFA, users need to establish their personal identity to ensure they have the right access permissions. To do this, biometric authentication and multi-device authentication are often used.

But MFA can be a hassle, and multiple layers of credentials can make access complicated for even the right users. Moreover, MFA still uses traditional passwords and encryption keys — so it doesn’t fix the inefficiency of static passwords, which still need to be managed. Ultimately, passwordless authentication is a way to replace MFA with something more efficient, user-friendly, and secure.

How Does Passwordless Work?
---------------------------

[The idea behind passwordless identification](https://info.ssh.com/passwordless-keyless-white-paper?hsLang=en) is to provide access for the right users, while protecting privileged users’ personal data. Passwordless access helps you eliminate the risk of leaked passwords and compromised information by using paired keys — one public key and one private key.

Here’s how it works: first, a privileged user creates an account with the organization. Once a user establishes a new identity, the user creates a private key that is only accessible to the person who possesses it. The new account is paired with a public key, which is held by the protected organization.

When it’s time for the right user to access their account, the private key must be unlocked with authentication. Once the private key is accessible, the organization is able to pair it with the public key. Pairing the private key with the public key is what allows the user to access the account at the right time, with the right level of privilege.

It’s important to note that passwordless authentication, by definition, aims to remove passwords from the authentication process. This means that, in a truly passwordless access setup, the credentials for unlocking the private key will not involve a password. Instead, passwordless authentication uses another type of MFA — whether it’s biometric, a physical token, or another personal identifier that cannot be leaked if the main enterprise falls victim to a cyberattack.

What About Keys?
-----------------

Passwords aren’t the only type of static credential. To maximize the benefits of migrating to a passwordless environment, organizations must also consider their other permanent credentials — their keys. SSH keys outnumber passwords 10 to 1, and often go overlooked while organizations tie themselves in knots over password security. Yet these keys, like passwords, can represent a serious security threat if not properly managed.

This raises an important question — is there a way to become passwordless and keyless simultaneously?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keyless Passwordless Authentication & Just-in-Time Zero Trust
-------------------------------------------------------------

Zero Trust (ZT) is the framework for today’s high-security enterprise systems. Using the Zero Trust model, even in-network devices, servers, applications — or any other target — must be verified before users can access sensitive information. MFA is another key component of Zero Trust, which allows you to increase confidence in each authentication effort. No matter which devices are in your corporate perimeter, Zero Trust helps to ensure your users are consistently authenticated.

Passwordless authentication solutions go hand-in-hand with Zero Trust architecture. When Zero Trust MFA uses passwords, users can quickly become fatigued with long login processes, repeated password requests, and disruptive MFA texts and emails. Since Zero Trust requires authentication at each step of user access, passwordless access allows users to move through IT systems with continuous verification, and without having to continuously log in and remember passwords.

The same principle applies to keys. If the users utilize keys instead of passwords, the keys must also be managed to mitigate major security risks. Using ephemeral authentication certificates, passwordless and keyless authentication ensures that the right users can access the right information on a per-use basis.

The Zero Trust concept establishes that authentication no longer requires permanent credentials like passwords or SSH keys. Instead, every session is authenticated just in time (JIT) for establishing the connection, using short-lived certificates. The certificates carry the required secrets to establish the connection, but the certificates automatically expire within minutes of authentication.

The user never handles any keys or passwords during the process, but everything happens under the hood. No keys or passwords are left behind to be managed either.

By pairing passwordless and keyless authentication, the Zero Trust security framework and the just-in-time concept are the way of the future.

Benefits of Keyless and Passwordless Authentication
---------------------------------------------------

Aside from significantly increased security, there are plenty of other [major benefits of passwordless and keyless authentication](https://www.ssh.com/just-in-time-passwordless-privileged-access-management?hsLang=en). These include:

*   **Increased usability.** When static credentials are out of the picture, users can access the right information without jumping through hoops. Traditional password-based authentication has required users to create complex passwords, then store them somewhere “safe” and remember them when it comes time to log in. Additionally, plenty of enterprises require users to manually rotate passwords or keys periodically. Passwordless and keyless authentication removes the burden of management, so users can access the right data without obstacles.

*   **Cost-effective operations:** Password and key management is an expensive endeavor for IT teams. To manage passwords for a large organization, an entire team of admins may be necessary to answer customer questions, help reset passwords, and rotate and retire passwords. This process can be time-consuming and inefficient compared to a passwordless approach. Implementing passwordless authentication allows your enterprise to reduce IT management costs by avoiding the time-consuming process of password management. The same applies to key management with one fundamental difference — keys are notoriously difficult to find. In fact, most Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions are not equipped to handle keys properly, so many keys are going undetected and unmanaged.
*   **Better security:** Passwordless and keyless authentication have the potential to be a much more secure option than permanent credential-based access control. Passwords and keys have the potential to fall into the wrong hands — no matter how often they are rotated. When passwordless and keyless authentication is adopted, there is little doubt that the right user is accessing the right information.

Keyless and Passwordless Authentication Best Practices
------------------------------------------------------

By learning passwordless and keyless authentication best practices, you can streamline access management from the very beginning. When implementing any new IT stack, it’s important to test out your new approach using trial technology when possible — this can involve demos of passwordless and keyless services, as well as localized deployment of your new technology before implementing it across the enterprise.

With small-scale implementation, you can identify any challenges your users might have with passwordless and keyless technology and determine how to address these issues before implementing the technology on a company-wide scale. While testing out passwordless and keyless authentication, it’s important to gather feedback to understand exactly which parts of the new technology are posing a challenge for new users.

Once you implement passwordless and keyless authentication on a company-wide scale, guiding your employees through the user process is potentially the most important of all the best practices. To improve usability, you can establish training courses, provide specialized IT support, distribute FAQ sheets, or even designate members of your IT team to provide live assistance for new users.

Keyless and Passwordless Authentication Are the Future
------------------------------------------------------

Passwordless and keyless authentication solutions allow you to verify access at each step in the process. Combining passwordless and keyless authentication with the Zero Trust approach means access can become faster and easier for users, [while improving security](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/credential-risk-mitigation/). For Zero Trust enterprises, passwordless and keyless access is a great way to save time and money — and maintain a strong approach to privileged access management.

Passwordless and keyless access management are consistently more secure than traditional solutions. Because passwordless and keyless authentication doesn’t rely on static access credentials, you’re eliminating the threat of unmanaged or stolen credentials from a password vault. Additionally, you can avoid the resources necessary to repeatedly rotate and manage all your enterprise passwords and keys.

As technology progresses, making certain changes just makes sense — and migrating to passwordless and keyless authentication is one of those changes.

=========================================================

What is Break-Glass Access?
===========================

When deploying an access management solution, like a [privileged access management (PAM)](/academy/pam/what-is-privileged-access-management) tool, businesses often require a “back-up” access capability that would allow a user or users to access their system even in case of an emergency, when the deployed PAM tool is unavailable to provide access in a regular way. This type of emergency access is called break-glass access.

What is Break-Glass Access?
---------------------------

Break-glass access refers to a procedure used in critical emergencies or exceptional cases, when a user with insufficient access is granted elevated access rights to bypass normal access controls. The user then gains immediate access to accounts or targets that they wouldn’t normally be authorized to access with the aim of performing emergency tasks, which they wouldn’t perform during regular, day-to-day operations.

Break-glass access is granted through a dedicated break-glass account which is traditionally created in advance. The account is typically highly privileged and allows access to the most critical systems, like root accounts. For that reason, break-glass accounts are well monitored, documented, tested, and managed to avoid any misuse. The related break-glass credentials that allow access to the account are typically quickly available to prevent unnecessary delays and have a time duration limit, which helps to control and reduce the account usage to certain tasks only.

When Might You Need Break-Glass Access?
---------------------------------------

An emergency break-glass access should be used only in situations when normal procedures are insufficient or unavailable. For example:

*   The deployed PAM tool is unavailable due to excessive downtime or maintenance.
    
*   PAM tool failure – the authentication process fails due to the server being down.
    
*   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required but unavailable due to a network outage.
    
*   Account problems due to a cyberattack – access to all accounts was removed.
    
*   Account problems due to a locked password – the password was typed incorrectly too many times.
    

How to Manage Break-Glass Access?
---------------------------------

The traditional way to manage break-glass access is via a PAM tool. Traditional PAM tools offer the functionality to create, monitor, and manage break-glass accounts, but their capabilities are limited and dependent on the operationality of PAM tools.

In most scenarios, managing break-glass access through a PAM tool is enough. However, problems arise during a PAM tool failure or unavailability – when one of the PAM tool components (a stronghold or password vault) becomes inoperable. This results in the inability of the PAM tool to provide regular as well as break-glass access. Like this, the deployed PAM tool basically becomes a single point of failure.

The solution to the PAM failure problem is implementing an access management solution that is capable of utilizing more than one way to access targets, even when break-glass access is needed.

For example, [SSH’s Zero Trust Suite](/ssh-zero-trust-access-key-and-secrets-management)implements the modern way of managing break-glass access in two forms:

1.  By using encryption keys
2.  By eliminating passwords and password vaulting

What is Credential Management?
==============================

_Credentials are the keys to your organization’s confidential resources — here’s how to treat them with the care and attention they require._

Passwords, certificates, keys — whatever authentication measures organizations use to identify and validate user access, such [credentials](https://www.ssh.com/academy/password-credential-breaches) are known gateways to reservoirs of valuable and highly sensitive information, making them a top target for online malicious actors. In fact, a recent Verizon report found that [61 percent of all breaches](https://www.verizon.com/business/en-gb/resources/reports/dbir/) involve credentials, making it vital that these assets are properly managed and protected.

However, [adequate credential management](https://www.ssh.com/blog/how-to-solve-the-most-common-credential-management-errors) is easier said than done. With organizations housing hundreds of current and expired credentials for every user and device, updating passwords, usernames, and keys throughout their life cycles is an impossible task to perform through manual labor alone. But with a credential management system in place, tools for automation and centralization provide the visibility and coverage organizations need to render their credentials completely inaccessible to unauthorized users.

Here’s a breakdown of how a credential management system works, features to look for when implementing a CMS solution, and how enterprises can further fortify confidential data by migrating to a credential-less environment.

What is Credential Management?
------------------------------

Managing credentials involves far more than just compiling a list of working usernames and [passwords](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/password-strength) for all users and their respective accounts. Since credential types may vary depending on the platform being accessed and the degree of privilege a user has, it’s important that you understand the nature of credentials in their various forms so that you can better shield them against vulnerabilities.

### Types of Credentials

Credentials are user-generated or computer-generated bits of information that help identify, validate, and define users and their access privileges as they connect to a network, application, or web-based platform. There are four primary types of credentials used today:

*   **Passwords:** String combinations of letters, numbers, and characters that are required to reach a certain length and complexity to be effective. They’re typically paired with usernames for login purposes.
*   **Certificates:** Electronic documents composed of a public key and a digital signature that are signed by a certification authority to verify the identity of a user logged onto a specific device.
*   **Tokens:** Encrypted strings of characters that authorize a user’s access privileges throughout an active session. Tokens are distributed to users after a successful login attempt.
*   **Keys:** A pair of encrypted, computer-generated complementary strings, usually 2,048 bits long, that consist of randomized numbers, letters, and characters. Keys are used in various applications, but they’re mainly used for [identity authentication](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication).

### What Credential Management Entails

Credential management is the ability to adequately organize and secure credentials responsible for identity authentication and access authorization by monitoring and mitigating vulnerabilities throughout their life cycle.

For proper coverage, administrators must consider the relationships between users, their preferred devices, and the entities they connect to. Moreover, credential management requires that administrators work in tandem with encryption components set by [public key infrastructures](https://www.ssh.com/academy/pki) (PKIs) — namely by detailing the policies and parameters that govern identity-based privileged access and authentication.

Why is Credential Management Important?
---------------------------------------

Credentials can provide direct access to an organization’s sensitive and personal data, making them valuable tools for hackers hoping to infiltrate unauthorized areas under the guise of an authorized user. From leveraging [human error](https://www.ssh.com/blog/in_defense_of_dumb_user) to bypassing login page lockouts, cybercriminals have developed cunning and deceptive ways to carry out their attacks undetected.

### Credential Harvesting

With credential harvesting, malicious actors embrace various techniques to create a running list of active username and password pairs, including [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://www.ssh.com/academy/attack/man-in-the-middle), traditional [brute force methods](https://www.ssh.com/blog/ssh-key-scan-attack-honeypot), and [DNS spoofing](https://www.ssh.com/blog/malicious_ssh_client_exfiltrates_credentials_34). For example, hackers may embed fake links into legitimate online PDF documents, send virus-ridden emails posing as trusted employees and company affiliates, or even deploy a malicious network that looks like a reliable WiFi source. The goal is to gather enough username-password combinations to successfully perform a credential-stuffing operation.

### Credential Stuffing

Here, attackers use all the credentials they’ve harvested to conduct a large-scale spraying attempt. With the help of bots, hackers input stolen credentials into as many accounts as possible, knowing that users tend to reuse passwords and usernames across various applications. Today’s bots can also automatically adopt the appearance of different IP addresses to bypass lockout policies and perform unlimited attempts without being blocked or flagged, making it difficult for organizations to detect anomalous behavior before it’s too late.

### Credential Abuse

Once an adversary has made their way into a user’s account, credential abuse ensues: financial information is stolen, personal data is compromised, confidential company insights are exposed, and the reputability of the enterprise is tarnished. However, there are several best practices to keep in mind to prevent attackers from ever getting to this point.

Best Practices for Credential Management
----------------------------------------

There are responsibilities, both at the user and organization levels, that require strict adherence to ensure optimal data security and breach prevention. From a user standpoint, the key is to practice sound IT hygiene. This includes:

*   Refraining from [sharing credentials](https://www.ssh.com/blog/using-unauthorized-channels-for-sensitive-information-sharing)
*   Avoiding the reuse of passwords across platforms
*   Defaulting to browser-generated credentials to ward off brute force attacks
*   Notifying administrators of access privileges that go beyond an assigned role’s tasks
*   Keeping credentials private and inaccessible to other internal users
*   Working strictly on assigned devices fortified with security measures and managed via CMS

While these measures help to drastically reduce the prevalence of human error, there’s still a strong possibility of employees accidentally leaking or exposing credentials. After all, no one is perfect, and in an environment that calls for multi-tasking and high productivity, mistakes are bound to happen. Therefore, it helps to have additional procedures in place to provide a reliable layer of security, even when a vulnerability caused by human error arises.

Such procedures fall under the responsibility of administrative leaders with the most oversight of their organization's [operational and IT infrastructure](https://www.ssh.com/academy/operational-technology/it-ot-convergence). Best practices that admins can perform on their end to keep credentials safe include:

*   Transitioning to a [Zero Trust approach](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework) in all security applications
*   Deploying detailed and strict password policies to inhibit the use of weak credentials
*   Leveraging multi-step authentication features, such as two-factor authentication, using biometrics or device tokens
*   Auditing, tracking, and logging all user activity surrounding credential use
*   Utilizing a credential management system to automate lifecycle processes at scale and with accuracy

As mentioned, credential management systems further enhance data security by processing, organizing, and updating enterprise-wide credential inventories with speed and agility — but not all of them are built alike.

What is a Credential Management System?
---------------------------------------

A credential management system, also known as a CMS, is a software solution consisting of a centralized interface with customizable tools that assist admins with comprehensive credential governance. For a CMS solution to be effective, however, it needs to fully support internal best practices, adapt to the scalability of the organization using it, integrate seamlessly into existing applications and platforms, and provide user-friendly navigation features.

Benefits of Implementing a Credential Management System
-------------------------------------------------------

Besides extending visibility into an organization’s vulnerabilities and lingering threats, a CMS offers increased productivity. For example, a CMS can continuously run through entire corporate credential directories for full management coverage, while following enterprise-specific security policies and settings — greatly reducing administrative workloads. Users can also feel more confident knowing that a security net is ready to catch any credential leaks or unauthorized access, even when they’re exercising caution on their end.

Furthermore, a CMS can cut down on IT costs by eliminating the need for sophisticated security equipment and extensive infrastructural support systems that often require additional manpower to operate.

Features to Look For in a Credential Management System
------------------------------------------------------

When searching for the best comprehensive CMS solution, it’s important to consider how well it integrates into your existing operational framework, how well it adapts to personalized configurations, and how well it prepares your enterprise for future threats. Look for characteristics and features such as:

*   **Granular Handling:** Management tools can generate, distribute, organize, and revoke credentials down to the individual user/device level with real-time accuracy.
*   **Automation:** Automated features simplify the process of organization-wide management while keeping your business compliant. This also helps with continuous [auditing](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/pass-audits) and session recording.
*   **Machine Maintenance:** This keeps [machine-to-machine interactions](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/automated) running smoothly and safely, with regular encryption and protocol checks for latency prevention.
*   **Zero Trust Compatibility:** Zero Trust embraces a “never trust, always verify” approach by implementing [just-in-time access](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/just-in-time-access) and [ephemeral certificates](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ephemeral-certificates-and-access) and additional means of authentication.
*   **Threat Mitigation**: This feature identifies and flags security risks and policy violations for a stronger, impenetrable credential inventory.
*   **Credential-Free Security:** Migrating to a credential-less environment involves transitioning credential-reliant ecosystems into future-proof environments so that credentials are no longer at risk of compromise.

Once your organization perfects its credential management system, your admins will better understand all the active credentials being used and those needing to be retired. However, to defend against future threats, the best option is to phase credentials out completely. With the right tool, this can be achieved at a pace that suits you.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Future is Credential-less
-----------------------------

The best way to protect your data is to eliminate credentials that adversaries could exploit, but this doesn’t mean doing away with identity-based authentication measures altogether. In a [passwordless and keyless landscape](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/passwordless-keyless-authentication-guide), ephemeral certificates and cryptographic algorithms play a central role, relying on automation and efficiency rather than user-heavy management. This significantly minimizes security risks associated with password sharing, neglected IT practices, and insufficient security training.

Shifting to a credential-less future also means:

*   Reduced credential management costs
*   Elimination of [password vaults](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/password-vault) and [credentials rotation](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/password-key-rotation)
*   Faster and safer device-initiated login processes
*   Cleaner data inventories and directories
*   Better security compliance and alignment
*   Easier threat detection and recognition

/. 072 [Password and Key Rotation](https://www.ssh.com/academy/secrets-management/password-key-rotation)
=========================================================

Password and Key Rotation
=========================

Any company that protects information using passwords and keys likely participates in password and key rotation, to some extent or another. Password and key rotation is an essential aspect of credential management for businesses, particularly when managing passwords and keys at scale.

Despite rumors disputing the importance of password and key rotation, password and key rotation is still critical today. Businesses need to understand why credential rotation exists, and follow the best practices associated with password and key rotation, to ensure the long-term security of their secrets. Here’s everything organizations need to know about this essential credential management practice.

[What is Password and Key Rotation?](#password-and-key-rotation)  
[How Often Should You Rotate Keys and Passwords?](#how-often-should-you-rotate-passwords)  
[The Importance of Credential Rotation](#importance-of-credential-rotation)  
[Risks of Manual Password and Key Rotation](#risks-of-manual-password-rotation)  
[Why Password and Key Rotation Isn’t Ideal](#password-and-key-rotation-is-not-ideal)


**What Is Password and Key Rotation?**
--------------------------------------

Password and key rotation are variations of the same credential management principle: resetting the credential from time to time. Password rotation involves changing a password, and key rotation involves retiring and replacing an old key with a new [cryptographic key](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/ssh-key-basics).

Modifying the original credential shortens the period in which the password, key, or certificate is active. This limits the timeframe available for the password or key to be compromised, thereby minimizing the risk of password and key-based vulnerabilities.

When leveraging password and key rotation, it’s essential to establish credential lifecycles — that is, how long they remain unrotated. Organizations must determine the appropriate duration for a key or password to remain active, and how often they should be rotated. Password expiration and automatic key rotation can help define and maintain a consistent and reliable credential lifecycle.

**How Often Should You Rotate Keys and Passwords?**
---------------------------------------------------

Ideally, organizations would rotate their credentials as often as possible. But with so many operations and projects happening within the modern enterprise, it’s unrealistic to expect all end-users to remember to rotate their passwords and keys as diligently and regularly as might be ideal. This is why organizations must determine, enforce, and maintain unique lifecycles for specific credentials.

The lifecycle of a key or password (how frequently it should be rotated) depends on a variety of factors, primarily:

### Nature of the Credential

Some credentials, such as passwords for standard user accounts, may only need a rotation interval of 60 or 90 days. However, superuser accounts and other privileged end-user credentials will likely need more frequent rotation. It’s always better to rotate keys and passwords too often than too little.

### Security Importance

Newly-rotated passwords and keys need to be widely implemented across systems, networks, and end-user accounts. However, the purpose of these credentials will influence their lifecycle. Credentials that hold extra-sensitive and secret information require shorter lifecycles; some credentials may even necessitate one-time-passwords (OTPS) or ephemeral tickets.

### Compromise

If you believe a password or key has been compromised — whether you receive a third-party notice, detect suspicious activity, or simply have a gut feeling that something is wrong — you must immediately rotate the credential. Keys and passwords should also rotate whenever security guidelines shift, stronger key algorithms are discovered, and enterprise tools and services change or update.

**The Importance of Credential Rotation**
-----------------------------------------

### Why is Key Rotation Important?

Rotating keys offers proactive protection against key modification, theft, and other forms of compromise. Regular key rotation reduces the number of credentials that could become vulnerable due to compromise and limits how much information is encrypted using the same algorithm. This helps organizations promote secure, resilient systems and data.

Along with proactively reducing risks of key theft, rotating your SSH keys helps prevent long-term key-based attacks. Because compromised keys are still technically “valid” credentials, stolen keys often go undetected in enterprise networks. This is why it’s vital to rotate keys — a malicious actor may have stolen your key months ago and is waiting for the moment to strike.

### Why is Password Rotation Important?

Password rotation also proactively prevents password modification and theft, ranging from brute force attacks to phishing attempts, malware, and more. By reducing the opportunity for attackers to strike, regularly rotating passwords lessens the chances of password-related cyberattacks.

Rotating passwords not only prevents malicious actors from accessing and exploiting these credentials but also restricts access to former employees. This prevents both accidental tampering and purposeful sharing with competitors or other malicious parties.

Password rotation also minimizes the impact of a successful breach. When passwords are rotated often, it’s harder for hackers to unlock confidential information using partial credentials (such as only a username).

### Does Password and Key Rotation Still Matter Today?

Yes! Password and key rotation is still incredibly important for organizations today. Not only is it an established way of managing passwords, but key and password rotation is still mandatory within many companies. In fact, some legacy systems only support vaulting and rotation and cannot leverage modern credential management practices.

**Risks of Manual Password and Key Rotation**
---------------------------------------------

Although password and key rotation is essential for many organizations today, this aspect of credential management doesn’t come without its challenges — especially when performed manually and at a large scale.

Manual password and key rotation is riddled with human error, and may actually increase the likelihood of cybersecurity risks. This is because manual rotation:

### 1. Promotes the Creation of Weak Passwords

Passwords should contain lengthy, randomized phrases or characters that hackers can’t easily guess. Passwords should also never be reused or repeated, but when end-users have to change passwords often and remember many credentials, they tend to recycle them instead. According to Comparitech and LastPass, [employees use the same passwords 13 times on average](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/password-statistics) — and surprisingly, IT professionals reuse passwords more than other end-users.

### 2. Encourages Poor Storage Practices

Manual password rotation promotes poor credential storage practices, like storing valuable credentials in an Excel spreadsheet. Manually collecting, storing, and protecting passwords is not scalable at an enterprise level; the [average number of passwords an employee must keep track of](https://blog.lastpass.com/2017/11/lastpass-reveals-8-truths-about-passwords-in-the-new-password-expose/) is 191! Plus, storing passwords in unsafe environments like Excel spreadsheets, notebooks, and password managers increases the risk of theft and compromise.

### 3. Overlooks Proper Tracking

When it comes to maintaining and enforcing key management best practices, rotation tends to get in the way. The [number of SSH keys in enterprise environments can reach three million](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ssh-key-management), and remembering to regularly rotate all these keys can quickly grow into an unmanageable and overwhelming task. And since compromised keys are seldom detected, manual key rotation often results in compromised keys slipping under the radar.

### 4. Prevents Consistency Across Credentials

Passwords and keys are often leveraged or stored on multiple machines. When end-users manually store, rotate, and maintain their credentials, they must remember to copy new credentials to all locations — and delete the old ones. This results in lots of tedious and error-prone tasks.

**Why Password and Key Rotation Isn’t Ideal**
---------------------------------------------

Many organizations have swapped manual password and key rotation for automated practices, reducing a number of the risks mentioned above. But even intelligent credential rotation systems, which automatically change passwords and keys according to set rules and regulations, cannot protect organizations against every cybersecurity threat.

Hackers move notoriously fast — and while some may lurk in the shadows, many will jump at the first opportunity to strike. Automated credential management tools are certainly a step in the right direction, but they’re not fail-proof. Due to all the challenges associated with credential management, any environment that uses passwords and keys is bound to eventually encounter related cybersecurity issues and vulnerabilities.

But what if there were no credentials to manage at all?

Enter the global movement towards [passwordless and keyless environments](https://www.ssh.com/blog/passwordless-ssh-password-ssh-authentication). In enterprise networks with no long-term credentials — where all credentials are [ephemeral tickets](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ephemeral_access) that expire after authorized use — rotation and other credential management challenges will become obsolete and completely unnecessary, reducing human errors and shrinking the chances of compromise.

Tech giants have seen the benefits. Uber has a passwordless certificate authority, Netflix has BLESS, and Facebook has built secure and scalable access with SSH without keys.

But the move to passwordless and keyless doesn’t happen overnight and not every company can or should build their solution in-house. Businesses need a hybrid solution that leverages modern-day credential management practices — which are as important as ever — while also allowing for a move to passwordless.

=========================================================

Types of Password Attacks and How to Prevent Them
=================================================

_Password attacks remain the most popular method for hackers attempting to breach accounts and obtain sensitive data, but passwordless security methods can eliminate this threat altogether._

When people hear the words “[password attack](https://www.ssh.com/academy/attack/password-sniffing)” they often imagine a rogue actor typing furiously at a dimly lit desk, inputting numerous potential credentials until they gain access to a user’s private account. While this portrayal is partly true, malicious actors have gotten more imaginative, resourceful, and adaptive in the game of [cracking passwords](https://www.ssh.com/academy/password-credential-breaches). As a result, to outsmart attackers, users must remain vigilant by practicing proper IT hygiene.

However, with hackers leveraging various advanced methods to steal and exploit passwords, what can users and administrators do to prevent credential-based breaches? This guide will explain the different types of password attacks, methods used to perform them, and best practices for safeguarding credentials and migrating to a passwordless infrastructure.

What Is a Password Attack?
--------------------------

Password attacks have been around for decades and are the most traditional means of breaching an individual user’s or organization’s sensitive data. Their long-standing efficacy is rooted in the fact that hackers can imitate a legitimate user, causing the people they interact with to falsely assume that they’re engaging with a known contact. By adopting a particular user's identity and [access privileges](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/privileged-account), hackers can compromise the data of that user and their associated contacts.

How Are Passwords Cracked?
--------------------------

From alarmingly convincing emails to cloned websites, adversaries have mastered the art of deception. The key to their success? [Human error](https://www.ssh.com/blog/in_defense_of_dumb_user). The [2021 Thales Data Threat Report](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/en-gb/euro-data-threat-report#download-popup) found that almost half (45%) of US companies suffered a data breach in the past year. And according to [Verizon’s 2022 Data Breaches Investigations Report](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/), 82% of data breaches involved a human element.

Every time a user recycles the same password for a new account or mistypes a URL and is directed to a malicious site, they risk their confidentiality and the security of their affiliated organization. Emphasizing caution and attentiveness is crucial in preventing human error and the devastating breaches that can follow. But to effectively implement safe IT practices, users need to know what they’re up against.

Types of Password Attacks
-------------------------

Hackers have had plenty of time to refine their breaching techniques to bypass increasingly sophisticated authentication measures, and are constantly switching tactics to avoid being detected and increase their success rate. Users and admins can learn how to sufficiently protect themselves and their assets from rogue actors by understanding how common password attacks are performed. Here are five types of password attacks all users should look out for.

### Phishing

Phishing involves the hacker masquerading as legitimate entities through various communication channels, such as email, SMS messages, and phone calls. The hacker might pose as a university, government agency, insurance company, or any other number of legitimate parties that might be corresponding with you, to access confidential information.

A classic example of this is a user receiving an email from what appears to be a major retailer offering a gift card. The user clicks on the “redeem” button and is taken to a convincing website where they’re prompted to enter their personal information to access their gift card. In reality, the fake website sends this information to adversaries who can then leverage the user’s personal information to break into other accounts, steal their identity, access bank records, and more.

Since this email trick is widely known, cybercriminals have come up with novel ways to deceive unassuming victims, which include:

*   **Clone phishing**, where a hacker uses a template from a legitimate email but replaces all legitimate links with false ones.
*   **Spear phishing**, where an attacker targets a specific individual using the credentials and appearance of a close contact.
*   **DNS cache poisoning**, where adversaries [rewrite](https://www.ssh.com/blog/malicious_ssh_client_exfiltrates_credentials_34) Domain Name System information to reroute users to malicious sites.
*   **URL hijacking**, where cybercriminals take advantage of users who mistype legitimate URLs, crafting false websites that closely resemble actual sites with nearly identical domain names.

As of late, many hacking attempts have become especially persuasive, with adversaries threatening legal action against victims who don’t comply with their demands. Users should always fact-check potentially scam emails, calls, and text messages and report suspicious behavior before responding to supposedly urgent demands.

### Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

As its name suggests, [these attacks](https://www.ssh.com/academy/attack/man-in-the-middle) are caused by insecure connection channels, where hackers can intercept authentication messages between clients and servers.

Essentially, the attack begins with an adversary monitoring users who log into an insecure website. The login data gets relayed to the hacker, and the user is directed to an illegitimate website. As the user peruses this website, data is collected about their online behavior, credentials, and account attributes. From the user’s perspective, it appears as if they’re safely accessing their personal data, all the while feeding rogue actors the information they want.

### Brute Force Attacks

Some hackers resort to simple [trial and error](https://www.ssh.com/blog/ssh-key-scan-attack-honeypot). Through brute force attacks, adversaries try different possible password combinations until they successfully log into an account or system. Nowadays, many use automated tools to speed up the permutation process.

Unfortunately, many users aren’t careful with the passwords they set. Frequent practices that lead to password vulnerabilities include:

*   Utilizing the same password across all accounts, which are all compromised once an attacker breaks into a single account.
*   Setting a password that’s too simple and easy to guess, such as “password” or “123456789”.
*   Setting a password that relates to personal data about the user.
*   Including standard dictionary terms in a password, even if stylized with special characters.

Hackers are aware of these security mishaps and are quick to exploit them through hybrid brute force attacks and reverse brute force attacks. Hybrid brute force attacks harness both traditional guessing methods and automated permutation tools, whereas reverse brute force attacks use known or stolen passwords to uncover corresponding usernames. Dictionary attacks and credential stuffing are two popular examples of each.

#### Dictionary Attacks

Attackers use lists of stolen or leaked passwords and common words to develop highly probable password combinations for certain entities and networks. For example, users or admins with a medical account for a New York-based healthcare clinic might embed words like “NY”, “health”, “medicine” and similar variations into their passwords so they’re easier to remember — but this also makes them easier to guess.

#### Credential Stuffing

Cybercriminals know that most users like to re-use password-username combinations across different platforms, so in the event of a successful data breach, they use stolen credentials to log in to different accounts. Reverse brute force attacks are most effective here since legitimate passwords are often associated with the same email address or username across sites.

### Password Spraying

To combat login attempt restrictions and account lockouts — which also tend to notify users of suspicious activity — adversaries have developed a method called password spraying, where one password is used across multiple websites, before trying the next possible password.

In this approach, hackers rely on the fact that most lockout policies are triggered by too many false attempts within a designated period. By the time an attacker moves on to the next password and rotates back to the first website, the lockout policy resets and does not count the previous failed attempt. This keeps all activity undetected, granting more time and privacy for malicious actors to keep trying until they find the correct password. However, this method only applies to single sign-on applications, as additional authentication measures complicate this process.

### Keylogging

A more advanced method, keylogging, involves a hacker installing surveillance software onto a user’s device to record and log keystrokes. From this information, the attacker can find confidential information such as social security numbers, login credentials, bank account and routing numbers, and medical records, to name a few.

Keylogging spyware can be installed or exploited through:

*   Hardware components or dongles directly connected to physical computer setups, such as USB disks, hidden cameras, or keyboard attachments.
*   Malicious software disguised as legitimate supplemental software, like virus scanners and productivity applications.
*   Devious internal actors exploiting an organization’s keylogging software intended to track employee activities.

While hardware keylogging equipment is extremely challenging to implement with secrecy, it’s still a serious threat that warrants protective measures. Additionally, keylogging software has been on a steady rise, meriting a strong need for users to be more vigilant.

Best Practices for Preventing Password Attacks 
-------------------

There are an overwhelming array of password attacks to safeguard yourself against, but several best practices can help your organization secure every user touchpoint and communication channel.

To start, reduce the risk of human error. Enforce more robust policies surrounding password generation, [management](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/password-key-rotation), and use. For example, have employees avoid using short and simple word and character combinations and, instead, encourage them to use auto-generated passwords that are far too complex to guess with any brute force tactic.

Furthermore, invest in an organization-wide training program that regularly educates and reminds employees of proper IT practices to prevent common mistakes and vulnerabilities, and to combat emerging attack strategies they may encounter.

After prioritizing human error mitigation techniques, consider adopting applications and tools that will automate maintenance procedures and trigger notifications in the event of a breach or abnormal behavior, such as:

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA prompts [extra authentication checkpoints](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/multi-factor-authentication) to ensure that the identity of a user attempting to gain specific access or privileges is valid. It uses factors like one-time passwords, biometric scanners, voice recognition, and device identification to verify the actual user. MFA is extremely helpful in protecting users whose passwords have been compromised since hackers would also need access to these highly unattainable factors to infiltrate an account.
*   **Virtual Private Network (VPN):** VPNs establish secure online connections so that users can safely and privately access, share, and manipulate data over the internet. Designed to deter man-in-the-middle attacks, VPNs hide user IP addresses for anonymity, encrypt connection data, and shield online user activity using a proxy server.
*   **Router Encryption:** Like VPNs, enabling [encryption settings](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iot/ssh-iot-access) on your router keeps all internet traffic that runs through it secure and undetectable. All Wi-Fi routers are equipped with encryption features, so check your router’s manual for instructions on how to implement them.
*   **Password Management:** [Password managers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/traditional-legacy-pam) provide a centralized hub where admins can glance at real-time metrics concerning password use and vulnerabilities. They also automate many management tasks, like password generation, while gauging password strength and securely storing credentials in organized, encrypted files.

Passwords should always be handled with the utmost care and attention, but the best way to prevent password attacks is by getting rid of them completely.

The Future is Passwordless 
-------------------

The overarching problem with password-related security measures is that cybercriminals will always find new ways around them: password spraying emerged as a result of account lockout policies, and clone phishing developed as awareness of scam emails heightened. To eliminate the prevalence of password attacks, many organizations are opting to [omit passwords](https://www.ssh.com/blog/passwordless-keyless-defensive-cybersecurity) entirely, leaving hackers stranded with obsolete data.

Migrating to a [passwordless environment](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/passwordless-keyless-authentication-guide) saves enterprises time and money traditionally allocated to managing and protecting credentials, but it’s a feat that should be done gradually to avoid exposing any security gaps. Experts recommend slowly incorporating cryptography-based authentication, [ephemeral certificates](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ephemeral-certificates-and-access), and [just-in-time](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/just-in-time-access) (JIT) access features into existing architectures until all passwords are phased out.

Doing this will help eliminate the risk of falling for phishing emails that ask for login credentials, better align organizations with cybersecurity compliance standards, keep data environments clean and organized, and drastically reduce the margin for human error. If you’re unsure of where to start, SSH has just the right solution for you.

This page contains a strong random password generator. The password is generated in your browser and never sent over the Internet.

* [Secure Password Generator](#secure-password-generator)

What is a good random password like?
------------------------------------

State-of-the-art password guessing software is able to guess passwords up to about 14-16 characters (as of 2017). Unfortunately, this is more than most people can remember. For most non-critical Internet services, shorter passwords (e.g., eight random characters, or three random words) are usually enough.

If you are generating passwords for servers or other security-critical applications, we recommend using the maximum length passwords (16 characters).

Generate password

What if you don't like the generated password? 
-------------------

If you don't like the generated password, you can always generate a new one. You might want to do this, for example, if the words seem hard to remember. Just click "Generate password" again, as many times as you like. Theoretically selecting from multiple passwords makes them a bit weaker, but in practice this does not matter.

If you need a password with special characters, keep clicking on the "Generate password" button until the generated password contains a special character. You can also take just part of the generated password, and add your own characters for extra security.

How this random password generator works
----------------------------------------

For the technically minded people, here is how this strong password generator works:

1.  The entire password generator runs in the browser and is implemented in Javascript. You can audit the code by viewing the source code of this page. The generated password is never sent over the network.
2.  Approximately 120 bits of randomness is fetched from [https://www.random.org](https://www.random.org). This ensures good password quality even with old browsers.
3.  128 bits of cryptographic quality random data is added from your web browser ([window.crypto.getRandomValues](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RandomSource/getRandomValues)). Modern browsers support this, but older browsers do not. This random data ensures security of the password even against parties capable of reading HTTPS-encrypted data.
4.  32-bits of non-cryptographic quality randomness is added from your web browser (Math.random), just as an extra security measure.
5.  The random data from all three sources is concatenated, and the SHA256 hash function is used to derive a raw password from them.
6.  The result is truncated to your requested password length (96, 64, or 48 bits, based on strength).
7.  The truncated value is encoded either using BASE64 encoding (with = characters removed from the end) or by using a dictionary of 65536 words to encode each 16 bit group into a random word.
8.  The resulting password is then displayed.

Other password generators
-------------------------

### Norton Password Generator

The Norton password generator is (was?) is part of Norton's IdentitySafe suite and was available at [https://identitysafe.norton.com/password-generator/](https://identitysafe.norton.com/password-generator/). It's main difference to our generator is that the Norton password generator generates the password on the server (June 2017). This means that the method they use for generating the password cannot be independently verified, and anyone capable of breaking HTTPS encryption will be able to read the password while it is transmitted over the network. It is known that many governments routinely break HTTPS by using fake certificates or weaknesses in the SSL and TLS protocols. Consequently, **we do not recommend using the Norton Password Generator**.

### XKCD Random Password Generator

The [XKCD Random Password Generator](http://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/) does not use any cryptographic entropy on the client side. While it gets some entropy from the server, its source and quality is not known. The fact that no client-side cryptographic entropy is included suggests limited of knowledge of cryptography and randomness. The generated passwords (four-word combinations) contain less than 44 bits of randomness. This is too little - it is even less than our Weak passwords. Such passwords can be broken with brute force attacks in relatively short time. However, worst of all, it does not use HTTPS and **sends the generated passwords over the network in the clear** (June 2017). Thus, **we absolutely do not recommend using the XKCD Random Password Generator**. You can generate stronger passwords consisting of words using the password generator on this page.

### Secure Password Generator

The so called Secure Password Generator at [http://passwordsgenerator.net/](http://passwordsgenerator.net/) suffers from several weaknesses. Most importantly, it generates the password on a server using an AJAX call, and transmits the password over the internet WITHOUT ENCRYPTION. This, almost **anyone can see your password from the network** and intelligence agencies are likely to record such traffic (June 2017). Furthermore, the password is generated on the server, with no means of verifying how it is generated. Thus, we **absolutely do not recommend using it for generating any passwords**.

### Becoming passwordless with PrivX by SSH Communications Security

One of the best ways to mitigate the password risk is by adopting [passwordless authentication](/academy/iam/keyless-passwordless-authentication-guide) methods. This is particularly recommended in critical infrastructures and large IT environments, since it eliminates the need to enforce traditional password policies, manage passwords and rotate passwords in general. Passwordless authentication ensures that the user does not see or handle any secrets required to establish a connection nor does it leave behind any passwords than can be stolen or broken with any type of password attack.

[PrivX](/products/privileged-access-management-privx) by SSH allows users to authenticate themselves to IT and OT targets with passwordless authentication and without the need for the administrator to vault, rotate or otherwise manage passwords.


/. 075 [Password Strength Best Practices](https://www.ssh.com/academy/secrets-management/password-strength)
=========================================================

Password Strength Best Practices
================================

Good passwords should use a minimum of 12 to 14 characters if permitted. For security-critical systems, we recommend using 16-character randomly generated passwords.

Passwords should include lowercase and uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters with equal probability. This does not mean that every password should contain all of them. Instead, the equal probability of having them is what matters. However, many applications require having at least one character from each category.

Passwords should ideally be generated at random when possible. We recommend our browser-based, fully auditable [online password generator](/iam/password/generator). It never sends the password over the network.

Using the same password on multiple systems should be avoided. In particular, important systems should each have their own password.

Passwords should ideally not contain any elements associated with the user. No relatives' names, no pet names, no birth dates, no social security numbers, no part of the user's address, no part of the user name, nothing that can be associated with anything the user knows.

Passwords also should not be simple combinations of words, unless the words are randomly selected.

While some sources recommend not writing passwords down, in practice it is impossible to remember many random passwords. Writing them down may be a good practice, as long as the list is kept protected (e.g., in a safe). Using password manager software may also make sense. However, use of cloud-based password managers should be avoided and can be risky, especially for security-critical uses.

We at SSH Communications Security recommend businesses go passwordless instead. [Passwordless authentication](/academy/secrets-management/keyless-passwordless-authentication-guide) methods are becoming more common, and they offer many benefits over traditional [vaulting](/academy/iam/password-vault), [rotating](/academy/secrets-management/password-key-rotation) and managing passwords.

Enterprise Password Vaults: How Managing Credentials Keeps Data Safe
====================================================================

If your business relies on sticky notes, shared documents, or shared passwords to keep track of internal credentials, your sensitive data may already be at risk. Here’s why every organization should be integrating an enterprise password vault — and then start thinking beyond them.

Passwords and keys are golden tickets for hackers — unsupervised, shared, and weak credentials can serve as easy pathways for breaching an enterprise’s database to steal sensitive information. But even the most alert and trained employees are prone to human error and slip-ups, especially if there is no management software in place to keep track of individual credentials and how they’re used.

Enterprise password vaults do more than save current passwords: they update, manage, dispose of, track, and rotate them, with easy integration into existing systems. But how do you know what kind of password vault will best suit your company? This article will explain what an enterprise password vault is, its pros and cons, and what features you should look for that will ultimately keep your enterprise running safely and efficiently.

What Is an Enterprise Password Vault?
-------------------------------------

An enterprise password vault is a software solution that allows administrators to surveillance and control how passwords to privileged accounts are handled within an organization. It’s a primary component of a [Privileged Access Management (PAM)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam) system that monitors activity on high-profile and sensitive accounts. Typically, employees are given varying levels of access to an enterprise password vault to prevent credential leaks and keep accountability transparent, with a high-ranking employee assigned administrative authority over all accounts.

There are two types of password vault managers: on-device and cloud-sync. On-device password vaults save data on an individual device, which makes it harder for cybercriminals to break through since they have to use that device to do so. However, this also means on-device vaults cannot be accessed remotely, causing an inconvenience for administrators who may want to run a quick diagnostic or audit.

Cloud-sync managers, on the other hand, store credentials and related data on a remote server. This allows several devices to access the same credentials, which is useful for those who work from home and may need to rotate between a tablet, laptop, and desktop computer. However, cloud systems are far more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and can provide hackers with more information than they initially sought.

Benefits of Using a Password Vault Manager
------------------------------------------

Let’s face it: most passwords people set are relatively simple, short, and easy to guess, even when they’re prompted to add special characters and numbers into the mix. With many organizations requiring staff to change their passwords regularly, thinking of a complex code word every few months becomes difficult and cumbersome — not to mention, it takes time to manage all of this. Company password vaults eliminate the headaches that come with manual credential security measures while ensuring the generation of strong passwords and regenerating them when necessary.

The _best_ password vaults integrate smoothly into existing workstreams, ridding employees of disruptive and spammy credential prompts while keeping track of account behavior, access attempts, authentication processes, and expired passwords. Vault managers can also make these logs exportable, eliminating the need to manually input credential data on a vulnerable spreadsheet or document file. Enterprise password vaults are akin to around-the-clock security officers that give you control over how they operate to keep credentials encrypted, unpredictable, and inaccessible.

Considerations When Using a Password Vault Manager
--------------------------------------------------

Storing credentials in a centralized management system makes life easier for employees — and hackers. If a single password for a high privileged account falls into the wrong hands, then all other linked accounts and the information stored by them are compromised. That’s why it’s vital to have company-wide procedures established as an added security blanket. Such safeguards should include:

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Even if an attacker manages to steal a password, MFA asks for additional information specific to the user for which the password is intended. This is especially useful for cloud-sync managers as failed authentication attempts can flag the intruder and alert the user.
*   **Limited or Monitored Password Sharing:** Ideally, organizations should not be sharing passwords as it increases the possibility of human error and leaks; however, there are circumstances where the convenience associated with sharing passwords may seem necessary to maintain operations. In that case, consider keeping shared passwords between as few people as possible or finding a vault manager that facilitates secure password sharing.
*   **Auto-Fill Capabilities:** Browser extensions that fill in credentials automatically can also accurately distinguish between legitimate and malware-ridden websites. If a suspicious website is entered, auto-fill capabilities pause and advise the user to leave the site.

No solution is 100 percent foolproof, but implementing various preventative measures can significantly reduce the threat of a cyberattack.

What to Look For in an Enterprise Password Vault
------------------------------------------------

Whether you’re shopping around for a shared password vault or want to know if yours is providing sufficient protection, it can be overwhelming trying to figure out the best password vault management solution. But there’s one key feature that will dictate how well a password vault manager will work within an organization: ease of navigation.

If your employees find a password solution confusing or frustrating to use, it could deter them from wanting to adopt it. After all, what good is a top-of-the-line, multitasking enterprise password vault if it remains idle and unused? Moreover, suppose an employee is not entirely sure how to use their company vault manager. In that case, they could accidentally alter settings that may make their passwords more vulnerable or reset all their credentials.

Another crucial factor that should be evaluated when looking for a suitable password manager is its efficacy. How well does the vault manager protect passwords? What precautions are available in the case of a breach? How does the vault manager ensure that only authorized users access certain privileged accounts? Each enterprise runs in its own unique way, so you’ll have to prioritize which features are worth investing in for your organization.

Nonetheless, all enterprise password vaults should have the following five baseline features to sufficiently guard your accounts and confidential data.

### 1. Industry-Approved Encryption Algorithms

When they’re not being used, passwords to all accounts should be encrypted with algorithms recommended by trusted cybersecurity networks. The current industry standard is 256-bit AES encryption, the longest (and therefore most complex) open-source key. However, experts suggest having a failsafe authentication system, such as MFA, to complicate breach attempts further.

### 2. Password Generation Guidance

For existing accounts where credentials were user-generated, a password vault manager should be able to alert employees if their current [passwords are weak](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/password/strength). For new accounts, the vault manager, upon the user’s request, should generate solid credentials and save them for later use. Because this process takes just a few seconds to complete, it encourages employees to eventually migrate all their credentials to the vault manager so that they’re consistently updated to a dependable strength.

### 3. Centralized Management Hub

Administrators should have access to an interface that’s user-friendly and straightforward. From permission-sharing to setting master password requirements, vault administrators should be able to establish parameters for credential creation, as well as see how all passwords are being used and for what purpose. At the same time, administrators shouldn’t be given complete and total control over all accounts. For instance, employee passwords shouldn’t be visible, and administrators shouldn’t be able to change them.

### 4. Reliable Vendor Troubleshooting

A company vault manager requires constant updating to stay on top of new threats that emerge every day and resolve any bugs that may surface. It’s important to read consumer reviews regarding vendor responsiveness and support when vulnerabilities develop. For example, an excellent vendor should be able to offer 24-hour availability to connect with a support team to walk you through any troubleshooting steps and respond to product issues that may need modification.

### 5. Administrative Auditing

The best password vault managers keep administrators accountable and aware of the weight of their access privileges through running logs that track activity within the vault system. These logs should be easy to download and export in cases of suspicious behavior in order to keep internal responsibilities in check.

The Future is Passwordless
--------------------------

Cybercriminals are becoming more resourceful by the hour. As a result, experts believe that to best mitigate breaches and malware, [passwords and vaults](/blog/better-without-password-vaulting) should be retired altogether. This is because passwords tend to leave a trail of crumbs that hackers can hold onto until they acquire the right technology or information to crack them. Human error will always remain an internal threat as well, and going passwordless would mean entirely eliminating that threat.

However, going passwordless will take a lot of time and resources, so industry experts suggest gradually working towards this goal at a pace that suits your business. So, how exactly do you make this transition?

Credentials are considered a “knowledge factor” because they’re created by users and intended to be remembered. Unfortunately, hackers love to prey on knowledge factors because they’re often easy to guess. Adopting a passwordless approach requires shifting from knowledge factors to “possession factors” (such as user-specific devices, online accounts, and custom links), “inherent factors” (biological components such as fingerprint scans and facial recognition), or a combination of both.

Examples of passwordless systems include certain implementations of [encyption keys](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/ssh-key-basics). But just like passwords, these keys must be properly managed and supervised, since getting hold of a key is the same as having access to a password — they both open the door to the target. What’s more, SSH key management has proven very difficult for many vault solutions, which typically can handle only 20% of all SSH keys in the best-case scenario.

There are ways for companies to go passwordless and keyless with [ephemeral](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ephemeral_access) certificate-based authentication. In this model, access is granted [just-in-time](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/just-in-time) at the time of authentication, but no keys or passwords are left behind to be managed. In theory, this model can eliminate the need to use password vaults entirely, but in practice, enterprises need vaults because this ‘credential-less’ approach is not technologically viable in all environments.

The solution is to use vaults when needed and become passwordless and keyless where possible.

Passwords, [cryptographic keys](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cryptography), access tokens, [cloud service](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/cloud-service-providers) credentials — whatever secrets your organization may have, they’re at risk of being compromised if they’re not sufficiently managed. However, implementing effective secrets management presents a significant challenge for organizations, because it requires the right combination of software applications, internal policies, and best practices. In this guide, we’ll dive into what secrets management should consist of and which solutions are worth investing in.

What Is a “Secret”?
-------------------

Secrets are more than just credentials — a secret can be any information used to authenticate access, secure confidential files, and validate identities as both human and non-human entities interact with other users, applications, and devices.

Think of secrets as the cogs in a wheel, with the wheel being a communicable entity. If two IoT devices, for instance, wanted to transmit data to each other, a chain of events must occur for the process to happen. This process usually involves validating secrets at every step to ensure that communication is safe, authentic, and stable. As each secret is confirmed, the cogs of both wheels start turning until they can function seamlessly with one another, performing the intended action.

Secrets come in all shapes and sizes, with varying responsibilities. They include:

*   **Cryptographic Keys:** Strings of lengthy, algorithm-generated numerical data primarily dedicated to [encrypting and decrypting](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh-keys) sensitive data.
*   **User Credentials:** User-generated or browser-generated usernames and passwords that validate users trying to access a suite of private information on the internet.
*   **Certificates:** Digitally signed documents that add enhanced authentication measures to accurately identify the validity of users, websites, and software. [Ephemeral certificates](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/ephemeral-certificates-and-access) are growing in popularity as an alternative passwordless option that provides extra security.
*   **Cloud Credentials**: Data used to authenticate users accessing items stored in a [cloud environment](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud-computing-definition). These are either generated by the cloud service provider or the user requesting its services and can include domain IDs, access and secret keys, standard username-password pairs, and more.
*   **Database Connection Strings:** Specially formatted bits of code harbored inside of software applications and used to communicate with databases. They include keyword value pairs connected by equal signs and separated by semi-colons, all in clear text format.
*   **Access Tokens:** Objects that carry and share authenticated user information to applications to trigger an application programming interface (API) request and [enable users](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/just-in-time-security-tokens) to perform particular tasks.
*   **API Keys:** Code that identifies and validates users requesting access to an application and enforces their [access privileges](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/privileged-account).

What Is Secrets Management?
---------------------------

Secrets management focuses on data security and consists of many moving parts that come together to comprehensively manage and secure credentials, software programs, resources, assets, and machines. It can involve IAM and PAM integration, robust internal IT policies, informational hygiene practices, and other automated solutions that improve visibility, scalability, and control over how secrets are used and who has access to them.

Why Is Secrets Management Important?
------------------------------------

Secrets are used in various cases, as we’ve already touched on in this guide, and serve as a thin digital security blanket shielding private communications and transactions from outside actors. They’re a first-level line of defense used to secure credentials against common threats like [man-in-the-middle](https://www.ssh.com/academy/attack/man-in-the-middle) (MITM), [brute force](https://www.ssh.com/blog/ssh-key-scan-attack-honeypot), and phishing attacks. However, secrets are only suitable for ensuring data security if they’re managed appropriately.

Consider this — a user could have a highly complex, hard-to-crack password, but its efficacy goes to waste if that same user shares it with others via email or accidentally leaks it due to poor IT practices.

Often discouraged by the amount of groundwork that needs to be covered with secrets management, organizations may relax their approach to managing and securing credentials across their entire informational infrastructure. This significantly increases the likelihood of a breach ushered in by [human error](https://www.ssh.com/blog/better-without-permanent-access), which can cause severe disruptions down the line.

In IT landscapes, stolen secrets can lead to hacked accounts, identity theft, privacy violations, reputational damage, and catastrophic financial losses. In OT environments, the consequences of misused secrets can turn fatal, with malicious hackers [inflicting physical damage](https://www.ssh.com/academy/operational-technology-breaches) by remotely controlling connected machinery.

You wouldn’t just place the keys to your safe, car, and home right at your doorstep for anyone to use — so why risk leaving your company’s secrets similarly exposed?

What Is a Secrets Manager or Secrets Management Solution?
---------------------------------------------------------

A secrets manager centralizes access to an organization’s valuable assets while safely storing all sensitive data needed to use and configure them. It allows administrators to generate SSH keys and passwords, assign access roles, manage credentials, and dispose of secrets at the end of their lifecycle, closing any possible security gaps that might otherwise go unnoticed.

It is important to understand that a secrets manager alone can only do so much in today’s bustling, scalable, and highly interconnected IT and OT networks. Employees must also do their part to prevent common [security pitfalls](https://www.ssh.com/blog/cybersecurity-trends-to-track). Adherence to internal security policies, careful attention, and a well-established list of best practices is key to keeping everyone on the same page.

What Are the Best Practices for Secrets Management?
---------------------------------------------------

When it comes to data security, every individual has a role to play, even with a reliable secrets manager in place. These six best practices will help your organization make the most of your secrets management solution:

### Categorize All Credentials

Organizing secrets by content type and use can help your team better manage credentials across your organization. For example, knowing where access credentials to business, personal, IT, health, and financial data are located allows administrators to troubleshoot an issue quickly and nullify secrets that have been stolen.

This practice also reduces credential clutter, providing a clearer picture of how each secret type is used throughout an enterprise. This is particularly useful for companies that rely on both in-house and cloud-based environments.

### Minimize Privileged Circles

To best keep secrets private, it’s recommended that organizations limit the number of employees who have privileged access to a master list or have comprehensive roles within a secrets manager. This significantly diminishes the chance of [human error](https://www.ssh.com/blog/why-should-you-secure-your-email) and suspicious internal behavior occurring that may go unnoticed.

Moreover, this practice helps organizations better secure credentials from wandering eyes. Smaller privileged circles also make these users and their activities more visible, maintaining accountability and encouraging compliance with internal security policies.

### Fortify Assets At Rest

Encryption during transactional events is an essential feature all organizations should look for in a secrets management solution, but encryption at rest is also important. Ideally, secrets should always be encrypted so that if they leak, they appear indecipherable. Otherwise, they remain in plain text format, making it far easier for hackers to misuse them.

### Fine-Tune Access Permissions

Practice the principle of least privilege, which sets user permissions with just enough access to perform their authorized tasks. Many secrets managers also provide auditing tools to help administrators detect unauthorized secrets use and include permission settings for better threat prevention.

When it comes to identity credentials, try to switch up where and how you store them. Harboring usernames, passwords, and keys in the same places makes their location predictable, should a hacker breach your organization’s IT infrastructure.

### Monitor Chains of Trust

Certificate chains of trust are afflicted with vulnerabilities at every touchpoint, making x.509 certificates and SSH keys crucial sources of validation and security as users connect to sites and servers.

However, it’s worth keeping an eye out for any gaps these tools may not fully address. Dedicate time to monitoring these authentication procedures regularly to prevent untrusted networks from being tapped into and cybercriminals from sneaking in.

### Prioritize IAM and PAM Integrations

Identity and Access Management ([IAM](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam)) and Privileged Access Management ([PAM](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam)) should work seamlessly with the secrets manager you choose to implement. While IAM focuses on strengthening identity authentication measures, PAM centers on the level of access a user is given once they are authenticated.

Since secrets management solutions involve safeguarding the sensitive data that’s exchanged and accessed through these processes, having seamless IAM and PAM integration automates security protocols to cover all vulnerable areas without compromising efficiency.

=========================================================

Secrets Vault
=============

Secrets are easy to create, but hard to keep safe. And IT environments are full of secrets, including tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys. These secrets open access to mission-critical information, which makes secrets management and security organizations' top priorities.

At the same time, IT environments consist of a mix of technologies, and every organization's environment is at a different stage of maturity. Some are much further along the way toward cloudification or even containerization, whereas others are run mainly by physical servers. Most IT environments are somewhere in between, in a hybrid stage.

Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet method for securing access secrets. The best approach depends on the use case. In this article, we explore and summarize the best practices of secrets vaulting.

To vault or not to vault, that is the question
----------------------------------------------

The easiest way to manage secrets is when they don’t have to be managed at all. That is why our solution [PrivX](/products/privileged-access-management-privx) is built around [just-in-time access tokens](/academy/iam/just-in-time-security-tokens) and [ephemeral certificates](https://info.ssh.com/privx_ephemeral_certificates_white_paper) that are created at the time of establishing a connection and then expire automatically after authorization. Like this, users never see or handle any secrets during the process, which improves an organization's security posture even further.

Temporary access tokens and ephemeral access tokens are a great fit for multi-cloud and hybrid environments. They allow enterprises to align their operations with [Zero Trust and Zero Standing Privileges](/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework) frameworks where you keep your environment free from credentials, reduce the complexity of managing them, and adopt [passwordless and credential-less](https://info.ssh.com/passwordless-keyless-white-paper) paradigms.

This approach leaves no secrets behind to vault or manage, freeing companies from traditional [secrets management](/academy/iam/secrets-management) altogether.

In fact, PrivX turns privileged access management (PAM) passwordless for many use cases: by integrating PrivX with identity and access management systems (IAM), users log in via single-sign-on (SSO) to their targets without worrying about credentials. This is not only a security boost, but it also saves time and makes day-to-day operations run smoother.

It might seem contradictory that when we talk about secrets vaulting, we recommend going vault-less and passwordless. The truth is: not all IT environments or use cases support this approach. That is why PrivX also offers other options, such as Secrets Vault, where access secrets can be stored, secured, and retrieved when needed.

So, when should you vault your secrets instead of using just-in-time access tokens that leave no secrets behind?

An example case of secrets vaulting: Automated access
-----------------------------------------------------

Typically, storing secrets has been associated with interactive access and privileged access management (PAM). However, automated connections - like application-to-application (A2A), machine-to-machine (M2M), or robotic process automation (RPA) communications - easily outnumber those made by humans.

For example, let’s take a closer look at applications. Applications have identities, but their access credentials and privileges are often all over the place, and they typically exist outside IAM or directory services, like Active Directory (AD). Moreover, automated applications might be generating thousands of requests per second, as opposed to interactive sessions where the rate is often significantly lower.

Some of the key points to consider include:

*   How many applications (e. g. web servers) can or should you connect to your databases?
*   What level of access privilege do those applications need?
*   Is it a read, use, or write type of access? (If it’s another type of target, like the Amazon Simple Storage Service Amazon S3 object storage service.)
*   What types of secrets grant access to the targets?
*   Can you track and audit their sessions if needed?

For database access, your application needs a username and a password. For S3 access, it needs an API token. If you are dealing with server-to-server access, it might need an SSH key. That is a wide variety of secrets already, just based on the target.

  

Why do application secrets need vaulting?
-----------------------------------------

In the past, the common practice was to create high-trust environments. An IT team would set up a security perimeter, inside which automated file transfers would run without interruptions. The required credentials were usually kept in plain-text format, hardcoded in the application, embedded in configuration files, part of configuration management, or integrated with version control.

Even back in the day, this was a dubious approach, since valuable secrets were basically up for grabs inside the high-trust security perimeter. But organizations were able to get away with it since only the initiated got access to the high-trust network.

Nowadays, enterprises are connected in various ways, and we live in the age of Zero Trust where no connection should be trusted by default. Instead, it should be verified every time it is established. The traditional security perimeter is gone - many critical maintenance, upgrade, and update tasks are outsourced, and applications are in contact with each other globally.

There is a clear need for a solution that manages all credentials and secrets, ensures that they are used securely, puts them under proper access controls, and ensures the right level of privilege per application access – typically a minimal amount of privilege to get the job done.

PrivX Secrets Vault does exactly that.

  

When to vault interactive session secrets?
------------------------------------------

Again, our recommendation is rather simple: if possible, organizations should use automatically expiring and just-in-time generated ephemeral certificates. If it is not possible right now, PrivX Secrets Vault is the secure access stronghold for managing secrets for tools that are used in software and infrastructure deployment, testing, orchestration, and configuration.

PrivX allows your organization to decide their own path toward modern secrets management. As an organization's environment and technologies evolve, PrivX enables migrating from a vault-based approach to a passwordless and vault-less paradigm.

When you modernize your environment and when you are ready for it, PrivX offers exactly that - a migration path to the passwordless world at your own pace.

Secrets Vault Benefits
----------------------

### No exposed secrets left behind

Many critical tasks, like automated file transfers or DevOps development cycles, still operate outside proper identity governance and administration (IGA), leaving secrets non-compliant or exposed for misuse. With PrivX Secrets Vault, you can onboard those secrets into a vault and mitigate risks.

### Protect all types of secrets

PrivX helps you secure, protect, and control access to:

*   Tokens
*   Certificates
*   Passwords
*   Encryption keys
*   Pieces of code

Basically, all secrets that are used through a UI, CLI, or HTTP API to access sensitive or mission-critical data.

### Manage non-interactive access with proper levels of granularity

Bring automated connections, like application-to-application (A2A), machine-to-machine (M2M), and Robotic Process Automation (RPA), under role-based access controls (RBAC). Make access lifecycle management fast and easy by associating non-human identities with a role. Manage their access and their level of privilege based on a small number of roles instead of identities, which can be counted in thousands.

### Keep your identities and roles in sync automatically

Integrate machine identities and human identities alike to the trusted identity provider of your choice. PrivX Secrets Vault automatically stays in sync with any changes to identities, making sure that the right identity is associated with the right role, or that access rights are revoked automatically - and almost in real time - if the identity is removed from your IAM.

### Audit and track sessions

Stay in control of all activities in your environment by auditing and tracking each session whether they are interactive or non-interactive.

### Centralize access and workflow processes

Put your access management under a single pane of glass with PrivX's multi-tenant vault. Use consistent, centralized, and well-defined workflows to manage secrets and access that they enable.

### Personal password manager

Allow your privileged users to store their own secrets in the vault, using it as their secure personal password manager for highly valuable secrets.

### Enable collaborative secrets management

Enable collaborative secrets management based on a role for privileged users, instead of them sharing secrets or using hard-coded credentials. PrivX Secrets Vault contains ready-made templates to help you get started.

Secrets Vault Use Cases
-----------------------

**1. Interactive UI access for environments that do not support certificates**

PrivX Secrets Vault is based on role-based access controls (RBAC). The user logs into PrivX and always sees an up-to-date list of accessible targets based on their role. If the target requires a password, the user retrieves the masked password from the vault and enters it into PrivX when prompted. The secrets available to the user are always limited by the role and the level of privilege associated with that role.

**2. Interactive command line interface (CLI) access** **in DevOps**

For those contexts where a CLI is needed, PrivX Secrets Vault ensures that secrets are accessible through an easy-to-use CLI tool. For example, for DevOps teams, this means that instead of the DevOps team sharing or using hard-coded secrets assigned to individual users, they can use a centralized vault where these secrets are stored.

**3. Application-to-application (A2A), machine-to-machine (M2M), and Robotic Process Automation (RBA) access**

PrivX Secrets Vault enables A2A, M2M, and RPA communication without risky, hard-coded target system credentials or credentials embedded in the code. Instead, these credentials are stored in the vault, which the non-human identities then access through a REST API to enable their automated connections. With the vault, you can centrally manage, control, track, and audit these processes and their secrets as needed.

**4. Collaborative admin secrets management for critical IT infrastructure access**

Use PrivX Secrets Vault as a centralized safe for a team of administrators to store encryption keys, access tokens, or break glass credentials. These can be used to access web applications, network devices, databases, or servers. No need to share secrets, the vault is the only location where a secret has to be updated.

**5. Digital safe for break glass credentials**

Use a single PrivX Secrets Vault instance as a centralized safe for critical secrets to be handled with extraordinary care, like break glass credentials. You can isolate the instance from your IAM integrations and set specific rules (like firewall or VPN configurations) on how these secrets can be accessed even if network connections are down.

Key Features of Secrets Vault
-----------------------------

**FEATURES**

Secrets vault as a microservice

The vault stores the secret data in encrypted format along with the metadata in the database. Internally, it uses the key vault API for performing secret encryption and decryption.

Role-based access control to target hosts

Users can be dynamically mapped to roles. You can view hosts that are accessible by specific roles.

Context-based roles

Restrict access based on the day of the week, time of the day, or IP addresses for specific roles.

Restrictions based on access groups

Restrict access based on access groups that can be, for example, departments or functions inside an organization. Even as an admin, you only get access to the area of the network your department is entitled to access.

Directory service integration

Users and groups can be synced with Microsoft AD, Azure AD via Graph API, Google G Suite, LDAP, and OpenID Connect providers (e.g. AWS Cognito, Okta, Ubisecure).

Sign-in and access control to PrivX

*   Single sign-on (SSO) through directory service applications via Kerberos
*   Username & password for local users

What are standing privileges?
-----------------------------

Standing privileges is a term that describes broad user access privileges that are essentially “always on.” In other words, a user with standing privileges to critical IT resources always has those privileges, regardless of whether that user actually needs access to those resources at this time, or indeed ever.

Standing privileges run counter to the principle of least privileged access, which is one of the core philosophies of the [Zero Trust framework](https://www.ssh.com/iam/zero-trust-framework). That principle argues that users should only have access to the exact resources they need to do their job at a given time, and no more than that.

Traditional PAM creates standing privileges
-------------------------------------------

Typically, any organization with network infrastucture or any critical data or assets, has personal [privileged accounts](/iam/user/privileged-account) in play - privileged accounts and privileges exist. [Traditional PAM](/iam/pam/traditional) tools have relied on the creation of accounts and privileges.

As the need for privileged access provisioning has grown in complex environments, enterprises face challenges to achieve ZSP. Administrative and maintenance access that includes broad privileges, persistant shared accounts, superuser and root accounts, never-offboarded 3rd party privileges, and password-based access to systems and applications, all contribute the growth of standing privileges.

The risks of standing privileges
--------------------------------

Standing privileges create the risk of excessive access. If user credentials with standing privileges are compromised, a hacker could have unencumbered access to all of the IT resources those credentials can access, at all times. Organizations that are looking to reduce their attack surface, the risk of data breaches and achieve compliance should make it a priority to eliminate the number of accounts that have standing privileges and to move toward a zero standing privilege framework.

What Are Zero Standing Privileges?
-----------------------------------

Zero Standing Privileges (ZSP) is a term coined by analysts, [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com), to describe the target state for privileged access in an organization to minimize risk of stolen credentials, privilege abuse, breaches, data loss and non-compliance.

Gartner's summary of their [Remove Standing Privileges Through a Just-in-Time PAM Approach](https://blog.ssh.com/gartner-standing-privileges-are-a-risk) research states: "The existence of privileged access carries significant risk, and even with PAM tools in place, the residual risk of users with standing privileges remains high. Security and risk management leaders engaged in IAM must implement a zero standing privileges strategy through a [just-in-time](/academy/iam/just-in-time) model."

Zero Standing Privileges solutions
----------------------------------

SSH.COM has developed a comprehensive set of[just-in-time (JIT)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/just-in-time)[Zero Trust](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework) solutions that support Gartner's approach for Zero Standing Privileges for user or machine ID authentication. This helps to mitigate the risk of managing digital keys, privileged passwords and other secrets (like API tokens or certificates) by greatly reducing their numbers in IT infrastructures.

What is Privileged Access?
--------------------------

Privileged access means computer access with higher access rights than those of a standard user in an enterprise. Typically, privileged access is used to maintain, upgrade and configure critical IT infrastructures, servers, applications and databases. Examples include [root](/iam/user/root) access, [Administrator](/academy/iam/user/privileged-account) access, or access to [service accounts](/academy/iam/user/privileged-account). Sometimes any access to the command line on a server is considered privileged access, as most enterprise users are only allowed to use applications through their user interface.

Some privileged accounts are operating system accounts with command-line access; other privileged accounts are application accounts with higher privileges (e.g., accounts that can change the configuration of an application).

With [privileged accounts](/academy/iam/user/privileged-account), privileged users can access highly valuable targets like the company network infrastructure, medical records credit card databases, software production environments or government secrets. Typically a privileged user has access to one or more privileged accounts.

Privileged access may also be obtained through other means. For example, a user with physical access to a computer can usually reboot the computer from a DVD or USB memory stick and perform any desired operations on the computer. Thus, users with physical access may also sometimes be considered privileged users.

As operations in all industries are becoming digitalized and secure remote access is more commonplace, new targets that are considered privileged have emerged. These include industrial control systems (ICS) in operational technology, network switches in IT environments and access to company customer relationship management (CRM) databases. The accounts allowing access to such targets are considered privileged as well.

What Is Privileged Access Management?
-------------------------------------

Privileged access management (PAM) is used to mitigate the threats of credential theft and privilege misuse. PAM as a concept is an important part of cybersecurity strategy with a purpose to control, track, secure and audit all human and non-human (interactive and automated) privileged identities and activities in an enterprise IT environment.

PAM is a subfield of Identity and Access Management (IAM).

Sometimes referred to as [privileged identity management (PIM)](https://www.cyberark.com/blog/pam-vs-pim-privilege-by-any-name-is-a-priority/) or [privileged access security (PAS)](https://www.cyberark.com/?page_id=23009), PAM is grounded in the [principle of least privilege](https://www.cyberark.com/what-is/least-privilege/), wherein users only receive the minimum levels of access required to perform their job functions. The principle of least privilege is widely considered to be a cybersecurity best practice and is a fundamental step in protecting privileged access to high-value data and assets. By enforcing the principle of least privilege, organizations can reduce the attack surface and mitigate the risk from [malicious insiders](https://www.cyberark.com/solutions/security-risk-management/insider-threats/) or external cyber attacks that can lead to costly data breaches.

Privileged access management typically includes **definition of roles** for users and **granting required privileges**, or access rights, for those roles. It also includes **distributing** the user information and access grants to all the devices and systems that enforce access rights in the organization. Furthermore, it usually includes **monitoring** what privileged users actually do and **analyzing** their activities to detect anomalies.

PAM Links to Insider Risk and Vendor Risk
-----------------------------------------

Users with privileged access are typically insiders in the organization. They include system administrators, database administrators, developers, architects, application owners, and IT managers. Most privileged users are insiders who already have access to the organization and its systems. Statistically, most cybercrimes are perpetrated by or assisted by insiders. Thus, controlling and monitoring privileged access **reduces insider risk**.

Many external vendors and outsourcing partners also have access to critical systems and data. For example, [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) was a contractor to the US government. In the famous [Target breach](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/target-hackers-broke-in-via-hvac-company/), the hackers used an HVAC contractor as a stepping stone to get to their actual target. There are also recent examples of [high-impact breaches involving privileged passwords](/academy/password-credential-breaches). It is common for IT adminstration to be contracted to offshore outsourcing partners. Controlling and monitoring privileged access is an important part of **reducing vendor risk**.

Traditional Privileged Access Management
----------------------------------------

The traditional approach to privileged access management has been to automatically change the passwords for privileged accounts several times per day, and store the passwords in a [password vault](/iam/password/vault). A jump server or client software is then used to authenticate the user, obtain the current password from the vault, and login to the target server. Alternatively, a web portal may be provided for obtaining the current password for the target account and displaying it to the user. The password would typically be valid for a fixed period, such as one hour, or until expressly released by the user.

The traditional analyst worldview on PAM has been on the [traditional approach](/iam/pam/traditional). They compare products based on their password rotation, password vaulting, etc features. But the next generation needs none of this. It solves privileged access management differently.

Traditional Privileged Access Management in the Cloud
-----------------------------------------------------

PAM deployments are notoriously difficult. Read, for example, [http://security-architect.com/privileged-account-management-pam-is-very-important-but-deploying-it-stinks/](http://security-architect.com/privileged-account-management-pam-is-very-important-but-deploying-it-stinks/).

The traditional approach changes the way system administrators work and many administrators hate it. It also requires substantial infrastructure, with some large organizations reportedly needing over a hundred vaults/jump servers to scale to their infrastructure. Password vaults become a single point of failure. For automation, every script has to be changed to obtain the password from a vault.

The traditional approach also does not scale into cloud, containers, and particularly elastically scaling computing environments. It becomes very cumbersome to implement password vaulting when computing instances go up and down as needed and often only live for a few seconds.

Furthermore, the traditional approach often requires installing (and patching!) software on servers and clients. This is costly and resource-intensive.

Read more about [PAM in the cloud >](/academy/iam/privileged-access-management-in-the-cloud)

What to look for in new Privileged Access Management
----------------------------------------------------

New technology has made it possible to implement privileged access management without password vaulting and without new software or agents installed on servers or clients. This substantially speeds up deployment, reduces overhead, and helps scale to cloud and elastic environments.

A truly modern and future-proof Privileged Access Management for multi-cloud needs and agile architecture. It is designed for elastic cloud environments from the start. It gets rid of passwords, password vaulting, and password rotation. Deployment becomes way easier and faster. The total project cost is greatly reduced, and time to full deployment easily drops by a factor of ten.

### PAM without password vaults and password rotation...

Next-gen PAM uses [short-lived ephemeral certificates](/academy/iam/ephemeral_access), invisible to the end-user, to enable access over secure SSH and RDP connections. Your privileged users get one-click jump host to the right cloud hosts via SSO and with optional MFA. This approach is passwordless and keyless, since access is granted just-in-time for authentication, but the authorization to the target expires automatically, leaving no keys or passwords behind to manage, forget or lose.

### ...except when you still need them in privileged access.

The reality is that going passwordless and keyless is not possible overnight. Customers have legacy environments that require key management, password vaulting and rotation. For this reason, the next-gen PAM needs to be hybrid and supports various credential management methods. It allows customers to manage access to their legacy critical infrastructures while migrating to more modern access approaches at the same time when they modernize their applications.

### Privileged 3rd & party access centralized

Agile business units need to grant all types of secure access to critical resources: permanent, temporary, internal and external. With PrivX, all your sessions are granted, secured and controlled through one, centralized system. Say goodbye to backdoors and rogue keys.

### PAM for Multi-cloud, hybrid cloud and on-prem

Next-gen PAM software makes managing privileged user access scalable, lean and rapid to deploy to multi-cloud and hybrid. Administrators enjoy role-based access control (RBAC) and re-use of existing AD/LDAP groups to automate access provisioning. Users make 1-click SSH or RDP connections from their browser –without sharing credentials, using SSH keys or password vaults. No need to install anything on the client or the server.

### Autodiscover global cloud instances with PAM

Next-gen PAM solution comes with an auto-discovery feature that automatically scans your environment for all the available cloud hosts at all times from all regions. Your admins get a single pane of glass to cloud hosts. Your developers always know which host they can access.

### Save valuable time on deploying privileged access management

Installation, deployment and configuration of future-proof PAM only takes a day. After that, maintenance work is lightweight and straightforward. Don’t worry about dedicating a team to handle a high-cost, high-maintenance product: the PAM solution leaves no footprint in your environment and updates automatically.

### Integrate PAM with AD, LDAP & IdaaS

Next-gen PAM helps you avoid duplicate work. You use your existing user identities from your AD/LDAP and the solution fetches user groups for you automatically. It’s not like basic PAMs where you have to duplicate your users manually or worry about keeping two separate systems up-to-date!


/. 082 [Least Privilege](https://www.ssh.com/academy/pam/what-is-least-privilege)
=========================================================

What Is Least Privilege and How Do You Use It?
==============================================

A data breach is the last thing your business needs. But even with passwords and multi-factor authentication, a cyberattack is always possible. Recovering from a security compromise can cost precious time and money — not to mention a loss of trust in your brand — which is why it is essential that businesses take proactive steps to mitigate the risk of a breach as much as possible.

One of the most important components of account security is privilege assignment. Privileged accounts [protect sensitive information](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/privileged-account) using role-based authentication, as well as other parameters that specify the data a user is allowed to access. The aim of privilege delegation is to ensure users can only access the data they need. This helps avoid insider threats and minimize the fallout of password compromise.

But even a sophisticated privileged access system isn’t entirely immune to cyber attacks. To optimize and maximize account security, [Zero Trust architecture](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework) — in which the principle of least privilege plays a key role — is recommended.

Least privilege offers a defense against insider threats, hackers, and other cyberattacks. Let’s take a look at what least privilege entails and why the concept of least privilege is so important in Zero Trust security.

What Does Least Privilege Mean in IT?
-------------------------------------

Before we can address the importance of least privilege, it’s important to define least privilege in the context of the modern cybersecurity landscape. In theory, least privilege refers to minimum access for each user — with no user able to access data that is not necessary to perform their job. In practice, it’s rarely possible to implement least privilege perfectly. Users in the real world will need to navigate IT systems quickly, without the need for authentication at every step.

Even programs can abide by the concept of least privilege. When applications need access to sensitive information, least privilege can help ensure each tool only has access to the data it needs to operate. Zero Trust architecture aims to get as close as possible to least privilege, by using multifactor authentication and ephemeral access certificates to protect privileged information.

The principle of least privilege (PoLP) is a central component of [privileged access management (PAM)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam), and is considered a best practice for modern cybersecurity. In today’s IT environment, it is possible to implement the principles of least privilege with streamlined safeguards that can optimize privileged access while maintaining a fast and easy user experience.

How Do You Use Least Privilege?
-------------------------------

The traditional approach to cybersecurity is perimeter-based — meaning users can access information once they have proven their credentials. Least privilege access avoids the pitfalls of perimeter security by creating privilege tiers that are highly specific to each user. To properly manage an organization using the principle of least privilege, your organization needs a dynamic approach to privileged access management. Instead of setting one-time credentials, effective least privilege management involves granting new privileges to employees as they progress through their tasks.

Even though least privilege is a more effective alternative to perimeter security, a potential concern in least privilege is known as “privilege creep” — the idea that, once privileges are granted, they are not revoked. With privilege creep, even highly granular PAM solutions can leave doors open to potential cyberattacks. Addressing privilege creep is necessary for an effective Zero Trust approach, by using ephemeral access credentials to minimize insider threats.

Best Practices for Implementing the Least Privilege Principle
-------------------------------------------------------------

For effective use of the principle of least privilege, there are certain steps every IT team should take. The best practices for implementing the least privilege principle effectively include:

*   **Monitor continuously.** By constantly monitoring your privileged account access, you can identify which users have unnecessary or inappropriate access to passwords and keys. Regular surveillance allows you to prevent privilege creep and identify the source of potential threats. Remember to monitor permissions for cloud-based applications, not just your on-premises data.
*   **Set up alerts.** In addition to auditing consistently, an alert system can help you detect unusual activity before a major data breach occurs.

*   **Establish administrative accounts.** When you separate administrative accounts from other users, you can help to ensure that privileged users aren’t able to access administrative capabilities unless it’s absolutely necessary.

*   **[Rotate passwords](/academy/iam/password-key-rotation) regularly.** By rotating passwords and keys, you can avoid the risk of cyberattackers gaining access to privileged account credentials.
*   **Set** [**just-in-time (JIT)**](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/just-in-time-access) **privileges.** JIT privileges are a central component of least privilege, offering a specific timeframe for the use of access on an as-needed basis. This access is based on [e](/academy/iam/ephemeral-certificates-and-access)[phemeral certificates](/academy/iam/ephemeral-certificates-and-access) to ensure that the credentials needed for the connections are created just-in-time and disappear immediately after use. The users never see or handle the credentials nor are the any credentials left to manage .When you replace standing passwords with JIT access, you can ensure data is only available to the right user at the right time.

What Are the Benefits of Least Privilege?
-----------------------------------------

In today’s cybersecurity environment, privileged accounts are one of the most common sources of security compromise. By ensuring users can only access the data they need, when they need it, IT administrators can effectively minimize the surface area of a cyberattack.

Insider threats from privileged users aren’t the only threat that’s thwarted by implementing the least privilege access principle. In the case of malware, unwanted requests are unable to move through the system because of limited lateral access. With automated least privilege monitoring, you can identify malware attacks before they are able to access sensitive information.

Least privilege isn’t just a way to protect yourself from attackers — it’s a great way to streamline security audits, too. Professionals in medicine, finance, education, cybersecurity, and other industries need a well-documented cybersecurity system to ensure compliance with industry audits. When you implement the principles of least privilege, you can provide evidence that your access controls are sufficiently secure.

Least Privilege and Zero Trust
------------------------------

[Zero Trust](/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework) is the gold standard of cybersecurity today. Guided by the “never trust, always verify” principle, Zero Trust offers an approach to security that treats any users, applications, and devices as if they were potentially compromised. In contrast with perimeter security, which trusts devices that have made it past a security threshold, Zero Trust requires constant vigilance and verification over time as users move laterally through the system.

With Zero Trust, IT admins can quickly revoke access for any device that is potentially compromised. The concept of least privilege is central to the Zero Trust model, since least privilege requires continuous authentication over time, as each user moves through the various levels of access. Without the principles of least privilege, Zero Trust architecture wouldn’t be possible.

/. 083 [Privileged Access Management - Legacy PAM](https://www.ssh.com/academy/pam/traditional-legacy-privileged-access)
=========================================================

Traditional Privileged Access Management (PAM)
==============================================

The traditional way analysts have structured privileged access management technology is all based on password vaulting. It was an approach selected by several early vendors in the market.

Recently, a new approach to PAM has emerged, which does not require password rotation, password vaults, or agent software on servers or clients. We call this the Next Generation PAM. The first product that used this approach was [PrivX Lean Privileged Access Management for multi-cloud](/products/privx/).

This page describes the old approach. For a more detailed description of the new approach, see [Next Generation Privileged Access Management](/iam/pam/).

Traditional PAM Market Definition
---------------------------------

Traditionally, the PAM market has been structured around the following features. However, several of these features are specific to a particular way of implementing PAM. Alternative approaches work much better in the cloud.

*   Controlling access to shared accounts. This may be implemented, e.g., by obtaining a password from a vault, using client software on the user's computer, or by using a web portal. Authentication to the portal or client may use, e.g., two-factor authentication or single sign-on (SSO).
    
*   Providing four-eyes control, meaning that two people must approve the operation, or the other may be monitoring the action in real time with the ability to terminate the session. Sometimes this is also called dual control.
    
*   Controlling and filtering commands or actions an administrator can execute. This is often implemented as part of privileged escalation controls, similar to [sudo](/iam/sudo/).
    
*   Monitor and record what privileged users do. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality may be used to extract text from images. User's actions may also be passed on to Security Incident and Event Monitoring (SIEM) and analytics systems. Such systems may analyze the operations to discover anomalies and provide early warning about potential breaches. Many systems provide video recordings of users' activities and executed commands.
    
*   Traditional systems use randomized passwords for shared accounts, and rotate these accounts frequently.
    
*   Traditional systems use a [password vault](/iam/password/vault) for storing the current passwords for service accounts and for supplying the to users and scripts.
    
*   Some privileged access management systems provide functionality for [managing SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management). However, the functionality provided by these products is usually very limited compared to [dedicated SSH key management products](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) and does not generally include full implementation of key life cycle management or the necessary functionality for sorting out legacy keys.
    
*   Prividing dashboards, views, and reports to help understand what users are doing in the IT environment.
    
*   PAM systems integrate with ticketing systems, IT service and support management (ITSSM) systems, and change management workflows.
    

Privileged access management system manage credentials for a wide variety of systems, including operating systems, databases, middleware, applications, network devices, hypervisors, [IoT devices](/iot/), and SaaS applications.

Functionality Categories
------------------------

Analysts typically divide product functionality into the following categories.

### Shared account password management (SAPM)

Managing and rotating passwords and access to them. Many products also manage SSL/TLS keys, encryption keys, [SSH keys](/ssh/key/), and/or other confidential data in their vaults. It should noted, however, that just storing SSH keys in a vault does not solve SSH key management in any significant way. Some products also save password history to handle restoring from backups and continuously monitor the environment for password changes made outside the solution (reconciliation). Access to shared accounts often involves a request and approval workflow. An irrefutable audit trail is typically kept of any access to passwords. Sometimes access may be configured to only be possible if there is an outstanding ticket in an IT Service Management (ITSSM) system that requires access. Additional authentication, just two-factor authentication, may also be required before access is granted. Most critical systems may require another person to watch the session. "Break-the-glass" or firecall functionality may also be supported for emergency access. Nonhuman access may be also be supported, e.g., in combination with AAPM solutions.

### Privileged session management (PSM)

Establishing and monitoring sessions to multiple systems. Monitoring recording activity in such systems. Authenticating users (e.g., using two-factor authentication or SSO) and then providing the users access to shared accounts.

### Superuser privilege management (SUPM)

Selectively permits users to execute commands with higher privileges. This functionality is similar to the [sudo](/iam/sudo/) tool, but is also available for a wide variety of operating systems.

### Application-to-application password management (AAPM)

This functionality refers to providing applications and scripts access to passwords stored in a password vault. This is basically used to eliminate hard-coded passwords. However, these products generally suffer from the risks that hackers may use the same functionality to read the passwords from the vault.

Dissatisfaction with Traditional PAM
------------------------------------

While the traditional PAM market has been hot and growing fast, there is a substantial amount of customer dissatisfaction in the market. Deployment projects frequently do not go as planned. Read, for example [Privileged Account Management (PAM) is Necessary, but Deploying it Stinks](http://security-architect.com/privileged-account-management-pam-is-very-important-but-deploying-it-stinks/).

We have customers who needed a hundred password vaults to get their market-leading PAM solution to scale to the size of their environment. A leading product uses a Windows server as the jump host, running [PuTTY](/ssh/putty/) on the Windows host to connect to end systems. (PuTTY has had several vulnerabilities that could allow breaking into the jump server.)

The problem in the market is that many organizations don't think strategically. They start run into issues about one year into their products. By the time they've spent millions and several years on a deployment project, it is very difficult to replace a product no matter what it costs.

Discovery
---------

Privileged access management solutions differ in how they discover user accounts.

*   Some use ad hoc tasks to discover user accounts and devices (e.g., from [Active Diretory](/iam/active-directory/)).
    
*   Concurrent discovery is used by some products to detect changes continuously. They may, for example, poll information from Active Directory and hypervisors. These products may trigger automatic enrollment workflows in the PAM solution.
    
*   Service account and credential discovery finds service accounts from the organization. The accounts are often scattered throughout the organization.
    
*   Some provide semi-automated discovery of hard-coded passwords from shell scripts and applications.
    

Integration with Identity Governance and Administration
-------------------------------------------------------

Some PAM products come from more general [identity and access management](/iam/) vendors. They may offer more general identity governance and administration (IGA) solutions. Some offer proprietary integrations into their products, increasing vendor lock-in. Others use standards-based solutions, such as Active Directory and Light-weight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).

Next Generation PAM
-------------------

Traditional PAM solutions are largely built around password vaulting. However, password vaults have become largely unncessary. It is now possible to completely eliminate passwords and other permanent credentials using short-lived certificates that are automatically generated on demand. For an example of a next generation privileged access management solution, see [PrivX On-Demand Access Manager](/products/privx/).

=========================================================

Privileged Access Management (PAM) in the Cloud
===============================================

[Privileged access management (PAM)](/academy/iam/pam) is almost universally used by companies big and small. And for good reason — PAM involves using authentication and authorization to protect sensitive data. Without PAM, enterprise information can quickly fall into the wrong hands.

There are plenty of types of PAM, from basic password setups to complex multi-factor authentication with multiple levels of authorization. PAM tends to become more complicated when data requires higher levels of protection. The right PAM solution will minimize the risk of security breaches, and also ensure that the network isn’t too cumbersome for the right users to access.

Even though PAM is a fixture among businesses across the globe, it’s worth noting that many of today’s businesses don’t believe their PAM solutions are secure. And there’s evidence to support their concern — compromises are always occurring, often because of outdated PAM technology, or an oversimplified approach to password management.

With their existing PAM solutions, many enterprises today are woefully unprepared for the latest cybersecurity threats. In this article, we’ll explore how a cloud privileged access management solution has the power to take your enterprise security to the next level.

Introduction to Cloud PAM
-------------------------

Improving PAM requires an understanding of how to make privileged access more efficient and more accessible for authorized users. Additionally, the transfer to new PAM technologies should be smooth and secure.

While the vast majority of today’s companies are using cloud-based applications, establishing a cloud privileged access management solution is less common. With IT teams devoted to cloud computing, it makes sense to implement a cloud PAM solution alongside other cloud migrations — especially in cases where cloud security offers the most efficient and secure solution.

Cloud computing is often cited as one of the most scalable ways to manage a business. While on-premises infrastructure requires increased space as a business grows, cloud-based servers can scale up or down without physical maintenance. Elasticity and scalability aren’t the only advantages of a cloud PAM solution. Many of today’s cyberattacks involve machine-to-machine (M2M) cloud-based attackers. Cloud security is the most effective way to protect your data from cloud attacks, which are effective at breaking down traditional protections.

When PAM is moved to the cloud (or a hybrid cloud solution), it has the potential to be a dynamic security solution. Instead of keeping passwords and credentials in an on-premises vault, cloud-based security allows you to protect your data with automatically rotated passwords, multi-factor authentication, and [credentials that are adjusted](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/privx-msp-secure-access-management-for-managed-hosts) based on user activity.

Cloud-based security can keep track of who’s trying to access your information and adjust the access credentials accordingly. Cloud attacks are no match for a comprehensive, cloud PAM solution.

Key Cloud PAM Terms
-------------------

Before we touch on the benefits of PAM in the cloud, let’s take a look at some key terms in the world of cloud and multi-cloud security. Discussing PAM in the cloud requires an understanding of the different services available. Key cloud PAM concepts include:

*   [**Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/saas)**:** Software that is provided by third-party applications is known as SaaS. The benefits of SaaS include everything from flexibility and scalability, to predictable contracts and secure management. PAM in the cloud uses components of SaaS to deploy third-party credentials management.

*   [**Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)**](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/iaas)**:** Infrastructure can be defined as on-premises devices or cloud-based services, like servers and storage. IaaS is an effective way to store credentials and information for cloud-based PAM, and to manage credentials with scalability.
*   [**PAM-as-a-Service (PAMaaS)**](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/privx-msp-secure-access-management-for-managed-hosts)**:** When PAM is deployed in the cloud, third-party PAM providers can bring all the benefits of SaaS and IaaS to your cloud privileged access management solution. PAMaaS providers, like SSH, can use hybrid cloud environments to ease the transition from legacy systems to a cloud-based PAMaaS approach.

The Difference Between PAM in the Cloud and PAM for the Cloud
-------------------------------------------------------------

In the world of PAMaaS, there is a distinction between “PAM in the cloud” and “PAM for the cloud”. Before investing in a PAM solution, it’s important to understand how PAM in the cloud works, when compared with PAM _for_ the cloud.

PAM in the cloud aims to replace on-premises PAM infrastructure with cloud-based architecture. Implementing PAM in the cloud is often a component of PAMaaS, where PAM service providers can operate new security technologies using a hybrid cloud or multi-cloud service.

In contrast, PAM _for_ the cloud doesn’t necessarily refer to a cloud-based PAM solution. PAM for the cloud simply means the PAM solution is used for cloud-based applications. It’s quite possible that legacy PAM systems are being used for cloud-based applications, which can leave cloud data unprotected against cloud-based M2M attacks.

Benefits of PAM in the Cloud
----------------------------

Before PAM in the cloud, enterprises managed passwords and credentials with software — or even physical storage units. Keeping track of credentials was a full-time job, and basic functions like password rotation and privilege management were often subject to error and inefficiency. Even though PAM is one of the last major SaaS services to take advantage of cloud technology, the advantages of PAM in the cloud are making it a rapidly growing product.

There are numerous financial benefits that make PAM in the cloud a cost-effective solution for privileged access management. PAMaaS providers can manage your privileged access technology with professional accuracy, reducing the workload for on-premises employees. Additionally, the lack of hardware investment in cloud computing means you can scale up or down as necessary — and only pay for the scope that you need.

PAM in the cloud isn’t just lightweight and scalable — it’s also more secure than traditional PAM solutions. Because PAM in the cloud offers [stronger defense against M2M attacks](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/protect-ot-m2m/) than legacy PAM technology, admins can save time, money, and hassle. PAM also allows you to automate your privilege management, by automatically rotating passwords regularly and establishing secure access tiers.

PAM Cloud Challenges & Risks
-----------------------------

Cloud migration comes with [plenty of challenges and risks](https://info.ssh.com/pam-vansonbourne-research). When it’s time to migrate your PAM to the cloud, it’s crucial that passwords and access credentials remain secure during the move. To strengthen security outside the realm of access credentials, PAM admins need to make sure data is encrypted — both in transit and in storage. Encryption key management (EKM) can be combined with PAM to form a necessary layer of defense in case of an emergency.

For businesses that are moving security management to the cloud, outdated security policies pose another major challenge. When access credentials and passwords are tailored to an on-premises environment, security policies aren’t designed to fit an environment with many remote users. To adjust access credentials to a cloud-specific environment, you will need to establish new policies to protect a cloud-driven enterprise — like two rounds of access credentials, one at the device level and one at the application level.

Cloud Security Best Practices
-----------------------------

Effective PAMaaS providers can take these challenges in stride. With an effective understanding of best practices, PAM in the cloud allows organizations to increase both security and efficiency — saving money in the process.

Every cloud PAM solution should be founded on the Principle of Least Privilege, which states that authenticated users should only be authorized to access what’s absolutely necessary. To avoid multiple layers of frustrating security measures, [the right PAM in the cloud solution](https://www.ssh.com/products/privx/) can offer Just-In-Time (JIT) access, which establishes access credentials based on dynamic authentication and user monitoring.

Security isn’t the only thing to consider when implementing a cloud privileged access management solution — efficiency matters, too. A highly secure PAM setup makes access difficult defeats the purpose of privileged access management, which should facilitate appropriate, secure, but also user-friendly access. Automated PAM allows you to quickly assess risks, and to implement relevant security measures based on real-time data. Moreover, [dynamic PAM tools](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam#traditional-pam-stinks,-especially-in-the-cloud) can adjust based on perceived threats, and authenticate intelligently.

Integrating PAM with data encryption technology is another great way to improve usability, and improve security protections in the process. By combining a cloud-based enterprise key management (EKM) system with cloud-based PAM, you can manage encryption keys, authenticate, and authorize users with a [unified Zero Trust solution](https://www.ssh.com/products/privx/).

/. 085 [Privileged Accounts](https://www.ssh.com/academy/pam/what-are-privileged-accounts)
=========================================================

What are Privileged Accounts and Why Are They Important?
========================================================

A privileged account is a user account that has more privileges than ordinary users. Privileged accounts might, for example, be able to install or remove software, upgrade the operating system, or modify system or application configurations. They might also have access to files that are not normally accessible to standard users.

Privileged accounts are typically tied to roles within an organization. Examples include IT administrators, security teams, helpdesk experts, 3rd party contractors, application owners, database administrators, operating systems, and services accounts, etc.

A privileged account can also be a machine-to-machine (M2M) or application-to-application (A2A) account that runs automatic operations without human interaction. Typical examples include automated payment transactions, smart asset tracking in the shipping industry, automated claims handling in the insurance industry or daily backups of corporate critical data.

Since privileged accounts always grant access to information or target that is valuable or critical for the operations of a business, they require special audit attention and management.

There are many kinds of privileged accounts:

*   [Root](/iam/user/root) and administrator accounts are typically used for installing and removing software and changing configurations. They grant very broad and highest access privileges for specific servers or databases and are also appropriately called superuser accounts.
    
    In Windows, administrator accounts are user accounts that are used for managing aspects of a computer, domain, or the whole enterprise IT infrastructure.
    
    Administrator accounts are often named`Administrator`in standalone computers and small environments. However, any user in Windows can be made an administrator by adding it to the proper group.
    
    Common administrator account subtypes includeLocal AdministratorandDomain Administrator.
    
*   **Domain Administrator** accounts grant full access and control of the Active Directory (AD) domain. These accounts are particularly armed and dangerous, since they give control over all domain controllers, domain workstations, and domain member servers and allow modifying the configuration of Active Directory or any content stored in Active Directory. This includes creating new users, deleting users, and changing their permissions.  
      
    Domain administrator is a kind of `Administrator` account.
*   **Local Administrator** accounts are user accounts that can manage a local computer in Windows. Generally, a local administrator can do anything to the local computer, but is not able to modify information in active directory for other computers and other users.  
      
    The local administrator account is often called Administrator, but any user can be made a local administrator by adding the user to the Local Administrator group.
*   Service accounts are used for running processes, such as web servers, database servers, and application servers. Service accounts may also be created just to own data and configuration files.
    
    Service accounts are not intended to be used by people, except for performing administrative operations.
    
*   Application accounts are linked to the specific application software and typically administer, configure or manage access to the application software. Application accounts allow interactions between applications and are typically run automatically by without human interaction. The exception to the rule is maintenance tasks performed by privileged users.
    
*   System accounts are created by an operating system during installation and used for running operating system components and owning related files.
    
    System accounts often have predefined[user ids](https://www.ssh.com/iam/user/id). Examples of system accounts include the[root account](https://www.ssh.com/iam/user/root)in Linux.
    
    The distinction of system accounts andservice accountsis sometimes blurred. Many system accounts run operating system processes, and in this respect resemble service accounts. Some system accounts, such as`root`, are also logged into by system administrators.
    

[Privileged access management (PAM)](/iam/pam/) refers to a set of processes and tools for controlling, monitoring, and auditing privileged accounts and access. Traditional PAM solutions are typically based on [password vaults](/iam/password/vault) and password rotation, whereas modern [next generation systems avoid passwords altogether](/products/privx/).

What is Privileged Account and Session Management?
--------------------------------------------------

Privileged Account and Session Management (PASM) solutions are a class of [privileged access management (PAM)](/iam/pam/) solutions that grant users temporary admin access to privileged corporate environments on an “all-or-nothing” basis. PASM solutions that help manage, control and monitor privileged accounts are part of an organization's risk management and [cybersecurity](https://www.ssh.com/cyber/security/) strategy.

In 2017, analysts at Gartner divided the PAM market into two primary solution groups: Privileged Account and Session Management (PASM) and [Privilege Elevation and Delegation Management](/iam/pedm) (PEDM).

How Privileged Account and Session Management works
---------------------------------------------------

Privileged Account and Session Management (PASM) solutions typically access to privileged accounts via password vaulting, password rotation or password creation. Some Privileged Account and Session Management (PASM) tools manage cryptographic keys and offer application-to-application password management.

Once users request access from the vault, they may be given a temporary account with administrative privileges. Privileged Account and Session Management (PASM) solutions typically have the ability to monitor and record what occurs during that session. Once the session is finished, that recording is logged and used for compliance and auditing purposes.

In 2017, analysts at Gartner divided the PAM market into two primary solution groups: [Privileged Account and Session Management (PASM)](/academy/iam/pasm) and PEDM. PEDM solutions aim to improve upon the limitations of PASM solutions, which offer temporary admin access on an “all-or-nothing” basis.

What problem does PEDM solve?
-----------------------------

On occasion, a user may need temporary access to secure IT resources that they typically would not have access to. On these occasions, organizations need a way to grant and them immediately revoke that access, because even a temporary admin account is just as much at risk to being stolen or compromised as a full admin account would be.

PASM solutions typically grant temporary admin access via a password vault. The vault grants the user access to the required server, and then logs all of their activity during that admin session for monitoring purposes. Once the session is done, the admin access is revoked.

The problem with PASM solutions is that they typically grant access on an “all-or-nothing” basis, so the temporary admin would be able to access everything on the target server, even the applications or scripts the user doesn't actually need or should be prohibited from accessing. If those temporary credentials were comprised, a bad actor would have unfettered access to the target server during the open session.

PEDM seeks to solve this challenge by eliminating the need for admin accounts and granting access to secure resources on a more granular basis.

How PEDM works
--------------

PEDM solutions typically aim to eliminate admin accounts altogether, instead allowing sysadmins to operate with regular user accounts. Sysadmins are granted admin privileges only to the individual applications, scripts or tasks that they need to manage. As a result, it’s easier for organizations to reduce or eliminate the number of accounts within their network that have any sort of admin access, which reduces the attack surface and the risk of external threats or human error.

What is a Root User?
--------------------

_Root_ is the superuser account in Unix and Linux. It is a user account for administrative purposes, and typically has the highest access rights on the system.

Usually, the root user account is called `root`. However, in Unix and Linux, any account with [user id](/iam/user/id) 0 is a root account, regardless of the name. It is fairly common for certain system administrators to have their own root accounts on a system, with their own passwords.

Privileged Access Management
----------------------------

[Privileged account management](/iam/pam/) refers to managing access to privileged accounts, including root accounts. Deploying privileged access management tools is important for organizations, because root accounts are so powerful. Most cybercrime is perpetrated by internal actors, such as system administrators. Gaining accountability into what they do is important for deterring insider crime and fraud. Furthermore, many [cybersecurity regulations](/compliance/) and best practice requires deploying privileged access management tools.

Privileged access management tools provide logging and monitoring of access. Typically every root login and every command executed as root is logged.

The passwords for privileged accounts should never be shared. Shared passwords are much more likely to misused, their passwords tend to remain unchanged for extended periods, and often leak when employees change jobs. Also, since they are nobody's personal responsibility and sort fo common knowledge among peers, they tend to not get the same amount of diligence as personal accounts, and are often emailed or written down in notes, files, and password managers.

Related Privileged Accounts 
-------------------

A root user account is a kind of [privileged account](/iam/user/privileged-account). Other privileged accounts include service accounts and system accounts.

Windows has Local Administrator and Domain Administrator accounts instead of root accounts.

A superuser account is a generic term for root accounts, Windows administrator accounts, and other similar accounts with generally unlimited privileges on systems.

Using SUDO and Other Tools to Eliminate Need for Root Accounts
--------------------------------------------------------------

Tools such as [sudo](/iam/sudo/) can be used to grant selected users the ability to run selected commands as root. All privileged access management tools also provide this capability. All of these tools can also log the commands performed as root to give accountability into what is done as root.

Root Access
-----------

Root access means performing something using root privileges. In Linux-based systems, this means being able to do something using the user id 0, i.e., as root.

Having root access generally means being able to log into some root account on the server, or being able to run commands as root on the server, for example by using some privilege escalation tool such as `sudo`.

Root Privileges
---------------

The root account has _root privileges_. This means it can read and write any files on the system, perform operations as any user, change system configuration, install and remove software, and upgrade the operating system and/or firmware. In essence, it can do pretty much anything on the system.

It is usually preferable to use dedicated service accounts for running applications and for managing various operating system subsystems. Access to the root account should be limited to the absolute minimum number of people and uses.

SELinux and Other Ways to Limit Root Privileges
-----------------------------------------------

Root accounts are very powerful, and can do almost anything on a computer. Various operating systems have mechanisms for limiting what root accounts can do. Such systems are primarily used in security-sensitive enterprises with dedicated security teams and in certain military and government organizations.

SELinux is a popular tool for limiting what processes running as root can do. It is primarily targeted for limiting exposure to vulnerabilities in server processes (such as web servers). However, the administrator's shell is just a normal program, and SELinux can also be used to limit what can be done from the shell.

SELinux is also frequently used to make escaping from containers more difficult.

SELinux is included and enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS Linux. On these systems, if root cannot access a file or perform an operation, the most common reason is that SELinux policy prevents the operation.

Apparmor is another tool similar to SELinux.

Systems utilizing multilevel security don't necessarily have a root account or its access rights may be severely limited. However, such systems are rarely used outside classified military environments.

The FreeBSD operating system has file flags, set using the `chflags` command, which can be used to prevent even root from performing certain operations on files.

Root User on Mac
----------------

Apple Mac also has a root account. By default, it is only used internally. To enable the root account for logins, follow [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012).

SSH Access To Root Account
--------------------------

[SSH (Secure Shell)](/ssh/) is often used for logging into remote servers as root. However, the default configuration in OpenSSH prevents root login using passwords. To enable root login, change the value of the PermitRootLogin configuration option in [/ssh/sshd_config](/ssh/sshd_config/).

Set-user-id Flags on Executable Files 
-------------------

One thing system administrators and auditors should know is that in Linux and Unix, programs can be run using a particular user id by changing the owner of the executable to that user, and setting the `setuid` bit in the file permissions. For example, `chown root executable && chmod 4755 executable` sets the executable to execute as root, regardless of who runs it. It is common for (novice) hackers to hide backdoors into systems by creating a suitable executable with the `setuid` bit set. This is something that is often scanned for in basic security scans.

Single User Mode and Recovering Lost Root Passwords
---------------------------------------------------

Single user mode is a special mode into which Linux, Unix, and Mac computers can be booted. Booting into single user mode normally requires physical access to the computer, and is typically used for recovering the root password if it has been lost or fixing the operating system or restoring data in case of some catastropic failure or corruption.

Beware that the Intel AMT firmware vulnerability may be used by attackers for booting systems into single user mode. Therefore, it is important to make sure the BIOS firmware has been upgraded on any Intel servers that have Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) enabled.

Some operating systems can be configured to require the root password in order to boot into single user mode. With those systems, it is particularly important to have the password for the root account securely stored, for example in a safe.

As long as disk encryption is not used, it is generally possible to recover a system where the root password has been lost by removing the disk from the computer, connecting it to another computer as a second disk, mounting it there, and then editing the password file on the mounted disk to clear the root password (e.g., edit `/mnt/etc/shadow` and copy the encrypted password for root from some other account, possibly from another computer with the same operating system).

If disk encryption is used and the disk encryption password is known, it may still be possible to mount the disk in another computer (by supplying the password using suitable tools, such as `cryptsetup`).

If the disk encryption key has been lost, it may be impossible to recover the system. The best option in that case is probably to reinstall the operating system and restore its data from a backup.

Rooted Devices
--------------

Rooting can also refer to escaping the privileges normally permitted for applications running on restricted devices, such as iPhones, iPads, Android phones, and tablets. The basic idea is to give you root access on your phone, so that you can install arbitrary applications, change the device's configuration, or install your own operating system.

**Note that rooting your device is not supported by the manufacturer, usually exploits undocumented vulnerabilities in the operating systems, and there is no guarantee about the quality of the rooting tools or motivations of the people behind them. USE THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK! They may void your warranty, render your device inoperable, or put your data at risk.**

Vendors often patch security vulnerabilities that the rooting tools exploit. Thus, the tools are very version specific. When a new version of the device or its operating system comes out, old tools may stop working. Consequently, the state of the art changes rapidly, and old articles about rooting may be out of date.

Each rooting toolkit is different. Some rooting systems require a the phone to be connected to a computers; others are applications run on the device. Some may even operate wirelessly, exploiting vulnerabilities on phones. However, the vulnerabilities needed by the last method can also be used to plant malware, and such vulnerabilities are patched by manufactures as quickly as possible.

There is also a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_(Android_OS)) on rooting that explains what it is about.

Rooting may also help free up storage space on the device. See [Top Six Ways to Free Up Storage Space of Android Device](https://www.kingoapp.com/root-tutorials/top-6-ways-free-up-android-storage-space.htm).

Malware may also use the same techniques as rooting software. See [10 million Android phones infected by all-powerful auto-rooting apps](https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/07/virulent-auto-rooting-malware-takes-control-of-10-million-android-devices/).

While rooting is legal in most countries, it could be illegal in others. The US Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) apparently has an exemption allowing it. The European Copyright Directive apparently allows rooting for the purpose of installing alternative software. You should seek your own legal counsel if legality is an issue in your country.

/. 090 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
=========================================================



/. 091 [What is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)?](https://www.ssh.com/academy/pki)
=========================================================

What is PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)?
========================================

_Public Key Infrastructure_ (PKI) is a technology for authenticating users and devices in the digital world. The basic idea is to have one or more trusted parties digitally sign documents certifying that a particular cryptographic key belongs to a particular user or device. The key can then be used as an **identity for the user** in digital networks.

The users and devices that have keys are often just called entities. In general, anything can be associated with a key that it can use as its identity. Besides a user or device, it could be a program, process, manufacturer, component, or something else. The purpose of a PKI is to securely associate a key with an entity.

The trusted party signing the document associating the key with the device is called a _certificate authority_ (CA). The certificate authority also has a cryptographic key that it uses for signing these documents. These documents are called _certificates_.

In the real world, there are many certificate authorities, and most computers and web browsers trust a hundred or so certificate authorities by default.

A public key infrastructure relies on digital signature technology, which uses [public key cryptography](/cryptography/). The basic idea is that the secret key of each entity is only known by that entity and is used for signing. This key is called the [private key](/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys). There is another key derived from it, called the [public key](/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys), which is used for verifying signatures but cannot be used to sign. This public key is made available to anyone, and is typically included in the certificate document.

X.509 Standard
--------------

Most public key infrastructures use a standardized machine-readable certificate format for the certificate documents. The standard is called X.509v3. Originally, it was an [ISO](https://www.iso.org/home.html) standard, but these days it is maintained by the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://www.ietf.org) as RFC 3280.

Common Uses of Certificates
---------------------------

### Secure Web Sites - HTTPS

The most familiar use of PKI is in SSL certificates. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the security protocol used on the web when you fetch a page whose address begins with `https:`. TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a newer version of the protocol. In practice, most websites now use the new version.

With HTTPS, certificates serve to identify the web site you are connecting to, to ensure that no-one can eavesdrop on your connection or, for example, inject fraudulent wire transfers or steal credit card numbers.

Certificates and cryptographic authentication of the server prevent [man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle). For secure communications, it is necessary to authenticate the communicating parties and encrypt the communications to protect passwords and data from malicious devices and hackers in the network.

### Authenticating Users and Computers - SSH

The [Secure Shell protocol](/ssh/) supports certificates for authenticating hosts and users. [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) uses standards-based X.509 certificates, whereas [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) uses its own proprietary certificate formats.

### Email Signing and Encryption

Certificates are also used for secure email in corporations. The S/MIME standard specifies a message format for signed and encrypted messaging, using the X.509 certificate formats.

[PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)](http://openpgp.org) and its free version, [Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG)](https://www.gnupg.org), use their own certificate format and a somewhat different trust model. However, they still offer email encryption and are quite popular.


Security Limitations of Public Key Infrastructure
-------------------------------------------------

The main weakness of public PKI is that any certificate authority can sign a certificate for any person or computer. Certificate authorities exist in many countries, some of which have rather authoritarian or even potentially hostile governments. Sometimes certificate authorities create or are coerced to create certificates for parties they have no business vouching for.

Among other things, intelligence agencies can use fraudulent certificates for espionage, malware injection, and forging messages or evidency to disrupt or discredit adversaries. For this reason, only limited trust should be placed on certificates from public certificate authorities.

Some organizations run their own private public key infrastructures. This means they run their own internal certificate authority. When the organization only trusts the internal CA for a certain purpose, there is a fair certainty that no-one else can issue certificates on their behalf. When they also trust public PKIs for the same entities, there is no added security, but they may save cost.

SSH's Role in the Development of Public Key Infrastructure
----------------------------------------------------------

SSH Communications Security was one of the early pioneers in PKI. We participated in the standardization work for X.509v3 and proposed an alternative approach called Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI) to address some of the trust issues with the X.509 standard. We wrote some of the standards documents on certificate enrollment protocols. We were also selling an advanced certificate authority product called SSH Certifier from 2001 onwards. Among other things, it pioneered support for multiple certificate authorities and multiple registration authorities in the same system and using customizable policy rules for choosing the certificate authority to obtain a certificate from. For more information, see [SSH's contributions to PKI and Certificate management](/pki/legacy/).

SSH Certifier - Advanced Multi-CA Certificate Authority Product
---------------------------------------------------------------

SSH released a certificate authority product called SSH Certifier in 2001. It was way ahead of its time, with support for multiple certificate authorities, multiple registration authorities, a policy engine for selecting which certificate authority to get a certificate from, automated policy rules, and support for automatic certificate management protocols and other methods of automated certificate enrollment. Its customers included, for example, Global Crossing (a major telecommunications operator) in the United States, University of Tokio, and Helsinki University of Technology.

The product is now sold by [Insta Security Solutions](https://www.insta.fi/en/services/cyber-security/insta-certifier) as Insta Certifier. It is primarily known in the telecommunications market. SSH still owns rights to the product, but is not currently selling it directly. Several of the original developers of Certifier still work for SSH

Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI)
---------------------------------------

The simple public key infrastructure (SPKI) was work done within the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) (Internet Engineering Task Force) and was proposed as an alternative to the [X.509](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt) standard. [SPKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_public-key_infrastructure) would have addressed many of the weaknesses of X.509 that have become evident in recent years.

Among the main design points of SPKI where:

*   Simple yet powerful certificate formats designed from scratch, rather than complex ASN.1 DER encodings, which have resulted in numerous bugs and vulnerabilities over the years.
    
*   A certification model that does not rely on single signers, but rather a K-of-N trust model, so that no single compromised Certificate Authority or government could forge certificates for anyone at will. We've seen examples of bad certificates many times, for example with [Symantec improperly issuing 30,000 certificates](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/google-takes-symantec-to-the-woodshed-for-mis-issuing-30000-https-certs/).
    
*   Powerful access control lists for authorizing operations.

What is an X.509 Certificate?
=============================

While X.509 certificates help digitally authenticate users and servers as they communicate online, they can also be used in other valuable applications.  

Digital certificates facilitate secure connections between users and servers through [public key infrastructures](/academy/pki) that help encrypt and decrypt sensitive, identifiable data. The X.509 certificate is the international industry standard used to authenticate online identities and provide strong protection against devious imposters. From email communications to browser access, here’s how X.509 certificates support stable and secure online connections.

What is an X.509 Certificate?
-----------------------------

An X.509 certificate is a digital certificate that follows the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) standard, which outlines the format and type of data public key certificates should possess for optimal security. X.509 certificates contain specific user information, an issued [public key](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys), and digital signatures that verify a user’s identity as they access online services and sites.

When a user interacts with a server, a [cryptographic key pair](https://www.ssh.com/academy/pki) is generated, hashed, and sent to a certificate authority (CA), along with a digital certificate request. The CA is a trusted third-party entity that binds its public key to a digital certificate. Per the X.509 standard, the digital certificate contains specific data, such as the location of the user’s device, the certificate’s serial number, the CA’s name, the particular encryption algorithm used, and more, which we’ll detail in the next section.

After verifying the certificate’s information, the CA digitally signs it and sends it to the user in an encrypted format. The resulting X.509 certificate is then imported onto the user’s server, where it can be used further to establish safe connections with web browsers and safely engage with online data.

X.509 certificates can also be self-signed; that is, the user requesting the certificate can digitally sign it without the authorization of a third-party CA. However, most applications generally do not trust these certificates for this reason.

What Type of Information Does an X.509 Certificate Carry?
---------------------------------------------------------

The general structure of an X.509 certificate is formally organized using Abstract Syntax Notation One, or ASN.1. Shown below is the baseline format for an X.509 digital certificate, along with what each component consists of:

*   **Version:** The iteration of the X.509 certificate being issued to a user.
*   **Serial Number:** A unique number assigned to each X.509 certificate by the CA.
*   **Signature Algorithm ID:** The specific mathematical algorithm used to create and encrypt the CA’s private key.
*   **Issuer:** The name of the CA who issued the X.509 certificate.
*   **Validity Period:** The timeframe in which the X.509 certificate can be used before it expires and becomes obsolete. It includes the start and end dates that the certificate is viable.
*   **Subject:** The user’s name or the type of device that receives the X.509 certificate from the CA.
*   **Subject Public Key Information:** This includes the algorithm used to generate the public key attached to the X.509 certificate, the public key itself, and additional data such as the key’s size and unique function.
*   **Certificate Signature Algorithm:** The type of algorithm involved in signing and encrypting the X.509 certificate.
*   **Certificate Signature:** A long, alphanumerical string unique to the identity of the CA issuing the X.509 certificate.

Additional data, like extensions and unique identifiers, can be attached to the certificate for further user validation.

What is an X.509 Certificate Used For?
--------------------------------------

X.509 digital certificates aren’t only used for validating identities across the web. They can also be used to fortify the [security of email communications](https://www.ssh.com/blog/why-should-you-secure-your-email), verify the legitimacy of [documents signed online](https://www.ssh.com/blog/how-to-sign-and-share-documents-digitally-and-securely), and ensure that written code has not been tampered with. X.509 certificates also form the foundation of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols, which help browsers filter through fake websites, servers, and applications to establish a safe environment for online activity.


What are the Benefits of Using an X.509 Certificate?
----------------------------------------------------

In a digital landscape rife with cybercrime, malware, and pesky bots, it can be hard for users to trust the safety of the internet. However, X.509 certificates are just as widely used as the SSH protocol, meaning almost every corner of the internet is safeguarded with hard-to-crack encryption algorithms to distinguish valid websites from fraudulent ones. Moreover, the pervasive use of [SSH keys](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/ssh-key-basics) across the internet grants scalability to the applications of X.509 certificates.

As mentioned, X.509 certificates can be used to validate users participating in almost any online transaction, from signing legal documents to accessing an online banking account, since [brute force attempts](https://www.ssh.com/academy/malware) by hackers have a very slim chance of decoding lengthy SSH keys.

How Should an X.509 Certificate Be Managed?
-------------------------------------------

As with keys, passwords, and other types of credentials, X.509 certificates should be [managed](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam) using an automated solution to prevent leaks that hackers are waiting to exploit. For complete protection, such solutions should extensively catalog X.509 certificates in circulation, outlining their key fields and current location for easy administrative viewing.

Since certificates can only be used within the timeframe allotted to them by the issuer, X.509 certificate management solutions should discard expired certificates that malicious actors can use to obtain sensitive information, while issuing new certificates with the help of a credible CA. However, experts recommend replacing X.509 certificates before their expiration date, as constant [credential rotation](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/password-key-rotation) complicates a hacker’s ability to find and use an active certificate.

Auditing practices should be conducted regularly to ensure that only authorized users can access a certificate management solution, to minimize the risk of [human error](https://www.ssh.com/blog/better-without-permanent-access) and malicious behavior.

Why is Automation Important?
----------------------------

As one can imagine, the multi-step process of X.509 certification takes time — hours, even. While an IT department could manually manage this workload, overseeing hundreds or even thousands of certificates a day increases the likelihood that errors will be made, jeopardizing the security of an entire business.

There’s also no guarantee that all certificates will be adequately rotated, logged, and deleted in time to outpace expiration dates that can spark a website or service outage. [Automation](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/automated) keeps all X.509 certificates functional, well-guarded, and compliant with [federal security standards and regulations](https://www.ssh.com/academy/compliance), ultimately saving organizations millions in operational, labor, and legal costs.

=========================================================

Business Email Compromise: What You Need to Know
================================================

It’s an all-too-commonscenario: You receive an email from your CEO asking you to urgently transfer money, make a purchase, or share sensitive information. The message seems legitimate, and it implores you to take quick action. However, the urgent nature of the email is a big red flag — you may just be the target of a Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack.

[Protect Yourself Against Business Email Compromise](#protect-yourself-against-business-email-compromise)

What is a Business Email Compromise (BEC)?
------------------------------------------

Business Email Compromise is a type of sneaky cyberattack that is a growing threat worldwide. The perpetrators use social engineering tactics — the act of psychologically tricking the receiver into giving up sensitive information, authorizing fraudulent transactions, or taking other actions that could compromise the security of the targeted organization.

The attackers behind BEC frauds often spend time researching their targets, using social media and other online resources to gather information about employees’ job titles and email addresses.

Using this information, cybercriminals create [spear phishing](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/how-to-prevent-password-attacks#phishing) emails — highly targeted phishing attacks — where they pose as high-level executives or trusted vendors. These carefully crafted emails appear to be from legitimate email IDs, convey a sense of urgency, and use persuasive language to manipulate the target to act quickly and impulsively.

Business Email Compromise or Email Account Compromise (EAC) attacks are particularly successful at bypassing traditional email security measures. Unlike traditional malware-based attacks, these cybercrimes are designed to exploit human vulnerabilities, making them harder to detect and defend against.

The Dangers of Business Email Compromise
----------------------------------------

The consequences of a successful Business Email Compromise attack can be devastating. Organizations can suffer significant financial losses, reputational damage, and potential legal liabilities, depending on the nature of the data stolen.

Attacks related to BEC have resulted in over [$43 billion in losses globally](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckbrooks/2022/06/03/alarming-cyber-statistics-for-mid-year-2022-that-you-need-to-know/?sh=6767db187864) from June 2016 to December 2021, according to statistics collected by the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), law enforcement, and filings with financial institutions.

The recent rise in remote working culture has led to an increase in this form of cybercrime. Recorded BEC attacks increased by more than 81% during 2022 and by 175% over the past two years, with open rates on malicious emails also surging, according to [Abnormal Security's latest report](https://abnormalsecurity.com/resources/h1-2023-report-employee-open-rates?utm_source=hp_button&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=7015G000001hsjoQAA) on business email compromise trends and statistics.

Types of Business Email Compromise
----------------------------------

BEC attacks are ever-evolving, with the scope of the crimes getting wider. Here are some of the prevalent types of business email compromise and the strategies used by cybercriminals to carry them out.

### Business Executive/CEO Scheme

The attacker poses as a high-level executive or the CEO of a company to send emails to employees who typically handle financial requests. The email often has a pressing tone which forces the employee to act quickly without checking the validity of the email. It could be a request for purchases, wire transfers, or other financial transactions to an external bank account.

### Fake Invoice Fraud

In this type of attack, the cybercriminal poses as a legitimate supplier or vendor and sends a fraudulent invoice to the company for goods or services. The attacker replaces the vendor’s bank account details with their own. These frauds can be difficult to detect since the attackers often use the supplier or vendor’s legitimate information.

### Lawyer Impersonation

An attacker poses as an attorney and contacts a company to request urgent payment for legal fees or settlements. The email is crafted to instill fear and often includes threats of legal action or other consequences if the payment is not made on time. These prey on the vulnerability of lower-level employees who may fear the alleged legal consequences.

### Data Theft

A cybercriminal targets HR and Finance personnel to steal sensitive information about an organization’s CEO, employees, invoices, or contracts. The attacker can then use the data in future attacks like CEO fraud.

### Account Compromise

This attack combines aspects of both the fraudulent invoice scheme and the CEO fraud. The attacker gains access to a company's email system and sends fraudulent emails to external vendors requesting payment or changing the bank account information of a vendor in the database. An individual executive or employee’s email contact list could also be compromised.

### Gift Card Scam

In this attack, the criminal poses as a supervisor or high-level executive with authority and sends an urgent email to an employee requesting help to buy gift cards for staff or customers. The email asks for serial numbers so it can be emailed out right away.

High-Profile Business Email Compromise Attacks that Made Headlines
------------------------------------------------------------------

*   A BEC scammer posing as Mattel's CEO contacted the company's finance team in 2015 and convinced an employee to wire $3 million to a Chinese supplier.  
    
*   In a notorious data theft BEC in 2016, cybercriminals impersonated Snapchat’s CEO to obtain sensitive data from a company employee. The data included former employees’ Social Security Numbers, tax information, salaries, and healthcare plans.  
    
*   In 2017, a Lithuanian man pled guilty to [tricking internet giants Google and Facebook](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39744007) into transferring over $100 million into a bank account under his control. He posed as a well-known company that provided the internet giants with hardware for their data centers and sent them forged invoices and fraudulent contracts.  
    
*   In February 2023, [Europol busted a Franco-Israeli criminal network](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/franco-israeli-gang-behind-eur-38-million-ceo-fraud-busted) involved in large-scale CEO fraud that cost a total of €38 million.

Business Email Compromise is now a growing threat to businesses of all sizes with attackers employing increasingly sophisticated social engineering tactics to carry out wire frauds, invoice frauds, and various other forms of cybercrimes. Security awareness and education play a crucial role in protecting companies from potential attacks.

Protect Yourself Against Business Email Compromise
--------------------------------------------------

There are ways for organizations to mitigate the risk of BEC. We at SSH Communications Security recommend sending emails containing sensitive or critical information only by using solutions tailor-made for such purposes.

One easy way is to use encrypted secure email, like our [Secure Mail](https://www.ssh.com/products/email-encryption-solution).

Best Security Practices to Help Prevent BEC Attacks
---------------------------------------------------

BEC attacks are particularly insidious since cybercriminals use social engineering — psychological manipulation tactics — to target human vulnerabilities and gain access to sensitive data or systems deceitfully.‘

### Employ Strong Authentication Practices

One of the primary ways to prevent BEC attacks is to use strong authentication practices to secure email accounts. This means using [unique and complex passwords](https://www.ssh.com/academy/secrets-management/password-key-rotation) that are changed regularly.

Setting up [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/multi-factor-authentication) also adds an extra layer of security. MFA requires a second form of authentication, such as a code sent to your mobile device or email in addition to your password. This can help prevent unauthorized access to email accounts, even if a password is compromised. This method can be used to verify both sender and recipient.

### Restrict Editing and Signing Rights

When sending sensitive information over email, it is a recommended cybersecurity practice to limit the number of people who can take the most critical actions in the process. By assigning roles, you can ensure that certain recipients are allowed to modify content while others only receive notifications of edits or completed actions.

### Organize Security Training for Employees

Employees are the first line of defense against BEC attacks, so it is crucial to train them to recognize and prevent BEC attacks. This includes education on the common types of BEC attacks, such as spoofed emails, wire transfer requests, and [phishing scams](https://www.ssh.com/blog/topic/phishing), and how to identify them.

Conducting regular training sessions and simulations can help employees recognize common patterns that cybercriminals use to avoid falling victim to them.

### Set Up Email Filters and Blocks

Using email filters and blocks can help prevent suspicious emails from reaching employees' inboxes in the first place. Email filters are designed to block emails with suspicious attachments or links, and also emails from suspicious domains. Filters can also flag emails that use common BEC tactics, such as requests for urgent wire transfers or changes to payment instructions.

### Verify All Payment Requests

In many cases, attackers impersonate vendors or other trusted parties to request fraudulent payments. Implementing a verification process for all payment requests could help prevent these attacks. This process may include contacting the vendor or trusted party directly and verifying the request before making any payments. Even if the message comes internally from a high-level executive like a CEO, having an extra check in place before making any large transfers of money or information is worth it.

### Monitor Email Accounts

Monitoring email accounts for suspicious activity can go a long way in preventing BEC attacks. It is important for any organization to regularly review email logs and activity reports to identify unusual login attempts or email activity. [External email security solutions](/products/email-encryption-solution) can assist in monitoring suspicious activity and alert administrators to potential threats.

### Using Encryption and Secure Communication Channels

[Secure communication channels](https://www.ssh.com/academy/secure-information-sharing/what-is-secure-data-sharing) and encryption can help prevent BEC attacks by adding layers of protection to email communications and by providing a secure way to transmit information. These security measures make it more difficult for cybercriminals to intercept, read, or alter sensitive information that is transmitted via email.

### Keep Your Software and Security Measures Updated

Businesses should update email software and security solutions to the latest versions and ensure that all security measures are properly configured and maintained. It could also help to stay informed of the latest BEC tactics and trends to adjust your security settings accordingly.

### Incident Response Planning

Even with robust safeguards in place, it is still possible for businesses to fall victim to BEC attacks. This is where it helps to have an Incident Response Plan (IRP) — a set of procedures that helps organizations respond to security incidents. A well-designed IRP can help prevent BEC attacks by identifying vulnerabilities, responding quickly, minimizing the impact of attacks, and improving communication and collaboration. This can reduce the likelihood of financial loss or damage to their reputation.

Mitigate the Risk of BEC - And Beyond
-------------------------------------

With BEC attacks becoming all too common in cyberspace, taking a proactive approach is the only way to thwart the dangers they pose. It is important now more than ever to improve internal security education, employ best security practices, and choose the right cybersecurity partner to protect your business against potentially devastating BEC attacks.

[SSH Secure Sign](#SSH-Deltagon-Secure-Sign)

  
What Is a Digital Signature?
----------------------------

The purpose of digital signatures is to establish a means to identify the authenticity of a document. For centuries, businesses and governments alike have used manual signatures to serve this purpose, due to the uniquely expressive nature of each person’s signature. In the case of digital signatures, the authenticity of a document is arguably even more reliable than manual signatures, because the signer is identified with a unique private key.

Digital signatures aren’t signatures in the traditional sense — there is no penmanship or personal information involved. Instead, digital signatures offer a mathematical verification process for the creator of a document or digital message.

The purpose of digital signatures is to confirm three types of verification: the identity of the signer, the origin of the document, and the status of the transaction. Using [public key cryptography](/academy/cryptography), digital signature software can provide all three pieces of information with a level of reliability that has come to be expected across many industries.

How Do Digital Signatures Work?
-------------------------------

[Public key cryptography](/academy/cryptography) refers to asymmetric cryptography, which involves two distinct keys that identify and decode a document. In asymmetric cryptography, [one key is private, and one is public](/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys). When the public key matches the private key, the integrity of the data can be verified. This process of encryption uses a public key algorithm to create a key for the document recipient.

Once the algorithm has created a public key, the person “signing” the document will create a private key. This private key is used to encrypt the data that is being signed, and the private key is mutually authenticated with the public key. As a result of mutual authentication, the public key can decrypt data encrypted by the private key. Although a private key is more reliable than a traditional password, the security of dual-key authentication relies on the private key being kept private.

Because the private key is created in addition to the public key, the public key will be able to open the private key. This means that, if the digital signature is not authentic, the public key will not be able to decrypt the enclosed document.

How Do I Create a Digital Signature?
------------------------------------

Creating a digital signature requires software to create mutually-authenticated private and public keys. The underlying operations of this software use a digital hash to establish one-way encryption, which allows the signer to create the private key. The hash is created by an algorithm, which generates a fixed-length key — this key serves as the basis for a digital signature. Although it is technically possible to encrypt each bit of data in a digital message, this hashing strategy is a more efficient way to encrypt data.

As you might expect, the public key is the only key that can decrypt the hash. With asymmetric authentication, even the slightest change to the hash from the document's creator will make the public key unable to decrypt the data. If the public key’s second hash does not correspond to the hash created by the sender, a security compromise has occurred — either the digital signature is inauthentic, or the data in the document has changed since it was encrypted. Either way, the public key is able to verify the authenticity and integrity of the document.

Types of Digital Signatures
---------------------------

Digital signatures are categorized by their security levels. With high-security digital signatures, more safeguards are enforced on the encryption and hashing process, making decryption and sending documents more complicated. Digital signatures are classified into three broad categories, known as Digital Signature Certificates: Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3.

Class 1 digital signatures provide only the most rudimentary security features. With Class 1, a document is authenticated based on the identification of the sender’s username and email address. While these pieces of information can serve as a type of low-security private key, Class 1 signatures shouldn’t be used for any highly sensitive documents.

Class 2 digital signatures make use of asymmetric cryptography to decrypt a document, and to identify the sender from a database of potential senders. This allows the receiver to understand whether the private key was created by an approved sender, and which member of the database sent it. These types of digital signatures are often used in business and government documents.

Class 3 digital signatures are the most secure type of digital signature. In Class 3 documents, the sender must use multi-factor identification to prove their identity — even before creating the digital signature. This means that Class 3 digital signatures establish an additional layer of authentication to ensure the private key has not fallen into the wrong hands.

Benefits of Digital Signatures
------------------------------

Digital signatures protect the security of documents by ensuring the integrity of their data, and by ensuring the authenticity of their sender. For sensitive data, the mathematical generation of asymmetric encryption is typically more secure than a simple password-protected digital document.

Aside from the major security benefits of digital signatures, there are other advantages of digital signatures that make them a worthwhile investment for businesses large and small. These benefits include:

*   **Traceability:** When the [time for a security audit](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/2022%20Case%20studies/SSH_CaseStudy_Healthcare.pdf) comes, businesses can trace the transaction history of documents using digital signatures. This can help you remain safe and compliant.

*   **Timestamped data:** Many businesses and government agencies need to identify the time of signing, and digital signatures allow recipients to authenticate a timestamp.

*   **Legal recognition:** Governments worldwide, including the United States government, recognize the legitimacy of digital signatures to determine the authenticity of a sender, making digital signatures the legal equivalent of a handwritten signature.
*   **Low cost of operation:** Once you’ve purchased digital signature software, upkeep and production are relatively easy. When you go digital, your business can eliminate the cost of paper, printing, and other components associated with handwritten documents.

The Difference Between Digital and Electronic Signatures
--------------------------------------------------------

Electronic signatures (also known as e-signatures) are a common way to authenticate digital documents — but e-signatures aren’t always digital signatures.

An e-signature is an umbrella term for any [authenticated, signed digital document](https://www.ssh.com/products/secure-encrypted-signature). E-signatures require verification of the identity of the signer, the intentions of the signer, and the association between the secure online signature and the document. By this definition, even a signature signed with a computer mouse is an e-signature, as long as these authentication measures are verified.

E-signatures offer a broader range of criteria for authentication, while digital signatures inherently require asymmetric cryptography, with the recipient’s public key decrypting the sender’s private key.

So, organizations that require a secure electronic signature will also accept a secure digital signature.

/. 099 [Email Phishing](https://www.ssh.com/academy/secure-information-sharing/what-is-email-phishing)
=========================================================

What is Email Phishing?
=======================

The term “phishing” comes from the word fishing, because the term describes a scenario in which scammers are fishing for sensitive information by appearing as a trusted authority, like a legitimate official company or a high-status employee. Email phishing is the most common type of phishing. 

Email phishing is a form of scamming used by online attackers who send vicious emails to intentionally deceive people into believing a fraud. These attacks aim to manipulate email receivers into handing over sensitive data such as financial information, business secrets, login information, or system credentials. The most commonly used technique is to manipulate people by creating a sense of fear and urgency to perform an action, like clicking a malicious link or downloading a file containing malware.

Additionally, email phishing is a social engineering technique. Social engineering is used by online attackers with the aim to understand user behavior, so they can create manipulative techniques and subsequently scam people. The goal of social engineering is to direct and manipulate users into acting without thinking about their actions.

High-risk industries for email phishing
----------------------------------------

Here are a few examples of the industries thatare commonly targeted by email phishing:

### Banks and financial institutions

The common goal of manycyber-attacks is financial gain. Thus, targeting financial institutions, which handle vast amounts of money, is extremely common.

### Social media

Another common goal of online attackers is identity theft. By impersonating a trusted social media network, attackers aim to collect login information and steal connected accounts and personal information.

### Online stores (e-commerce)

By posing themselves ase-commerce stores, cyber-criminals aim to steal financial information like credit card data.

Types of Email Phishing
-----------------------

### Spiteful web links

Using malicious links is typical in phishing emails. When an email receiver clicks on a malicious link, it typically takes the user to a scammy website or a webpage that is infected with malicious software, also known as malware.

Fraudulent links are made to appear trustworthy by using logos, company names, and credible images within the email. However, after a closer inspection, it is possible to spot errors or anomalies in the link. (More on how to secure your email from email phishing below.)

### Malicious attachments

Malicious email attachments might look like legitimate file attachments, but they are actually infected with malware that can compromise computers and their files.

For example, in the case of ransomware (a type of malware),all of the files on the computer could become inaccessible. Another example of a malicious attachment is a keystroke logger, an app/software that could be installed to track everything a user types, including passwords.

Additionally, malware infections can spread from an infected computerto other networked devices such as servers and cloud systems.

### Scammy data entry forms

These emails direct users to data entry forms to fill in sensitive information such as user IDs, passwords, credit card data, or phone numbers. Once users submit their information, it can be used by online criminals.

How does email phishing work?
-----------------------------

Anyone can be a target of email phishing – it can happen in one’s personal email as well as business emailat work. The consequences of email phishing are severe in both cases.

### Email phishing targeting personal email

The intention of most phishing schemes is to steal your login credentials (your username or email address and the associated password).

Problems that can come from email phishing attacks on your personal email include, for example:

*   Charges on your credit card
*   Money stolen from your bank account
*   Loans opened in your name without your consent
*   Fake social media posts
*   Ransomware to extort money from you
*   Tax returns filed in your name
*   Lost access to important documents
*   Wire transfers to an attacker’s account 

### Email phishing targeting business email

Cybercriminals target businesses to gain access to sensitive information, data, business secrets, and money. Falling for an email phishing scam at work can lead to serious consequences including, for example:

*   Unauthorized access to confidential systems files and communication
*   Important files can become inaccessible 
*   Business reputation can be damaged
*   Company’s value decreased and investor confidence reduced
*   Loss of corporate funds 
*   Interruption of revenue-impacting productiveness

An example of email phishing
----------------------------

Mary receives an email from her bank saying that she needs to update her credit card PIN as a security measure within the next 24 hours.She takes action quickly and follows the link provided in the email.She provides her credit card PIN and updates her so called new credit card information which leads to the website becoming unresponsive.

In a few hours, she notices a big purchase made on a random website with her credit card.She contacts her bank, and it turns out the email was not from her bank. It was an email phishing scam.

Typical phrases used in phishing emails
---------------------------------------

Most often online attackers use the word ‘request’ in phishing email subject lines, as the subject line is the first attempt to lure email phishing victims to open the email and click the malicious links or download a malware attachment.

Other popular key phrases can be: ‘follow up’, ‘urgent’, ‘important’, ‘payment status’, ‘invoice due’, ‘direct deposit’, ‘expenses’, and ‘payroll’.

How to secure your email from email phishing
--------------------------------------------

One of the key precautions you can follow is to take time,read, and evaluate the information being sent to you. Starting with the email sender, subject line, and following with the email content, including images, logos, and most importantly links and possible attachments.Be cautious no matter what the email is suggesting.

### Email phishing warning signs

A feeling of urgency and requests for personal data via embedded links are all warning signs. Take a good look at the sender’s email address. The email address often emulates legitimate company or authority names, but there might be small changes and errors in letters.

### Avoid clicking pop-ups and links

Avoid clicking any links provided unless you are absolutely certain that the email comes from a trusted source. Online attackers change the location of the “close” or “X”button on a popup window to trick users into opening a malicious site or downloading malware.

### Protect your credentials

Secure your valuable information by changing your passwords frequently or by using a solution that protects your credentials for you. Make sure that your communication and data are well protected from malware by using updated data protection software.

Businesses are offered a variety of security tools – make sure that you select the right tools suitable for your business. The right [secure business communication tools](/solutions/ssh-secure-ecommunications-suite) will offer businesses high-level, robust security and encryption in line with industry regulations and data privacy laws.

### Don’t provide credit card or other financial data easily

Don’t share financial or credit card data on a website that you arenot familiar with. You should always deal with great caution with a website or an email that promises gifts or quick wins.

### Email phishing and remote working

Remote working can create a risk for data protection as users often don’t have enterprise-level cybersecurity at homeunless their employer provides the right tools. This may offer the attackers a higher chance of a successful email phishing campaign. It is extremely important for organizations to train their employees to be aware of online threats, such as email phishing.

### Update software and firmware

Software and firmware developers release updates to remediate bugs and security issues. Remember to always install these updates to make sure known vulnerabilities are no longer present in your infrastructure.

### Use encrypted emails

Email encryption is an authentication process that forbids messages from being read by an unintended or unauthorized individual. It scrambles the original sent message and converts it into an unreadable format. Email encryption is essential, especially for businesses, when sharing sensitive information via email.

### Verify sender and recipient

If you are sending sensitive or critical information, use a solution that verifies the sender before allowing the transmission of the email. Strong identification includes biometric, password-based, or token-based authentication. It is good practice to force the recipient to verify their identity before getting access to the email.

These two methods combined make email phishing more difficult to achieve.

### Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)

MFA is an authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource. Rather than just asking for a username and password, MFA requires one or more additional verification factors such as PIN code sent via a text message, which decreases the likelihood of a successful cyberattack.

How to protect your organization against email phishing
-------------------------------------------------------

There are ways for organizations to mitigate the risk of email phishing. We at SSH Communications Security recommend businesses send emails containing sensitive or critical information only by using solutions with enterprise-grade security.

An easy way to do that is to use encrypted secure email, like our [SSH Secure Mail](/products/email-encryption-solution). Its robust encryption ensures that the message cannot be intercepted in transit, and the sender-recipient verification and MFA give you the confidence that the email has been sent from a legitimate source and has been received only by the intended recipient(s).

=========================================================

Enterprise Email Security
=========================

_Enterprise email is a critical component of any business communication. At the same time, email remains one of the biggest security attack vectors for organizations of all types and sizes._

During the past couple of years, cyberthreats have become increasingly targeted and more sophisticated cyberattacks have emerged, causing great damage to businesses, organizations, as well as governments. Enterprise email security breaches continue to occur without a sign of slowing down, and with remote work being more common than ever, cybercriminals now have more ways to attack organizations.

In this article, we explore what enterprise email security is, why it is important, how to implement enterprise email security, and what enterprise email security best practices are.

[Enterprise Email Security Best Practices](#enterprise-email-security-best-practices)  
[Protect Your Organization from Email-Based Threats](#protect-your-organization-from-email-based-threats)

What is Enterprise Email Security?
----------------------------------

Enterprise email security is a combination of policies, processes, and technologies that help organizations to protect themselves against email-based cyberattacks and ensure that employees don’t fall victim to these attacks. Every organization is in danger of external as well as internal email-born threats equally. Examples of these threats include phishing attacks, spam emails, malware, or data breaches.

When talking about enterprise email security policies, we talk about organization-wide guidance on how to use and communicate via enterprise email. With the goal to secure business email communication from unauthorized access, email security policies describe in detail the processes of email communication within an enterprise and outside enterprise borders, including data sharing of sensitive, highly confidential, or restricted information. Thus, enterprise email security policies also closely relate to data management policies, [business data categorization](https://info.ssh.com/how-to-protect-and-secure-your-vital-business-communications), and data privacy and security policies.

Enterprise email security technologies include standard as well as advanced security tools. Standard email security is usually provided by the organization’s email service provider. For example, Microsoft 365’s email security is maintained by Microsoft Purview, a general, overarching solution aimed at the security of the entire Microsoft 365 package. The standard email threat protections include, for example, attachment scanning, phishing, or scanning of malicious URLs. However, [the standard security features are not enough to protect an organization against email-based cyberattacks](https://info.ssh.com/microsoft-365-email-security-guide) because they can’t fully mitigate all the risks that enterprise email communications face.

On the other hand, advanced enterprise email security solutions are developed to secure and protect email communications in particular. These include, for example:

*   Secure Email Gateways (SEGs)
*   Email encryption solutions
*   Email Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools
*   Email Sandboxing
*   Anti-virus, anti-malware, and anti-spam technologies

Why Do You Need Enterprise Email Security?
------------------------------------------

Enterprise email is still the primary method of business communication mostly for its ease-of-use and general availability. However, when it comes to security, enterprise email is not as secure as organizations might perceive it to be. Especially when sharing business information with employees, customers, and partners. Sharing sensitive business information via enterprise email makes email a prime target for malicious actors looking to gain access to an organization or harvest valuable data. These malicious actors are not always just externals, they could also be internals, for example, ex-employees whose access was not revoked. Here, the importance of enterprise email security policies and processes comes into play – they should cover external and internal sources.

Without proper enterprise email security in place, third parties can use enterprise email to gain access to sensitive systems, data, and other resources, with the goal to disrupt organization’s data confidentiality, organizational integrity, or availability of the email system. This could lead to, for example:

*   Data breaches and leaks  
    
*   Financial losses and extra costs
*   Non-compliance with data privacy and security laws (e. g. GDPR)  
    
*   Failed IT audits
*   Loss of customers’ trust

Enterprise Email Security Best Practices 
-------------------

Enterprise email security should be multi-layered and include several touchpoints to protect email traffic in real time as well as sensitive data or information that is being shared. Enterprise email security best practices include:

### Use an enterprise email security gateway

Enterprise email security gateway is the first line of defense that filters out potentially dangerous emails based on the specific settings arranged by an administrator and in line with your enterprise email security policies. Email security gateway prevents malicious emails from reaching employees’ inboxes, so they don’t even get to see them. Like that, they can’t click on malicious URLs or download attachments containing malware or spyware.

### Use a comprehensive email encryption solution

Email encryption is basically a process of scrambling a message into a set of numbers, letters, and symbols that are in an unreadable format. So, when the email communication is intercepted, the message cannot be read by an unauthorized unintended recipient. Using an email encryption solution is especially crucial when sending sensitive or confidential information via enterprise email. Email encryption formats include, for example, S/MIME encryption or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

Most enterprise email security gateway solutions also offer additional email encryption.

### Use secure devices only

It is important to use encrypted, trackable, and compliant devices and applications when sharing business-sensitive information via enterprise email. [Using unauthorized devices is a serious vulnerability](https://www.ssh.com/blog/using-unauthorized-channels-for-sensitive-information-sharing) for any organization and could lead to massive fines.

### Educate your employees during regular email security awareness training

Organization’s employees are the last line of defense when all other enterprise email security mechanisms fail. They can be trained and educated to recognize social engineering and other types of email-based attacks, how to react to them, and how to avoid them to protect the organization. Employee training should ensure that they are familiar with and understand all enterprise email security policies, processes, and technologies.

### Implement secure business communications across the entire organization

Enterprise email security is only a part of business communications security. It is necessary to implement [secure business communications across an entire enterprise](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/ssh-secure-ecommunications-suite) to ensure that business secrets are protected when shared as well as stored. Secure business communications include not just enterprise email, but also enterprise data management, data storage, secure data sharing, secure data collection, and more.

### Implement easy-to-use solutions

Enterprise email security technologies may sound complicated on the inside, however, on the outside, the tools should be user-friendly, intuitive, and easy to use. Like this, it is possible to implement technologies without the risk of employees not using the tools due to their complexity. This is especially important when implementing solutions across the entire enterprise – it is necessary to ensure that even less technical end-users can use the tools.

/. 101 [Secure Data Sharing](https://www.ssh.com/academy/secure-information-sharing/what-is-secure-data-sharing)
=========================================================

Secure Data Sharing
===================

In the era of modern IT environments, organizations have many reasons and needs to share data – enabling remote work for employees, improving operational efficiency, or collaborating with third-party vendors being only a few of them. Data sharing is simply a must. However, without proper data sharing security measures, organizations put themselves at risk of breaking data privacy laws and expose themselves to an increased risk of cyberattacks and data breaches.

In this article, we explain what secure data sharing is, why businesses need secure data sharing, and how to share data securely with compliance in mind.

**Contents**

[How to Share Data Securely?](#how-to-share-data-securely)  
[Secure Data Sharing with Guaranteed Compliance](#secure-data-sharing-with-guaranteed-compliance)

What is Secure Data Sharing?
----------------------------

Businesses frequently collect, share, and store a vast variety of sensitive data, ranging from employee personal information or customer financial data to business trade secrets. Regularly, this valuable data needs to be shared with others within and outside the organization. Secure data sharing ensures that any data resources can be shared with others without compromising the organization’s security or data security.

Secure data sharing means sharing of sensitive, confidential, restricted, or even secret information in a way that ensures that the data is protected from unauthorized access or misuse. It also includes sharing of data in line with data sharing and privacy security laws, like GDPR.

Why Do Businesses Need Secure Data Sharing?
-------------------------------------------

Four key needs and benefits of implementing secure data sharing are:

### Compliance with data security and privacy laws

Especially in European Union countries, strict data security laws and regulationsmandate organizations to treat data with the utmost caution. By implementing secure data sharing in line with laws, businesses ensure their compliance and do not have to worry about passing data security-related audits.

A key element in GDPR compliance is restricting access to sensitive data only to the bare minimum needed for the job and limiting the number of people with such access. Another is the ability to demonstrate compliance during an audit.

### Protecting business as well as customer reputation

Without secure data sharing, organizations are at increased risk of data breaches. A potential data leak puts not only the business’s reputation but also the customers’ reputation on the line as their data might get exposed or misused during the breach.

Additionally, the financial repercussions of a breach could lead to bankruptcy, in the worst-case scenario. For example, [in 2022, the global average cost of a data breach](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach) was daunting $4.35 million.

### Secure business collaboration across borders

Secure data sharing allows businesses to share their sensitive data with employees as well as third-party organizations and collaborate on joint projects securely. With the right data sharing security measures in place, business collaboration is possible not only across organizational borders but also across physical borders. Secure data sharing enables smoother operations for employees and vendors who work remotely or in different countries.

### Enhanced productivity and operational efficiency

The right set of data sharing security tools allows organizations to easily protect as well as govern their data. A comprehensive secure data sharing toolset should offer features that can be used to enforce data policies and controls. Like that, organizations can improve their operations and grow their business without the need for cumbersome software and complicated processes.

Many tools also offer additional security features and applications that help businesses protect not just their data in transit, but also their data at rest. [A comprehensive secure business communications toolset](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/ssh-secure-ecommunications-suite) can take an organization’s secure data sharing to the next level.

How to Share Data Securely?
---------------------------

There are numerous ways for organizations to approach secure data sharing depending on the company size, type, and industry. Here are six steps every organization should take to ensure data sharing security without risking compliance:

### 1. Create data classification and data management policies

For every organization, it is important to understand what information they process and manage. Not all data is equal, thus creating clear dataclassification is the first step toward secure data sharing. It is crucial to start by identifying which data is sensitive, highly confidential,restricted, or secret and assigning appropriate levels ofrestrictions and four-eye mechanisms to each data group. Based on this data classification, an organization can then create appropriate policies which determine the protection needed, who can access the data, and what they can do with it.

### 2. Implement appropriate data sharing security controls

The next step is to implement suitable security measures – depending on the level of sensitivity, each data group might require different security controls. The right tool or a set of tools should offer a variety of technical controls, including:

*   Robust end-to-end encryption
*   Access controls
*   Various authentication methods (e. g. MFA, SSO, passwords)
*   Monitoring and reporting, including audit trails

### 3. Control where your sensitive data is and who has access to it

Based on the business type and industry, organizations need to adhere to various regulations determining where data is stored and how it can be shared. An organization should always make a cautious decision when it comes to storing their sensitive data, whether they decide to use a private cloud, managed services, or on-premises storage. The solution, which organizations use for secure data sharing, should give them the flexibility to choose between various deployment models.

### 4. Use secure business communication channels

When sharing sensitive data, it is crucial to use secure communication channels to ensure that the communication cannot be intercepted by unauthorized, potentially malicious actors. These secure channels include, for example, [encrypted email communications](https://www.ssh.com/products/email-encryption-solution), [secure file sharing](https://www.ssh.com/products/tectia-ssh/), or [secure data sharing via encrypted network connections](https://www.ssh.com/products/nqx).

Additionally, with [quantum computers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cryptography/quantum-computing-resilient-algorithms) on the horizon, it is important to also consider their impact on secure data sharing, especially when sensitive data with long-term value is being shared.

[Learn how to prepare your organization for the quantum-safe future >>>](https://info.ssh.com/guide-to-quantum-safe-cryptography)

### 5. Educate your employees about secure data sharing

By educating employees on how to share data securely, organizations can significantly improve their security posture. Employee training should include information about security and data-related policies as well as practical information on how to use the implemented tools.

### 6. Review your policies, processes, and tools regularly

Lastly, it is important to regularly review and assess all data-sharing-relatedpolicies, procedures, and technologies. The cybersecurity landscape, laws, and regulations change, and so do cyberthreats. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of implemented security controls should be a regular practice.

=========================================================================

Secure Email Gateways (SEGs), or Email Security Gateways, are made to filter out malicious email traffic and only deliver non-threatening emails. Are they always effective and enough to protect you from cyberattacks? Not completely.

Read more about Secure Email Gateways, why they are not always trustworthy, and how organizations can protect themselves better from email-based cyberattacks.

[Common features of Secure Email Gateways](#common-features)  
[What are the dangers of using Secure Email Gateways?](#dangers-of-secure-email-gateways)  
[Email Security Gateway protection one step further](#protection-one-step-further)

What is a Secure Email Gateway?
-------------------------------

Secure Email Gateways or shortly SEGs are an email security solution that awaits on an email's path from the public internet to the corporate email server. It inspects email traffic for malicious content before it reaches the corporate systems.

### Organizations should protect themselves from email cyberattacks

Many organizations apply a Secure Email Gateway as part of their email security system. Before an email enters or exits their employees' inboxes, it first needs to pass through a Secure Email Gateway, which checks whether the incoming emails show any signs of a malicious message or content. If it detects red flags, like [typical signs of email phishing](/academy/secure-information-sharing/what-is-email-phishing), it won't deliver the email. It can also scan outgoing emails for sensitive or confidential information.

How does a Secure Email Gateway work?
-------------------------------------

Secure Email Gateways detect emails with unwanted content like spam, phishing links, or malware. Once a Secure Email Gateway detects a potential email threat, it blocks the email from reaching the recipient. This slims down the odds of a company falling victim to an email cyberattack. Due to the fact that the malicious email is not even delivered, the recipient cannot interact with it and potentially click on a malicious link or download a malicious attachment.

Common features of Secure Email Gateways
----------------------------------------

### Filtering spam

A Secure Email Gateway focuses mainly on clearing out spam emails. It looks for common patterns found in spam messages and blocks them. Depending on the specific vendor and solution, it can also include a feature for employees to mark an email as spam.

### Protecting from malicious content

Secure Email Gateways can find some [elements of a phishing email](/academy/secure-information-sharing/what-is-email-phishing) such as malicious links or attachments. Despite this, sophisticated phishing attacks can pass SEGs, delivering the email.

### Preventing data loss

Outgoing emails are scanned with a Secure Email Gateway too. It looks for sensitive information in emails that are getting sent to unauthorized recipients.

What are the dangers of using Secure Email Gateways?
----------------------------------------------------

Even though Secure Email Gateways are a widely used email security defense tool, they haven’t kept up with all the different ways that email attacks can happen. SEGs look at the basic and traditional signs of suspicious emails. This means that they don’t catch advanced dangerous attacks, like social engineering attacks that are often used these days.

While an SEG does a great job of filtering spam and large-scale email attacks, it’s not equipped to handle highly-targeted phishing and social engineering attacks.

So what can you do to protect your organization from advanced attacks?

Email Security Gateway protection one step further
--------------------------------------------------

Organizations can protect themselves from basic email cyberattacks by utilizing a Secure Email Gateway. On top of an SEG, they can add an extra layer of security by using an email encryption tool, like our [SSH Secure Mail](/products/email-encryption-solution).

Our highly secure and easy-to-use email encryption solution provides full-on email security with these features:

### Access verification

You can verify senders and recipients alike with various authentication methods (including MFA, PIN, and SSO) and ensure full security with detailed monitoring features, like audit trails and reporting.

What is SSH (Secure Shell)?
===========================

This is the start page for the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, software, and related information. SSH is a software package that enables secure system administration and file transfers over insecure networks. It is used in nearly every data center and in every large enterprise.

This page was created by the inventor of SSH, [Tatu Ylonen](https://ylonen.org) (twitter: [@tjssh](https://twitter.com/tjssh)). He wrote ssh-1.x and ssh-2.x, and still works on related topics. The open source OpenSSH implementation is based on his free version.

The SSH protocol
----------------

The SSH protocol uses encryption to secure the connection between a client and a server. All user authentication, commands, output, and file transfers are encrypted to protect against attacks in the network. For details of how the SSH protocol works, see the [protocol page](/ssh/protocol/). To understand the SSH File Transfer Protocol, see the [SFTP](/ssh/sftp) page.

The SSH protocol is believed to be secure against cryptographic attacks on the network, provided keys and credentials are properly managed. However, we do not recommend using `diffie-hellman-group1-sha1` key exchange. It uses a 768 bit Diffie-Hellman group, which may be breakable by governments today. Larger groups are probably ok. Recent OpenSSH versions have disabled this group by default. See [sshd_config](/ssh/sshd_config) for configuring what key exchanges to use.

Automate with SSH keys, but manage them 
-------------------

SSH keys can be used to automate access to servers. They are commonly used in scripts, backup systems, configuration management tools, and by developers and sysadmins. They also provide single sign-on, allowing the user to move between his/her accounts without having to type a password every time. This works even across organizational boundaries, and is highly convenient.

However, unmanaged SSH keys can become a major risk in larger organizations.

---------------------------

The [Secure Shell protocol](/ssh/protocol/) was originally developed by [Tatu Ylonen](https://ylonen.org) in 1995 in response to a hacking incident in the Finnish university network. A password sniffer had been installed on a server connected directly to the backbone, and when it was discovered, it had thousands of usernames and passwords in its database, including several from Ylonen's company.

That incident triggered Ylonen to study cryptography and develop a solution he could use himself for remote login over the Internet safely. His friends proposed additional features, and three months later, in July 1995, Ylonen published the first version as open source. It became OpenSSH. Later he took the protocol for standardization at the IETF and designed the [SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)](/ssh/sftp/). He founded SSH Communications Security Corp in December 1995 to provide commercial support for the protocol.

Ylonen still works on topics related to Secure Shell, particularly around key management, as well as broader cybersecurity topics.

Today, the protocol is used for managing more than half of world’s web servers and practically every Unix or Linux computer, on-premise and in the cloud. Information security specialists and system administrators use it to configure, manage, maintain, and operate most firewalls, routers, switches, and servers in the millions of mission-critical networks and environments of our digital world. It is also embedded inside many file transfer and systems management solutions.

The new protocol replaced several legacy tools and protocols, including [telnet](/ssh/telnet), [ftp](/ssh/ftp/), [FTP/S](/ssh/ftp/ftps), [rlogin](/ssh/rlogin), [rsh](/ssh/rsh), and [rcp](/ssh/rcp).

SSH Protocol – Secure Remote Login and File Transfer
====================================================

This page is about the SSH protocol. For the company behind it, see [SSH Communications Security](/). For using the Linux ssh command, see [ssh command usage](/ssh/command). For SSH clients, servers, and technical information, see [SSH (Secure Shell) home page](/ssh/).

The SSH protocol (also referred to as Secure Shell) is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. It provides several alternative options for strong authentication, and it protects communications security and integrity with strong encryption. It is a secure alternative to the non-protected login protocols (such as [telnet](/ssh/telnet), rlogin) and insecure file transfer methods (such as [FTP](/ssh/ftp/)).

Typical uses of the SSH protocol
--------------------------------

The protocol is used in corporate networks for:

*   providing secure access for users and automated processes
    
*   interactive and automated file transfers
    
*   issuing remote commands
    
*   managing network infrastructure and other mission-critical system components.
    

How does the SSH protocol work
------------------------------

The protocol works in the client-server model, which means that the connection is established by the SSH client connecting to the SSH server. The SSH client drives the connection setup process and uses public key cryptography to verify the identity of the SSH server. After the setup phase the SSH protocol uses strong symmetric encryption and hashing algorithms to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data that is exchanged between the client and server.

The figure below presents a simplified setup flow of a secure shell connection.

![SSH_Client_Server](https://www.ssh.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SSH_Client_Server.png?width=556&name=SSH_Client_Server.png)

Strong authentication with SSH keys
-----------------------------------

There are several options that can be used for user authentication. The most common ones are passwords and public key authentication.

The public key authentication method is primarily used for automation and sometimes by system administrators for single sign-on. It has turned out to be much more widely used than we ever anticipated. The idea is to have a cryptographic key pair - public key and private key - and configure the public key on a server to [authorize access](/ssh/authorized_keys/) and grant anyone who has a copy of the private key access to the server. The keys used for authentication are called [SSH keys](/ssh/key/). Public key authentication is also used with smartcards, such as the CAC and PIV cards used by US government.

The main use of key-based authentication is to enable secure automation. Automated secure shell file transfers are used to seamlessly integrate applications and also for automated systems & configuration management.

We have found that large organizations have way more SSH keys than they imagine, and [managing SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management/) has become very important. SSH keys grant access as user names and passwords do. They require a similar provisioning and termination processes.

In some cases we have found several million SSH keys authorizing access into production servers in customer environments, with 90% of the keys actually being unused and representing access that was provisioned but never terminated. Ensuring proper policies, processes, and audits also for SSH usage is critical for proper identity and access management. Traditional identity management projects have overlooked as much as 90% of all credentials by ignoring SSH keys. We provide [services](/products/services) and [tools](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) for implementing SSH key management.

SSH provides strong encryption and integrity protection
-------------------------------------------------------

Once a connection has been established between the SSH client and server, the data that is transmitted is encrypted according to the parameters negotiated in the setup. During the negotiation the client and server agree on the symmetric encryption algorithm to be used and generate the encryption key that will be used. The traffic between the communicating parties is protected with industry standard strong encryption algorithms (such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)), and the SSH protocol also includes a mechanism that ensures the integrity of the transmitted data by using standard hash algorithms (such as SHA-2 (Standard Hashing Algorithm)).

IETF SSH standard and detailed technical documentation
------------------------------------------------------

### The core protocol

When the SSH protocol became popular, Tatu Ylonen took it to the [IETF](http://ietf.org) for standardization. It is now an internet standard that is described in the following documents:

[RFC 4251 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture](/hubfs/SSH%20Academy/RFC_4251_-_The_Secure_Shell__SSH__Protocol_Architecture)

[RFC 4253 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol](/hubfs/SSH%20Academy/RFC_4253_-_The_Secure_Shell__SSH__Transport_Layer_Protocol)

[RFC 4252 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Authentication Protocol](/hubfs/SSH%20Academy/RFC_4252_-_The_Secure_Shell__SSH__Authentication_Protocol)

[RFC 4254 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Connection Protocol](/hubfs/SSH%20Academy/RFC_4254_-_The_Secure_Shell__SSH__Connection_Protocol)

### SFTP file transfer protocol

The [SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)](/ssh/sftp/) is probably the most widely used secure file transfer protocol today. It runs over SSH, and is currently documented in

[draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02](/hubfs/SSH%20Academy/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02)

### Public key file format

The public key file format is not a formal standard (it is an informational document), but many implementations support this format.

[RFC 4716 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Public Key File Format](/hubfs/SSH%20Academy/RFC_4716_-_The_Secure_Shell__SSH__Public_Key_File_Format)

=========================================================

Automated SSH connections - Secure M2M connections
==================================================

Automated secure connections between devices, computers, and cloud systems are a very common use case of the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/). The powerful SSH protocol provides secure connectivity, automated file transfers, and strong and automatic authentication between the many M2M processes that execute in the shadows of corporate networks every day (and night).

Studies of actual corporate environments have revealed that the identities involved in these automated connections (by far) outnumber the human users. Automated SSH connections are commonly authenticated with [SSH keys](/ssh/key/), and typically require no passwords.

* [How are automated SSH connections set up?](#how-are-automated-ssh-connections-set-up?) 
* [Managing automated SSH connections](#managing-automated-ssh-connections)


Why are automated SSH connections used?
---------------------------------------

SSH (and [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) for file transfer) connections are the basic tools for IT process automation. In corporate networks, automated SSH connections are used for a variety of recurring tasks and system administration processes. Scripts and processes that perform data archiving, periodic reporting, database cleanup, log data collection, system backups, and network maintenance regularly establish secure connections between systems using the ubiquitously deployed SSH procotol.

How are automated SSH connections set up?
-----------------------------------------

The automated M2M connections are run without the supervision of a human user. This means that the authentication between processes needs to be completed automatically, without the interactive prompting for a password from the user. Embedding the password into the communicating programs or scripts is problematic from the security point of view, and also imposes some undesired maintenance burden in the event of a password rotation.

The SSH protocol that provides the secure connectivity offers a secure and functionally elegant way to circumvent the difficulties imposed by the password authentication. The use of SSH keys for authentication allows for strong, automated, and passwordless authentication. [SSH key](/ssh/key/) based authentication is considerably more secure than password authentication, **and** can be fully automated. When complemented with a well-designed SSH key management stategy, the automated SSH connections can also enjoy the full benefits of managemenent, for example key rotation and other lifecycle management features.

The automated connections over SSH are typically run at intervals (daily, weekly, quarterly) or triggered by certain conditions (a logfile appearing in a designated directory, or a signal from a process to initiate a system backup). The availability, flexibility, and reliability of the SSH protocol has made it into the primary system administration automation tool in corporate environments.

Managing automated SSH connections
----------------------------------

SSH automation is typically created and maintained by the corporate IT department. Individual system administrators program the automated processes and self-provision the SSH keys used for the access. The "in-house" development nature of the automation often leads to processes that are lightly (if at all) documented.

Since the automated SSH connections often execute within the corporate core systems and regularly operate with elevated privileges, it is a good security practice to bring them under the corporate IAM strategy and policy. Bringing such unseen/undocumented processes under centralized management requires a management solution than can not only control/regulate SSH keys and access, but also detect and discover SSH access to allow a zero-disruption management roll-out.

Network monitoring of encrypted connections (SSH, RDP, HTTPS)

Enterprise networks are frequently accessed by 3rd parties such as consultants, outsourcing partners, remote contractors, and other trusted third parties. Today's distributed operations mean that very often these trusted outsiders access the corporate core systems remotely over the public Internet. Allowing remote access requires that encrypted secure protocols are used, to protect the identity and login credentials as well as the privacy of the exchanged data. Use of encryption has, however, an unpleasant side-effect as it also means that the network monitoring solutions used by corporate IT teams are blinded by encryption and unable to monitor the connections. Protocols such as [SSH](/ssh/protocol/), [SFTP](/ssh/sftp), [RDP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383015%28v=vs.85%29.aspx), and [HTTPS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818) provide security but also hide the actions within the connections under the cover of encryption.

Corporate IT security teams require tools that can monitor, control, and audit encrypted connections of trusted 3rd parties.

Monitoring Network Access of 3rd Parties
----------------------------------------

Both corporate security policies and regulatory controls require the monitoring of network access of all users that enter the corporate core systems. Information security is based on knowing and controlling **who has access to what**. Combining this with the necessity of privacy protected network access requires network monitoring solutions that are able to "see inside" the encrypted and protected connections. Normal network monitoring systems are not able to do this, and are blind to encryption. Common network monitoring tools, such as [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org) are able to capture, detect and reconstruct various unencrypted protocols, but do not see into the protected tunnels of encrypted SSH, RDP, or HTTPS protocols.

PrivX - Monitor, Control, Audit
-------------------------------

[PrivX](/products/privx/) is a versatile solution for managing privileged connections and monitoring encrypted sessions

PrivX provides a centralized enforcement point that allows effective enforcement for corporate policy and works as a [compliance](/compliance/) enabler for organizations in regulated businesses.

Using PrivX for network monitoring of encrypted connections allows benefits such as:

*   Recording an **audit trail**
    
*   Safe use of **shared accounts**
    
*   Effortless enforcement of **2 factor authentication**
    
*   Prevent **SSH back-tunneling** attacks
    

### Audit Trail of 3rd Party Actions

Monitoring network connections of third parties with PrivX allows storing a record of actions for later audits or reviews. PrivXstores the sessions as videos that can be searched and indexed - these recorded sessions form an audit trail that can be used for multiple purposes that range from service level reviews to forensic examinations.

### Allows Safe Use of Shared Accounts

PrivX allows safe and auditable use of shared accounts at corporate resources. This is a very convenient and secure way of sharing a single account among a team of individual users. The actual login credentials of the shared account (for example the [root account](/iam/user/root) of the corporate firewall) do not need to be exposed to (sometimes temporary or external) users, and the actions undertaken at the shared account are logged and recorded.

### Enforcement of Two-Factor Authentication

Deploying a well placed security policy enforcement point such as PrivX offers an additional benefit in the form of an efficient and smooth deployment point for two-factor authetication (2FA). Most 2FA solutions require the installation of a server-side component or agent but PrivX installation is agentless. This reduces the solution complexity and maintenance burden, while improving overall system security.

### Prevent SSH Back-tunneling Attacks

[SSH back-tunnelling](/ssh/tunneling/) is one of the ways the SSH protocol can be misused. An attack like this is difficult to observe and protect against, since the actions of the attacker are hidden from sight of most security systems. Using an auditing solution such as PrivXallows detecting an unauthorized SSH tunnel and both preventing the attackers intentions and recording the attempt for more thorough investigations.

What is OpenSSH?
----------------

[SSH (Secure Shell)](/ssh/) is a tool for secure system administration, file transfers, and other communication across the Internet or other untrusted network. It encrypts identities, passwords, and transmitted data so that they cannot be eavesdropped and stolen.

[OpenSSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH) is an open-source implementation of the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/). It is based on the free version by [Tatu Ylonen](https://ylonen.org) and further developed by the [OpenBSD](http://openbsd.org) team and the user community.

Tatu Ylonen founded [SSH Communications Security](/) to provide commercial support for enterprises, and the original version evolved into [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/). The commercial version also supports Windows and IBM mainframe (z/OS) platforms and includes full support for X.509 certificates and smartcard authentication (for example the CAC and PIV cards used by US government).

The open source version is delivered as source code or precompiled binaries under a BSD-style license. The project team provides no support services for end-users, but community-based support is available (on a voluntary basis) from various security web forums.

What is an SSH Key?
-------------------

SSH provides an authentication mechanism based on cryptographic keys, called [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication). One or more public keys may be configured as [authorized keys](/ssh/authorized_keys/); the private key corresponding to an authorized key serves as authentication to the server. Typically both authorized keys and private keys are stored in the _.ssh_ directory in a user's home directory. Fundamentally, such keys are like fancy passwords, only the password cannot be stolen from the network and it is possible to encrypt the private key locally (so that using it requires both a file and a passphrase only known to a user). However, in practice most keys are used for automation and do not have a passphrase.

The keys used for user authentication are called _user keys_. SSH also uses _host keys_ for authenticating hosts. Together these are called [SSH keys](/ssh/key/).

SSH keys replaced the insecure _.rhosts_ authentication that was vulnerable to active network-level attacks. Replacing _.rhosts_ improved the security of the Internet and enterprise information systems tremendously. However, the vast success of the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) combined with the fact that OpenSSH shipped free with most operating systems led to a lack of policies and oversight in relation to SSH keys. Consequently, auditors and IT security managers did not pay enough attention to SSH keys.

SSH keys provide the same level of access as user names and passwords, and typically to privileged accounts with operating system access. It is common that there are 10 times as many SSH keys as there are passwords. Yet SSH keys have been ignored in most identity and access management projects. They require the same kind of provisioning and termination processes and audit attention as passwords or any other authentication method.

What Risks Are Associated with SSH Keys? 
-------------------

SSH risks expose organizations to major security risks for a number of reasons:

*   Lack of provisioning, termination, and oversight processes and policies for SSH keys.
    
*   The number of existing legacy SSH keys seems to surprise everybody. In one customer case we found 3 million keys (750,000 distinct keypairs). In another case the customer found 4.5 million authorized keys. Most large enterprises seem to have at least hundreds of thousands of keys and don't know how many. Compromise of just one key is enough to gain illegitimate access.
    
*   Many keys are unused and represent access that was never properly terminated. In one typical major enterprise we have found that about 90% of all the SSH keys were not used during a six-month monitoring period.
    
*   Nobody knows who has the corresponding private keys. The keys can be kept offline.
    
*   SSH keys have typically never been changed. Like passwords, keys should be changed periodically (a key rotation period of six months is common).
    
*   SSH keys grant privileged access. In one typical major enterprise we found that 10% of all SSH keys granted [root access](/iam/user/root).
    
*   Many recent malware packages have been collecting SSH keys.
    
*   SSH keys can be used to hide backdoors. Such backdoors are not likely to be ever discovered without [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/), and no-one can tell if it was a backdoor or a key that had been forgotten.
    
*   Given the vast number of keys, uncontrolled access graphs formed by the keys, and the fact that keys are used to copy data to disaster recovery sites and backup systems, they may be used to spread an attack throughout the server environment, including backup sites, in minutes in an automated fashion. This represents a major cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism threat.
    
*   Many publicized cybercrime incidents have involved rogue system administrators utilizing SSH keys and criminals outright buying SSH keys from insiders.
    
*   Improperly managed server keys expose hosts to network-level man-in-the-middle attacks.
    

NIST Guidelines for SSH Key Management
--------------------------------------

[NIST](http://nist.gov) published guidelines in late 2015 for managing SSH keys for both automated and interactive access as [NIST IR 7966](/compliance/nist-7966/). The NIST guidelines explain the problem and establish a framework for addressing [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/).

SSH Key Management
------------------

OpenSSH presents several special challenges for SSH key management:

*   Common lack of policies and provisioning/termination processes. Users are commonly allowed to self-provision keys for themselves (and anyone they like).
    
*   The proprietary certificates supported by OpenSSH make auditing SSH key based access impossible. With them, you cannot tell which keys a server will accept by analyzing the server. Typically there are no reliable records or audits of which keys a certificate authority key has signed. We do not recommend the use of non-ephemeral OpenSSH certificates for user authentication.
    
*   Key locations are commonly configured in configuration files.
    
*   Some organizations use custom-compiled versions that have non-standard paths compiled in for specifying the location of SSH keys.
    
*   SSH keys may be stored in NFS (Network File System) volumes and a change may affect many hosts.
    
*   User accounts may come from [Active Directory](/iam/active-directory/), NIS (Network Information System), or LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) servers.
    
*   Keys may be stored in LDAP.
    
*   SELinux is enabled in many common Linux distributions, and it may not be possible to directly read [authorized_keys](/ssh/authorized_keys/) files.
    
*   Configuration file syntax and the meaning of certain options has changed many times between versions.
    
*   Options in [authorized_keys](/ssh/authorized_keys/) files are important for understanding what access is provided and for restricting the use of stolen/copied keys using from-stanzas.
    

The only solution that is currently able to practically address the SSH key management problem with the full complexity of enterprise environments is [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/).

For more information on SSH key management and what it involves, please see the [generic SSH key management page](/iam/ssh-key-management/).

Information security starts by controlling who is given access to systems. The rest is just enforcing the access. If there is no knowledge of who has been given access using SSH keys, there is no security. No confidentiality, no integrity, no guarantee of continued operation.

Comparison to Tectia SSH
------------------------

While the open source OpenSSH and commercial [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) implementations address the same underlying need for securing of logins, communications, and file transfers to hosts, there are some differences in their approaches.

Organizations requiring [commercial support, 24x7 support](/products/services), or smartcard authentication may wish to check out [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/).


User Interface Considerations - Command Line or Graphical
---------------------------------------------------------

Due to its history and heritage in the open source operating system community and its availability on primarily Linux/BSD the default user interface to the OpenSSH functionality is the command line. The figure below present a typical view of an OpenSSH client started from a Linux command line.

![OpenSSH command line user interface](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/OpenSSH_command_line_user_interface-2.png)

The users of the open source version are familiar with working in this environment, and the project team has not seen the need for graphical user interfaces that are the norm outside the system administration and certain software development market segments.

SSH client users that require graphical user interfaces have the option to use one of the commercial or non-commercial [SSH client software](/ssh/client) packages, many of which provide a platform native GUI.

OpenSSH Download
----------------

OpenSSH is available for source code download at the project [website](http://www.openssh.com/portable.html) as well as on various operating systems and distribution-specific package management systems. Downloading and compiling the source code suits certain audiences (software developers and linux distribution developers). End users are advised to acquire OpenSSH via the operating system specific package managers, or to consider a commercially supported product such as [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/).

The project accepts contributions to the project via the [OpenBSD Foundation](http://www.openbsd.org/donations.html).

OpenSSH Client - ssh
--------------------

The OpenSSH client program is called [ssh](/ssh/command). The SSH client generally uses information in the _.ssh_ directory in the user's home directory. It also reads [/etc/ssh/ssh_config](/ssh/config), which contains system-wide configuration for it.

OpenSSH Server - sshd
---------------------

The OpenSSH server program is called [sshd](/ssh/sshd). The server is typically started during boot, and reads its configuration from _/etc/ssh_ directory. Its main configuration file is usually [/etc/ssh/sshd_config](/ssh/sshd_config).


/. 109 [OpenSSH Server Process (SSHD)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sshd)
=========================================================

sshd – SSH server process
=========================

`sshd` is the [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) server process. It listens to incoming connections using the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol) and acts as the server for the protocol. It handles user authentication, encryption, terminal connections, file transfers, and [tunneling](/ssh/tunneling/).

How to Install SSH Server on Linux
----------------------------------

The SSH server usually comes up as a readily installable package on most linux distributions. However, it is not always installed by default. You can try `ssh localhost` to test if it is running; if it respons with something like `Connection refused`, then it is not running.

On Debian-derived distributions, the command to install an SSH server is usually:

    aptitude install openssh-server

On Red Hat derived distributions, the command would usually be:

    yum install openssh-server

These commands must be run as [root](/iam/user/root).

If the server does not start automatically, try using the `service sshd start` command, or just reboot the computer.

To get an SSH server for Windows, see [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/). To get one for IBM z/OS mainframes, see [Tectia SSH for Mainframes](/products/tectia-ssh-zOS).

Startup and Roles of Different `sshd` processes
-----------------------------------------------

The `sshd` process is started when the system boots. The program is usually located at `/usr/sbin/sshd`. It runs as [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser). The initial process acts as the **master server** that listens to incoming connections. Generally this process is the one with the lowest process id or the one that has been running the longest. It is also the parent process of all the other `sshd` processes. The following command can be used to display the process tree on Linux, and it is easy to see which one is the parent process.

    ps axjf

For example, it is easy to see in the following output that process 2183 is the master server.

     PPID   PID  PGID   SID TTY      TPGID STAT   UID   TIME COMMAND  ...     1  2183  2183  2183 ?           -1 Ss       0   8:51 /usr/sbin/sshd -D  2183 12496 12496 12496 ?           -1 Ss       0   0:00  _ sshd: cessu [priv] 12496 12567 12496 12496 ?           -1 S    15125  24:07  |   _ sshd: cessu  2183 12568 12568 12568 ?           -1 Ss       0   0:00  _ sshd: cessu [priv] 12568 12636 12568 12568 ?           -1 S    15125   0:00  |   _ sshd: cessu@pts/2 12636 12637 12637 12637 pts/2    12637 Ss+  15125   0:00  |       _ -zsh ...

The other `sshd` processes are child processes that serve a single connection. A new process is created for each new SSH session.

If the SSH server is upgraded or restarted, only the master server is generally restarted. The server has been designed so that the server processes serving existing connections continue to operate. This minimizes the disruption to users when, for example, server configuration is changed. The easiest way to restart the SSH server is usually to use `service sshd restart`. However, care should be taken when upgrading configurations remotely, as errors could prevent connecting to the server again (see below).

It is also possible to kill individual processes by killing the server process for a particular user, terminal, or command. This could be done, e.g., using the `kill -9 <processid>` command.

It is also possible to run multiple master `sshd` processes on the same system. This is very unusual, but we have seen enterprise customers with more than ten servers running simultaneously with different configurations. Each server would need to listen to a different port and usually would have a different configuration file.

![SSHD is the Linux SSH server process](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/SSHD_is_the_Linux_SSH_server_process-2.png)

Configuration File
------------------

The SSH server has a configuration file, usually `/etc/sshd/sshd_config`. The configuration file specifies encryption options, authentication options, file locations, logging, and various other parameters. For a detailed description, please the [sshd_config](/ssh/sshd_config) documentation.

Logging
-------

The SSH server uses the [syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) subsystem for logging. There are many ways to configure `syslog` and several syslog servers. Many enterprises also collect syslog data into their centralized SIEM (Security Incident and Event Management) system.

On most systems, `syslog` is configured to log SSH-related messages by default into files under `/var/log/`. On Debian-derived systems, the default log file is usually `/var/log/auth.log`. On Red Hat derived systems, the default log file is usually `/var/log/secure`.

Both the `syslog` facility and logging level can be configured in the server configuration file. It is **strongly advised to set the logging level to VERBOSE**, so that fingerprints for SSH key access get properly logged. Newest OpenSSH versions may log them automatically, but many Linux distributions still come with versions that don't log fingerprints without this setting. See [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management) for why this is important.


Debugging SSH Connection Problems
---------------------------------

Sometimes logging into an SSH server just doesn't seem to work, and it can be difficult to figure out what the problem is. There are basically three tools that help diagnose connection and authentication problems:

### SSH Client `-v` Option

The first approach is to add the `-v` option when calling the client on the command line. For example:

    ssh -v [user@]host

This will print verbose debugging output that can usually identify what the problem is. Thigs to check include:

*   Does it successfully establish the TCP connection to server? If not, it could be DNS or routing problem or the server could be down. If the output includes `Connection established`, then the connection was successful.
    
*   Check the user name that it is trying to authenticate as. Look for a line containing `Authenticating to <hostname> as '<username>'`.
    
*   Check that it successfully negotiates encryption. If you see a line containing `SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received`, then encryption negotiation was successful. If not, then the server or client must be reconfigured. An outdated host key on the client could also cause this (use `ssh-keygen -R <hostname>` on the client to remove old host key if necessary; see [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen)).
    
*   Look at the authentication methods the server is willing to accept. Look for lines containing `Authentications that can continue: <list of methods>`. If the method you are trying to use is not included, you need to change the configuration of the server **and restart the server**. This is a fairly common cause of problems if using anything other than password or [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication).
    
*   If you see a line containing `Authentication succeeded`, then it is not an authentication problem. If login fails after this, then it could be a problem with the user's login shell or, e.g., `.bashrc`.
    
*   It is fairly common for `X11 forwarding` to fail. It is disabled by default in the OpenSSH server. You need to edit the `sshd_config` file on the server to have the line `X11Forwarding yes` to enable it. It often does not to be enabled on enterprise application servers, but in universities, home environments, and development servers it is usually needed. Again, remember to restart the server.
    

### Log Files

Looking at the log files can often reveal insights into the cause of the problem. The messages sent to the client are intentionally designed to reveal quite little about the user being logged in as. This is for security reasons. For example, we don't want attacker to be able to test which user accounts exist on a target system. More information about, e.g., authentication failures can often be found in the log file.

### Run the Server in Debug Mode

A system administrator can manually run the server with the `-d` option to get extra verbose output from the server. This is often the last resort when diagnosing connection problems. Usually the cause of authentication failures is quite clearly visible in its output.

It may be desirable to run the new server in a different port then the normal server, so as to not prevent new connections to the server (especially if it remote!). In this case, the server would be run (as root) with something like `sshd -d -p 2222` and then the client would connect with `ssh -p 2222 [user@]host`.

Command-Line Options
--------------------

It is rare to have to manually provide command options for the SSH server. Generally only people repackaging SSH or creating new linux distributions or new embedded platforms (e.g., [IoT devices](/iot/)) would do this.

The following options are available in OpenSSH:

**-4** Only use IPv4 addresses. This might be used in environments where DNS gives IPv6 addresses but routing does not work for them.

**-6** Only use IPv6 addresses. This might be used for testing to make sure IPv6 connectivity works.

**-C** `**connection_spec**` Used for testing particular `Match` blocks in the configuration file, in combination with the `-T` option. The `connection_spec` is a comma-separated list of `<keyword>=<value>` pairs, where `<keyword>` can be one of: `user`, `host`, `laddr`, `lport`, `addr`. Multiple `-C` options are permitted and combined.

**-c** `**host_certificate_file**` Specifies the path of a file containing the host certificate for the host. The certificate is in [OpenSSH's proprietary format](/ssh/certificate).

**-D** Do not detach and become daemon. This is often used when `sshd` is run using `systemd`. This allows easier monitoring of the process in such environments. Without this option, the SSH server forks and detaches from terminal, making itself a background daemon process. The latter has been the traditional way to run the SSH server until recently. Many embedded systems would still use the latter.

**-d** Enables debug mode. The server does not fork, and will exit after processing a single connection. This can be used for diagnosing user authentication and other problems, and usually gives more information about the problem than is set to the client.

**-E** `**log_file**` Appends logs to the specified file, instead of sending them to `syslog`.

**-e** Write debug logs to standard error. This could be used for debugging.

**-f** `**config_file**` Specifies the path of the server configuration file. By default, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` is used.

**-g** `**login_grace**` Specifies how quickly users must authenticate themselves after opening a connection to the SSH server. The default is 120 seconds, but this can be changed in the server configuration file. The timeout prevents permanently reserving resources on the server by opening an unauthenticated connection to it.

**-h** `**host_key_file**` Specifies a file from which to read a host key. The default is to use `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_<algorithm>_key` files. Only one host key can be specified for each algorithm.

**-i** This would be used if the server was run through `inetd`. However, nobody does it these days.

**-k timeout** This option is obsolete. It was used with SSH version 1. Its use is strongly discouraged.

**-o option** Overrides any configuration option specified in the configuration file. This could be useful for testing and running multiple servers on different ports.

**-p port** Specifies the port that the server listens on. The default is 22. The port can also be specified in the server configuration file.

**-q** Doesn't send anything to the system log. This is not recommended; the only real use of this option would be for an attacker to hide logins using a backdoor. This option really shouldn't be there.

**-T** Reads the server configuration file, checks its syntax, and exits. This is useful for checking that the configuration file is ok before restarting the server. Checking the configuration file is especially important if updating the configuration remotely. In fact, in such cases it is best to first test the new configuration by running a second server on a new port, and only restart the primary server after a successful login using the test server. This can be combined with the `-C` option to test individual `Match` blocks in the configuration file.

**-t** Checks the validity of the configuration file and referenced keys. See `-T` for advise on additional testing before restarting a server remotely.

**-u len** This obscure option has only one useful purpose: specifying `-u0` causes dotted IP addresses to be stored in the `utmp` file (which contains information about logins to the server). This disables DNS lookups by the SSH server, if the authentication mechanism or `from=` patterns on [authorized keys](/academy/ssh/authorized-key) do not require then. Otherwise it would specify the size of an `utmp` structure on the host, the cases where it needs to be manually specified are very rare.

Getting Version Number of the Installed Server
----------------------------------------------

When connecting to an SSH server, it reports a version number to the client. OpenSSH does not provide a documented means for getting the version number of the server.

If the server is given the unrecognized `-v` option, it however reports its version number on the second line of output. This can be very helpful in determining the version number from a shell script.

How SSH port became 22
----------------------

The default [SSH](/ssh/) port is 22. It is not a coincidence. This is a story of how it got that port.

When I ([Tatu Ylonen](https://ylonen.org) first published this story in April 2017, it went viral and got about 120,000 readers in three days.

The story of getting SSH port 22
--------------------------------

I wrote the initial version of SSH (Secure Shell) in Spring 1995. It was a time when [telnet](/ssh/telnet) and [FTP](/ssh/ftp) were widely used.

Anyway, I designed SSH to replace both `telnet` (port 23) and `ftp` (port 21). Port 22 was free. It was conveniently between the ports for `telnet` and `ftp`. I figured having that port number might be one of those small things that would give some aura of credibility. But how could I get that port number? I had never allocated one, but I knew somebody who had allocated a port.

The basic process for port allocation was fairly simple at that time. Internet was smaller and we were in the very early stages of the Internet boom. Port numbers were allocated by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority). At the time, that meant an esteemed Internet pioneer called [Jon Postel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel) and [Joyce K. Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_K._Reynolds). Among other things, Jon had been the editor of such minor protocol standards as IP (RFC 791), ICMP (RFC 792), and TCP (RFC 793). Some of you may have heard of them.

To me Jon felt outright scary, having authored all the main Internet RFCs!

Anyway, just before announcing `ssh-1.0` in July 1995, I sent this e-mail to IANA:

    From ylo Mon Jul 10 11:45:48 +0300 1995 From: Tatu Ylonen <ylo@cs.hut.fi>To: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority <iana@isi.edu>Subject: request for port numberOrganization: Helsinki University of Technology, FinlandDear Sir, I have written a program to securely log from one machine into another over aninsecure network. It provides major improvements in security and functionality over existingtelnet and rlogin protocols and implementations. In particular, it prevents IP, DNS andouting spoofing.  My plan is to distribute the software freely on the Internet and to get itinto as wide use as possible. I would like to get a registered privileged port number forthe software.The number should preferably be in the range 1-255 so that it can be used in the WKS fieldin name servers. I'll enclose the draft RFC for the protocol below. The software has been inlocal use for several months, and is ready for publication except for the port number. Ifthe port number assignment can be arranged in time, I'd like to publish the software alreadythis week. I am currently using port number 22 in the beta test.It would be great if this number could be used (it is currently shown as Unassigned in thelists). The service name for the software is "ssh" (for Secure Shell).Yours sincerely,  Tatu Ylonen <ylo@cs.hut.fi>  ... followed by protocol specificationfor ssh-1.0

The next day, I had an e-mail from Joyce waiting in my mailbox:

    Date: Mon, 10 Jul 1995 15:35:33 -0700 From: jkrey@ISI.EDU To: ylo@cs.hut.fi Subject: Re: request for port number  Cc: iana@ISI.EDU Tatu,  We have assigned port number 22 to ssh, with you as the point of contact.  Joyce

There we were! SSH port was 22!!!

On July 12, 1995, at 2:32am, I announced a final beta version to my beta testers at Helsinki University of Technology. At 5:23pm I announced ssh-1.0.0 packages to my beta testers. At 5:51pm on July 12, 1995, I sent an announcement about SSH (Secure Shell) to the `cypherpunks@toad.com` mailing list. I also posted it to a few newsgroups, mailing lists, and directly to selected people who had discussed related topics on the Internet.

Changing the SSH port in the server
-----------------------------------

By default, the SSH server still runs in port 22. However, there are occasions when it is run in a different port. Testing use is one reason. Running multiple configurations on the same host is another. Rarely, it may also be run without root privileges, in which case it must be run in a non-privileged port (i.e., port number >= 1024).

The port number can be configured by changing the `Port 22` directive in [/etc/ssh/sshd_config](/ssh/sshd_config). It can also be specified using the `-p <port>` option to [sshd](/ssh/sshd). The SSH client and [sftp](/academy/ssh/sftp-ssh-file-transfer-protocol) programs also support the `-p <port>` option.

Specifying SSH port number on the command line
----------------------------------------------

The `-p <port>` option can be used to specify the port number to connect to when using the `ssh` command on Linux. The `-P <port>` (note: capital P) option can be used with [SFTP](/academy/ssh/sftp-ssh-file-transfer-protocol) and `scp`. The SSH port number command line setting overrides any value configured in configuration files.

Configuring SSH access through firewalls
----------------------------------------

SSH is one of the few protocols that are frequently permitted through firewalls. Unrestricted outbound SSH is very common, especially in smaller and more technical organizations. Inbound SSH is usually restricted to one or very few servers.

### Outbound SSH

Configuring outbound SSH in a firewall is very easy. If there are restrictions on outgoing traffic at all, just create a rule that allows TCP port 22 to go out. That is all. If you want to restrict the destination addresses, you can also limit the rule to only permit access to your organization's external servers in the cloud, or to a [jump server](/iam/jump-server) that guards cloud access.

### Back-tunneling is a risk

Unrestricted outbound SSH can, however, be risky. The SSH protocol supports [tunneling](/ssh/tunneling). The basic idea is that it is possible to have the SSH server on an external server listen to connections from anywhere, forward those back into the organization, and then make a connection to some Internal server.

This can be very convenient in some environments. Developers and system administrators frequently use it to open a tunnel that they can use to gain remote access from their home or from their laptop when they are travelling.

However, it generally violates policy and takes control away from firewall administrators and the security team. It can, for example, violate [PCI](/compliance/pci/), [HIPAA](/compliance/hipaa/security-rule), or [NIST SP 800-53](/compliance/nist-800-53/). It can be used by hackers and foreign intelligence agencies to leave backdoors into organizations[](/products/cryptoauditor/)

### Inbound SSH access

For inbound access, there are a few practical alternatives:

*   Configure firewall to forward all connections to port 22 to a particular IP address on the internal network or [DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)).
    
*   Use different ports on the firewall to access different servers.
    
*   Only allow SSH access after you have logged in using a VPN (Virtual Private Network), typically using the IPsec protocol.
    

Enabling SSH access via iptables
--------------------------------

[Iptables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables) is a host firewall built into the Linux kernel. It is typically configured to protect the server by preventing access to any ports that have not been expressly opened.

If `iptables` is enabled on the server, the following commands can be used to permit incoming SSH access. They must be run as root.

    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 22 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

If you want to save the rules permanently, on some systems that can be done with the command:

    service iptables save

/. 111 [Remote File Copy (RCP)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/rcp)
=========================================================

rcp - the legacy remote file copy tool
======================================

The `rcp` (remote copy) program was a tool for copying files to/from remote computers. It has since been superceded by [ssh](/ssh), particularly the [scp](/ssh/scp) tool. Everyone who still has `rcp` enabled is encouraged to immediately disable it for important security reasons.

The `rcp` tool was introduced in BSD Unix in the 1980s. It was an important tool at the time, but it suffered from several shortcomings. Its security was poor, and its usability wasn't great.

### Contents

* [Security Issues in `rcp`](#security-issues-in-rcp) 
* [Usability Issues in `rcp`](#usability-issues-in-rcp)

Security Issues in `rcp`
------------------------

`rcp` used `.rhosts` files and `/etc/hosts.equiv` for authentication. These methods relied on IP addresses and DNS (Domain Name System) for authentication. However, spoofing IP addresses is fairly easy, especially if the attacker is on the local network, and at the time [it could even be done remotely](http://wiki.cas.mcmaster.ca/index.php/The_Mitnick_attack).

Furthermore, the `.rhosts` files were stored in users' home directories, which were typically stored on NFS (Network File System) volumes. The security of NFS at that time was poor (and still is, in many installations).

Usability Issues in `rcp`
-------------------------

A major annoyance in `rcp` was that it didn't support passwords for authentication. Whenever you wanted to copy files between systems, you first had to set up `.rhosts` authentication. Besides obvious security implications, this was really cumbersome.

Making ad hoc copying of file easy was a major factor in the success of SSH. It being secure was just an added bonus. The ease of use meant students and employees could learn it more easily and there was less workload on IT support specialists. Lower costs, saved time, more productivity, better user satisfaction.


/. 112 [Remote Login (rlogin)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/rlogin)
=========================================================

rlogin - the legacy remote login tool
=====================================

The `rlogin` (remote login) program was a tool for remotely using a computer over a network. It could be used to get a command-line on a remote computer. It has since been superseded by [ssh](/ssh/). Everyone who still has `rlogin` enabled is encouraged to immediately disable it for important security reasons.

The `rlogin` tool was introduced in BSD Unix in the 1980s. It was an important tool at the time, but it suffered from several shortcomings. Its security was poor, and its usability wasn't great.

### Contents

* [Security Issues in `rlogin`](#security-issues-in-rlogin) 
* [Usability Issues in `rlogin`](#usability-issues-in-rlogin)


Security Issues in `rlogin`
---------------------------

The main problem with rlogin was that it sent user passwords over a network in the clear, without any encryption. This meant that any attacker with access to the network could read user names and passwords from the network. It only took a few hours of programming to write the software to do this, and it was commonly done. It was called [password sniffing](/attack/password-sniffing), and it was very common in the mid 1990s.

`rlogin` did support Kerberos for encryption, but at the time, Kerberos was export controlled and not widely deployed outside a few universities and government environments. Thus, in practice passwords sent using it were vulnerable.

Furthermore, `rlogin` supports `.rhosts` files for authentication. These files rely on IP addresses for authentication, and spoofing IP addresses is fairly easy. For example, any attacker on the local network can pretend to be any other host. In the past, these attacks could also be [performed remotely](http://wiki.cas.mcmaster.ca/index.php/The_Mitnick_attack) due to predictable TCP sequence numbers.

Usability Issues in `rlogin`
----------------------------

The `rlogin` program does not automatically set up the user's `DISPLAY` environment variable for running graphical applications remotely using X11. Most researchers and power users want to run programs remotely - editing, analysis/simulation tools, etc. Especially with X terminals, such use was critically important.

SSH differed from `rlogin` by setting the `DISPLAY` environment variable automatically. This simple usability improvement was one of the major reasons why universities adopted SSH early on. It was just easier to use. Easier to teach to new students. Less support required. Just easier and more cost-effective for everyone.


/. 113 [Remote Shell (RSH)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/rsh)
=========================================================

RSH - the legacy remote shell tool
==================================

The `rsh` (remote shell) program was a tool for remotely running a command on a remote computer. It has since been superceded by [ssh](/ssh/). Everyone who still has `rsh` enabled is encouraged to immediately disable it for important security reasons.

The `rsh` tool was introduced in BSD Unix in the 1980s. It was an important tool at the time, but it suffered from several shortcomings. Its security was poor, and its usability wasn't great.

### Contents

* [Security Issues in `rsh`](#security-issues-in-rsh) 
* [Usability Issues in `rsh`](#usability-issues-in-rsh)

Security Issues in `rsh`
------------------------

`rsh` used `.rhosts` files and `/etc/hosts.equiv` for authentication. These methods relied on IP addresses and DNS (Domain Name System) for authentication. However, spoofing IP addresses is fairly easy, especially if the attacker is on the local network, and at the time [it could even be done remotely](http://wiki.cas.mcmaster.ca/index.php/The_Mitnick_attack).

Furthermore, the `.rhosts` files were stored in users' home directories, which were typically stored on NFS (Network File System) volumes. The security of NFS at that time was poor (and still is, in many installations).

Usability Issues in `rsh`
-------------------------

End users commonly wanted to use `rsh` to open a terminal window in a remote computer. They then wanted to run arbitrary applications from the remote server - including editors and graphical tools. To do this, they needed to set the user's `DISPLAY` environment variable appropriately, and allow access to their local X terminal. This was cumbersome.

SSH differed from `rsh` by setting the `DISPLAY` environment variable automatically. It also automatically created secure authentication tokens for X11 authentication and did it in a way that prevented rogue servers from using those credentials after the session terminated. This was a major convenience, which helped push universities and companies into using SSH instead of `rsh`.


/. 114 [Secure File Copy (SCP)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/scp)
=========================================================

scp - Secure File Copy
======================

`scp` is a program for copying files between computers. It uses the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol). It is included by default in most Linux and Unix distributions. It is also included in the [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) and [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh) packages.

### Contents

* [Basic usage](#basic-usage) 
* [Copying directory trees with `scp`](#copying-directory-trees-with-scp) 
* [Configuring public key authentication](#configuring-public-key-authentication)

Basic usage
-----------

The basic usage of `scp` is as follows:

    scp file host:path

This copies the file to the remote host. The destination `path` is optional, but can be a directory on the server, or even a file name if copying a single file. It is possible to specify multiple files; the last one is the destination.

To copy a file from the remote host, use:

    scp host:file path

This fetches the file from the host, and puts it in the directory indicated by `path`. Often, `path` is just `.`, meaning the current working directory.

Copying directory trees with `scp`
----------------------------------

To cpoy entire directory trees instead of single files, add the `-r` option. For example:

    scp -r host:path/directory .

This would fetch `path/directory` from the host, copying it to the current working directory (creating `directory` in current working directory).


Configuring public key authentication
-------------------------------------

Normally, `scp` asks for a password. To avoid this, or to automate file copying in scripts, public key authentication is usually used.

The basic idea is to create a key pair on the client and copy the public key to the server into an [authorized keys file](/ssh/authorized_keys). See [how to set up public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication).

Don't forget to establish proper SSH key management practices. See [how to manage SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management).


/. 115 [Session Key](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/session-key)
=========================================================

Session Key
===========

In [cryptographic protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol), a session key is a cryptographic key that is used for encrypting the bulk of transmitted data and ensuring integrity of the data.

### Contents

* [Key Exchange](#key-exchange) 
* [Perfect Forward Secrecy](#perfect-forward-secrecy) 
* [SSH Key Management and Access](#ssh-key-management-and-access)


Key Exchange
------------

Most cryptographic protocols, such as [SSH](/ssh/) utilize a key exchange algorithm for deriving unique keys for each session or connection. Typical key exchange algorithms include [Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) and [elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman).

Algorithms such as Diffie-Hellman can generate a shared secret that is only known to the communicating parties, and not to a passive eavesdropper. However, such algorithms are vulnerable to [man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle), which allows an active attacker to pretend to be the other side to each communicating party, sitting in the middle, basially establishing a separate session with each party.

To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, key exchange typically includes some kind of authentication. The authentication is generally a digital signature of all data exchanged during the key exchange as seen by the signing party. The data (or [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) of it) is then signed by some shared secret - typically a [private key](/cryptography/private-key). The other end verifies the signature using a [public key](/cryptography/public-key) and makes sure the signed values how it saw the exchanged data.

Some kind of shared key pair or shared secret is generally needed to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

Perfect Forward Secrecy
-----------------------

[Perfect forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy) means that compromise of long-term keys (e.g., [host keys](/ssh/host-key)) does not compromise session keys. In other words, an attacker who breaks into the server is not able to decrypt earlier sessions.

The [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) provides perfect forward secrecy by using Diffie-Hellman or elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman for every session. This differs from [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), that is usually configured without perfect forward secrecy, even though the standard does support it.

SSH Key Management and Access
-----------------------------

[Managing SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management/) is important to ensure host keys are properly up to date (to prevent [man-in-the-middle](/attack/man-in-the-middle) attacks) and to ensure that user authentication using [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) is properly under control.

[Authorized keys](/academy/ssh/authorized-key) and [identity keys](/ssh/identity-key) grant access, and managing them is an important part of [identity and access management](/iam/identity-management). In some organizations, SSH keys constitute more than 90% of all access credentials.

=========================================================

ssh-agent: How to configure ssh-agent, agent forwarding, & agent protocol
=========================================================================

The `ssh-agent` is a helper program that keeps track of users' [identity keys](/ssh/identity-key) and their [passphrases](/ssh/passphrase). The agent can then use the keys to log into other servers without having the user type in a password or passphrase again. This implements a form of single sign-on (SSO).

The SSH agent is used for [SSH public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication). It uses [SSH keys](/ssh/key) for authentication. Users can create SSH keys using the [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen) command and install them on servers using the [ssh-copy-id](/ssh/copy-id) command.

Starting `ssh-agent`
--------------------

On most Linux systems, `ssh-agent` is automatically configured and run at login, and no additional actions are required to use it. However, an [SSH key](/ssh/key) must still be created for the user.

If `ssh-agent` is not automatically started at login, it can be started manually with the command

    eval `ssh-agent`

The `ssh-agent` command outputs commands to set certain environment variables in the shell. The commands output by default are compatible with `/bin/sh` and `/bin/bash`. To output commands for the C-shell (`/bin/csh` or `/bin/tcsh`), add `-c`.

The easiest way to check is to check the value of the `SSH_AGENT_SOCK` environment variable. If it is set, then the agent is presumably running. It can be checked by

    echo $SSH_AGENT_SOCK

Also, to allow key-based logins to servers, [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) must be enabled on the server. In [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) it is enabled by default. It is controlled by the `PubkeyAuthentication` option in [sshd_config](/ssh/sshd_config/).

Adding SSH keys to the Agent
----------------------------

By default, the agent uses SSH keys stored in the `.ssh` directory under the user's home directory. The [ssh-add](/ssh/add) command is used for adding identities to the agent. In the simplest form, just run if without argument to add the default files `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `.ssh/id_dsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, and `~/.ssh/identity`. Otherwise, give it the name of the private key file to add as an argument.

The following command will list private keys currently accessible to the agent:

    ssh-add -l

SSH Agent Forwarding
--------------------

Furthermore, the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) implements _agent forwarding_, a mechanism whereby an [SSH client](/ssh/client) allows an [SSH server](/ssh/server) to use the local `ssh-agent` on the server the user logs into, as if it was local there. When the user uses an SSH client on the server, the client will try to contact the agent implemented by the server, and the server then forwards the request to the client that originally contacted the server, which further forwards it to the local agent. This way, `ssh-agent` and agent forwarding implement single sign-on that can progress transitively.

A wonderful feature of the single sign-on provided by SSH is that it works independent of organizational boundaries and geography. You can easily implement single sign-on to servers on the other side of the world, in cloud services, or at customer premises. No central coordination is needed.

To use agent forwarding, the `ForwardAgent` option must be set to `yes` on the client (see [ssh_config](/ssh/config/)) and the `AllowAgentForwarding` option must be set to `yes` on the server (see [sshd_config](/ssh/sshd_config/)).


Running `ssh-agent`
-------------------

The `ssh-agent` command is usually run from initialization scripts at login, such as from `/etc/X11/Xsession.d/90x11-common_ssh-agent` on Linux Mint LMDE. Alternatively, any user can configure it to be run from, e.g., the user's `~/.xsession` file or `~/.profile`.

The agent outputs environment variable settings that this puts in place. The `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable is set to point to a unix-domain socket used for communicating with the agent, and the `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment variable is set to the process ID of the agent. To get the environment variables set in the user's shell environment, the agent is usually run with something like the following:

    eval `ssh-agent`

The `ssh-agent` command accepts the following options:

**-a bind_address**

Forces to bind the Unix domain socket to the given file path, instead of the default socket.

**-c**

Forces generation of C-shell commands on stdout. By default the shell is automatically detected.

**-d**

Enables debug mode.

**-E fingerprint_hash** Specifies which algorithm to use for generating SSH key fingerprints. Valid values include `md5` and `sha256`.

**-k**

Kills the currently running agent.

**-s**

Forces generation of Bourne shell (`/bin/sh`) commands on stdout. By default the shell is automatically detected.

**-t life**

Specifies a maximum number of seconds that identities are kept in the agent. The value is in seconds, but can be suffixed by `m` for minutes, `h` for hours, `d` for days, and `w` for weeks. Without this option, the agent keeps the keys in its memory as long as it runs. This can be overridden when running the [ssh-add](/ssh/add) command.

=========================================================

SSH Command - Usage, Options, Configuration
===========================================

This page is about the OpenSSH `ssh` command on Unix/Linux or the Mac terminal. For general information about SSH and other implementations, see the [SSH protocol home page](/ssh/).

Practically every Unix and Linux system includes the `ssh` command. This command is used to start the SSH client program that enables secure connection to the SSH server on a remote machine. The `ssh` command is used from logging into the remote machine, transferring files between the two machines, and for executing commands on the remote machine.

SSH Command in Linux
--------------------

The `ssh` command provides a secure encrypted connection between two hosts over an insecure network. This connection can also be used for terminal access, file transfers, and for tunneling other applications. Graphical X11 applications can also be run securely over SSH from a remote location.

Other SSH Commands
------------------

There are other SSH commands besides the client `ssh`. Each has its own page.

*   [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen) - creates a key pair for public key authentication
    
*   [ssh-copy-id](/ssh/copy-id) - configures a public key as authorized on a server
    
*   [ssh-agent](/ssh/agent) - agent to hold private key for single sign-on
    
*   [ssh-add](/ssh/add) - tool to add a key to the agent
    
*   [scp](/ssh/scp) - file transfer client with RCP-like command interface
    
*   [sftp](/ssh/sftp) - file transfer client with FTP-like command interface
    
*   [sshd](/ssh/sshd) - OpenSSH server
    

Using the Linux client
----------------------

Linux typically uses the [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh) client. The ssh command to log into a remote machine is very simple. To log in to a remote computer called **sample.ssh.com**, type the following command at a shell prompt:

    ssh sample.ssh.com

If this is the first time you use ssh to connect to this remote machine, you will see a message like:

    The authenticity of host 'sample.ssh.com' cannot be established.

    DSA key fingerprint is 04:48:30:31:b0:f3:5a:9b:01:9d:b3:a7:38:e2:b1:0c.

    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

Type `yes` to continue. This will add the server to your list of known hosts (`~/.ssh/known_hosts`) as seen in the following message:

    Warning: Permanently added 'sample.ssh.com' (DSA) to the list of known hosts.

Each server has a [host key](/ssh/host-key), and the above question related to verifying and saving the host key, so that next time you connect to the server, it can verify that it actually is the same server.

Once the server connection has been established, the user is authenticated. Typically, it asks for a password. For some servers, you may be required to type in a one-time password generated by a special hardware token.

Once authentication has been accepted, you will be at the shell prompt for the remote machine.

Specifying a different user name
--------------------------------

It is also possible to use a different username at the remote machine by entering the command as:

    ssh alternative-username@sample.ssh.com

The above can also be expressed with the syntax:

    ssh -l alternative-username sample.ssh.com

Executing remote commands on the server
---------------------------------------

The ssh command is often also used to remotely execute commands on the remote machine without logging in to a shell prompt. The syntax for this is:

    ssh hostname command

For example, to execute the command:

    ls /tmp/doc 

on host **sample.ssh.com**, type the following command at a shell prompt:

    ssh sample.ssh.com  ls /tmp/doc

After authenticating to the remote server, the contents of the remote directory will be displayed, and you will return to your local shell prompt. **-x** Disables X11 forwarding.

SSH client configuration file
-----------------------------

The `ssh` command reads its configuration from the SSH client configuration file `~/.ssh/config`. For more information, see the page on [SSH client configuration file](/ssh/config).

Configuring public key authentication 
-------------------

To configure passwordless [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication), you may want to create an [SSH key](/ssh/key) and set up an [authorized_keys](/ssh/authorized_keys) file. See the pages on [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen) and [ssh-copy-id](/ssh/copy-id) for more information.

Configuring port forwarding
---------------------------

Command-line options can be used to set up port forwarding. Local fowarding means that a local port (at the client computer) is tunneled to an IP address and port from the server. Remote forwarding means that a remote port (at the server computer) is forwarded to a given IP address and port from the client machine. See the page on [configuring port forwarding](/ssh/tunneling/example) on how to configure them.

OpenSSH also supports forwarding Unix domain sockets and IP packets from a tunnel device to establish a VPN (Virtual Private Network).

SSH command line options
------------------------

Some of the most important command-line options for the OpenSSH client are:

**-1** Use protocol version 1 only.

**-2** Use protocol version 2 only.

**-4** Use IPv4 addresses only.

**-6** Use IPv6 addresses only.

**-A** Enable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

**-a** Disable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

**-C** Use data compression

**-c cipher_spec** Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.

**-D** `**[bind_address:]**`**port** Dynamic application-level port forwarding. This allocates a socket to listen to port on the local side. When a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.

**-E log_file** Append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error.

**-F configfile** Specifies a per-user configuration file. The default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.

**-g** Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.

**-i identity_file** A file from which the [identity key](/ssh/identity-key) (private key) for [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) is read.

**-J** `**[user@]**`**host**`**[:port]**` Connect to the target host by first making a ssh connection to the pjump host\[(/iam/jump-host) and then establishing a [TCP forwarding](/ssh/tunneling/example) to the ultimate destination from there.

**-l login_name** Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.

**-p port** Port to connect to on the remote host.

**-q** Quiet mode.

**-V** Display the version number.

**-v** Verbose mode.

**-X** Enables X11 forwarding.

A little history
----------------

SSH replaced several older commands and protocols in Unix and Linux the 1990s. The include [telnet](/ssh/telnet), [rlogin](/ssh/rlogin), and [rsh](/ssh/rsh).

SSH runs at TCP/IP port 22. This is right between [ftp](/ssh/telnet) and telnet, which are 20 years older. Read the story of [how SSH got port 22](/ssh/port).

The following video summarizes how and why SSH was originally developed.

/. 118 [SSH Configuration](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config)
=========================================================

SSH config file for OpenSSH client
==================================

This page is about OpenSSH client configuration. For OpenSSH server configuration, see [sshd_config](/ssh/sshd_config). For Tectia SSH configuration, see [Tectia SSH Server Administrator Manual](https://www.ssh.com/manuals/server-admin/). For configuring passwordless public key authentication, see [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen).

The [ssh](/ssh/) program on a host receives its configuration from either the command line or from configuration files `~/.ssh/config` and `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`.

[Command-line](/ssh/command) options take precedence over configuration files. The user-specific configuration file `~/.ssh/config` is used next. Finally, the global `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` file is used. The first obtained value for each configuration parameter will be used.

* [Format of SSH client config file `ssh_config`](#format-of-ssh-client-config-file-ssh_config) 
* [Listing of client configuration options](#listing-of-client-configuration-options)

Commonly used configuration options
-----------------------------------

There are many configuration options available. In practice, only a few of them are ever changed, and user-specific configuration files are rarely used. In most cases, just `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` is edited.

### Enabling X11 forwarding and agent forwarding

Developers, students, and researchers often want to enable X11 forwarding and SSH agent forwarding. These allow running graphical applications remotely and eliminate the need for typing a password whenever moving from one server to another, respectively. Setting these options in `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` makes life easier for end users, saves overhead, and reduces support load. However, they increase the risk of an attack spreading from a compromised server to a user's desktop, so the most security-critical environments may want to leave them disabled. There is generally no reason to enable them on production servers in enterprises.

    ForwardAgent yes ForwardX11 yes

### Port forwarding

Local and remote port forwarding can be used for tunneling applications, accessing intranet web services from home, tunneling database access, and many other purposes. For instructions on configuring port forwarding, see the [port forwarding configuration page](/ssh/tunneling/example). Note, however, that port forwarding can also be used to tunnel traffic from the external Internet into a corporate intranet. Employees sometimes do this to be able to work from home even when company policy does not permit it. Hackers use it to leave permanent backdoor. See the page on [SSH tunneling](/ssh/tunneling) for more information.

### Configuring public key authentication

Public authentication is used for passwordless logins between systems. It is often used for automated processes, such as backups, configuration management, and file transfers. It is also used by sophisticated end users and system administrators for single sign-on. See the [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) for configuring it.

When a user has created more than one [SSH key](/ssh/key) for authentication, the `-i` command line option may be helpful for specifying which key to use. In the client configuration file, this can be specified using the `IdentityFile` options.

### Certificate-based authentication

OpenSSH certificates can be used for authentication either using [ssh-agent](/ssh/agent) or by specifying the `CertificateFile` option in the client configuration file. See [SSH certificates](/ssh/certificate) for more information.

Format of SSH client config file `ssh_config`
---------------------------------------------

The `ssh_config` client configuration file has the following format. Both the global `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` and per-user `~/ssh/config` have the same format.

*   Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are comments.
    
*   Each line begins with a keyword, followed by argument(s).
    
*   Configuration options may be separated by whitespace or optional whitespace and exactly one =.
    
*   Arguments may be enclosed in double quotes (") in order to specify arguments that contain spaces.
    

Listing of client configuration options 
-------------------

The following keywords can be used in SSH client configuration files. Keywords are case-insensitive and arguments are case-sensitive. Any algorithm or method names that include an at sign (@) are for experimental use only and not recommended for production.

**Host**

Restricts the following declarations to be only for those hosts that match one of the patterns given after the keyword. The pattern is matched against the host name given on the command line.

**Match**

Restricts the following declarations to apply only for hosts that match the specified criteria. For detailed information, see [SSH man page](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man5/ssh_config.5).

**AddressFamily**

Specifies which address family to use when connecting. Valid arguments are: `any`, `inet`, `inet6`.

**BatchMode**

If set to `yes`, passphrase/password querying will be disabled. This is useful for running the ssh client from shell script that do not have an interactive user, and prevents accidentally blocking on a password prompt.

**BindAddress**

Specifies to use the specified address on the local machine as the source address of the connection.

**ChallengeResponseAuthentication**

Specifies whether to use challenge-response authentication. This is mostly a legacy method and has been replaced by `KbdInteractiveAuthentication`.

**CheckHostIP**

Directs ssh to additionally check the host IP address in the `known_hosts` file.

**Cipher**

Specifies the cipher to use for encrypting the session in protocol version 1. Note that use of protocol 1 is not recommended.

**Ciphers**

Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol version 2 in order of preference. Multiple ciphers must be comma-separated. The `ssh -Q cipher` command can be used to query supported ciphers. The following list is supported in [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) 6.7:

    3des-cbc blowfish-cbc cast128-cbc arcfour arcfour128 arcfour256 aes128-cbc aes192-cbc aes256-cbc

    rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se aes128-ctr aes192-ctr aes256-ctr aes128-gcm@openssh.com

    aes256-gcm@openssh.com chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com

**ClearAllForwardings**

Specifies that all local, remote, and dynamic port forwardings specified in the configuration files or on the command line be cleared.

**Compression**

Specifies whether to use compression. `yes` enables compression.

**CompressionLevel**

Specifies the compression level to use if compression is enabled.

**ConnectionAttempts**

Specifies the number of attempts to make before exiting.

**ConnectTimeout**

Specifies the timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the SSH server, instead of using the default system TCP timeout.

**ControlMaster**

Enables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single network connection.

**ControlPath**

Specify the path to the control socket used for connection sharing as described in the ControlMaster section above or the string `none` to disable connection sharing.

**DynamicForward**

Specifies that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded over the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.

**EscapeChar**

Sets the escape character.

**ExitOnForwardFailure**

Specifies whether ssh should terminate the connection if it cannot set up all requested dynamic, tunnel, local, and remote port forwardings.

**ForwardAgent**

Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent will be forwarded to the remote machine.

**ForwardX11**

Specifies whether X11 connections will be automatically redirected over the secure channel and DISPLAY set.

**ForwardX11Trusted**

If this option is set to `yes`, remote X11 clients will have full access to the original X11 display.

**GatewayPorts**

Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to local forwarded ports.

**GlobalKnownHostsFile**

Specifies a file to use for the global host key database instead of `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts`.

**GSSAPIAuthentication**

Specifies whether user authentication based on [GSSAPI](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2743) is allowed. GSSAPI is typically used for Kerberos authentication, e.g., with [Active Directory](/iam/active-directory/).

**GSSAPIKeyExchange**

Specifies whether key exchange based on GSSAPI may be used.

**GSSAPIClientIdentity**

If set, specifies the GSSAPI client identity that ssh should use when connecting to the server.

**GSSAPIDelegateCredentials**

Forward (delegate) credentials to the server.

**GSSAPIRenewalForcesRekey**

If set to `yes` then renewal of the client's GSSAPI credentials will force the rekeying of the ssh connection.

**GSSAPITrustDns**

Set to `yes` to indicate that the DNS is trusted to securely canonicalize the name of the host being connected to. If `no`, the hostname entered on the command line will be passed untouched to the GSSAPI library.

**HashKnownHosts**

Indicates that ssh should hash host names and addresses when they are added to `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. These hashed names may be used normally by [ssh](/ssh/client) and [sshd](/ssh/sshd/), but they do not reveal identifying information should the file's contents be disclosed.

**HostbasedAuthentication**

Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with public key authentication, using the `.rhosts` or `.shosts` files in the user's home directory and `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `/etc/shosts.equiv` in global configuration.

**HostKeyAlgorithms**

Specifies the protocol version 2 host key algorithms that the client wants to use in order of preference. The following values are supported in [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh) 6.7:

ssh-ed25519 ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com ssh-rsa ssh-dss ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 ecdsa-sha2-nistp384 ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com ssh-dss-cert-v01@openssh.com ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com ssh-rsa-cert-v00@openssh.com ssh-dss-cert-v00@openssh.com

**HostKeyAlias**

Specifies an alias that should be used instead of the real host name when looking up or saving the host key in the host key database files.

**HostName**

Specifies the real host name to log into. This can be used to specify nicknames or abbreviations for hosts. The default is the name given on the command line. Numeric IP addresses are also permitted (both on the command line and in HostName specifications).

**IdentitiesOnly**

Specifies that ssh should only use the [identity keys](/ssh/identity-key) configured in the `ssh_config` files, even if [ssh-agent](/ssh/agent) offers more identities.

**IdentityFile**

Specifies a file from which the user's [identity key](/ssh/identity-key) is read when using [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication). The default for protocol version 1 is `~/.ssh/identity`; and `~/.ssh/id_rsa` or `~/.ssh/id_dsa` for protocol version 2.

**KbdInteractiveAuthentication**

Specifies whether to use keyboard-interactive authentication. This is a common method for password authentication, one-time passwords, and multi-factor authentication.

**KbdInteractiveDevices**

Specifies the list of methods to use in keyboard-interactive authentication.

**LocalCommand**

Specifies a command to execute on the local machine after successfully connecting to the server.

**LocalForward**

Specifies that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded over the secure channel to the specified host and port from the remote machine. The first argument must be `[bind_address:]port` and the second argument must be `host:port`.

**LogLevel**

Specifies the verbosity level of logging messages from ssh. The possible values are: `QUIET`, `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `INFO`, `VERBOSE`, `DEBUG`, `DEBUG1`, `DEBUG2`, and `DEBUG3`.

**MACs**

Specifies the MAC (message authentication code) algorithms in order of preference. The `ssh -Q mac` command can be used to query supported MAC algorithms. The following list is supported in [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) 6.7:

    hmac-sha1 hmac-sha1-96 hmac-sha2-256 hmac-sha2-512 hmac-md5 hmac-md5-96 hmac-ripemd160 

    hmac-ripemd160@openssh.com umac-64@openssh.com umac-128@openssh.com hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com

    hmac-sha1-96-etm@openssh.com hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com

    hmac-md5-etm@openssh.com hmac-md5-96-etm@openssh.com hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh.com umac-64-etm@openssh.com

    umac-128-etm@openssh.com

**NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost**

This option can be used if the home directory is shared across machines. In this case localhost will refer to a different machine on each of the machines and the user will get many warnings about changed host keys.

**PreferredAuthentications**

Specifies the order in which the client should try protocol 2 authentication methods.

**Protocol**

Specifies the protocol versions in order of preference. The possible values are '1' and '2'. Multiple versions must be comma-separated. Use of protocol version 1 is NOT RECOMMENDED for security reasons. There is reason to believe it may be susceptible to [man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle).

**ProxyCommand**

Specifies the command to use to connect to the server. The [SSH client](/ssh/client) communicates with the proxy command using its standard input and standard output, and the proxy command should pass the communication to an [SSH server](/ssh/server).

**PubkeyAuthentication**

Specifies whether to try [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) using [SSH keys](/ssh/key). Valid values are `yes` and `no`. When public key authentication is used in a production environment, a proper [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management) system should also be put in place.

**RemoteForward**

Specifies that a TCP port on the remote machine be forwarded over the secure channel to the specified host and port from the local machine. The first argument must be: `[bind_address:]port` and the second argument must be `host:port`. SSH tunneling is a powerful tool, but see [security considerations on SSH tunneling](/ssh/tunneling).

**RhostsRSAAuthentication**

Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with RSA host authentication. This is for protocol version 1 only and is deprecated.

**RSAAuthentication**

Specifies whether to try RSA authentication. This is for protocol version 1 only and is deprecated.

**SendEnv**

Specifies what environment variables should be sent to the server.

**ServerAliveCountMax**

Sets the number of keepalive messages that may be sent by the client without the client receiving any messages back from the server. When this threshold is reached the client will terminate the session.

**ServerAliveInterval**

Specifies interval for sending keepalive messages to the server. The messages are sent through the encrypted channel, and serve to detect if the server has crashed or the network has gone down.

**SmartcardDevice**

Specifies which smartcard device to use.

**StrictHostKeyChecking**

Specifies if ssh should never automatically add host keys to the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file, and refuses to connect to hosts whose host key has changed.

**TCPKeepAlive**

Specifies whether to send TCP keepalives to the other side. These operate on the level of the TCP protocol. Sending keepalives helps properly close the socket when the network or server goes down. On the other hand, without it, the connection may stay alive and any windows open, even if the network is down for a while.

**Tunnel**

If `yes`, request `tun` device forwarding between the client and the server. This used for implementing a VPN over SSH.

**TunnelDevice**

Specifies the tun devices to open on the client (**local_tun**) and the server (**remote_tun**).

**UsePrivilegedPort**

Specifies whether or not to use a privileged port for outgoing connections. The client must run as [root](/iam/user/root) to use a privileged port. A privileged port is required for host-based authentication.

**UserKnownHostsFile**

Specifies a file to use for per-user known host key database instead of the default `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

**VerifyHostKeyDNS**

Specifies whether to verify the remote key using DNS and [SSHFP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4255) resource records.

**VisualHostKey**

Specifies whether an ASCII art representation of the remote host key fingerprint is printed in addition to the hex fingerprint string at login and for unknown host keys.

====================================================

Microsoft Windows is the world's most popular operating system. In its different versions it is used extensively in practically every corporation - both on the users' desktops and in the servers of computing centers.

The lack of a native [SSH](/ssh/) for Windows is perhaps the most serious shortcoming of the world’s most popular operating system. The need has been recognized also by [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) (in their [blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2015/10/19/openssh-for-windows-update)). However, the Microsoft implementation is apparently only a command-line client.

SSH Windows Servers
-------------------

Windows servers require an SSH server to be installed to allow secure remote login, secure file transfers, and automated remote command execution. There are several SSH server implementations available.

[Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) is the leading Windows [SSH server](/ssh/server) implementation. Other implementations are available from companies such as Bitvise, and community project teams such as [FileZilla](/ssh/filezilla/) (for file transfers only). Microsoft has announced their plan of making a port of [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) available in Windows. SSH is used in practically all corporate networks for securing remote management, file transfers, and automated tasks.

The announcement of the upcoming OpenSSH support for Windows [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview) was given in mid 2015, and the target date for software availability was in mid 2016. See Microsoft blog for details: [OpenSSH support announcement](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2015/06/03/looking-forward-microsoft-support-for-secure-shell-ssh) and [Windows Support Announcement](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2015/10/19/openssh-for-windows-update).

Unlike the open source alternatives Tectia SSH Windows server comes with professional support services, and fully supports advances security features such as certificate authentication and [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/).

SSH Windows Clients
-------------------

There are a number of free and commercial SSH clients available for Windows:

*   [Download free SSH client](/ssh/download/)
    
*   [Tectia SSH, with 24x7 support and certificate support](/products/tectia-ssh/)
    
*   [PuTTY](/ssh/putty/download)
    
*   [FileZilla](/ssh/filezilla/)
    

For brief introductions of different alternatives, see our [SSH client page](/ssh/client). There is also an extensive SSH client comparison page on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_clients).


Key Management for Windows SSH Servers
--------------------------------------

While SSH is everywhere and its deployments are still growing in the on-premises and cloud environments, there is an aspect of SSH that requires attention in most enterprise environments.

The [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) uses [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) for authenticating servers and users (in both interactive and machine-to-machine cases). The numbers of these keys are such that manual management of them is unfeasible in larger environments. Yet the SSH keys are access credentials, comparable to passwords, and grant (often privileged) access to resources. [Management of SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management/) is a necessity for security and regulatory compliance alike. [Universal SSH Key Manager®](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) is the best solution for managing SSH keys and access in enterprise networks - on-premise or in the cloud.

SSH Key Management Problem in Enterprise Networks
-------------------------------------------------

By default [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) allows any user to provision permanent SSH keys for future access. Even though they are critically important access credentials they are rarely under the control of corporate IT. They have traditionally been ignored in enterprise [identity and access management](/iam/identity-management) and related policies. This has led to what IDC calls [A gaping hole in your IAM strategy”](//info.ssh.com/a-gaping-hole-in-your-identity-and-access-management-strategy-secure-shell-access-controls). It is clear that the situation cannot continue.

[Managing SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management/) as part of the corporate [identity and access management](/iam/identity-management) strategy is necessary for regulatory compliance with [Sarbanes-Oxley](/compliance/sarbanes-oxley/), [HIPAA](/compliance/hipaa/security-rule), [PCI DSS](/compliance/pci), [FISMA/NIST 800-53](/compliance/nist-800-53/), and the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](/compliance/cybersecurity-framework/). It also reduces financial and reputation risks and helps ensure business continuity. Automating SSH key management can also save millions of dollars in operational costs annually in larger organizations.

SSH Server
==========

SSH is a protocol for securely exchanging data between two computers over an untrusted network. SSH protects the privacy and integrity of the transferred identities, data, and files. It runs in most computers and in practically every server. It ships standard on UNIX, Linux, and macOS machines and it is used in over 90% of all data centers in the world.

The [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) and [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) secure hundreds of millions of maintenance sessions, file transfers, and [automated](/ssh/automated) processes - every day.

* [Standardized Security](#standardized-security)

How Does SSH Server Work?
-------------------------

The SSH protocol works on the client/server-model. The SSH client always initiates the setup of the secure connection, and the SSH server listens for incoming connection requests (usually on TCP port 22 on the host system) and responds to them.

In the connection setup phase, the SSH server authenticates itself to the client by providing its public key. This allows the SSH client to verify that it is actually communicating with the correct SSH server (instead of an attacker that could be posing as the server).

After a successful authentication the server provides the client access to the host system. This access is governed with the user account permissions at the target host system.

The secure connection between the client and the server is used for remote system administration, remote command execution, file transfers, and securing the traffic of other applications. [Automated SSH](/ssh/automated) sessions are very often used as a part of many automated processes that perform tasks such as logfile collection, archiving, networked backups, and other critical system level tasks.


Availability of SSH Servers
---------------------------

Most server operating systems come with a native, preinstalled SSH server implementation. Those that are an exception to the rule are usually installed with an SSH server from a trusted security solution vendor, such as SSH Communications Security, Bitvise, or VanDyke Software. These companies sell SSH software and provide the technical support and maintenance services for it. The open source community maintains the OpenSSH project that provides a free to use, non-commercial SSH implementation.

[Tectia SSH - Enterprise Grade SSH Clients and Servers - From the Inventors of the Protocol =button btn-success](/products/tectia-ssh/)

Quality Equals Security
-----------------------

As security software, the SSH server has strict requirements for software quality. The SSH server process executes with wide system privileges, and acts as an access control "gatekeeper" to the host system. This makes the SSH server an attractive target for hackers and malware. The pivotal security role of the SSH server places stringent requirements for its code quality and reliability. Bugs and defects in the code can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.

Standardized Security
---------------------

The SSH protocol has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force ([IETF](https://ietf.org)). The standards are open and were authored as a joint effort by many security specialists and companies. As the original inventor of the protocol, SSH Communications Security was a key contributor in the standardization effort.


/. 123 [SSH Server Configuration](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sshd_config)
=========================================================

sshd_config - How to Configure the OpenSSH Server?
===================================================

_This page is about configuring the OpenSSH server. For Tectia SSH, see_ [_Tectia SSH Server Administrator Manual_](/manuals/)_. For configuring public key authentication, see_ [_ssh-keygen_](/ssh/keygen)_. For configuring authorized keys for public key authentication, see_ [_authorized_keys_](/ssh/authorized_keys)_._

The OpenSSH server reads a configuration file when it is started. Usually, this file is `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, but the location can be changed using the `-f` command line option when starting [sshd](/ssh/sshd). Some organizations run multiple SSH servers at different port numbers, specifying a different configuration file for each server using this option.

The default values for certain configuration options in OpenSSH are quite restrictive and often need to be changed. Usually this is done by editing the default configuration file to change just a few options.

Relationship of configuration files
-----------------------------------

The SSH server actually reads several configuration files. The `sshd_config` file specifies the locations of one or more [host key](/ssh/host-key) files (mandatory) and the location of [authorized_keys](/ssh/authorized_keys) files for users. It may also refer to a number of other files.

![sshd config-ssh-config](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/sshd_config-ssh-config-2.png)

Common configuration options for individual use
-----------------------------------------------

Many individual developers and power users wish to maximize their convenience rather than go for maximum security. For such use, we recommend the following settings for homes, development servers, and universities. For important systems even such organizations should follow the guidelines for configuring enterprise servers.

    X11Forwarding yes AllowAgentForwarding yes PermitRootLogin yes

Common configuration changes for the enterprise
-----------------------------------------------

Larger enterprises, or others wanting to run a tight security policy for certain servers, may want to configure the following configuration options.

### Cryptographic policy

Symmetric algorithms for encrypting the bulk of transferred data are configured using the `Ciphers` option. A good value is `aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr`. This should also provide good interoperability.

Host key algorithms are selected by the `HostKeyAlgorithms` option. A good value is `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,ssh-rsa,ss`/ssh/sshd_config/`h-dss`.

Key exchange algorithms are selected by the `KexAlgorithms` option. We recommend `ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256`. In particular, we do not recommend allowing `diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`, unless needed for compatibility. It uses a 768 bit prime number, which is too small by today's standards and may be breakable by intelligence agencies in real time. Using it could expose connections to [man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle) when faced with such adversaries.

Message authentication code algorithms are configured using the `MACs` option. A good value is `hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha1`.

We have included the [sha-1](/cryptography/) algorithm in the above sets only for compatibility. Its use is questionable from a security perspective. If it is not needed for compatibility, we recommend disabling it. NIST has also issued [guidance on it](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/policy.html).

    Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr

    HostKeyAlgorithms ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,ssh-rsa,ssh-dss

    KexAlgorithms ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,

    diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256

    MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha1

Some organizations may also want to set policy for `PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes`. Same value as for `HostKeyAlgorithms` would make sense. However, restricting this value could abruptly break business-critical connections, and we recommend only setting it after analyzing all existing authorized keys for the algorithms they use.

### Verbose logging

It is strongly recommended that `LogLevel` be set to `VERBOSE`. This way, the key fingerprint for any [SSH key](/ssh/key) used for login is logged. This information is important for [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management), especially in legacy environments.

    LogLevel VERBOSE

**Note:** the newer OpenSSH releases do not need a verbose mode setting anymore as the required SSH key activity information is written into the syslog by the default OpenSSH config.

### AuthorizedKeysFile location

Historically, most organizations have not touched the location of the [authorized keys files](/ssh/authorized_keys). This means they are in each user's home directory, and each user can configure additional permanent credentials for themselves and their friends. They can also add additional permanent credentials for any service account or root account they are able to log into. This has lead to massive problems in large organizations around managing SSH keys.

We **strongly** recommend that organizations establish proper life cycle management for key-based credentials, and set the related options as part of this process. See [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management) and [contact us](/about/contact) for additional help.

    AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized-keys/%u

Enterprises should also pay attention to the `AuthorizedKeysCommand` and `AuthorizedKeysCommandUser` options. They are typically used when SELinux is enabled and to fetch SSH keys from LDAP directories or other data sources. Their use can make auditing SSH keys cumbersome and they can be used to hide backdoor keys from casual observation.

### Root login

For enterprise use, root access should generally go through a privileged access management system. This is necessary to enable auditing. A privilege escalation method such as [sudo](/iam/sudo) may then be used to execute commands as root. Ideally, the [root](/iam/user/root) account will not have any password at all. (See also [PrivX](/products/privx/) for eliminating all admin account passwords.)

However, many organizations need to allow scripts to run commands as root using SSH keys. With proper [SSH key lifecycle management](/iam/ssh-key-management), this is the recommended way to script access. We furthermore recommend setting a [forced command](/ssh/authorized_keys) for any key configured to allow access as root. This can be enforced using the configuration file.

To disable passwords for root, but still allow key-based access without forced command, use:

    PermitRootLogin prohibit-password

To disable passwords and only allow key-based access with a forced command, use:

    PermitRootLogin forced-commands-only

We also need to point out that we have seen some organizations use forced commands that in practice allow the client to run any command, just to nominally satisfy a policy/audit requirement that all keys must have forced commands. Forced commands must be EFFECTIVE. In general, the forced command should make no reference to the `SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND` environment-variable. Auditors should check for this; if the forced command does reference this, odds are 99% that the forced command has been intentionally designed to fool auditors.

### Login banner

Many enterprises, especially in the government, may want to print a login banner with legal warnings before asking for a password. The `Banner` option does this. If this option is specified, the contents of the file will be printed to the client before login.

    Banner /etc/banner

### Port forwarding

Enterprises would generally want to prevent [port forwarding](/ssh/tunneling/) on their servers, unless expressly needed for tunneling legacy applications. There is substantial risk that users will use SSH tunneling to open backdoors into the organization through the firewall to get access to work machines from home. We've seen this done in numerous organizations and the technique is widely known.

Even if port forwarding is disabled, there is still the possibility of a user running their own SSH server or having their own laptop run one.

    AllowTcpForwarding no AllowStreamLocalForwarding no GatewayPorts no PermitTunnel no

### Certificate-based authentication

OpenSSH also supports its own certificate formats for host and user authentication. See [PrivX Zero Trust Access Management Solution](/products/privx/) for how to use these for privileged access without passwords and automated access without SSH keys, based on Active Directory roles.

In host authentication, host certificates can be a major convenience. [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) supports standards-based X.509 certificates for this. OpenSSH requires its own [certificate authority](/pki/) and secure certification authorities for it are not yet commercially available as of this writing. Therefore we don't recommend using OpenSSH certificates quite yet.

See [OpenSSH certificates](/ssh/certificate) for more information on OpenSSH certificates and how to configure them and what is available for issuing them.

Detailed `sshd_config` file format 
-------------------

The `sshd_config` file is an ASCII text based file where the different configuration options of the SSH server are indicated and configured with keyword/argument pairs. Arguments that contain spaces are to be enclosed in double quotes (").

In the `sshd_config` file the keywords are case-insensitive while arguments are case-sensitive.

Each line that starts with '#' is interpreted as a comment.

The following is a list of some of the most commonly used `sshd_config` keywords. Full listing of all available configuration options can be found on the [sshd Config Manual Pages](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?sshd_config(5)).[](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?sshd_config(5))

The default is `no`.

**HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly**

Specifies whether or not the server will attempt to perform a reverse name lookup when matching the name in the `~/.shosts`, `~/.rhosts`, and `/etc/hosts.equiv` files during host-based authentication.

**HostKey**

Specifies a file containing a private host key used by SSH. It is possible to have multiple host key files. The default is `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key`, `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key`, `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key` and `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key` for SSH protocol version 2.

Telnet – How to use
===================

Telnet is one of the earliest remote login protocols on the Internet. It was initally released in the early days of IP networking in 1969, and was for a long time the default way to access remote networked computers. It is a client-server protocol that provides the user a terminal session to the remote host from the telnet client application. Since the protocol provides no built-in security measures, it suffers from serious security issues that have limited its usefulness in environments where the network cannot be fully trusted. The use of Telnet over the public Internet should be avoided due to the risk of eavesdropping.

* [The Telnet Standard](#the-telnet-standard)


Telnet Security Problems
------------------------

The Telnet session between the client and the server is not encrypted. Anyone with access to the TCP/IP packet flow between the communicating hosts can reconstruct the data that flows between the endpoints and read the messaging, including the usernames and passwords that are used to log in to the remote machine. This network attack requires very little expertise and can be performed with network debugging tools that are readily available.

![Telnet is vulnerable to eavesdropping](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Telnet_is_vulnerable_to_eavesdropping-2.png)

[Packet sniffing](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/common-network-attack-strategies-packet-sniffing.html) attacks like the above were the underlying reason for developing SSH, and they were the most common security problem on the Internet already in the mid-1990s. Today mass monitoring and mass collection of credentials from the Internet by intelligence agencies, criminals, and hackers is routine.

Eavesdropping Attack on a Telnet Connection
-------------------------------------------

The figure below presents a sample mock attack on an unprotected network protocol such as Telnet. Without encryption the data communications can be read by anyone that has access to the network packet stream.

![Attack on a telnet session](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Attack_on_a_telnet_session-2.png)

In the figure above the black terminal window is used to run a common network traffic analysis tool (tcpdump) while the maroon window is used to run a Telnet session to a weather information service. A closer look at the tcpdump window reveals that the contents of the Telnet session are easily readable from the traffic dump – as would be usernames, passwords, and other details if such had been transmitted.

Accessing any networked session like this exposes the users to identity, password, and data theft.

Replace Insecure Telnet with Secure Shell (SSH)
-----------------------------------------------

[SSH (Secure Shell)](/ssh/) provides a secure alternative to Telnet. SSH protects user identities, passwords, and data from network snooping attacks, and allows secure logins and file transfers.

SSH has practically replaced Telnet, and the older protocol is used these days only in rare cases to access decades old legacy equipment that does not support more modern protocols. And there are still organizations that simply do not care about security.

For Unix and Linux operating systems, the [OpenSSH](https://ssh.com/ssh/openssh/) implementation comes free with the operating system and can be used to replace Telnet.

Downloading WinSCP for Windows
------------------------------

The installation package and source code can be downloaded from [winscp.net](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php).

Other SSH clients can be found [here](/ssh/download/).

WinSCP for Mac
--------------

WinSCP is not available for Mac OS. However, other free alternatives are available. For example, [Cyberduck](/ssh/cyberduck/) and [FileZilla](/ssh/filezilla/) are fairly popular alternatives.

Main Features
-------------

The main features of WinSCP include:

*   Graphical user interface
    
*   Runs on Microsoft Windows
    
*   Translations are available for several languages, including Chinese, Czech, French, German, Japanese, and Spanish
    
*   [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/), [FTP](/ssh/ftp/), [FTPS](/ssh/ftp/ftps), and WebDAV protocol support
    
*   Uploading, downloading, renaming, deleting, creating files and directories and managing their permissions.
    
*   Scripting language for automating file transfer tasks
    
*   Synchronizing directories bidirectionally
    
*   Simple built-in text editor for editing scripts
    
*   Ability to share the session profile files with PuTTY
    
*   Supports keyboard-interactive authentication, [public key](/ssh/public-key-authentication) authentication, and GSSAPI authentication. Windows single sign-on is supported.
    
*   Both Windows Explorer and dual-pane modes for file transfer. THe Windows Explorer mode only shows a pane for the remote directory, whereas the dual-pane view shows both a local and a remote directory simultaneously.
    
*   Ability to encrypt information about remote sites using a master password. However, this option is only available in interactive mode and cannot be used with scripting.
    
*   Normal installer and `.EXE` ("portable executables") alternatives
    
*   Configuration data can be stored in either Windows registry or in configuration files (`.INI`, for use with portable executables).
    

Installing
----------

Usually, the software is installed from an installation package like any other software packages. This is how most people use it.

Upgrading can be done by installing the new version. Upgrading preserves configuration files.

The software can also be run directly from an executable file without installing it. This is called portable mode. It allows running the software from USB sticks, which can provide some extra security when using public computers. However, malware running on the computer could easily corrupt the software on the USB stick or steal encryption keys from the application's memory. Thus the extra security is largely illusory.

The portable executable can be upgraded by just replacing the executable with a newer one.

Uninstalling
------------

To remove the application, go to `Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program`. In Windows 10, go to `Settings > System > Apps & features`.

WinSCP Scripting Summary
------------------------

The software implements a simple scripting language that can be used to automate certain operations with a server. The scripting language relies on credentials stored in local files.

The scripting language implements the following commands. More detailed documentation can be found at [https://winscp.net/eng/docs/scripting](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/scripting).

**call** - executes an arbitrary command on the server. Commands requiring input are not supported.

**cd** - changes remote working directory

**checksum** - calculates checksum of a remote file

**chmod** - changes permissions of remote files

**close** - closes a session

**echo** - prints a message to script output

**exit** - closes all sessions and terminates the program

**get** - downloads one or more files from a remote directory

**help** - provides help on commands

**keepuptodate** - updates a remote directory to reflect local changes

**lcs** - changes local directory

**lls** - lists files in a local directory

**ln** - creates a symbolic link on the remote host

**lpwd** - displays the current local directory

**mkdir** - creates a new directory on the remote host

**mv** - renames or moves a file on the remote host

**open** - opens a new connection to a server. For the SFTP protocol, password may be hard-coded in the command or [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) may be used. For interactive sessions, the user may type the password.

**option** - sets script options, such as echoing, confirmations, reconnect time limit for broken sessions, and whether to fail if wildcard matches no files.

**put** - uploads files to a remote directory

**pwd** - displays the current remote working directory

**rmdir** - removes a directory from the remote host

**session** - selects which session to use for the following commands

**stat** - gets attributes of a file from the remote host

**synchronize** - synchronizes a local directory with a remote directory, updating changed files in either direction

Scripting as .NET Assemblies
----------------------------

The software provides COM interfaces for any .NET programming language that supports COM. The interfaces are provided by the `winscpnet.dll` library. More complex automation can be implemented in any such language. [PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb978526.aspx) is one such language; C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET, Microsoft Azure Website, and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) are also supported.

WinSCP Command Line Mode
------------------------

While the application does not have a full terminal emulator, it does support a command line mode for executing commands remotely. The command line mode does not support commands that require keyboard input.

It is possible to use the application in conjunction with [PuTTY](/ssh/putty/) to have access to full terminal capability.

Cloud Service Support
---------------------

Guides exist for using the application with several cloud services. See [https://winscp.net/eng/docs/guides](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/guides).

Strengths
---------

*   Session scripting
    
*   Integration to .NET scripting tools
    
*   Synchronizing directories
    
*   Good documentation
    

Weaknesses
----------

*   No SSH key management support
    
*   Hardcoded passwords - [compliance violation](/compliance/)
    
*   Slow to copy many files
    
*   Opening a large directory can hang the application for an extended period, particularly over long-distance networks
    

Comparison
----------

*   Some people clearly prefer WinSCP over [FileZilla](/ssh/filezilla/)
    
*   WinSCP has no terminal window. Users who need a terminal need a separate client (see [downloads page](/ssh/download/)).
    

Summary
-------

WinSCP is good for managing a small number of servers and for implementing small-scale file transfer automation.

Inability to automate key management makes it very cumbersome in large enterprises and makes compliance audits very difficult.

WinSCP is open source and does not come with any support.

Security Alert
--------------

Many organizations have massive amounts of SSH keys that must be properly managed. If left unmanaged, they pose a major risk and compliance issue. [See more](/iam/ssh-key-management/)

SSH tunneling, unless properly controlled, can allow backdoor access from the Internet into internal networks. [See more](/ssh/tunneling/)

Sites sending `ssh:` (and maybe `sftp:`, `scp:`, `webdav:` etc) URLs could potentially trigger WinSCP to perform undesired and harmful actions.

=========================================================

Security orchestration
======================

Security orchestration is a method of connecting security tools, processes and people to strengthen an organization’s overall security posture. The concept has grown in popularity as enterprise IT security has become more and more complicated to manage.

### Contents

* [Security orchestration for enterprise IT](#security-orchestration-for-enterprise-it)

Security orchestration for enterprise IT
----------------------------------------

Ensuring the security of an enterprise IT environment today is a difficult task. A modern security team can no longer rely on a single vendor or single solution for all the work they do. Most organizations rely on a variety of security tools to help manage internal risks and protect against the wide range of constantly evolving external threats.

But, managing that array of tools and making sure that they work effectively together is no small feat. Because enterprises like to invest in best-of-breed tools, they’re left with different security tools that aren’t able to talk to each other. Security teams have to manage this manually, and they are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data and alerts they need to address.

Security orchestration is the answer.

The benefits of security orchestration
--------------------------------------

Integrating different security systems together through security orchestration helps organizations save time and money. Eliminating redundancies helps streamline security processes, allowing better time and resource management throughout the security operation. By centralizing security operations data, security teams can respond to incidents and issues faster and more effectively.

Once an organization’s security systems are integrated together, the organization is well-positioned to leverage automation to speed up processes and free up valuable resources. Security orchestration allows organizations to get the most out of their tools, processes and people.

=========================================================

Data Loss Prevention and anti-virus for SSH, SFTP and Remote Desktop
====================================================================

Data loss prevention (DLP) systems are employed to counter the risk of valuable or sensitive data ending up in possession of unauthorized parties. Network [Data Loss Prevention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_loss_prevention_software) (DLP) tools and anti-virus products typically monitor the network traffic at designated network entry/exit points and use predefined criteria to filter the sensitive data from the flow of traffic. Once identified the DLP tool takes action to stop the data transfer in real time, and typically triggers an alert on the detected attempt.

### Contents

* [Encrypted Protocols and Data Loss Prevention tools](#encrypted-protocols-and-data-loss-prevention-tools) 
* [Enhancing DLP systems to cope with Encrypted Traffic](#enhancing-dlp-systems-to-cope-with-encrypted-traffic)

Encrypted Protocols and Data Loss Prevention tools
--------------------------------------------------

While the approach above works for most normal traffic, it struggles when encrypted network protocols (such as [SSH](/ssh/protocol/) (Secure Shell), [SFTP](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/sftp/) (SSH File Transfer Protocol), RDP (Windows Remote Desktop), or SSL/TLS) are used. Encryption blinds the data loss prevention software's interception and filtering tools and renders them incapable of reacting to illegitimate transfers of protected data.

Encrypted communications protocols, such as the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/), utilize modern encryption algorithms to hide the transferred data. While this guarantees data privacy and confidentiality, it also prevents traditional data loss prevention tools and anti-virus systems from seeing the transferred data and files.

Enhancing DLP systems to cope with Encrypted Traffic
----------------------------------------------------

Modern [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) is sophisticated, and the trend is towards more and more complex attacks that combine multiple protocols, approaches and techologies. Attackers are well aware and educated in modern information security technologies. They make extensive use of the same tools their counterparts at corporate IT departments use.

Data Loss Prevention solutions that do not address encrypted connections are not sufficient to meet the real-life demands of today. Most DLP solutions can be significantly improved by extending their reach into encrypted protocols.

[](https://www.ssh.com/products/cryptoauditor/)There is significant demand, particularly in finance and other heavily regulated industries, for non-disruptive transparent solutions that monitor, control and audit encrypted connections - with integration to data loss prevention systems.

* [Why do enterprises need SIEM?](#why-do-enterprises-need-siem?-)

What is Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)?
---------------------------------------------------------

Security information and event management (SIEM) is, at its core, a data aggregator, search and reporting system. SIEM software provides insight into, and a record of, the enterprise IT environment, and is an indispensable tool for detecting and managing threats. SIEM tools have two main functions. First, they provide reports on security-related incidents and events. And second, they send alerts when there’s a potential cybersecurity issue.

How do SIEM tools work?
-----------------------

SIEM works by combining two technologies: security event management (SEM), which analyzes event and log data in real-time to provide event correlation, threat monitoring and incident response, with security information management (SIM), which collects, analyzes and reports on log data.

That means that SIEMs collect and aggregate log data, then identify and categorize incidents and events, and then analyze them. In this way, they provide real-time analysis of security alerts.

Why do enterprises need SIEM?
-----------------------------

SIEM evolved out of the tradition of log management, as organizations dealt with a growing need for better compliance management. SIEM provides the monitoring and reporting required to comply with newer, strict regulations like [HIPAA](/compliance/hipaa/security-rule), [PCI DSS](/compliance/pci), and [SOX](/compliance/sarbanes-oxley), to name a few.

The SIEM category also evolved out of a broader enterprise need for better IT security, eventually becoming the foundation of the modern [security operations center (SOC)](/ssh/security-orchestration/soc). SIEM tools are now an essential part of any SOC, giving organizations complete visibility and control over what’s happening in their network in real-time.

What is a Security Operations Center (SOC)?
-------------------------------------------

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of highly experienced cybersecurity experts tasked with monitoring, detecting, investigating and responding to any security incidents and issues the organization faces. It’s not necessarily a physical room, though it can be. It’s more a dedicated team. Think of the SOC like a hub or central command post for all things cybersecurity. The team takes in telemetry from across the organization, managing events and deciding how to act on them.

The goal of the SOC is to prevent breaches and respond quickly when cybersecurity incidents occur to minimize potential damage to the company.

Roles and responsibilities
--------------------------

The roles and responsibilities within an SOC may vary depending on its size, but there are a few roles common to most SOCs:

*   **SOC manager:** This person is responsible for the SOC team and operations. Top-level responsibilities, like directing response to major threats, fall on them.
    
*   **Incident responder:** The incident responder reacts quickly to any alerts, doing a preliminary evaluation of any irregularities.
    
*   **Compliance auditor:** They ensure staffers are following procedures correctly, and play a key role in the standardization of processes.
    
*   **Security analyst:** The SOC analyst identifies potential security threats and determines the plan for handling them.
    
*   **Investigator/Threat hunter:** This person gathers data, preserves evidence, and searches for any potential weaknesses on the network.
    

Types of SOCs
-------------

There are many different forms an SOC can take, depending on the organization’s size, resources and security needs, including but not limited to:

*   **Internal SOC:** Cybersecurity team is set up internally.
    
*   **Internal virtual SOC:** The internal cybersecurity team doesn’t have a dedicated facility, but is set up virtually.
    
*   **Co-managed SOC:** The internal cybersecurity team works together with an outsourced vendor to manage cybersecurity needs.
    
*   **Command SOC:** These centers oversee smaller SOCs across a large region.
    
*   **Outsourced virtual SOC:** An independent third-party vendor provides the same service as an internal virtual SOC.

What is security orchestration?
-------------------------------

Security orchestration brings together different security tools, processes and people to improve and organization’s overall security. By combining the management of different best-of-breed tools, security orchestration enables [cybersecurity](https://www.ssh.com/cyber/security/) teams to do their jobs quicker and more effectively.

What is security automation?
----------------------------

Security automation is often a component of security orchestration. It takes the basic concept a step further, automating the repetitive processes in a [Security Operations Center (SOC)](/ssh/security-orchestration/soc/) to improve efficiency and free up time for security teams to perform more valuable tasks.

What is security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR)?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) combines orchestration and automation with response strategy to accelerate, standardize and shorten incident response. This method of connecting security technologies, automation, threat intelligence and incident response enables organizations to respond to evaluate and respond to threats immediately, improving their overall security posture and often preventing data breaches in the first place.

Successful threat management isn’t just about detection; it depends on rapid response. SOAR systems take the data gathered from SIEM systems, along with data from other sources like data loss prevention (DLP) tools, managed service alerts, and other investigations, and gives context to that data. SOAR defines incident analysis and response procedures in a digital workflow format. It’s all about prioritizing incident response activities and speeding up response times to keep up with today’s evolving threat landscape.

The talent gap
--------------

Organizations worldwide are facing a cybersecurity skills gap. It’s difficult to find both the caliber and quantity of talent needed to stay on top of threats to the organization. Security teams are overworked and understaffed. SOAR helps organizations with resource constraints, addressing the talent gap through automation.

By lightening the manual load, SOAR allows security teams to prioritize the most pressing threats and gives them adequate time to address them. Automating repetitive tasks and the tedious parts of the workflow frees up resources to focus on the elements that require human judgement and action.

FTP Client – basic (insecure) file transfer capability
======================================================

This page presents an overview of an FTP client and explains how [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) provides the same functionality but securely and more robustly, and is easier to use and configure.

### Contents

* [FTP Client Overview](#ftp-client-overview)

* [Tectia SSH Clients and Servers](#tectia-ssh-clients-and-servers)


FTP Client Overview
-------------------

An FTP client is a software application that allows logging in to a computer that runs [FTP server](/ssh/ftp/server) software. Once a user has connected to a server and authenticated using a password, the user can then transfer files and folders to and from the server computer. The client functionality is embedded in most common web browsers, but is also available as a separate, dedicated software application for most common operating systems.

FTP Is Vulnerable to Identity and Data Theft
--------------------------------------------

The FTP protocol is unencrypted and transmits passwords and data in the clear. Tools are widely available for capturing user names and passwords from the network. This is called _password sniffing_, and was a common attack already in the mid-1990s.

SFTP Is a Secure Alternative to FTP
-----------------------------------

The [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) protocol and [SSH](/ssh/) have replaced FTP in practically all new applications. FTP should only be used with legacy systems that do not support SFTP. It is generally impossible to achieve [compliance](/compliance/) in regulated industries when using FTP.

With the SFTP alternative, it is also easy to automate file transfers. SFTP supports the use of cryptographic keys, [SSH keys](/ssh/key/), for authentication. This makes [automation](/ssh/automated) very easy.

The SFTP protocol also works across firewalls and Network Address Translation (NAT) automatically and without any special configuration.

Tectia SSH Clients and Servers
------------------------------

See the separate [SSH client](/ssh/client) page for alternatives for a file transfer client.

As a replacement for an FTP server, we recommend [Tectia SSH Server](/products/tectia-ssh/). It is available for Windows, Unix, Linux, and [z/OS](/products/tectia-ssh-zOS).

FTP – Protocol and Application
------------------------------

FTP is an application and a protocol for transferring files and directories between computers over a data network. Mr. Abhay Bhushan wrote the original protocol specifications in the early 1970s. Since then FTP has gained wide acceptance by the general computing audience. The widely adopted protocol has been standardized by the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://ietf.org/) (IETF). The current standard is described in [RFC 959](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc959).

How Does It Work?
-----------------

FTP is an application layer protocol and runs on top of the [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) protocol. It works on a client-server model. This means that the file transfer connections are (usually) initiated by an [FTP client](/ssh/ftp/client) and responded to by an [FTP server](/ssh/ftp/server). Once an authenticated connection has been established between the client and server, the files and folders can be transferred to either direction between the two connected computers.

![Connection between an FTP client and server](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Connection_between_an_FTP_client_and_server-2.png)

Availability and Usage
----------------------

FTP is one of the oldest data transfer methods in IP networks. Consequently, it has been included as a standard component in many operating systems. Most operating systems offer an FTP server, and client software is also widely available. There is a selection of client applications available for all common desktop operating systems.

The protocol used to be widely used by system administrators and software developers for moving files and folders from one computer to another. However, it has been largely replaced by [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) due to security concerns, robustness issues (especially in relation to Network Address Translation (NAT)), and ease of use.

Inherently Insecure
-------------------

When FTP was initially specified and designed, the importance of network security was less pronounced than today. The file transfer protocol was not designed to be secure – it offers no protection for the privacy nor integrity of the files that are transferred, nor does it protect the identity of the communicating parties. All passwords and data are transferred in the clear. These well-known and recognized security concerns for the protocol were addressed by the IETF in an informational RFC document [RFC 2577](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2577). The protocol also does not work well over firewalls and address translation, which are very common in today's networks.

Because an eavesdropper can easily intercept user passwords and transferred data, the protocol should only be used in networks that are trusted. In non-trusted networks such as the public Internet, file transfers should be done with a secure alternative such as [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) or [SCP](/ssh/scp) (Secure Copy Protocol). The SFTP protocol, for example, offers equivalent file transfer capability but is enhanced with protection of user identities, login credentials, and transferred data.

Popular Implentations and a Secure Alternative
----------------------------------------------

The popularity of the FTP protocol and its many use cases have spawned a number of implementations of the protocol. Popular implementations are, for example, [FileZilla](/ssh/filezilla/) and [WinSCP](/ssh/winscp/) for the Windows operating system.

Read more about [FTP clients](/ssh/ftp/client) and [FTP servers](/ssh/ftp/server).


/. 136 [File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Servers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/ftp/server)
=========================================================

FTP Server – Beware of Security Risks
=====================================

An [FTP](/ssh/ftp/) server runs on a computer to provide basic, unencrypted file transfer capability for connecting users. It is most commonly used for _anonymous FTP_, basically providing public files to anyone.

FTP uses cleartext passwords for authentication. _Password sniffing attacks_ collecting user names and passwords from the network were common already in the mid-1990s. The FTP protocol has been largely replaced by [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) and [SSH](/ssh/). Today, FTP should only be used on extreme legacy systems and for public access anonymous FTP. Even for anonymous public access, [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) and web servers have largely replaced FTP. Since FTP is unencrypted, [man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle) can and have been used to inject malware into software downloaded using FTP.

Secure Alternative (SFTP)
-------------------------

We strongly recommend switching away from FTP as soon as possible. It is seriously not secure. [Secure File Transfer Protocol](/ssh/sftp/) (SFTP) is the alternative the world has moved to. Practically all commercial file transfer tools now support SFTP. It is supported on all modern operating systems. It also makes configuring [automation](/ssh/automated) much easier and supports secure [key-based authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication).

It is practically impossible to achieve regulatory [compliance](/compliance/) in regulated industries, such as [financials](/compliance/basel-iii/) or [health care](/compliance/hipaa/security-rule), when using FTP. Public companies are also required to [protect financial data](/compliance/sarbanes-oxley/).

Consequently, the use of FTP should be restricted to totally closed and trusted environments and anonymous access.

Implementations
---------------

We do not recommend configuring FTP servers. However, if one is needed, all Unix and Linux systems come with built-in FTP servers. For Windows, [FileZilla Server](/ssh/filezilla/) is a possible alternative.

We recommend using [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/). [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) is a free open source server for Unix/Linux, and comes standard with every modern Unix, Linux, and Mac system. [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) is a widely used server for Windows. It is commercially supported, with 24x7 support available. It is also available for [z/OS](/ssh/ftp/server).


/. 137 [Obsolescent Secure File Transfer Protocol (FTPS)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/ftp/ftps)
=========================================================

FTPS - Obsolescent Secure FTP
=============================

The [File Transfer Protocol](/ssh/ftp/) (FTP) has been hampered by its inherent **lack of security** as well as network **connectivity issues** particularly in environments that make use of the common [network address translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) (NAT) technologies. NAT is a common feature of corporate firewalls, which has resulted in frequent FTP connectivity problems in corporate and protected networks.

* [FTPS Implementations (Obsolescent)](#ftps-implementations-(obsolescent))


FTPS - Combining FTP and SSL
----------------------------

FTPS ("FTP with Security") was born out of the realization that the usefulness of the FTP protocol was being hampered by its lack of communications security.

This evident security problem was addressed by combining the plaintext, unencrypted FTP with [Secure Sockets Layer](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Secure-Sockets-Layer-SSL) (SSL) or [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) (TLS) protocols. A resulting combination would then carry the file transfer functionality inside an encrypted SSL/TLS tunnel that provides end-to-end encryption and transport security.

The FTPS extension to FTP was published by the IETF as [RFC 2228](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2228.txt).

The security of FTPS connections can be set up in two distinct ways, both of which have their strengths and shortcomings. The security methods are called “implicit” and “explicit”.

In the **implicit** security method the entire connection is protected by the SSL/TLS session. This method, however, breaks the compatibility with “normal” FTP servers, as the client will initiate the connection with SSL/TLS, and the server needs to be aware of this.

In the alternative **explicit** security method the encryption is turned on by a special command after the initial plaintext FTP connection is set up. The drawback of the “explicit” method with its added command is that it requires a separate step with user/client action to complete, and thus changes the protocol flow and user workflow.

SSH and SFTP
------------

The SSH protocol is deployed in practically every corporate network across the globe. It offers a secure file transfer capability based on [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) (also known as SSH File Transfer Protocol). This is a standard part of the SSH protocol suite. It offers a selection of strong authentication methods, user-friendly secure file transfer functionality, and works well over NATs and firewalls without the issues that hamper FTP (or FTPS) implementations.

SFTP has pretty much replaced old FTP and FTPS on internal networks and in any security-critical applications. Some _anonymous FTP_ usage remains for public access, and some legacy equipment still uses FTP. FTPS has remained a curiosity, supported by some commercial file transfer tools, but less and less used. Given the prevalence of SFTP, there is no good application for FTPS.

SFTP Implementations (Recommended)
----------------------------------

We strongly recommend using the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) and [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) instead of FTPS. SFTP is supported by practically all commercial file transfer tools, and it ships standard with Unix, Linux, and Mac operating systems as part of the [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) package.

For business-critical applications we recommend using the [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) Server and Client. It comes with commercial 24x7 support services, full support for smartcards and certificate-based authentication (including [CAC and PIV cards](/ssh/cac-card-piv-card-smartcard-authentication)). It is also available for [z/OS mainframes](/products/tectia-ssh-zOS).

FTPS Implementations (Obsolescent)
----------------------------------

Some popular file transfer clients (such as [FileZilla](/ssh/filezilla/) and [WinSCP](/ssh/winscp/)) support also the secure version of FTP. The SSL/TLS security option is also available in many server implementations, but extra configuration may be required.

Guide to Secure Remote Access
=============================

_**The world is embracing remote and hybrid workspaces, but so are cybercriminals. Here’s how to implement a suite of security solutions for remote access environments to patch up today’s vulnerabilities and prepare for tomorrow’s threats.**_

With [IoT networks](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iot) and work-from-home environments becoming the norm, [secure remote access](https://www.ssh.com/blog/secure-remote-access-management-for-ot-iot-and-iiot-assets-with-privx-ot-22) is essential to maintaining safe and reliable network and server connectivity, no matter where users find themselves. Traditionally, virtual private networks (VPNs), firewalls, and cloud-based services have helped companies and households manage remote access and activity to protect their data, but new challenges call for more advanced options to [mitigate emerging threats](https://www.ssh.com/blog/cybersecurity-trends-to-track).

Enabling secure remote access requires substantial coverage to protect all user touchpoints and patch up vulnerabilities that malicious actors are waiting to exploit. This guide will explore how remote access works, why it is important, and best practices for achieving optimal security in remote environments.

What Is Secure Remote Access?
-----------------------------

As its name implies, secure remote access involves leveraging software and applications that help provide protected connectivity and communication with wireless devices, servers, and networks wherever users are situated. However, the meaning of secure remote access is shifting as technology progresses. What was once an acceptable solution for safeguarding an IT environment several months ago may not be enough to tackle today’s threats.

As a result, many enterprises may employ a mixture of security tools, such as:

*   [**Secure SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)**](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sftp) **software:** SFTP is a secure file transfer protocol that runs over the SSH protocol. It supports the full security and authentication functionality of SSH.
*   **Identity Access Management (**[**IAM**](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam)**):** IAM allows organizations to monitor and track the identities of users, devices, software, and their level of access.
*   [**Zero Trust Architecture**](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/zero-trust-framework)**:** This type of architecture complies with a “never trust, always verify” mantra — it requires that organizations never trust a user or device, relying instead on repetitive access authentication for remote users.
*   [**Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)**](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/ciem)**:** CIEM integrates automation capabilities to revoke excessive access privileges to cloud entitlements by following the principle of least privilege.
*   **Privileged Access Management (**[**PAM**](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam)**):** PAM focuses on managing users with privileged access, granting administrators control and visibility over role-based permissions.
*   **Virtual Private Networks (VPN):** VPNs establish an encrypted, private tunnel for devices tapping into the internet.
*   **Firewalls:** These implement a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks, where activity is monitored for unauthorized access.

While these solutions are incredibly helpful in mitigating risks associated with remote and internet-based communications, how they’re managed and configured is equally vital to fostering a highly secure environment.

Why Is Secure Remote Access Important?
--------------------------------------

For many companies, the pandemic has cemented the use of partially or fully [remote working environments](https://www.ssh.com/blog/how-to-sign-and-share-documents-digitally-and-securely), but with this shift comes new challenges not present in a physically integrated workplace. For example, IT teams must learn to register and adequately manage remote work devices from any location. At the same time, employees must learn how to extend proper cybersecurity etiquette to their homes, cafes, and other domains where sensitive company data could be easily compromised.

At the bare minimum, experts recommend that organizations providing remote work capabilities focus on strengthening security measures surrounding device usage, internet browsing, IoT endpoints, and internal cybersecurity policies. Simple actions, such as using only company-issued devices to access confidential internal data, using strong [log-in credentials](https://www.ssh.com/blog/how-to-solve-the-most-common-credential-management-errors), harnessing a centralized IoT management solution, and regularly educating employees on best cybersecurity practices can significantly reduce the risk of preventable breaches caused by [human error](https://www.ssh.com/blog/better-without-permanent-access) and lack of management.

It’s worth noting that secure remote access is an amalgamation of best practices and solutions curated to armor an organization from top to bottom — with the organization itself skilled enough to defend against cyberattacks and knowledgeable enough to resolve them.

Who Is Accountable for Secure Remote Access?
--------------------------------------------

Since secure remote access and its management is a multi-faceted endeavor, it requires _everyone_ in an organization to demonstrate a commitment to IT security for it to be successful. Executives and cybersecurity experts should take charge of drafting and implementing a list of policies and standards to align all internal activity. IT teams, either created internally or outsourced via third parties, should oversee the technicalities of software systems and applications used to guard remote access, as well as troubleshoot issues that arise. And lastly, employees should be [held accountable](https://www.ssh.com/blog/in_defense_of_dumb_user) for how well they abide by safe remote access practices..

How Does Secure Remote Access Work?
------------------------------------

Passwords aren’t the only type of static credential. To maximize the benefits of migrating to a passwordless environment, organizations must also consider their other permanent credentials — their keys. SSH keys outnumber passwords 10 to 1, and often go overlooked while organizations tie themselves in knots over password security. Yet these keys, like passwords, can represent a serious security threat if not properly managed.

This raises an important question — is there a way to become passwordless and keyless simultaneously?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to Set Up a Secure Remote Access Environment
------------------------------------------------

Every organization should cover the basics of remote access for all users' security by:

*   Installing antivirus software on all connected devices, remote and in-house
*   Limiting the use of remote access ports or strictly monitoring them for suspicious entry
*   Embracing multifactor authentication ([MFA](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/multi-factor-authentication)) to confirm user identities
*   Updating existing VPNs to their latest versions
*   Using logging and tracking tools to monitor IP addresses and log-in attempts
*   Reminding internal users of standard cybersecurity practices
*   Enforcing company security policies and overall compliance with industry standards

Some users have higher-than-normal access privileges than regular users. They are allowed to use [privileged accounts](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/privileged-account), which is why they are called privileged users. Examples include power users, root users, software developers, consultants, maintenance engineers, and network and database administrators.

These users need an extra layer of security since they have access to particularly sensitive or critical data or systems. To facilitate this essential layer of security, organizations should:

*   Link user roles with a user identity, since admin-level access is typically defined by a role
*   Limit access to a minimum level of privilege required to complete a task
*   Use sophisticated access management tools, like [hybrid Privileged Access Management (PAM) software](https://www.ssh.com/products/privileged-access-management-privx)
*   Embrace multifactor authentication ([MFA](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/multi-factor-authentication)) for especially critical sessions
*   Secure credentials needed for privileged sessions, preferably by going [passwordless and keyless](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/secrets-management)
*   Audit, log, track, and optionally record mission-critical sessions
*   Monitor and track automated application-to-application connections
*   Ensure [secure file transfers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sftp) and transmissions to and between servers
*   Enforce company security policies and overall compliance with industry standards

Once these practices are implemented, protect your organization from future attacks and [advanced cryptography](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cryptography/what-is-quantum-safe-cryptography) by diving into the following best practices for secure remote access policies.

Best Practices for Secure Remote Access Policies
------------------------------------------------

As organizations function concurrently with security software and principles, new vulnerabilities will arise that require tweaking established secure remote access solutions. For example, VPNs are become increasingly obsolete because of their lack of scalability, which is crucial in supporting IoT and other progressive wireless frameworks. While still useful, they shouldn’t be relied on for comprehensive support.

With cybercriminals leveraging advancing technologies to breach IT infrastructures more easily, organizations need to stay several paces ahead of upcoming industry trends and level up their working environment by harnessing:

*   **Zero Trust:** The best way to prevent internal rogue behavior is to utilize verification instead of trust. This helps reduce the risk of malicious actors disguising themselves behind approved IP addresses and keeps curious employees out of data folders requiring more high-level authentication.
*   **Secure Access Service Edge (SASE):** As more businesses turn to the cloud for extended capabilities, SASE offers threat detection and prevention in one easy-to-navigate platform. Additionally, traffic runs a more direct route without stopping at a data center, which provides high-end performance and efficiency.
*   [**IAM Interfaces**](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam)**:** Since most attacks occur at traditional entry points, like log-in screens and authentication points, IAM gives administrators valuable insight into attempted breaches and the entities conducting them.
*   [**Privileged Access Management (PAM)**](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/pam): PAM is a subcategory of IAM, and applies to privileged users who maintain network infrastructures, critical infrastructures, databases, and production environments.
*   **Cloud Security Programs:** [Cloud systems](https://www.ssh.com/academy/cloud/computing-security) are beneficial resources that strengthen an organization’s storage, performance, and configuration capacities — but they’ve also become one of the most targeted online infrastructures. Proper planning and comprehensive implementation are needed to deploy security solutions that successfully prevent breaches.
*   **Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN):** WANs remove geographic barriers so that organizations can function flawlessly from anywhere in the world. But as one can imagine, congestion and latency quickly become an issue. SD-WANs forge optimal pathways for traffic, using smart software to determine areas of strain and availability. This helps admins better manage and monitor channels to mitigate undetected breaches.

Secure Remote Access and Zero Trust
-----------------------------------

We’ve briefly covered what zero trust means in secure remote access management, but it’s worth emphasizing why it should be a priority in every organization. To keep an extra item off their agenda, businesses may forgo adopting a zero trust approach, but in doing so, they put themselves at an increased risk of internal threats. Moreover, human error is a leading factor in breach susceptibility. A lack of adherence to security policies, [leaked credentials](https://www.ssh.com/academy/password-credential-breaches), and haphazard device management reduces the efficacy of any remote access security solution.

The best approach to prevent these mistakes is to assume that you cannot trust anyone. While this may sound harsh, it’s impractical to give undisputed access to company data to certain IP addresses simply because they’re on a list. Without thoroughly verifying the users entering confidential spaces, you could be ushering in a fleet of hackers and not know until it’s too late.

Zero trust often works hand-in-hand with just-in-time ([JIT](https://www.ssh.com/academy/iam/just-in-time-access)) access, which eliminates the use of [permanent credentials](https://www.ssh.com/solutions/zero-trust-passwordless-keyless-video). It also uses segregation of duties (SoD) to limit employee access to an organization’s full suite of IT resources, as well as micro-segmentation to embed various security zones for extra safeguarding against illicit internal traffic.

/. 139 [SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sftp-ssh-file-transfer-protocol)
=========================================================

SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP): Get SFTP client & server
===========================================================

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a secure file transfer protocol. It runs over the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol). It supports the full security and authentication functionality of SSH.

SFTP has pretty much replaced legacy [FTP](/ssh/ftp/) as a file transfer protocol, and is quickly replacing [FTP/S](/ssh/ftp/ftps). It provides all the functionality offered by these protocols, but more securely and more reliably, with easier configuration. There is basically no reason to use the legacy protocols any more.

SFTP also protects against [password sniffing](/attack/password-sniffing) and [man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle). It protects the integrity of the data using encryption and cryptographic hash functions, and autenticates both the server and the user.

SFTP Port Number
----------------

SFTP port number is the [SSH port 22](/ssh/port) (follow the link to see how it got that number). It is basically just an SSH server. Only once the user has logged in to the server using SSH can the SFTP protocol be initiated. There is no separate SFTP port exposed on servers. No need to configure another hole into firewalls.

SFTP Client for Windows and Mac
-------------------------------

Many SFTP client implementations are available. Many SSH clients support SFTP.

*   [Tectia SSH Client](/products/tectia-ssh/)
    
*   [WinSCP](/ssh/winscp/)
    
*   [FileZilla](/ssh/filezilla/)
    
*   [PuTTY](/ssh/putty/download)
    
*   [Cyberduck](/ssh/cyberduck/)
    

SFTP Server for Linux, Windows, and Mac
---------------------------------------

SFTP server usually comes as part of an SSH implementation. Most organizations use either Tectia SSH or OpenSSH as the server; both come with SFTP server implementations out-of-the-box.

*   [Tectia SSH Server for Windows](/products/tectia-ssh/)
    
*   [Tectia SSH Server for IBM z/OS mainframes](/products/tectia-ssh-zOS)
    
*   [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) - open source server for Linux & Unix
    
*   [FileZilla](/ssh/filezilla/) - a free sftp server for Windows
    

SCP Command on Linux
--------------------

The `scp` command is a file transfer program for SFTP in Linux. The `scp` command line interface was designed after the old [rcp](/ssh/rcp) command in BSD Unix. The `scp` also usually comes with the OpenSSH package.

Its typical use is:

    scp [-r] file ... [user@]host:[path]

Basically, this copies one or more files to the given host. If `user` is given, then they are copied to that account on the host. If no `user` is supplied, then the same user name as on the client side is assumed. If `path` is given, then the files are copied to that directory (relative to the given user's home directory). If no `path` is given, the files are copied to the user's home directory. If the `-r` option is supplied, then files may be directories, and the given directory and all its subdirectories and files in them (recursively) are copied.

One can also copy in the reverse direction:

    scp [-r] [user@]host:file path

Commonly, the `path` would be `.`, i.e., the current directory.

SFTP Command on Linux
---------------------

The `sftp` command in Linux is a client program for SFTP. The `sftp` command line interface was designed to be similar to the [ftp](/ssh/ftp/) command. The `sftp` command is typically part of the [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) package.

SSHFS & Using SFTP for File Sharing
-----------------------------------

SFTP can furthermore be used for file sharing, similar to [Windows file sharing](http://www.techradar.com/news/networking/windows-file-and-network-sharing-the-complete-guide-1119901) and Linux [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System). The main difference is that SFTP is secure, and can be used reliably over [Network Address Translation (NAT)](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/nat.htm) and the public Internet.

[Sshfs](/ssh/sshfs/) is a network file system for Linux that runs over the SFTP protocol. It can use any SSH server as a server, and use remote files over the network as if they were local files. The remote file system can be mounted and unmounted as desired. It is the most convenient way to mount remote files ad hoc, without the need for any configuration by the server administrator. SSH keys can even fully automate establishing the connection to the server. Basically, anyone who is able to log into the server can mount its file system, with access to those files the user has access to.

Other file sharing implementations using SFTP include:

*   [Expandrive (Windows and Mac)](http://www.expandrive.com/)
    
*   [Apache Commons VFS](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/index.html)
    
*   [chromeos-filesystem-sftp](https://github.com/yoichiro/chromeos-filesystem-sftp)
    

Interactive and Automated Secure File Transfers 
-------------------

Like SSH itself, SFTP is a client-server protocol. SFTP clients are included in quality [SSH clients](/ssh/client) and complete enterprise grade SSH implementations provide both SFTP client and server functionality. Some SSH clients, such as [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/), also provide graphical file manager views into remote filesystems.

On Linux, SFTP is often used as a command-line utility that supports both interactive and automated file transfers. [Public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) can be used to fully automate logins for automated file transfers. However, [proper lifecycle management of SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management) is important to keep access under control.

Common use cases for automated file transfers include nightly system backups, copying data to disaster recovery systems, distributing configuration data, and moving transaction logs to archival systems. Many organizations have thousands of daily SSH transfers. In come cases, we have seen over 5 million daily automated SSH logins.

SFTP Protocol
-------------

The SFTP protocol runs over the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) as a subsystem. It was originally designed by [Tatu Ylonen](https://ylonen.org) for SSH 2.0 in 1997-1998. There is no separate SFTP port; it uses the normal SSH port.

The protocol supports multiple concurrent operations. Each operation is identified by a unique number assigned by the client, and servers response contains the same identifying number. Server may process requests asynchronously and may return responses out-of-order. For performance reasons, file transfer clients often send multiple requests before stopping to wait for responses.

Operations or packet types supported by the protocol include:

**INIT**: sends client version numbers and extensions to the server

**VERSION**: returns server version number and extensions to the client

**OPEN**: opens or creates a file, returning a file handle

**CLOSE**: closes a file handle

**READ**: reads data from a file

**WRITE**: writes data to a file

**OPENDIR**: opens a directory for reading, returning a directory handle

**READDIR**: reads file names and attributes from a directory handle

**MKDIR**: creates a directory

**RMDIR**: removes a directory

**REMOVE**: removes a file

**RENAME**: renames a file

**STAT**: returns file attributes given a path, following symlinks

**LSTAT**: returns file attributes given a path, without following symlinks

**FSTAT**: returns file attributes given a file handle

**SETSTAT**: modifies file attributes given a path

**FSETSTAT**: modifies file attributes given a file handle

**READLINK**: reads the value of a symbolic link

**SYMLINK**: creates a symbolic link

**REALPATH**: canonicalizes server-size relative path to an absolute path

The following response packets are returned by the server:

**STATUS**: indicates success or failure of an operation

**HANDLE**: returns a file handle upon success

**DATA**: returns data upon success

**ATTRS**: returns file attributes upon success

There is also an extension mechanism for arbitrary vendor-specific extensions. The extensions that are supported are negotiated using the INIT and VERSION packets.

**EXTENDED**: sends a vendor-specific request from client to server

**EXTENDED_REPLY**: sends a vendor-specific response from server to client.

SFTP vs. FTPS
-------------

People often want to compare SFTP vs. FTPS. FTPS is basically the old [ftp](/ssh/ftp) protocol run over SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security).

Benefits of SFTP over FTPS include:

*   SFTP runs over SSH in the standard SSH port. Thus, no additional ports need to be opened on the server and no additional authentication needs to be maintained. This simplifies configuration and reduces the likelihood of configuration errors.
    
*   FTPS needs complicated firewall configuration and may not work over NAT. Ports 989 and 990 need to be open. Furthermore, FTPS supports both active and passive modes (see [FTP](/ssh/ftp/)), which further complicates firewall configurations and is prone to problems.
    
*   FTPS requires an [X.509 certificate](/pki) for the server, typically from a public certificate authority. SSH works without any centralized infrastructure. SFTP can utilize whatever host key distribution or certification method is in use for SSH, without needing additional work and ongoing maintenance.
    
*   FTPS is basically FTP, which means it has ASCII mode, which can corrupt files if the mode is not properly set. Some implementations default to ASCII mode.
    
*   FTPS cannot be used as a file system. (This does not improve security, as it can still read the same files.)
    
*   FTPS requires an extra server software package to be installed and patched, whereas SFTP usually comes with SSH with the system.

SSH Clients: Definition
-----------------------

An SSH client is a program that allows establishing secure and authenticated SSH connections to [SSH servers](/ssh/server).

SSH client software is available for major enterprise environment operating systems, such as Unix variations, Microsoft Windows and IBM z/OS.


Cyberduck - SFTP/FTP Client for Mac
-----------------------------------

Cyberduck is a fairly popular file transfer client for Apple Mac and Microsoft Windows. It supports FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3, OpenStack Swift, Backblaze B2, Microsoft Azure & OneDrive, Google Drive and Dropbox.

Cyberduck was built by David V. Kocher, Yves Langisch, and [iterate GmbH](https://iterate.ch/).

### Downloading Cyberduck

Cyberduck can be downloaded from [https://cyberduck.io/](https://cyberduck.io/).

### Security Alert

Cyberduck can use [public keys for authentication](https://ssh.com/ssh/public-key-authentication). Many organizations have been found to have massive numbers of unmanaged SSH keys. They pose a major security and compliance risk. [More information on SSH Key Management >](https://ssh.com/iam/ssh-key-management)

Opening SSH tunnels from the external Internet into organizations has also become a common way to circumvent security policies and open backdoors. [More information on SSH Tunneling >](https://ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/)

Filezilla - SSH and FTP Client
------------------------------

The FileZilla project is an open source development initiative behind the “FileZilla Free FTP Solution”. The project made its first release in 2001. The software is still distributed free of charge under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

FileZilla is well-suited for small-scale file transfer requirements. There is no commercial support, so each user is on their own. The FileZilla community has web forums, Wiki, and bug tracking systems which provide assistance.

### FileZilla supports multiple protocols

FileZilla is a cross-platform implementation of the FTP, SFTP, and FTPS protocols. In addition to the unprotected plaintext file transfers it also supports the SFTP and FTPS secure file transfer protocols. For secure file transfers the server-side naturally needs to also support the selected secure protocol. The FileZilla SFTP client is fully interoperable with the [Tectia SFTP servers](/products/tectia-ssh).

FileZilla provides end-users with a graphical user interface that provides desktop end users with a familiar and easy user experience.

![filezilla-main-window](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/filezilla-main-window-2.png)

### Multiplatform support

The FileZilla client software is available for the common desktop operating systems. Installation packages are available for download for Windows and MacOS. For the Linux operating systems the FileZilla project provides both the source code of the client applications as well as pre-compiled binary packages in the native package management systems of various Linux distributions.

A FileZilla server implementation is available for the Windows operating systems for Windows Vista and newer versions. There is a version for both 32- and 64-bit platforms for each operating system version.

### Download Filezilla

To download FileZilla, go to the [project download page](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php).

### Alternatives for FileZilla

Modern SSH clients, such as [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh) offer file transfers integrated with a terminal client. The [FTP](/ssh/ftp) and [FTPS](/ssh/ftp/ftps) protocols shouldn't really be used anymore, as they are quite insecure or aren't as robust as [SFTP](/ssh/sftp).

Please see the [SSH clients](/ssh/client) page for a list of alternatives for various platforms.

PuTTY
-----

PuTTY is a versatile terminal program for Windows. It is the world's most popular free SSH client. It supports [SSH](/ssh/protocol), [telnet](/ssh/telnet), and raw socket connections with good terminal emulation. It supports [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) and Kerberos single-sign-on. It also includes command-line [SFTP](/ssh/sftp) and [SCP](/ssh/scp) implementations.

[Learn all about PuTTY here >](/academy/ssh/putty)

Tectia SSH Client
-----------------

[Tectia is the original SSH Client (and Server) solution](/products/tectia-ssh/) developed by the founder of SSH Tatu Ylönen.

Tectia is the backbone of the SSH Client technology with a more than 25-year-long history of securing SSH environments.

SSH Clients for Windows
-----------------------

There are several other clients and servers available. These are generally not supported for [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/) and may not have commercial support or 24x7 support available.

**PuTTY** is a free client for the SSH and telnet protocols - mentioned above.

**WinSCP** is a free open-source Windows client for file transfers. In addition to file transfer (with FTP, SFTP, or SCP protocols) WinSCP offers a basic file manager functionality and supports scripting. [More information on WinSCP >](/ssh/winscp/)

**FileZilla** is a free file transfer client - mentioned above.

**Chrome SSH extension** - The Google Chrome browser can be turned into an SSH client with an extension available in the Chrome Web Store. The Chrome SSH (beta) offers a basic SSH protocol capability.

**Bitvise** is a European software company that priovides an SSH client also for Windows. A copy of Bitvise SSH Client can be downloaded from: [https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download =nofollow](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download).

**VanDyke Software** offers their commercial client software for a free, time-limited evaluation. VanDyke SecureCRT and SecureFX clients supports telnet, Secure Shell (SSH), and SFTP. An evaluation copy can be downloaded from [https://vandyke.com/download/index.html =nofollow](https://vandyke.com/download/index.html).

Commercial clients: **Tectia SSH** is a commercially supported SSH client for enterprises, with 24x7 support. [More information on Tectia SSH >](/products/tectia-ssh/)

*   [PuTTY on Linux](/ssh/putty/linux/)
    
*   [PuTTY on Mac](/ssh/putty/mac/)
    

Alternative SSH clients
-----------------------

There many SSH clients that are more modern. A major shortcoming of PuTTY is that it does not have integrated file transfers in the client itself. Instead, file transfers have to be done via the command line. This is too complicated for most users. [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh) has had them since 2000. PuTTY also does not include an SSH server.

*   [Other SSH clients](/ssh/client)
    


How to get an SSH server
------------------------

PuTTY does not come with an SSH server. It can be used with [Linux OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh). For Windows and IBM z/OS mainframes, we recommend the [Tectia SSH server](/products/tectia-ssh/).

*   Supports both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. An MSI installer has been available since 2016.
    
*   Supports SSH client, [telnet](/ssh/telnet) client, [SFTP](/ssh/sftp) client (command line only), and [rlogin](/ssh/rlogin) client. Both SSH2 and SSH1 protocols are supported. Note that use of SSH1 is not recommended for security reasons. Practically all devices support SSH2 these days.
    
*   Supports [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) and [Active Directory](/iam/active-directory/)/Kerberos authentication.
    
*   File transfers only using a separate command-line programs. No integrated file transfer support.
    
*   No scripting support, but can be used together with [WinSCP](/ssh/winscp/).
    

### Terminal window

The main feature of the product is the terminal window. It has good terminal emulation, good configurability, and good support for different cryptographic algorithms. SSH, telnet, and plain TCP/IP protocols are supported.

The PuTTY terminal is pretty good and handles terminal emulation well.

### Transferring files

The user interface does not include an integrated file transfer client. However, command-line tools called `PSFTP` and `PSCP` are provided. These can be used for file transfers. However, most non-technical users are not willing to use a command line. [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/), for example, has offered fully integrated file transfer capability since 2000.

The [WinSCP](/ssh/winscp/) and [FileZilla](/ssh/filezilla/) clients can also be used for file transfers in conjunction with PuTTY. Having two software packages, switching between them to do operations, and managing profiles and logins for both is extra trouble. WinSCP can now import PuTTY profiles, but separate login is still required for each.

### Public key authentication

PuTTY uses its own file format for SSH keys. The keys are stored in `.ppk` files. The [PuTTYgen](/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen) tool can be used for generating new keys and converting between `.ppk` files and other key formats.

It is common for hackers and malware to collect SSH keys when penetrating an organization. This happened, for example, in the infamous [Sony breach](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/25/sony_pictures_in_it_lockdown_after_alleged_hacker_hosing/). Recently, Wikileaks obtained [CIA hacking tools](/ssh/cia-bothanspy-gyrfalcon) designed to steal SSH keys and their passphrases.

Managing SSH keys properly is important. [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) a popular SSH key management solution and the only one at the time of this writing that supports `.ppk` files.

### Telnet support

PuTTY grew out of a [telnet](/ssh/telnet) client. It still supports the `telnet` protocol. However, very few devices use `telnet` these days. Its use is not recommended for security reasons.

`Telnet` sends all user names and passwords in the clear. It is very easy to listen to network traffic and steal user names and passwords from `telnet` traffic. By mid-1990s, such password sniffing attacks had become the largest security problem on the Internet. That was the very problem SSH was designed to solve. Compromised routers, switches, or ARP proofing attacks can also be used to inject arbitrary commands into telnet sessions.

There is a separate version of the software, called `PuTTYtel`, for countries that do not allow any use of encryption. However, SSH is now used in all countries, officially or unofficially. Most systems can no longer be managed without encryption. Even the most oppressive countries need to secure their systems somehow. There cannot be cybersecurity in a networked environment without encryption.

PuTTY also supports connecting to serial ports and raw sockets. These can sometimes be useful for debugging purposes and for working with some legacy devices. For example, in kernel development access via a serial port is still sometimes the best way to debug a panic that causes an immediate reboot, as it provides a way to see the boot messages.

Known security vulnerabilities
------------------------------

Version 0.66 and earlier are known to contain security vulnerabilities. Upgrading to the latest version is recommended.

*   [Buffer overflow in SCP](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-pscp-sink-sscanf.html). This a potential stack overflow and remote code execution vulnerability. A corrupt server could execute code on the client when any file is downloaded. It could also be exploited by [man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle).
    
*   [Integer overflow in terminal escape sequence handling](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-ech-overflow.html). This is a memory corruption and possible remote code execution vulnerability. It involves sending an escape sequence to the terminal. For example, a compromised switch could inject the attack into a session. It can also be exploited by a corrupt server to execute code on the client, or using man-in-the-middle attacks.
    
*   [A trojaned version has been circulating](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/check-your-sources-trojanized-open-source-ssh-software-used-steal-information).
    

Lack of proper key management can expose servers to risk and allow attackers to spread server-to-server or jump through desktops/laptops containing SSH keys. More information on SSH key management can be found [here](/iam/ssh-key-management).

History and maintenance status
------------------------------

PuTTY is one of the oldest SSH clients for Windows. It was first released by Simon Tatham in 1998. SSH support was added in 2000.

After 19 years, the software is still a beta version. Development has been slow, but it is still being maintained. A recent version added support for elliptic curve cryptography. The user interface or features have not changed much in 15 years.

A Frequently Asked Questions document (FAQ) can be found [here](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/faq.html).

Where to find the source code
-----------------------------

Source code is available on Simon Tatham's [home page](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). Installation packages can be downloaded securely [here](/ssh/putty/download).

Extensions, branches, and integrations
--------------------------------------

The product is open source. Several projects have branched off and build on its source code.

*   [PuttyManager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/puttymanager/) is a tabbed user interface, but development appears to have stopped years ago.
    
*   [ExtraPuTTY](http://www.extraputty.com/download.php) is a fork that has various extensions, such as Lua programming language integration.
    
*   [MTPuTTY](http://ttyplus.com/multi-tabbed-putty/) is a version of with a user interface that supports multiple tabs (i.e., a tab control where each tab is a terminal window).
    
*   [WinSCP](/ssh/winscp/) has some level of integration for file transfer functionality.

Download PuTTY installation package for Windows
-----------------------------------------------

### Master download site

Simon Tatham publishes new PuTTY versions [on his personal home page](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

Installation and setup instructions
-----------------------------------

*   [Installation instructions for Windows](/ssh/putty/windows/install)
    
*   [Setting up public key authentication using PuTTYgen](/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen)
    

Verifying release signatures
----------------------------

The releases are signed with [GPG](https://gnupg.org/), using the PuTTY release key.

To verify the signatures, you need the `gpg` tool. On Debian-based Linux, it can be installed with `aptitude install gnupg`. On Red Hat 7, it can be installed with `yum install gnupg2`.

To import the signature key into GPG, use:

    gpg --import putty-release-2015.asc

To check the signature of a file, use:

    gpg --verify <signaturefile> <datafile>

For example:

    gpg --verify putty-64bit-0.69-installer.msi.gpg putty-64bit-0.69-installer.msi

Package contents: putty.exe, puttygen.exe, psftp.exe, pscp.exe, pagent.exe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The installation package includes `putty.exe`, `puttygen.exe`, `psftp.exe`, `pscp.exe`, and `pagent.exe`.

`putty.exe` is the main executable for the terminal client. It can also be used standalone, without the installation package, by simply copying the executable to a USB stick and running it on a new machine. This way, the user can carry the executable with them. However, this should not be assumed to provide great security - malware on the machine where it is used can still compromise the software (cf. [CIA hacking tool bothanspy](/ssh/cia-bothanspy-gyrfalcon)) and viruses may get installed on the USB stick whenever it is inserted in a new machine.

`puttygen.exe` is can be used for generating SSH keys on Windows. See the separate [puttygen page](/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen) on how to create and set up SSH keys with it.

`psftp.exe` is an [SFTP](/ssh/sftp) file transfer client. It only works on the command line, and does not support graphically dragging and dropping files between systems. See [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh) if you'd like that functionality.

`pscp.exe` is a command line [SCP](/ssh/scp) client.

`pagent.exe` is an SSH agent for PuTTY. Keys are first created with `puttygen.exe` and can then be loaded into `pagent` for automating logins and for implementing single sign-on.


Alternatives
------------

For other SSH clients and comparison, see the [SSH clients](/ssh/download/) page. Several more modern alternatives are available.

### Server for Windows or other platforms

You don't need to worry about a server if you are going to connect to a school or work server. However, if you are planning to use PuTTY to log into your own systems, then you may need to install and enable a server.

Most Linux and Unix systems come with [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) preinstalled. On some distributions, you may need to install the server. On Debian-derived systems, the following will install the server:

    sudo aptitude install openssh-server

On Red Hat systems, the following will install the server:

    sudo yum install openssh-server

Depending on the system, you may also need to start the server if you don't want to reboot. The following should work on most systems:

    sudo service sshd restart

For Windows, the [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) is a popular choice and comes with commercial support services. It also runs on IBM z/OS mainframes. Unix/Linux are available with support for business-critical applications.

SSH key management needs attention
----------------------------------

SSH is often used with [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) to implement automation and single sign-on.

Public key authentication uses a new kind of access credential, the [SSH key](/ssh/key/), for authentication. It is much more secure than traditional password authentication, especially compared to hard-coded passwords in scripts, but the keys need proper management.

Most organizations with more than a hundred servers have large numbers of SSH keys. Usually, these keys have not been properly managed and audited. An [SSH risk assessment](/products/ssh-risk-assessment/) is recommended. Organizations should consider deploying [key management software](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) to establish proper provisioning, termination, and monitoring for key-based access.

Risks of unmanaged SSH keys include uncontrolled attack spread across the server infrstructure, including to disaster recovery data centers and backup systems.

Organizations should also be aware of security risks related to [SSH port forwarding](/ssh/tunneling/). It is a technology that has many good uses, but it can also enable unfettered access across firewalls. Employees and attackers can leave tunnels back into the internal network from the public Internet. This particularly affects organizations using cloud computing services.

Using telnet is not recommended
-------------------------------

In addition to SSH, the PuTTY can be used as a [telnet](/ssh/telnet) client. Telnet is insecure. Its use is not recommended.

The main problem with `telnet` is that it transmits all passwords and any transmitted data in the clear. Anyone with access to any computer on the same network can steal user names and passwords that are transmitted. Such [password sniffing](/attack/password-sniffing) attacks were very common on the Internet already in the 1990s.

`Telnet` sessions can also be [hijacked](/attack/man-in-the-middle) in the network. Attackers can inject their own commands into `telnet` sessions. Protection from such attacks was the main reason why [Tatu Ylonen](https://ylonen.org) developed SSH as a replacement for `telnet` in the first place. Use of `telnet` has not been recommended for 20 years.

SFTP file transfer support
--------------------------

File transfer support is implemented as a separate program, `PSFTP.` It is available only as a command-line tool. There is no graphical user interface for file transfers.

[SCP file transfers](/ssh/scp) are supported via the `PSCP` program. This is also command-line only.

Modern implementations, such as [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/), have integrated file transfers in the terminal client.

PuTTY for Linux
===============

This page is about PuTTY on Linux. For the Windows version, see [here](/ssh/putty/windows/). For the Mac version, see [here](/ssh/putty/mac/).

PuTTY Linux vesion is a graphical terminal program that supports the [SSH](/ssh/protocol), [telnet](/ssh/telnet), and `rlogin` protocols and connecting to serial ports. It can also connect to raw sockets, typically for debugging use.

Since most people would just use the preinstalled [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh) in a terminal window on Linux for basic SSH access, the primary use of Putty on Linux is probably debugging: connecting to raw sockets and connecting to serial ports.

* [Running PuTTY](#running-putty) 
* [Usage](#usage) 
* [SSH Key Management and Public Key Authentication](#ssh-key-management-and-public-key-authentication)

How to Install PuTTY on Linux
-----------------------------

Putty is not installed by default on most Linux distributions. On Debian, it can be installed with the following command:

    sudo aptitude install putty

Other related tools come in a separate installation package. To install them, use:

    sudo aptitude install putty-tools

Running PuTTY
-------------

The graphical client can be started by just running `putty`. On most distibutions the command will be available through the menus. It can typically be found in the Internet or Network category.

Usage
-----

When started, PuTTY opens a terminal Window. The Linux version of the client loks and feels almost exactly the same as the Windows version. For guidance on how to use it, see description of [the Windows version](/ssh/putty/windows/).

SSH Key Management and Public Key Authentication 
-------------------

PuTTY supports [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication). It uses its own key format (`.ppk` files).

The [puttygen](/ssh/putty/linux/puttygen) tool is used for generating a private key for authentication.

To enable public key authentication, first run `puttygen`, typically as:

    puttygen -t rsa -b 2048 -o mykey.ppk

Then get the public key using:

    puttygen -L mykey.ppk

Copy the public key (or cut-and-paste it) to the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server that you want to log in to using the key. You may need to create the `.ssh` directory and the `authorized_keys` file if they don't already exist. See [more information on authorized keys](/ssh/authorized_keys).

PuTTY for Mac is a port of the [Windows version of PuTTY](/ssh/putty/windows/). However, there are many options for SSH clients for Mac, and this page discusses several of them.

Using the built-in SSH client in Mac OS X
-----------------------------------------

Mac OS X includes a command-line SSH client as part of the operating system. To use it, goto Finder, and selext Go -> Utilities from the top menu. Then look for Terminal. Terminal can be used to get a local terminal window, and also supports SSH connections to remote servers.

### Running SSH from the terminal command line

Once you have the terminal window open, you have two alternatives. The first approach is to type `ssh hostname` or `ssh user@hostname` into the terminal window. This is more familiar for Linux and Unix users who are used to using a command line.

### Running SSH with a graphical user interface

The second option is to select New Remote Connection... from the Shell menu of Terminal. This opens a graphical dialog asking for the host to connect to and the user name. This also allows saving connections. This is recommended for users who are not accustomed to using a command line.

### How to use PuTTY SSH keys with the built-in OpenSSH

If you have a PuTTY `.ppk` format private key and want to use it with the built-in OpenSSH on Mac on the command line or in scripts, you can use the following commands.

First, install PuTTY for Mac using `brew install putty` or `port install putty` (see below). This will also install the command-line version of [puttygen](/ssh/putty/linux/puttygen), the PuTTY key generator tool.

Then, use the following command to convert the `.ppk` format private key to a standard PEM format private key:

    puttygen privatekey.ppk -O private-openssh -o privatekey.pem

Make sure permissions on the private key file are set properly. It should only be readable by the user that owns it.

    chmod go-rw privatekey.pem

You can now use the key for logins from scripts and command line with:

    ssh -i privatekey.pem user@hostname

Ported PuTTY for Mac 
-------------------

There is a port of PuTTY for Mac. It can be installed in several ways.

### Installation using HomeBrew

If you already have the `brew` command installed, the best way to install PuTTY is to use the following command:

    brew install putty

### Installation using MacPorts

PuTTY is readily available via MacPorts. To see how to install MacPorts and PuTTY, see [here](https://onvinetech.wordpress.com/2016/01/26/49/).

Once you have MacPorts installed, you just need to give this command:

    sudo port install putty

and to add a shortcut on the Desktop,

    cp /opt/local/bin/putty ~/Desktop/PuTTY

Alternatives to PuTTY on the Mac
--------------------------------

A lot of people use [Cyberduck](/ssh/cyberduck) on Mac. It is a solid, well-known SSH client that is quite popular.

How to Use PuTTY on Windows
===========================

This page is about the PuTTY SSH client on Windows. For information about PuTTY on Mac, see the [PuTTY Mac page](/ssh/putty/mac/). For PuTTY on Linux, see the [PuTTY Linux page](/ssh/putty/linux/).

This page explains how to use the PuTTY terminal window on Windows. How to configure PuTTY, how to create and save profiles, and what configuration options to change. Advanced topics, such as configuring public key authentication, are also addressed.

Getting and installing
----------------------

You can download a copy of the software for the Windows platform from the [download page](/ssh/putty/download). Detailed installation instructions are provided on the [installation instructions](/ssh/putty/windows/install) page.

Running PuTTY and connecting to a server
----------------------------------------

If you selected to create a desktop icon during installation, you can start the software simply by (double-)clicking on the icon. Otherwise, open the software from the Windows **Start** menu.

When the software starts, a window titled **PuTTY Configuration** should open. This window has a configuration pane on the left, a **Host Name (or IP address)** field and other options in the middle, and a pane for saving session profiles in the lower right area.

For simple use, all you need to do is to enter the domain name or IP address of the host you want to connect to in the **Host Name** field and click **Open** (or press Enter). A domain name looks like `students.example.edu`. An IP address looks something like `78.99.129.32`.

What if you don't have a server
-------------------------------

If you don't have a server to connect to, you can try [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) on Windows or [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) on Linux.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Security alert dialog box
-------------------------

When you connect to a server for the first time, you are likely to see a `PuTTY Security Alert` dialog about the server's host key not being cached in the registry. This is normal when you are connecting to a server for the first time. If you ever get this with a server, it could mean that someone is trying to attack your connection and steal your password using a [man-in-the-middle attack](/attack/man-in-the-middle).

But as said, the first time you connect, this is normal, and you should just click **Yes**. If you want to be fancy, you can check the displayed key fingerprint and make sure it is the same that is used by the server. In real life, almost nobody does that. It is more secure to use a proper [SSH key management solution](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) anyway.

![Security Alert Dialog about unknown server host key](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Security_Alert_Dialog_about_unknown_server_host_key-2.png)

Terminal window and login credentials
-------------------------------------

After the security alert, you should get a terminal window. By default, this is a black, very bland window. It should first ask for your user name and then password. After these, you should get a command line on the server.

You can then type into the terminal Window. You are now connected to the server, and anything you type in the Window is sent to the server. Server's responses are displayed in the Window. You can run any text-based applications on the server using the window. The session terminates when you exit the command-line shell on the server (typically by typing `exit`) to the command line or pressing `Control-D`. Alternatively, you can forcibly terminate the session by closing the terminal window.

![PuTTY SSH terminal window](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/PuTTY_SSH_terminal_window-2.jpeg)Configuration options and saved profiles

The initial configuration window contains a lot of options. Most of them are not needed in normal use.

![PuTTY Windows configuration and connection screen with profile save option](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/PuTTY_Windows_configuration_and_connection_screen_with_profile_save_option-2.png)

### Port

The **port** field specifies the TCP/IP port to connect. For SSH, this is the port on which the SSH server runs. Normally it can be left to 22. If for some reason you need to connect to a different port number, just change the value. Usually only developers would change this to a different value, but some enterprises are known to run SSH servers in non-standard ports or to run multiple SSH servers on the same server at different ports.

### Connection type

The **Connection type** selection almost never needs to be touched. Just leave it as **SSH**. SSH is a secure, encrypted communications protocol designed to ensure your password and data are maximally protected.

**Raw connections** might be used for developers to connect a TCP/IP socket for testing (e.g., when developing a network application that listens on a TCP/IP port).

[**Telnet**](/ssh/telnet) is an old legacy protocol that is almost never used, unless you manage equipment that is more than 10 years old. Telnet is not secure. Passwords are sent in the clear on the network. Attackers can easily eavesdrop on plaintext communications and steal user names and passwords. **Rlogin** is another legacy protocol with similar woes.

**Serial** refers to a serial port, another legacy communications mechanism for connecting computers to peripheral devices. Most PCs these days no longer have serial ports, but they are still sometimes used for controlling physical equipment, instrumentation, machinery, or communications devices. Another use for serial ports is debugging operating systems or embedded software.

### Load, save, or delete a stored session

This section allows you to save your settings as named profiles. Just write the name of your new profile in the **Saved Sessions** box and click **Save** to create a new profile. The host name and your other settings are saved in the profile.

Saved profiles appear in the larger box below it. Initially it will contain just **Default Settings**. Profiles you save will be included there. Select a profile and click **Load** to use a previously saved profile. Select a profile and click **Delete** to delete a profile that is no longer needed.

### Close window on exit

Finally, the **Close window on exit** setting specifies whether the terminal window should be automatically closed when the connection is terminated. There is rarely any need to change it from the default value of **Only on clean exit**.

Left pane configuration options
-------------------------------

More options can be found in the left pane titled **Category**. Select a category from the tree, and the right pane will change to show configuration options for that category. The initally shown options belong to the **Session** category.

Only the more relevant options are described here. There are lots of options, and most of them would never be used.

### Terminal options

The options in this category influence terminal emulation and keyboard mappings. They are largely self-explanatory, and will not be covered here. Very few people need to touch these. Some people may change how the **bell** character is handled; people using exotic operating systems might change what is sent by the **backspace** or **delete** character.

### Window options

The window options influence the appearance and behavior of the terminal window. It can also specify how characters are translated on output and to select fonts and colors for the window.

Connection options
------------------

Of the connection options, the **Data** options can be useful. The **Auto-login user name** specifies the user to log in as, so that the name will not have to be entered every time. The **Proxy** options are rarely useful for home users, but may be needed in enterprises that do not allow outgoing Internet connections without using a SOCKS proxy or other similar mechanisms. Don't worry if you don't know what a SOCKS proxy is; just stay out of that section.

The **Telnet**, **Rlogin**, and **Serial** categories only contain options for those protocols, and very few people would ever use them.

The **SSH** options, however, are important and useful for some people. The ordinary user or student need not worry about them. But if you want to use public key authentication, then they are needed. Note that **you need to open the SSH options subtree** by clicking on the small `[+]` symbol. Otherwise you won't see all the options.

### Key exchange, host keys, and cipher options

You almost never want to touch the Kex (key exchange), Host Keys, or Cipher options. They all have reasonable default values, and most people don't know enough about [cryptography](/cryptography/) to select any better values. Thus just skip these options, unless you know what you are doing.

### Authentication options - public key authentication

The **Auth** subtree contains some options that may be useful. When **Auth** is clicked, it shows a pane titled **Options controlling SSH authentication**. To enable public key authentication, you just [generate an SSH key](/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen) and then click the **Browse** button in the **Authentication parameters** box in the middle right area of this configuration pane. For more information, see also [configuring public key authentication for PuTTY](/ssh/putty/public-key-authentication). Advanced users may also want to check the **Allow agent forwarding** checkbox to use key-based single sign-on.

Most users have no need to generate SSH keys and need not know what public key authentication is. System administrators, however, should learn it and should also familiarize themselves with [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management) and ensure their organization implements proper provisioning and termination processes and audits for SSH keys.

![PuTTY authentication public key options](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/PuTTY_authentication_public_key_options-2.png)

### Active Directory authentication (GSSAPI / Kerberos)

One of the interesting features of PuTTY is support for [Active Directory](/iam/active-directory/) single sign-on. Technically it uses the Kerberos protocol via a programming interface called [GSSAPI](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2743.txt). In the SSH protocol, the mechanism is called GSSAPI authentication. Enterprise users using Kerberos authentication (e.g., via the Centrify or Quest Authentication Services aka Vintela) may want to take advantage of the single-sign-on capability. Other users don't need to care. The settings for GSSAPI authentication can be found under the **SSH** / **Auth** section. Note that you must again expand the **Auth** section by clicking on the `[+]` symbol to see the GSSAPI options.

### X11 forwarding options

[X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) is a protocol and system for running graphical applications on Unix and Linux. It supports running graphical applications remotely over a network out-of-the-box.

PuTTY does not implement an X11 server (the display side), but it can work with some other product that implements X server functionality on Windows. A popular free alternative is [XMing](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/).

To use an X11 server, you need to check the **Enable X11 forwarding** box and enter **localhost:0.0** in the **X display location** box. The other settings need not be touched. Detailed instructions can be found, e.g., [here](http://www.geo.mtu.edu/geoschem/docs/putty_install.html).

![X11 forwarding options for use with Xming](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/X11_forwarding_options_for_use_with_Xming-2.png)

### Tunneling options

The final category of configuration options we'll discuss is **Tunnels**. They are used for configuring SSH tunneling, also called SSH port forwarding. This panel can be used for defining forwardings for the connection. Forwardings are saved in the profile.

To add a local forwarding (i.e., TCP/IP port on local machine forwarded to a port on the remote machine or to a machine reachable from the remote machine), write the source port in the **Source port** field, the destination host and port (e.g., `www.dest.com:80`) in the **Destination** field, and select **Local**. The click **Add**.

To add a remote forwarding (i.e., a TCP/IP port on the remote machine forwarded to a port on the local machine or to a machine reachable from the local machine), specify **Source port** on the destination machine and **Destination** that is reachable from the local machine (your desktop).

Normally you need not check **Local ports accept connections from other hosts** or the same for remote ports. However, if the connection to the forwarded port is from a over a network instead of from `localhost`, then you need to check these. There is a small security risk, but usually it is not a problem in the cases where SSH tunneling is used. However you should understand that anyone who can connect to the respective computer can then connect to the forwarded port. In some cases port forwarding can be used to traverse firewalls. We suggest you read our article on [the risks of SSH port forwarding](/ssh/tunneling).

=========================================================

How to Install PuTTY on Windows. Download & configure
=====================================================

This page provides detailed instructions for installing PuTTY on Windows 10, 8, or 7. However, installation should be very similar on other versions of Windows as well.

### Contents

* [Download installation package](#download-installation-package) 
* [Starting the installer](#starting-the-installer) 
* [Configuring and installing](#configuring-and-installing) 
* [Running PuTTY](#running-putty) 
* [How to get a server](#how-to-get-a-server) 
* [Other SSH clients](#other-ssh-clients) 
* [How-tos](#how-tos)

Download installation package
-----------------------------

First you need to obtain a copy of the installation package (e.g., `putty-<version>-installer.msi`). If you have a 64-bit computer, it is recommended that you install the 64-bit version `putty-64bit-<version>-installer.msi`. Almost any computer bought after 2015 has a 64-bit processor, except for the very cheapest ones. Many high-end computers sold several years before that. If you don't know or don't care, it is always safe to use the 32-bit version (`putty-<version>-installer.msi`).

You can download the installer [here](/ssh/putty/download).

Starting the installer
----------------------

On Windows 10, the Edge browser offers to run the installer when the download is complete. Just click to install the software.

On older versions of Windows, you may need to run the installer manually. Open the Windows Explorer (right-click on the Windows logo in the bottom left corner), navigate to the Downloads directory (or wherever you saved the installer), and double-click on the file name. A detailed description can be found [here](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/execute-msi-files-39905.html). Note, however, that the installation has to be performed with Administrator rights (either using the Administrator account or your personal account must have Administrator permissions).

Occasionally, some people have problems installing MSI files. The video here may help.

[How to install an MSI file on Windows 7, 8, and 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb3awVu7kAs)

Configuring and installing
--------------------------

When the installer starts, it shows the welcome screen. Just click **Next**.

![PuTTY installer has started](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/PuTTY_installer_has_started-2.png)

The installer then asks for the Destination folder in which to install the software. Almost always it is best to use the default value. Just click **Next**.

![Putty install asks destination folder](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Putty_install_asks_destination_folder-2.png)

Then, the installer asks to select product features to install. You probably want to add a shortcut on the desktop if you expect to use the software frequently. All the other options generally should be enabled. When ready, click **Install**.

![Selecting installation options for PuTTY installer on Windows 7, 8, 10](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Selecting_installation_options_for_PuTTY_installer_on_Windows_7__8__10-2.png)

When the installation has completed successfully, it should show a "Completed" screen. Click **Finish** to exit the installer.

![putty-installer-completed](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/putty-installer-completed-2.png)

Running PuTTY
-------------

Once installation successfully completed, you should test to make sure that PuTTY runs correctly and you can find the program. If you installed a shortcut on the desktop, you should be able to find the icon for PuTTY. Try (double-)clicking on the icon. It should start the software.

Otherwise, you should be able to find the software from the Windows Start menu in the bottom left corner of the screen. The menu looks different in each version of Windows. On Windows 10, scroll down until you see "PuTTY". Open the group, and select "PuTTY".

When the software starts, you should get a window with the title "PuTTY Configuration" with a field **Host Name** in the upper middle part. Try entering a host name to connect to in that field, and click **Open**.

![Initial Window with Configuration, Host Name, and Profiles](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Initial_Window_with_Configuration__Host_Name__and_Profiles-2.png)

How to get a server 
-------------------

An SSH client is intended to be used for connecting to an SSH server. Since you hare installing one, you presumably have a server to connect. The server may be at your university, work, or home. You need a host name (e.g., `students.example.edu`) or IP address (e.g., `177.33.189.54`) to connect to. Enter the host name or IP address in the **Host Name** field.

If you don't have a server but want one, try installing [Tectia SSH Server](/products/tectia-ssh/) for Windows or IBM mainframes or [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) on Linux.

Other SSH clients
-----------------

While PuTTY is a good client, it is rather old. Its user interface is very old-fashioned and it does not provide a graphical interface for transferring files. For alternatives, see [other SSH clients](/ssh/client).

How-tos
-------

For further tutorials, see:

/. 149 [PuTTY Public Keys](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty/public-key-authentication)
=========================================================

PuTTY Public Key authentication
===============================

Public key authentication in PuTTY uses [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) stored in `.ppk` files. Instructions for configuring public key authentiation for PuTTY can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-putty-on-digitalocean-droplets-windows-users).

*   [Generate SSH keys on Windows](/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen)
    
*   [Generating SSH keys on Linux using puttygen](/ssh/putty/linux/puttygen)
    

There have been documented instances of [malware collecting PuTTY SSH keys](/malware/). In the widely publicized Sony breach, attackers went after `.ppk` files. This illustrates how important [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/) is. As of this writing, [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) is the only SSH key management solution that supports PuTTY keys.


/. 150 [PuTTYgen for Linux](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty/linux/puttygen)
=========================================================

Puttygen command line on Linux - SSH key generator
==================================================

This page is about PuTTYgen on Linux. For the Windows version, see the [PuTTYgen on Windows](/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen) page.

`Puttygen` is the SSH key generation tool for the linux version of [PuTTY](/ssh/putty/). It works similarly to the [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen) tool in OpenSSH.

The basic function is to create public and private key pairs. PuTTY stores keys in its own format in `.ppk` files. However, the tool can also convert key formats.

### Contents

* [Installation](#installation) 
* [Creating a New Key Pair for Authentication](#creating-a-new-key-pair-for-authentication) 
* [Installing the Public Key as an Authorized Key on a Server](#installing-the-public-key-as-an-authorized-key-on-a-server)

* [Exporting a Private Key to Tectia SSH or OpenSSH](#exporting-a-private-key-to-tectia-ssh-or-openssh) 
* [Command Line Options](#command-line-options)

Installation
------------

In some Linux distributions, the `puttygen` tool needs to be installed separately from the PuTTY client. For example, in Debian Linux, the following command will install it:

    sudo aptitude install putty-tools

Creating a New Key Pair for Authentication
------------------------------------------

To create a new key pair for authentication from the command line, use something like:

    puttygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "user@host" -o keyfile.ppk

It is strongly recommended that a passphrase be used for key files intended for interactive use. Key files used for automation (e.g., with [WinSCP](/ssh/winscp/) should generally have an empty passphrase.

Installing the Public Key as an Authorized Key on a Server
----------------------------------------------------------

With both [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) and [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) servers, access to an account is configured by generating a public key, copying the public key to the server, and adding the public key to a [~/.ssh/authorized_keys](/ssh/authorized_keys) file.

To extract the public key, use:

    puttygen -L keyfile.ppk

Then log into the server, edit the `authorized_keys` file with your favorite editor, and cut-and-paste the public key output by the above command to the `authorized_keys` file. Save the file. Configure PuTTY to use your private key file (here `keyfile.ppk`). Then test if login works. See [configuring public key authentication for PuTTY](/ssh/putty/public-key-authentication).


Changing the Passphrase of a Key
--------------------------------

It is recommended that all SSH keys be regenerated and changed periodically. [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager) can automate this. Just changing the passphrase is no substitute, but it is better than nothing. These instructions can also be used to add a passphrase to a key that was created without one.

Use the following command to change the passphrase:

    puttygen keyfile.ppk -P

This will prompt for the new passphrase, and write the result back to `keyfile.ppk` with the new passphrase.

Exporting a Private Key to Tectia SSH or OpenSSH
------------------------------------------------

It is rarely necessary to export a private key from PuTTY to Tectia SSH or OpenSSH. However, the process is described here, as it can sometimes be necessary when, for example, an application is moved to Linux in the cloud and the destination server of a file transfer cannot easily be reconfigured to change an authorized key.

Tectia SSH and OpenSSH both support the OpenSSH private key file format, so using that key file format is described here. Tectia SSH also supports certain other formats.

To convert an existing PuTTY private key for Tectia or OpenSSH, use the command:

    puttygen keyfile.ppk -O private-openssh -o keyfile

Then copy `keyfile` to the `.ssh` directory on the host where Tectia or OpenSSH will be run.

Command Line Options
--------------------

The basic command line of PuTTYgen:

*   Specifies a key file to read or a key type and size to generate.
    
*   Optional action to perform (e.g., change passphrase)
    
*   Optional output type and output file.
    

The basic command line is:

    puttygen [-t keytype [-b bits] [-q] | keyfile]          [-C new-comment] [-P]          [-O output-type | -p | -l | -L]          [-o output-file]

The options are:

**keyfile** Name of existing key file to read, when modifying an existing key.

**-t keytype** Specifies to the type of a new key to generate. Acceptable values include `rsa` and `dsa`. `rsa1` is also supported to generate legacy SSH-1 keys, but they should never be needed any more.

**-b bits** Specifies the number of bits in the key. For DSA keys, 1024 is a decent size. For RSA keys, 2048 or even 4096 bits are recommended.

**-q** Suppresses messages about progress during key generation.

**-C new-comment** Specifies comment to describe the key. The comment does not impact the operation of the key. The comment can be specified for new keys or for existing keys to change their comment. Typically the comment would be used to identify the key owner, but since any value can be specified, it cannot really be relied upon.

**-P** Requests to change the key's passphrase. The tool will prompt for a new passphrase. It is not possible to specify a passphrase on the command line. The passphrase will be used to encrypt the private key. See [more details on passphrases and how to generate good ones](/ssh/passphrase).

**--old-passphrase-file file** Specifies a file from which to read the old passphrase of the key. This is only needed if manipulating an existing key that is protected by a passphrase.

**--new-passphrase file** Specifies new passphrase for the key. This can be used when creating a new key, or with the **-P** option to change the passphrase.

**-O output-type** Specifies what to output. By default, the private key is output. The following values can be specified:

*   **private** Save the private key in the proprietary PuTTY key format as a `.ppk` file.
    
*   **fingerprint** Outputs the fingerprint of the key. The fingerprint uniquely identifies the key and can, for example, be read over the phone to ensure the key is the intended one.
    
*   **public** Save the public key corresponding to the private key. For SSH2 keys, the public key will be output in the format specified by [RFC 4716](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4716). This format is supported by, e.g., Tectia SSH. Keys in that format look like this:
    
    ---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ---- Comment: "user@example.com" AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEA1on8gxCGJJWSRT4uOrR13mUaUk0hRf4RzxSZ1zRb YYFw8pfGesIFoEuVth4HKyF8k1y4mRUnYHP1XNMNMJl1JcEArC2asV8sHf6zSPVffozZ 5TT4SfsUu/iKy9lUcCfXzwre4WWZSXXcPff+EHtWshahu3WzBdnGxm5Xoi89zcE= ---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
    
*   **public-openssh** Save the public key ony, in OpenSSH's proprietary format. The format is also supported by Tectia SSH. like this:

*   **private-openssh** Converts the private key to OpenSSH's format. This can only be used for SSH2 keys.
    
*   **private-sshcom** Converts the private key to the format used by Tectia SSH.
    
*   **private-openssh** Coverts the private key to the format used by OpenSSH. This format is also supported by Tectia SSH.
    

**-l** Same as **-O fingerprint**.

**-L** Same as **-O public-openssh**.

**-p** Same as **-O public**.

**-o output-file** Specifies the output file. This option is mandatory when generating a new key. Otherwise, when changing the passphrase or comment, the default is to overwrite the original file. When outputting a public key or fingerprint, the default is standard output.

**-h** or **--help** Outputs help text and usage summary.

**-V** or **--version** Outputs version number of the tool.

**--pgpfp** Outputs the fingerprints of the PGP Master keys used for signing new versions of PuTTY.

=========================================================

Using PuTTYgen on Windows to generate SSH key pairs
===================================================

This page is about PuTTYgen on Windows. For the Linux version, see [here](/ssh/putty/linux/puttygen).

PuTTYgen is an key generator tool for creating [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) for [PuTTY](/ssh/putty/download). It is analogous to the [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen) tool used in some other SSH implementations.

The basic function is to create public and private key pairs. PuTTY stores keys in its own format in `.ppk` files. However, the tool can also convert keys to and from other formats.

`PuTTYgen.exe` on Windows is a graphical tool. A [command-line version](/ssh/putty/linux/puttygen) is available for Linux.

PuTTYgen download and install
-----------------------------

PuTTYgen is normally installed as part of the normal PuTTY `.msi` package installation. There is no need for a separate PuTTYgen download. [Download the PuTTY installation package](/ssh/putty/download). For detailed installation instructions, see [PuTTY installation instructions](/ssh/putty/windows/install).

Running PuTTYgen
----------------

Go to Windows **Start menu** → **All Programs** → **PuTTY** → **PuTTYgen**.

![PuTTYgen started](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/PuTTYgen_started-2.png)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a new key pair for authentication
------------------------------------------

To create a new key pair, select the type of key to generate from the bottom of the screen (using `SSH-2 RSA` with 2048 bit key size is good for most people; another good well-known alternative is `ECDSA`).

Then click **Generate**, and start moving the mouse within the Window. Putty uses mouse movements to collect randomness. The exact way you are going to move your mouse cannot be predicted by an external attacker. You may need to move the mouse for some time, depending on the size of your key. As you move it, the green progress bar should advance.

Once the progress bar becomes full, the actual key generation computation takes place. This may take from several seconds to several minutes. When complete, the public key should appear in the Window. You can now specify a [passphrase](/ssh/passphrase) for the key.

You should save at least the private key by clicking **Save private key**. It may be advisable to also save the public key, though it can be later regenerated by loading the private key (by clicking **Load**).

![PuTTYgen generating RSA SSH key](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/PuTTYgen_generating_RSA_SSH_key-2.png)

We strongly recommended using a passphrase be for private key files intended for interactive use. If keys are needed for automation (e.g., with [WinSCP](/ssh/winscp/), then they may be left without a passphrase.

![puttygen created key and asking for passphase to save private key](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/puttygen_created_key_and_asking_for_passphase_to_save_private_key-2.png)

Installing the public key as an authorized key on a server
----------------------------------------------------------

With both [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) and [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) servers, access to an account is granted by adding the public key to a [~/.ssh/authorized_keys](/ssh/authorized_keys) file on the server.

To install the public key, Log into the server, edit the `authorized_keys` file with your favorite editor, and cut-and-paste the public key output by the above command to the `authorized_keys` file. Save the file. Configure PuTTY to use your private key file (here `keyfile.ppk`). Then test if login works. See [configuring public key authentication for PuTTY](/ssh/putty/public-key-authentication).

Managing SSH keys
-----------------

In larger organizations, the number of SSH keys on servers and clients can easily grow to tens of thousands, in some cases to millions of keys. In large quantities, SSH keys can become a massive security risk and they can violate compliance requirements.

[Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager) can manage PuTTY keys in addition to OpenSSH and Tectia keys. It works with legacy keys on traditional servers as well as dynamic and keyless elastic environments in the cloud. Any larger organization should ensure they have proper provisioning and termination processes for SSH keys as part of their Identify and Access Management (IAM) practice.

Changing the passphase of a key 
-------------------

It is recommended that all SSH keys be regenerated and changed periodically. The Universal SSH Key Manager can automate this. Just changing the passphrase is no substitute, but it is better than nothing. These instructions can also be used to add a passphrase to a key that was created without one.

To change the passphrase, click on **Load** to load an existing key, then enter a new passphrase, and click **Save private key** to save the private key with the new passphrase. Be sure to properly destroy and wipe the old key file. Creating a new file with a new passphrase will not help if the old file remains available.

SSH keys are authentication credentials
---------------------------------------

SSH (Secure Shell) is used for managing networks, operating systems, and configurations. It is also inside many [file transfer tools](/ssh/sftp/) and configuration management tools. Every major corporation uses it, in every data center.

SSH keys enable the automation that makes modern cloud services and other computer-dependent services possible and cost-effective. They offer convenience and improved security when properly managed.

Functionally SSH keys resemble passwords. They grant access and control who can access what. In [identity and access management](/iam/), they need similar policies, provisioning, and termination as user accounts and passwords. One cannot have confidentiality, integrity, or any guarantees of continued availability of systems without controlling SSH keys.

Technically the keys are cryptographic keys using a [public key cryptosystem](/cryptography). However, functionally they are authentication credentials and need to be managed as such.

### Authorized keys define who can access each system

Authorized keys are [public keys](/cryptography/public-key) that grant access. They are analogous to locks that the corresponding private key can open.

For more information, see the dedicated page on [authorized keys](/academy/ssh/authorized-keys-file).

### Identity keys identify users and provide access

Identity keys are private keys that an SSH client uses to authenticate itself when logging into an SSH server. They are analogous to physical keys that can open one or more locks.

Authorized keys and identity keys are jointly called _user keys_. They relate to user authentication, as opposed to host keys that are used for host authentication.

For more information, see the dedicated page on [identity keys](/ssh/identity-key).

### Certificate-based user authentication

[PKI certificates](/pki) can also be used for authentication. In this case, the user still has a private key but also has a certificate associated with the key. The technology is supported in both [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh) and [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh), with some differences.

Device authentication keys
--------------------------

### Host keys authenticate servers

Host keys are used for authenticating hosts, i.e., computers. Their purpose is to prevent [man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle). See the separate page on [host keys](/ssh/host-key) for more information.

Certificate-based host authentication can be a very attractive alternative in large organizations. It allows device authentication keys to be rotated and managed conveniently and every connection to be secured.

### Known host keys

One of the unique features of SSH is that by default, it trusts and remembers the host's key when first connecting to it. This was a key differentiator that allowed SSH to be deployed grass-roots, as there was no centralized key infrastructure for hosts in 1995, and still isn't today (2017), with exemption of SSL certificates for web servers. The resulting ease of deployment was one of the main reasons SSH became successful.

The memorized host keys are called _known host keys_ and they are stored in a file called `known_hosts` in OpenSSH. As long as host keys don't change, this appoach is very easy to use and provides fairly good security. However, in large organization and when the keys change, maintaining known hosts files can become very time-consuming. Using certificates for host keys is recommended in that case. [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh) supports standard X.509 certificates for hosts. OpenSSH has its own proprietary certificate format. The advantage of standard-based certificates is that they can be issued by any certificate authority (CA), whereas no reliable CAs exist for OpenSSH keys.

Session keys
------------

A session key in SSH is an encryption key used for encrypting the bulk of the data in a connection. The session key is negotiated during the connection and then used with a symmetric encryption algorithm and a message authentication code algorithm to protect the data. For more information, see the separate page on [session keys](/ssh/session-key).

How to configure key-based authentication
-----------------------------------------

Key based authentication in SSH is called [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication). It is easy to configure by end users in the default configuration. On the other hand, security-conscious organizations need to establish clear policies for provisioning and terminating key-based access.

### How to set up public key authentication for OpenSSH

SSH keys are typically configured in an [authorized_keys](/ssh/authorized_keys/) file in `.ssh` subdirectory in the user's home directory. Typically a system administrator would first create a key using `ssh-keygen` and then install it as an authorized key on a server using the `ssh-copy-id` tool. See also the dedicated page on [configuring authorized keys for OpenSSH](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys/openssh).

We recommend using [passphrases](/ssh/passphrase) for all identity keys used for interactive access. In principle we recommend using passphrases for automated access as well, but this is often not practical.

### Storing keys in ssh-agent for single sign-on

SSH comes with a program called `ssh-agent`, which can hold user's decrypted private keys in memory and use them to authenticate logins. The agent can also be used to access keys on a smartcard or in a Hardware Security Module (HSM). See the documentation for [ssh-agent](/ssh/agent) on how to set it up.

The connection to the SSH agent can be forwarded to a server, so that single sign-on also works from that server onwards. That feature should be used with care, as it allows a compromised server to use the user's credentials from the original agent. Agent forwarding can, however, be a major convenience feature for power users in less security critical environments.

To enable agent forwarding, set `AllowAgentForwarding` to `yes` in [/etc/ssh/sshd_config](/ssh/sshd_config) on the server and `ForwardAgent` to `yes` in the client configuration file [/etc/ssh/ssh_config](/ssh/config).

### Recommended key sizes

We recommend selecting key sizes according to [NIST SP 800-57](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4.pdf). The default key sizes used by the `ssh-keygen` tool are generally of acceptable strength. In fact, since the protocol never reveals the public keys that are acceptable for user authentication, the algorithms used for the keys are not as critical as they are in, for example, PKI certificates.

For RSA keys, 2048 bits is probably a good choice today (2017). However, many cryptographers now recommend switching to ECDSA keys and think that advances in factoring large integers may make RSA keys vulnerable in the near/mid-term. For ECDSA we recommend using 521 bit (sic!) keys, even though 384 or even 256 bit keys probably would be safe. There is just no practical benefit from using smaller keys.

### Identity key location

Identity keys are usually stored in a user's `.ssh` directory, for example, `.ssh/ssh_id_rsa`. The default identity key file name starts with `id_<algorithm>`. However, it is possible to specify any file name and any location when creating a private key, and provide the path name with the `-i` option to the SSH client. For example, `ssh -i /home/ylo/secure/my-key ec2-user@awshost.domain.my` would use a private key from the file `my-key` for authentication.

The default identity key location can also be configured in [/etc/ssh/ssh_config](/ssh/config) or the user's `.ssh/config` file using the `IdentityFile` option.

### Authorized key location

When a user tries to log in using key-based authentication, the OpenSSH server looks for authorized keys from a directory specifies in the [server configuration](/ssh/sshd_config) using the `AuthorizedKeysFile` option. The default is `.ssh/authorized_keys` in the user's home directory.

However, having the authorized keys stored in the user's home directory means that the user can add new keys that authorize logins to his/her account. This is convenient, but the user can then give these keys to friends or colleagues, or even sell them for Bitcoins (this has actually [happened](https://news.bitcoin.com/looting-fox-sabotage-shapeshift/)). SSH keys are furthermore permanent and remain valid until expressly removed.

If authorized keys are added for [root](/iam/user/root) or service accounts, they easily remain valid even after the person who installed them has left the organization. They are also a convenient way for hackers to establish permanent presence on a system if there is no detection and alerts about unauthorized new keys.

For these reasons, most larger organizations want to move authorized keys to a root-owned location and established a controlled [provisioning and termination process for them](/iam/ssh-key-management).

### Moving SSH keys to a root-owned location

In principle, moving SSH keys to a root-owned location is easy:

1.  Create a suitable root-owned directory, e.g., `/etc/ssh/keys`, under which authorized keys are stored.
    
2.  Create a subdirectory under this directory for each user, and move each user's `authorized_keys` file to `/etc/ssh/keys/<user>/authorized_keys`.
    
3.  Finally, change set `AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/keys/%u/authorized_keys` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
    

In practice, however, this is not always so simple, especially in larger environments. User names may come from directories (e.g., [Active Directory](/iam/active-directory) or LDAP). Many organizations have varying OpenSSH versions, including very old systems or custom SSH builds that have non-standard built-in paths. We recommend using key management tools such as [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager) to hide this complexity in larger environments. These tools can also implement a provisioning, termination, and approval workflow for keys and alerts about unauthorized changes made by root users.

### OpenSSH's limitation on the number of private keys

The OpenSSH server has a feature (I would call it a bug) that it counts testing whether a particular key can be used for authentication as an authentication attempt. This has the consequence that if the user has more than five keys in `.ssh`, only some of them work. This often causes key-based authentication to fail and is often difficult for users to figure out. The way around this is to explicitly specify the private key to use using the `-i` option. An alternative is to adjust the `MaxAuthTries` session on the server, but this is not a full solution and it is undesirable to increase the number of attempts for password authentication.

What do SSH keys look like
--------------------------

An authorized key can look like this:

    ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBN+Mh3U/3We4VYtV1QmWUFIzFLTUeegl1Ao5/QGtCRGAZn8bxX9KlCrrWISIjSYAwCajIEGSPEZwPNMBoK8XD8Q= ylo@klar

An identity key can look like this:

    -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY----- MHcCAQEEIJWbvSW7h50HPwG+bWR3DXgQ6YhOxYbe0ifr1rRUvsUuoAoGCCqGSM49 AwEHoUQDQgAE34yHdT/dZ7hVi1XVCZZQUjMUtNR56CXUCjn9Aa0JEYBmfxvFf0qU KutYhIiNJgDAJqMgQZI8RnA80wGgrxcPxA== -----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----

How does authentication in SSH work?
------------------------------------

Initializing a connection in SSH consists of:

*   Negotiating the version of the protocol to use
    
*   Negotiating cryptographic algorithms and other options to use
    
*   Negotiating a one-time session key for encrypting the rest of the session
    
*   Authenticating the server host using its host key
    
*   Authenticating the user using a password, public key authentication, or other means.
    

After this, data can be exchanged, including terminal data, graphics, and files.

![SSH Key - Authentication Using SSH Keys](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/SSH_Key_-_Authentication_Using_SSH_Keys-2.png)

### Public key authentication

The key-based authentication mechanism in SSH is called [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication). Essentially, some session-specific data is signed using the private identity key. The signature is then sent to the server that checks if the key used for signing is configured as an authorized key. The server then verifies the digital signature using the public key in the authorized key. The identity key is never sent to the server.

The essential thing in public key authentication is that it allows one server to access another server without having to type in a password. This powerful feature is why it is so widely used for file transfers (using the [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) protocol) and configuration management. It is also commonly used by system administrators for single sign-on.

How common are SSH keys and what is the risk
--------------------------------------------

SSH keys turn out to be extremely common and widely used. Many large organizations have accumulated them for twenty years without any controls. A typical Fortune 500 enterprise has several million keys granting access to their servers. In one customer case, we examined 500 applications and 15,000 servers, and found **3,000,000** authorized keys and 750,000 unique key pairs. This organization also had **over five million daily logins** using keys. The keys were used for executing financial transactions, updating configurations, moving log data, file transfers, interactive logins by system administrators, and many other purposes.

It is turning out that most large enterprises have hundreds of thousands or even millions of keys. These keys are access that is unaccounted for, and may risk the entire enterprise.

How to eliminate SSH keys entirely
----------------------------------

The [Zero Trust Suite](/ssh-zero-trust-access-key-and-secrets-management) by SSH can be used to eliminate SSH keys from servers entirely and establish policy-based access control and session logging across the enterprise. It also eliminates most of the administrative burden of managing keys, while still providing the benefits: automation and single sign-on.


/. 154 [Authorized Key](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/authorized-key)
=========================================================

Authorized Key in SSH
=====================

An _authorized key_ in SSH is a [public key](/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys) used for granting login access to users. The authentication mechanism is called [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication).

Authorized keys are configured separately for each user - usually in the [`.ssh/authorized_keys`](/ssh/authorized_keys/) file in the user's home directory. However, the location of the keys can be configured in SSH server configuration files, and is often changed to a root-owned location in more secure environments.

Technically, an authorized key looks like this:

    ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBN+Mh3U/3We4VYtV1QmWUFIzFLTUeegl1Ao5/QGtCRGAZn8bxX9KlCrrWISIjSYAwCajIEGSPEZwPNMBoK8XD8Q= ylo@klar

* [Provisioning](#provisioning) 
* [Authorized Key Provisioning in OpenSSH](#authorized-key-provisioning-in-openssh) 
* [Beware of the Key Management Problem](#beware-of-the-key-management-problem)

Authorized keys are Access Credentials
--------------------------------------

Authorized keys configure access credentials and grant access to servers. They must be properly managed as part of [identity and access management](/academy/iam) and are relevant for all [compliance standards](/compliance/) and cybersecurity-related laws, such as [Sarbanes-Oxley](/compliance/sarbanes-oxley/) for public companies, [HIPAA](/compliance/hipaa/security-rule) for health care, and [FISMA/NIST SP 800-53](/compliance/nist-800-53/) for US government agencies.

[Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) is a popular solution for managing the keys and establishing proper provisioning and termination processes.


Provisioning
------------

Authorized keys are the only kind of credential that users are commonly able to self-provision. It is possible to prevent self-provisioning in SSH, but that requires a configuration change. The operation is often called _lock-down_, and it is usually one of the first steps in [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/).

Each SSH implementation has its own tools for creating and distributing SSH keys. Different implementations also use different formats for the key files.

Typically provisioning an authorized key involves generating a key pair, installing the public key as an authorized key, and using the [private key](/cryptography/private-key) as an [identity key](/ssh/identity-key).

Various SSH clients have their own key generation tools. [PuTTY](/ssh/putty/) comes with [PuTTYgen](/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen).

### Authorized Key Provisioning in OpenSSH

With [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/), a key pair can be created using the [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen/) tool. The public key can then be copied to a server using the [ssh-copy-id](/ssh/copy-id) tool.

The whole process is very simple and only takes a few minutes. With default configuration, anyone with access to a user account on a server can configure additional SSH keys for it.

Beware of the Key Management Problem
------------------------------------

Given that generating and and installing SSH keys is so easy, they can easily proliferate and expose the organization to attack spread and other disks. It is important to pay attention to key management and address it in security policies and audits early on. Even in an organization of only a few dozen people there can be hundreds or thousands of authorized keys. Some larger enterprises have several million keys granting access to their production servers.



/. 155 [Authorized Keys File](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/authorized-keys-file)
=========================================================

Authorized Keys File in SSH
===========================

The `authorized_keys` file in [SSH](/ssh/) specifies the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the file is configured. It is a highly important configuration file, as it **configures permanent access** using [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) and needs [proper management](/iam/ssh-key-management/).

The default configuration in most SSH implementations allows users to deploy new [authorized keys](/academy/ssh/authorized-key) for themselves and anyone they like. Such access is permanent, and may bypass privileged access management systems.

Self-provisioning is anathema to [identity and access management](/academy/iam) and having a controlled access provisioning and termination process, as required by most cybersecurity [laws and regulations](/compliance/).

When organizations deploy a formal process for [managing access using SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management/), one of the first steps is usually lock-down, basically moving the `authorized_keys` files to root-owned locations, which prevents self-provisioning for normal users.

[Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) comes with [support service](/resources/support/plans) that frequently helps customers in SSH key management. OpenSSH offers no support services.

Automating Management of Authorized Keys 
-------------------

Managing `authorized_keys` files manually is costly and error-prone. We had a customer with a 15-person dedicated team for manually installing SSH keys. Another customer estimated having 200 system administrators who spend 10% of their time setting up SSH keys. Automating the process can **save a lot of money** and **eliminate outages due to human errors**.

Furthermore, SSH keys grant access and having that access under control is required by laws and regulations such as [HIPAA](/compliance/hipaa/security-rule) for the health care industry, [Sarbanes-Oxley](/compliance/sarbanes-oxley/) for all US public companies, [PCI DSS](/compliance/pci) for credit card processing, and [FISMA/NIST SP 800-53](/compliance/nist-800-53/) for US federal government agencies.

=========================================================

Configuring Authorized Keys for OpenSSH
=======================================

[Authorized keys](/academy/ssh/authorized-key) specify which users are allowed to log into a server using [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) in [SSH](/ssh/).

In OpenSSH, authorized keys are configured separately for each user, typically in a file called authorized_keys.

Location of the Authorized Keys File
------------------------------------

With [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/), the authorized keys are by default configured in `.ssh/authorized_keys` in the user's home directory. Many OpenSSH versions also look for `ssh/authorized_keys2`. Some organizations use custom OpenSSH builds with different default paths.

The `AuthorizedKeysFile` configuration option in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` specifies where the [SSH server](/ssh/server) looks for authorized keys. The option may contain more than one location, separated by spaces. %% is replaced by literal %, %h by the home directory of the user being authenticated, and %u by the login name of the user. For example, `/var/ssh/%u/ak` would cause the SSH server to look for authorized keys for the user `jane` from `/var/ssh/jane/ak`.

The `AuthorizedKeysCommand` option can be used to specify a program that is used to fetch authorized keys for a user. The program gets as argument the user name for which to look for keys. A common use of this option is to fetch authorized keys from an [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) directory.

When selecting a solution for managing SSH keys, it is important to ensure it understands SSH configuration files and can parse the locations where keys are stored, and is able to deal with custom builds used in the organization, if any. Support for the `AuthorizedKeysCommand` may also be an important consideration, particularly in cloud environments.

Generating New Keys
-------------------

New key pairs can be generated using the [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen/) program and the [ssh-copy-id](/ssh/copy-id) tool can be used for copying keys in an `authorized_keys` file on a server. It is almost too easy, and that is one of the reasons why the number of SSH keys has become so uncontrolled.

In a locked-down environment, a proper key management tool such as [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) would normally be used. Such tools can handle keys in root-owned locations and alert if a [root user](/iam/user/root) installs an unauthorized key.

Format of the Authorized Keys File 
-------------------

In OpenSSH, a user's authorized keys file lists keys that are authorized for authenticating as that user, one per line. Lines starting with `#` and empty lines are ignored.

Each line contains a public [SSH key](/ssh/key/). The public key may be preceded by options that control what can be done with the key.

The following options are supported in `authorized_keys` files.

#### cert-authority

Indicates that the key should be trusted as a certificate authority to validate proprietary OpenSSH certificates for authenticating as that user. We **strongly recommend against using this option**, as using OpenSSH certificates for user authentication makes it **impossible to audit** who has access to the server by inspecting server configuration files, and no trustworthy OpenSSH certificate authority exists.

#### command="cmd"

Forces a command to be executed when this key is used for authentication. This is also called **command restriction** or **forced command**. The effect is to limit the privileges given to the key, and specifying this options is often important for implementing the **principle of least privilege**. Without this option, the key grants unlimited access as that user, including obtaining shell access.

It is a common error when configuring [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) file transfers to accidentally omit this option and permit shell access.

#### environment="NAME=value"

Specifies an environment variable and its value to be added to the environment before executing shell or command.

#### from="pattern-list"

Specifies a **source restriction** or **from-stanza**, restricting the set of [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) or host names from which the reverse-mapped [DNS names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) from which the key can be used.

The patterns may use `*` as wildcard, and may specify IP addresses using `*` or in [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) address/masklen notation. Only hosts whose IP address or DNS name matches one of the patterns are allowed to use the key.

More than one pattern may be specified by separating them by commas. An exclamation mark `!` can be used in front of a pattern to negate it.

#### no-agent-forwarding

Prevents forwarding the SSH authentication agent.

#### no-port-forwarding

Prevents port forwarding for connections using this key. This can be important for, e.g., keys intended to be used only with [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) file transfers.

Forgetting to disable port forwarding can allow [SSH tunneling](/ssh/tunneling/) to be performed using keys only intended for file transfers.

#### no-pty

Prevents allocation of a [pseudo-tty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal) for connections using the key.

#### no-user-rc

Disables execution of `.ssh/rc` when using the key.

#### no-x11-forwarding

Prevents [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) forwarding.

#### permitopen="host:port"

Limits port forwarding only to the specified [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers) on the specified host. `*` as port allows all ports. More than one host and port can be specified using commas.

#### principals="principals"

On a `cert-authority` line, specifies which users (principal name in proprietary OpenSSH certificates) can log in using their certificate. Use of this option (or `cert-authority`) is **not recommended**, as it makes impossible to audit (by inspecting the server) how many different keys grant access as that user, and OpenSSH certificate authorities are not generally very secure.

#### tunnel="n"

Specifies a tunnel device number to be used if the client requests IP packet tunneling after logging in using a key with this option. IP tunneling is a rarely used option, but can enable full [VPN access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) to the internal network over SSH.

/. 157 [CAC and PIV Smartcards](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/cac-piv-card-smartcard-authentication)
=========================================================

CAC Card, PIV Card, PKI Authentication for SSH
==============================================

Government organizations operate under strict information security guidelines. Their security policies require encrypted and strongly authenticated access methods to be used with high-value assets. In the context of the ubiquitous [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) this often means the use of certificate authentication.

While PKI and certificates offer a strong, scalable, and centrally managed authentication of users and servers, they are still vulnerable to attacks on the private keys of the end-entities. Stealing a user's private key allows an attacker to impersonate that user, which may lead to serious security breaches. In high-security environments the use of certificates is often combined with the use of hardware security tokens such as smartcards or USB tokens.

Combining hardware tokens or smartcards with certificate authentication provides the advantage that the private key of an entity cannot be stolen by [malware that collects SSH keys](/malware/).

In the governmental context commonly used security tokens are:

*   CAC card ([Common Access Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card))
    
*   PIV card ([Personal Identity Verification Card](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/))

* [CAC Card with Tectia SSH =grid2](#cac-card-with-tectia-ssh-=grid2) 
* [PIV Card with Tectia SSH =cell](#piv-card-with-tectia-ssh-=cell)


CAC Card with Tectia SSH =grid2
-------------------------------

The DoD Common Access Card is an identification card that is issued to the personnel of US Department of Defense. CAC is a smartcard that functions as the standard identification for active duty uniformed service personnel, selected reserve personnel, civilian employees of DoD, and some contractors that work for DoD. Common Access Card also works as the principal token for physical access to buildings and it **provides access to DoD computer networks and systems**.

The access to computers, online systems and networks is based on a PKI certificate and an associated private key that are stored on the chip of the CAC card. The certificate is presented to the server, while the private key remains on the card (and only on the card). Using the private key on the CAC requires the user to be in possession of the card, and aware of the PIN or passphrase that protects the key. The card and the PIN form the required two factors for authentication.

[Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) is the leading commercial and professionally supported implementation of the Secure Shell protocol. Tectia SSH supports PKI authentication as well as the use of certificates on hardware security tokens and smartcards, such as CAC. Using Tectia SSH with CAC requires no patching or additional components. CAC is supported out-of-the-box.

PIV Card with Tectia SSH =cell
------------------------------

While the CAC is limited to the personnel and contractors of the Department of Defense, the other branches of the US Federal government use a separate but similar authentication and identification system - the Personal Identity Verification standard ([PIV](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/)).

Like the CAC, the PIV card is also a smartcard that contains a certificate and a private key to be used to gain access to computers, networks, and online resources. PIV is the standard method for strong authentication within the US Federal government.

The PIV system is described in Federal Information Processing Standards publication [FIPS 201-2](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.201-2.pdf) (replaced by FIPS 201-3 now).

Tectia SSH's support for PKI authentication covers also the use of PIV cards.

Setting up public key authentication
------------------------------------

Key based authentication in SSH is called [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication). The purpose of `ssh-copy-id` is to make setting up public key authentication easier. The process is as follows.

### Generate an SSH Key

With [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/), an SSH key is created using [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen/). In the simplest form, just run `ssh-keygen` and answer the questions. The following example illustates this.

    # ssh-keygen Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ylo/.ssh/id_rsa): mykey Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  Enter same passphrase again:  Your identification has been saved in mykey. Your public key has been saved in mykey.pub. The key fingerprint is: SHA256:GKW7yzA1J1qkr1Cr9MhUwAbHbF2NrIPEgZXeOUOz3Us ylo@klar The key's randomart image is: +---[RSA 2048]----+ |.*++ o.o.        | |.+B + oo.        | | +++ *+.         | | .o.Oo.+E        | |    ++B.S.       | |   o * =.        | |  + = o          | | + = = .         | |  + o o          | +----[SHA256]-----+ #

Creating a key pair (public key and private key) only takes a minute. The key files are usually stored in the `~/.ssh` directory.

### Copy the key to a server

Once an SSH key has been created, the `ssh-copy-id` command can be used to install it as an [authorized key](/academy/ssh/authorized-key) on the server. Once the key has been authorized for SSH, it grants access to the server without a password.

Use a command like the following to copy SSH key:

    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey user@host

This logs into the server host, and copies keys to the server, and configures them to grant access by adding them to the [authorized_keys](/ssh/authorized_keys) file. The copying may ask for a password or other authentication for the server.

Only the public key is copied to the server. The private key should never be copied to another machine.

### Test the new key

Once the key has been copied, it is best to test it:

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey user@host

The login should now complete without asking for a password. Note, however, that the command might ask for the passphrase you specified for the key.

### Troubleshooting

There are a number of reasons why the test might fail:

*   The server might not be configured to accept public key authentication. Make sure [/etc/ssh/sshd_config](/ssh/sshd_config) on the server contains `PubkeyAuthentication yes`. Remember to restart the [sshd](/ssh/sshd/) process on the server.
    
*   If trying to login as [root](/iam/user/root), the server might not be configured to allow root logins. Make sure `/etc/sshd_config` includes `PermitRootLogin yes`, `PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`, or `without-password`. If it is set to `forced-commands-only`, the key must be manually configured to use a forced command (see `command=` option in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
    
*   Make sure the client allows public key authentication. Check that [/etc/ssh/config](/ssh/config) includes `PubkeyAuthentication yes`.
    
*   Try adding `-v` option to the `ssh` command used for the test. Read the output to see what it says about whether the key is tried and what authentication methods the server is willing to accept.
    
*   OpenSSH only allows a maximum of five keys to be tried authomatically. If you have more keys, you must specify which key to use using the `-i` option to `ssh`.
    

How ssh-copy-id works
---------------------

`ssh-copy-id` uses the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) to connect to the target host and upload the SSH user key. The command edits the `authorized_keys` file on the server. It creates the `.ssh` directory if it doesn't exist. It creates the authorized keys file if it doesn't exist. Effectively, ssh key copied to server.

It also checks if the key already exists on the server. Unless the `-f` option is given, each key is only added to the authorized keys file once.

It further ensures that the key files have appropriate permissions. Generally, the user's home directory or any file or directory containing keys files should not be writable by anyone else. Otherwise someone else could add new authorized keys for the user and gain access. Private key files should not be readable by anyone else.

Some best practices for SSH keys
--------------------------------

SSH keys are very useful, but can lead to problems if they are not properly managed. They are access credentials just like user names and passwords. If they are not properly removed when people leave or systems are decommissioned, no-one may any longer know who really has access to which systems and data. Many large organizations have ended up having millions of SSH keys.


### Use a passphrase when possible

It is recommended that keys used for single sign-on have a passphrase to prevent use of the key if it is stolen or inadvertantlyleaked. The [ssh-agent](/ssh/agent) and [ssh-add](/ssh/add) programs can be used to avoid having to enter the passphrase every time the key is used.

Generally all keys used for interactive access should have a passphrase. Keys without a passphrase are useful for fully automated processes. They allow shell scripts, programs, and management tools to log into servers unattended. This is often used for backups and data transfers between information systems.

### Add a command restriction when possible

The `copy-id` tool does not automatically add command restrictions to keys. Using command restrictions is highly recommended when the key is used for automating operations, such as running a report for fetching some files. A command restriction is basically a `command="<permitted command>"` option added to the beginning of the line in the server's [authorized_keys](/ssh/authorized_keys/) file.

### Managing SSH keys

Anyone having more than a few dozen servers is strongly recommended to [manage SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management). Not managing the keys exposes the organization to substantial risks, including loss of confidentiality, insertion of fraudulent transactions, and outright destruction of systems.

The `copy-id` tool can be dangerous. It can easily accidentally install multiple keys or unintended keys as authorized. The logic for choosing which key to install is convoluted. Extra authorized keys grant permanent access. They can later be used to spread attacks host-to-host, and the more keys there are, the higher the risk. It also violates all [regulatory compliance requirements](/compliance/).

The [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager) is a widely used product for managing SSH keys.


Command-line options
--------------------

The sample below presents _ssh-copy-id_ command line syntax:

    ssh-copy-id [-f] [-n] [-i identity file] [-p port] [-o ssh_option] [user@]hostname

The options have the following meaning:

**-f** Don't check if the key is already configured as an authorized key on the server. Just add it. This can result in multiple copies of the key in `authorized_keys` files.

**-i** Specifies the identity file that is to be copied (default is `~/.ssh/id_rsa`). If this option is not provided, this adds all keys listed by `ssh-add -L`. Note: it can be multiple keys and **adding extra authorized keys can easily happen accidentally**! If `ssh-add -L` returns no keys, then the most recently modified key matching `~/.ssh/id*.pub`, excluding those matching `~/.ssh/*-cert.pub`, will be used.

**-n** Just print the key(s) that would be installed, without actually installing them.

**-o ssh_option** Pass `-o ssh_option` to the SSH client when making the connection. This can be used for overriding configuration settings for the client. See [ssh command line options](/ssh/command) and the possible configuration options in [ssh_config](/ssh/config).

**-p port** Connect to the specifed SSH port on the server, instead of the default port 22.

**-h** or **-?** Print usage summary.

Ssh-copy-id on Mac
------------------

While MacOS includes SSH, it does not include `ssh-copy-id` out of the port. However, according to some sources MacOS 10.12.4 includes it, and presumably newever versions include it as well.

You can test whether your Mac has it by opening a terminal window (Finder / Go / Utilities / Terminal) and typing `ssh-copy-id`.

If your system does not have it, there are many ways to install ssh-copy-id Mac version.

### Installation using Homebrew

To install it using Homebrew, use the following command. You need to have the `brew` command installed.

    brew install ssh-copy-id

### Installation from MacPorts

The following command will install it using MacPorts. You need to have the `port` command installed.

    sudo port install openssh +ssh-copy-id

### Installation using Curl

The following command can be used to install a Mac version directly. Note that as a general rule we do not recommend piping any commands from the network to the shell, like this does. Only use this method if you fully trust the source. The advantage of this method is that it does not need any special software - `curl` comes preinstalled.

* [PGP / GPG Private Key Protection](#pgp-/-gpg-private-key-protection)

What is Passphrase?
-------------------

A _passphrase_ is similar to a password. However, a password generally refers to something used to authenticate or log into a system. A passphrase generally refers to a secret used to protect an encryption key. Commonly, an actual encryption key is derived from the passphrase and used to encrypt the protected resource.

It Should Be Hard to Guess
--------------------------

A good passphrase should have at least 15, preferably 20 characters and be difficult to guess. It should contain upper case letters, lower case letters, digits, and preferably at least one punctuation character. No part of it should be derivable from personal information about the user or his/her family.

Sometimes there is a need to [generate random passwords or phrases automatically](/ssh/passphrase-generator).

Protecting a Private Key
------------------------

The purpose of the passphrase is usually to encrypt the private key. This makes the key file by itself useless to an attacker. It is not uncommon for files to leak from backups or decommissioned hardware, and hackers commonly exfiltrate files from compromised systems.

To use an encrypted key, the passphrase is also needed. In a way, they are two separate factors of authentication.


Protecting SSH keys
-------------------

[SSH keys](/ssh/key) are used for authenticating users in information systems. The SSH keys themselves are [private keys](/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys); the private key is further encrypted using a symmetric encryption key derived from a passphrase. The key derivation is done using a hash function.

Passphrases are commonly used for keys belonging to interactive users. Their use is strongly recommended to reduce risk of keys accidentally leaking from, e.g., backups or decommissioned disk drives.

In practice, however, most SSH keys are without a passphrase. There is no human to type in something for keys used for automation. The passphrase would have to be hard-coded in a script or stored in some kind of vault, where it can be retrieved by a script. An attacker with sufficient privileges can easily fool such a system. Thus, there would be relatively little extra protection for automation.

More than 90% of all SSH keys in most large enterprises are without a passphrase. However, this depends on the organization and its security policies.

Use of proper [SSH key management tools](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager)is recommended to ensure proper access provisioning and termination processes, regularly changing keys, and [regulatory compliance](/compliance/).

SSH keys can be generated with tools such as [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen) and [PuTTYgen](/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen). These tools ask for a phrase to encrypt the generated key with.

PGP / GPG Private Key Protection
--------------------------------

Private keys used in email encryption tools like [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) are also protected in a similar way. Such applications typically use private keys for digital signing and for decrypting email messages and files.


/. 160 [Passphrase Generator](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/passphrase-generator)
=========================================================

Passphrase Generator Using Basic Shell Commands
===============================================

People often ask about passphrase generators. Basically, how to generate a strong passphrase. Many web sites also offer passphrase generation. However, the problem with online sites is that you can never fully trust them, unless the way they generate passwords can be fully audited. Surprisingly many of them even send the generated passwords in plain text HTTP over the Internet for anyone to see!

Even when the communication is HTTPS-protected, it is impossible to know how the passwords are generated on the server side and whether they are stored. There could be a [man-in-the-middle attack](/attack/man-in-the-middle) being performed on the connection. Such attacks are surprisingly common, and routinely performed by intelligence agencies using fakes certificates. Some malware and adware - even ones pre-installed on Windows laptops in the case of the [Lenovo Superfish scandal](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/02/lenovo_superfish_scandal_the_result_of_evil_or_incompetence.html) - also spy on encrypted web traffic. Furthermore, web browsers cache pages, and you don't really want your passphrase to remain in a cache file for weeks, do you?

* [SSH keys should be managed](#ssh-keys-should-be-managed)


Browser-based online password generator
---------------------------------------

We offer an [online random password generator](/iam/password/generator) that is entirely browser-based. Unlike other password generators, there is no server component that needs to be trusted. The password does not end up in caches. That is the only online password/passphrase generator we can recommend.

Generating passphrase on the command line
-----------------------------------------

It is also easy to generate random passwords and passphrase on the command line. This can be done with basic Unix commands. The generated passphrases are too complex to remember, but are very useful for applications where passphrases are needed for protecting machine keys and for [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management). The same commands can be used to generate passwords.

The basic idea is to read from `/dev/urandom`, a device that produces high-quality cryptographically secure pseudo-random data. The device works by collecting entropy for interrupt timings, device latencies, keypresses, packet timings, and on some systems, hardware randomness sources. It then uses strong cryptographic hash functions to produce a continuous random stream from this data. On many systems, randomness is also carried on across reboots using a random seed file. The output is then formatted to something user-readable.

### Shell commands to generate passphrases

Any of the following commands can be used, depending on what tools are installed in the particular operating system:

        dd if=/dev/urandom bs=16 count=1 2>/dev/null | base64 | sed 's/=//g'

This generates a passphrase with 128 bits of entropy. The output looks like this:

    q4fZq185VKt7LgdNSP5W7A

An alternative to using the `base64` command (which may not be available) is to use something like `sha256sum` (or `md5sum`, `sha1sum`, etc) to generate a passphrase that is hex. Something like the following would work:

      dd if=/dev/urandom bs=32 count=1 2>/dev/null | sha256sum -b | sed 's/ .*//'

This generates a passphrase with 256 bits of entropy. The output looks like this:

    3ed04c7f887dc04fe11ad1f58f0473c88edf966502d66aff43a3583569c945de

How complex does a passphrase need to be?
-----------------------------------------

If you are looking for a password or passphrase that you can remember, you can take characters from the beginning of the output. Generally, at least 15 characters would be recommended to prevent password brute-forcing attacks. In 2012, any eight-character Windows password could be broken by hobbyists [in a few hours](http://www.techspot.com/news/51044-25-gpu-cluster-can-brute-force-windows-password-in-record-time.html). Even most 16-character passwords [can be easily cracked](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2331984/Think-strong-password-Hackers-crack-16-character-passwords-hour.html). For hexadecimal passwords, you should multiply password lengths by 1.5.

Passphrases for keys should be substantially longer than passwords. We recommend having 128 bits of entropy in the passphrase. At least 80 bits is essential. This means 20 hex digits or 14 base-64 digits at the minimum.

SSH keys should be managed
--------------------------

As a reminder, if you have any significant number of servers, make sure to manage your keys properly. They are access credentials that need provisioning and termination processes. See [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager) for more information.


/. 161 [Public Key Authentication](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication)
=========================================================

What is SSH Public Key Authentication?
======================================

The [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) supports many authentication methods. Arguably one the most important of these is Public Key authentication for interactive and automated connections.

Public Key authentication - what and why?
-----------------------------------------

The motivation for using public key authentication over simple passwords is security. Public key authentication provides cryptographic strength that even extremely long passwords can not offer. With [SSH](/ssh/), public key authentication improves security considerably as it frees the users from remembering complicated passwords (or worse yet, writing them down).

In addition to security public key authentication also offers usability benefits - it allows users to implement single sign-on across the [SSH servers](/ssh/server) they connect to. Public key authentication also allows automated, passwordless login that is a key enabler for the countless secure automation processes that execute within enterprise networks globally.

Public key [cryptography](/cryptography/) revolves around a couple of key concepts. The sections below explain these briefly.

### Asymmetric Cryptography - Algorithms

As with any encryption scheme, public key authentication is based on an algorithm. There are several well-researched, secure, and trustworthy algorithms out there - the most common being the likes of RSA and DSA. Unlike the commonly known (symmetric or secret-key) encryption algorithms the public key encryption algorithms work with _two separate keys_. These two keys form a pair that is specific to each user.

### Key Pair - Public and Private

In the SSH public key authentication use case, it is rather typical that the users create (i.e. provision) the key pair for themselves. SSH implementations include easily usable utilities for this (for more information see [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen/) and [ssh-copy-id](/ssh/copy-id)).

Each [SSH key](/ssh/key) pair includes two keys:

*   A [public key](/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys) that is copied to the SSH server(s). Anyone with a copy of the public key can encrypt data which can then only be read by the person who holds the corresponding private key. Once an SSH server receives a public key from a user and considers the key trustworthy, the server marks the key as authorized in its [authorized_keys file](/ssh/authorized_keys/). Such keys are called [authorized keys](/academy/ssh/authorized-key).
    
*   A [private key](/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys) that remains (only) with the user. The possession of this key is proof of the user's identity. Only a user in possession of a private key that corresponds to the public key at the server will be able to authenticate successfully. The private keys need to be stored and handled carefully, and no copies of the private key should be distributed. The private keys used for user authentication are called [identity keys](/ssh/identity-key).
    


Setting Up Public Key Authentication for SSH
--------------------------------------------

The following simple steps are required to set up public key authentication (for SSH):

1.  Key pair is created (typically by the user). This is typically done with [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen/).
    
2.  Private key stays with the user (and only there), while the public key is sent to the server. Typically with the [ssh-copy-id](/ssh/copy-id) utility.
    
3.  Server stores the public key (and "marks" it as [authorized](/ssh/authorized_keys/)).
    
4.  Server will now allow access to anyone who can prove they have the corresponding private key.
    

Handling of the Private Key
---------------------------

It is extremely important that the privacy of the private key is guarded carefully. For most user-driven use cases this is accomplished by encrypting the private key with a [passphrase](/ssh/passphrase).

When a private key is needed the user is asked to supply the passphrase so that the private key can be decrypted. The handling of passphrases can be automated with an [SSH agent](/ssh/agent).

In most [automated](/ssh/automated) use cases (scripts, applications, etc) the private keys are not protected and careful planning and key management practises need to be excercised to remain secure and compliant with regulatory mandates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Chaos to Order - SSH Key Management
----------------------------------------

In environments where users are free to self-provision authentication keys it is common that over the years the numbers of provisioned and deployed keys grow very large. Since there is no way to find out who owns or has originally provisioned a given public key found on a server, and since these keys never expire, the true state of access control in large unmanaged environments can be very unclear or outright chaotic.

Managing and controlling access to servers and other IT infrastructure is a legal requirement for any enterprise that operates on regulated markets such as finance, energy, healthcare, or commerce. These enterprises need to employ solutions for [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/) to control the access granted by [SSH keys](/ssh/key).


/. 162 [SSH Host Key](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/host-key)
=========================================================

What are SSH Host Keys?
=======================

A _host key_ is a cryptographic key used for authenticating computers in the [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/).

Host keys are key pairs, typically using the [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29), [DSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm), or [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) algorithms. Public host keys are stored on and/or distributed to [SSH clients](/ssh/client), and private keys are stored on [SSH servers](/ssh/server).

* [Host Certificates](#host-certificates) 
* [User Keys](#user-keys) 
* [Tools for SSH Host Key Management](#tools-for-ssh-host-key-management)

Host Keys Should Be Unique
--------------------------

Each host (i.e., computer) should have a unique host key. Sharing host keys is strongly not recommended, and can result in vulnerability to [man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle). However, in computing clusters sharing hosts keys may sometimes be acceptable and practical.

Host Keys in OpenSSH
--------------------

In [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/), host keys are usually stored in the `/etc/ssh` directory, in files starting with `ssh_host_<rsa/dsa/ecdsa/ed25519>_key` (the location can be changed in server configuration files).

Host keys are normally generated automatically when OpenSSH is first installed or when the computer is first booted. The [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen/) program can be used for generating additional host keys or for replacing existing keys.

Known Host Keys
---------------

SSH clients store host keys for hosts they have ever connected to. These stored host keys are called _known host keys_, and the collection is often called _known hosts_. In OpenSSH, the collection of known host keys is stored in `/etc/ssh/known_hosts` and in `.ssh/known_hosts` in each user's home directory.


Management of Host Keys
-----------------------

Host keys are cryptographic keys. The private keys should only be accessible to [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser). However, system administrators having root access to a server can obtain the server's private host key. Likewise, if an attacker gains root access to the server, he can obtain a copy of the private host key.

Once the attacker has a copy of the private host key, he can perform [man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle) on the network to obtain user passwords and to inject new commands in other administrative sessions.

It is important to regularly change host keys. It is a complicated process and has to be done with due diligence.

Host Certificates
-----------------

Some SSH implementations support using certificates for authenticating hosts.

[Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) supports standards-compliant [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) certificates for host authentication. This allows the host certificates to be generated and managed using normal certificate management tools in an enterprise.

The free open source [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/) only supports its own proprietary certificate format. Using them requires developing and maintaining internal tools for host certificates.

Using host certificates instead of traditional host keys is generally strongly recommended. We have customers using X.509-compliant host certificates with [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) on over 40,000 hosts in a single enterprise.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Keys
---------

Security architects and administrators should also be aware of the uniquitous use of [SSH keys](/ssh/key/) for user authentication. They are access credentials that should be taken into account in [identity and access](/iam/identity-management).

It turns out that many organizations have 10 times as many SSH keys as they have traditional user names and passwords granting access to their servers. Organizations that use SSH should [assess](/products/ssh-risk-assessment/) their risks and based on the results, start planning for [deploying SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/) as an urgent endeavor. Due to their high numbers, the risk involved, and potentially very costly [compliance ramifications](/compliance/), addressing SSH keys is one of the top-five critical security problems in enterprises today.

Tools for SSH Host Key Management
---------------------------------

Host key management should be seen as part of broader [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/).

The [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) is the tool with the largest number of large deployments.

SSH Key Basics: Introduction to SSH Keys, Their Use & Misuse, and Their Value to Enterprises
============================================================================================

### What Are SSH Keys and Why Are They Important?

The SSH ([Secure Shell](/ssh/protocol)) protocol is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. SSH enables secure system administration and file transfers over insecure networks using encryption to secure the connections between end points.

An [SSH key](/ssh/key) is an access credential, similar to a password, used in the SSH protocol. SSH keys grant, automate and enable remote access to the digital core of nearly every enterprise. They enable major financial institutions, global industrials, tech giants and governments to function securely.

SSH founder, [Tatu Ylönen, invented the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol](/ssh) in 1995.

* [SSH Keys - a target for hackers](#a-target-for-hackers) 
* [Managing SSH Keys - next steps for enterprises](#next-steps-for-enterprises)


### SSH keys are widely used, and widely unmanaged.

SSH keys are extremely common and widely used. Many large organizations have accumulated them for twenty years without any controls. Enterprises can have hundreds of thousands or even millions of keys granting access to their servers. In large enterprises, 90% of SSH keys are typically unused and unmanaged.

### Why SSH Keys are high-stakes risks for enterprises

Unused SSH keys are access that is unaccounted for, and are a target for hackers. Unmanaged keys [pose significant risk to the entire enterprise](https://info.ssh.com/why-ssh-keys-will-make-you-fail-your-audit). [Snowden](https://burningtree.co.uk/lessons-snowden-unmanaged-ssh-key-time-bomb) is widely believed to have exploited weak SSH key management to breach the NSA. A single key in the wrong hands gives hackers undetected access to networks, where they can create new permanent access keys for others.

Many companies lack SSH key policy enforcement. Internal IT specialists create and use SSH keys daily, often for [PAM bypass](https://blog.ssh.com/5-ways-to-bypass-pam) - to gain access to servers for e.g. maintenance without wasting time navigating the company's access management systems.

SSH Keys - a common target for hackers
--------------------------------------

Advanced malware and hackers target SSH keys. Unmanaged, poorly configured SSH keys are particularly attractive:

*   SSH keys provide a **long-term backdoor**. Unmanaged keys, poorly configured keys and insecure credentials are common in large enterprise IT environments.
    
*   SSH keys enable hackers to spread an attack from one server to another. This "**lateral movement**" ability means hackers might be able to access nearly all servers in an enterprise, including disaster recovery and backup data centers
    
*   SSH keys are a popular "**secondary attack vector**" in hacks and data breaches. Common primary attacks include e.g. social engineering, malware or brute force password attack. After the hacker is inside the target network, unmanaged SSH keys are the second step - providing access to critical systems, such as servers with valuable data.
    
*   SSH keys often grant **access to servers with company data**, [credit card payment environments](https://www.ssh.com/compliance/pci/) and [financial data environments](https://www.ssh.com/compliance/sarbanes-oxley/)
    
*   SSH keys are commonly **configured to provide** [**root**](https://www.ssh.com/iam/user/root/) **or** **administrator** access, thus allowing installation of malware, enabling systems to be compromised, or even destroyed
    

Managing SSH Keys - next steps for enterprises
----------------------------------------------

Large enterprises, such as those in finance, insurance, media, tech, healthcare, retail and energy, may have up to millions of SSH keys in circulation in vast complex IT environments.

In addition to the risk of data breach, unmanaged SSH keys are a cause of audit failure and compliance failure.

/. 164 [SSH Key Identities](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/identity-key)
=========================================================

Identity Key in SSH
===================

An identity key is a [private key](/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys) that is used in [SSH](/ssh/) for granting access to servers. They are a kind of [SSH key](/ssh/key/), used for [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication).

In [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/), new identity keys can be created using the [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen/) tool. The tool generates both a private key and a [public key](/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys). The public key can then be installed as an authorized key on a server using the [ssh-copy-id](/ssh/copy-id). Generally each SSH implementation comes with its own tools for generating and installing keys.

While technically similar keys to [host keys](/ssh/host-key), identity keys are used for authenticating users, whereas host keys are used for authenticating computers.

### Contents

* [Where Are Identity Keys Located](#where-are-identity-keys-located) 
* [Configuring the Location of Identity Keys](#configuring-the-location-of-identity-keys)

Where Are Identity Keys Located
-------------------------------

The default location for identity keys on Unix/Linux systems is the `.ssh` directory in each user's home directory. Identity key names typically start with `id_`, but this does not need to be the case.

Configuring the Location of Identity Keys
-----------------------------------------

With [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/), the location of identity keys is configured using the `IdentityFile` configuration option in the OpenSSH client configuration files, usually `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` or `.ssh/config` in the user's home directory. However, the location of the per-user configuration file may vary depending on server-wide configuration.

Some organizations also use SSH versions with custom compiled-in locations for SSH keys. It is best to use proper [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/) tools, such as the [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) to manage the keys and configure the locations. Each product uses its own configuration mechanism.

SSH keys are a critical access management problem
-------------------------------------------------

SSH keys provide the same access as user names and passwords. Furthermore, they often grant access to privileged accounts on the operating system level, giving a command line. Yet, in many cases, SSH keys have been completely overlooked in identity and access management planning, implementation, and audits. Users have been able to create and install keys without oversight and controls. This has led to violations of corporate access policies and dangerous backdoors.

Over the last few years, it has turned out that most large organizations have massive numbers of SSH keys in their environment. These keys are like passwords. **They grant access to resources** - production servers, databases, routers, firewalls, disaster recovery systems, financial data, payment systems, intellectual property, and patient information.

Information security starts from controlling who is given access to systems and data. If there is no control over access, there is no security, no confidentiality, no integrity, and no guarantees of continued operation.

### Overview video

[Intro into SSH keys and SSH key management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke_M3t_L3iY)

Link to [SSH Risk Assessment](/products/ssh-risk-assessment/)

### Insight from real customer cases

We have worked with many companies, including several global top-10 banks, leading retailers, and other large Fortune 500 companies. Based on our findings, most organizations:

*   Have **extremely large numbers of SSH keys** - even several million - and their use is grossly underestimated
    
*   Have **no provisioning and termination processes** in place for key based access
    
*   Have **no records** of who provisioned each key and for what purpose
    
*   Allow their system administrators to **self-provision** permanent key-based access - without policies, processes, or oversight.
    

In the case of one representative customer, we went through a quarter of their IT environment as part of a major SSH key management project. They had five million daily logins using SSH, most of them using SSH keys for automation. We analyzed **500 business applications**, **15000 servers**, and found **three million SSH keys** that granted access to live production servers. Of those, **90% were no longer used**. **Root access was granted by 10%** of the keys.

### NIST issues guidance on SSH key management

US National Instute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as issued guidance on SSH key management as [NIST IR 7966](/compliance/nist-7966/). It is a good starting point for understanding how to manage access using SSH. We wrote most of the NIST guidelines, and have expanded upon them in our internal processes. We also invented SSH (Secure Shell). We are the best subject matter experts in the field.

### Regulatory compliance requires SSH key management

Typical requirements for [compliance](/compliance) include:

*   Managing identities and credentials - SSH keys are access credentials
    
*   Provisioning and termination process for access - including access based on SSH keys
    
*   Segregation of duties - elimination of key-based access from test and development systems into production
    
*   Disaster recovery - limiting attack spread from primary systems to disaster recovery sites and backup systems
    
*   Privileged access controls - SSH keys are often used to bypass [jump servers](/iam/jump-server)
    
*   Boundary definition and documentation of connections for payment systems, financial data environments, patient data environments, or between government information systems
    
*   Incident response and recovery - being able to change compromised SSH keys.

The risk of unmanaged SSH keys
------------------------------

Unmanaged access exposes organizations to significant risks that could in the worst case bring down critical information systems for months. Unmanaged keys risk systemic failure of critical infrastructure, especially in a cyberwarefare scenarios.

### Stolen and misused keys

There are far more SSH keys in circulation than anyone seems to believe. In one financial sector customer case we encountered 3 million keys (750,000 distinct keypairs) from 15,000 servers. In another case there were 4.5 million authorized keys from 100,000 servers. Typical numbers for Fortune 500 companies range from hundreds of thousands to millions - many times more than they have employees or system administrators with command line operating access.

With so many unmanaged keys the likelihood of keys being misused, stolen, or used as part of an attack is high. One single key can be enough to gain undetected access to critical systems and data.

### The impact of compromise is very high

We have found that in several customer cases about 10% of the discovered keys grant [root access](/iam/user/root). An attacker getting root means they can do anything on the server - including inject fraudulent data, subvert encryption software, install persistent malware, or outright destroy the system. **Confidentiality, integrity, and continuity of operations are all compromised**. Even if the key gives non-root access, local privilege escalation vulnerabilities can often result in the attacker gaining root access.

There is substantial risk that SSH keys can be used to spread an attack to a majority of all production servers in the organization. This could cause billions of dollars of damage to shareholders. Many companies use SSH keys to push data to disaster recovery sites and backup systems, exposing them to attacks as well.

When keys are used for file transfers between business partners, they may be used to spread the attack between organizations. Improperly configured [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) file transfer connections may be used to log into other organizations using stolen keys. The keys may be used for stealing other authentication credentials or installing data collection software for furthering the attack in other ways.

For the modern society, **cyberwarfare** is a relevant risk, and a coordinated attack across critical infrastructure with the intention to destroy and confuse is a real possibility. Recently leaked [CIA hacking tools](/ssh/cia-bothanspy-gyrfalcon) were collecting SSH keys.

SSH Is Everywhere
-----------------

Every company in the Fortune 500 uses the [SSH](/ssh/) (Secure Shell) protocol in their corporate IT infrastructure. The SSH protocol provides secure, trusted access to routers, firewalls, database hosts, application servers, and other networked resources within the corporate infrastructure - both on-premise and in the cloud.

[SSH keys](/academy/ssh/ssh-key-basics) are a powerful feature of the SSH protocol that allow administrators, application owners, and developers to securely access these resources remotely. SSH keys also enable secure automated file transfers, remote command execution, and secure the countless automated operations and machine-to-machine transactions that are necessary in large scale corporate network environments.

Millions of SSH Keys Found In Enterprises
-----------------------------------------

The popularity of SSH has led to a proliferation of SSH keys in corporate networks. We have run thorough scans of customer networks, including large multi-national enterprises, governmental agencies and technology companies. Our research has shown that the number of automated, scripted, or other non-interactive SSH identities typically outnumber human users by a factor of ten. Consequently, the number of deployed SSH keys in vast multi-national networks can be staggering.

In large enterprise networks with 10,000 plus servers we have encountered from one million to over three million SSH keys in circulation. These SSH keys have usually been provisioned over many years, with their ownership and purpose now unknown, yet in many cases they still provide access to whomever was in possession of the corresponding private key.

A situation like this is of course not compliant with common sense, corporate security policy, or regulatory compliance mandates. The issue of unmanaged SSH keys is common, and has become so widespread that it has been identified as “a gaping hole in Identity & Access Management” by IDC.

SSH Keys for SSO: Usage, ssh-add Command, ssh-agent
===================================================

`ssh-add` is a command for adding [SSH private keys](/ssh/identity-key) into the SSH authentication agent for implementing single sign-on with [SSH](/ssh/). The agent process is called [ssh-agent](/ssh/agent); see that page to see how to run it.

The cool thing about `ssh-agent` and `ssh-add` is that they allow the user to use any number of servers, spread across any number of organizations, without having to type in a password every time when moving between servers. This is commonly used by system administrators to move among the machine they administer. It is also widely used in universities and research institutions for accessing computing resources. However, it has also lead to proliferation of SSH keys in enterprises, and that is something administrators should [be aware of](/iam/ssh-key-management) and audit should [take steps to address](/compliance/).

To add an arbitrary private key, give the path of the key file as an argument to `ssh-add`. For example,

    ssh-add ~/.ssh/tatu-aws-key

would add the file `~/.ssh/tatu-aws-key`.

Keys with Passphrases
---------------------

If the key being added has a [passphrase](/ssh/passphrase), `ssh-add` will run the `ssh-askpass` program to obtain the passphrase from the user. If the `SSH_ASKPASS` environment variable is set, the program given by that environment variable is used instead.

Some people use the `SSH_ASKPASS` environment variable in scripts to provide a passphrase for a key. The passphrase might then be hard-coded into the script, or the script might fetch it from a password vault. However, use of passphrases in this manner does not eliminate the need for proper [key lifecycle management](/iam/ssh-key-management) and rotation. Instead, we recommend looking at the [PrivX On-Demand Access Manager](/products/privx/) on how to completely eliminate SSH keys in such applications and replace them by short-lived certificates issued on-demand based on centrally managed access policies.

`ssh-add` Command Line Options
------------------------------

`ssh-add` accepts the following command line options.

**-c** Causes a confirmation to be requested from the user every time the added identities are used for authentication. The confirmation is requested using `ssh-askpass`.

**-D** Deletes all identities from the agent.

**-d** Deletes the given identities from the agent. The private key files for the identities to be deleted should be listed on the command line.

**-E** Specifies the hash algorithm for displaying key fingerprints. Valid options include `md5` and `sha256`.

**-e pkcs11path** Remove identities provided using a PKCS#11 interface, identified by the given path to its shared library. PKCS#11 interfaces are typically used for accessing keys on smartcards and hardware security modules (HSM).

**-k** When loading keys into or deleting keys from the agent, process plain private keys onmly, skipping certificates.

**-L** Lists public key parameters of all identities currently represented by the agent.

**-l** Lists fingerprints of all identities currently represented by the agent.

**-s pkcs11path** Adds identities provided by the PKCS#11 shared library at `pkcs11path`. This is can be used for adding keys on smartcards or in hardware security modules (HSM).

**-t life** Sets the maximum time the agent will keep the given key. After the timeout expires, the key will be automatically removed from the agent. The value is seconds, but can be suffixed for `m` for minutes, `h` for hours, `d` for days, or `w` for weeks.

**-X** Unlocks the agent. This asks for a password to unlock.

**-x** Locks the agent. This asks for a password; the password is required for unlocking the agent. When the agent is locked, it cannot be used for authentication.

What Is `ssh-keygen`?
---------------------

`Ssh-keygen` is a tool for creating new authentication key pairs for SSH. Such key pairs are used for automating logins, single sign-on, and for authenticating hosts.

SSH Keys and Public Key Authentication
--------------------------------------

The [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) uses public key cryptography for authenticating hosts and users. The authentication keys, called [SSH keys](/ssh/key/), are created using the `keygen` program.

SSH introduced [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) as a more secure alternative to the older `.rhosts` authentication. It improved security by avoiding the need to have password stored in files, and eliminated the possibility of a compromised server stealing the user's password.

However, SSH keys are authentication credentials just like passwords. Thus, they must be managed somewhat analogously to user names and passwords. They should have a proper termination process so that keys are removed when no longer needed.


Creating an SSH Key Pair for User Authentication
------------------------------------------------

The simplest way to generate a key pair is to run `ssh-keygen` without arguments. In this case, it will prompt for the file in which to store keys. Here's an example:

    klar (11:39) ~>ssh-keygen Generating public/private rsa key pair. 

    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ylo/.ssh/id_rsa):

    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  Enter same passphrase again:

    Your identification has been saved in /home/ylo/.ssh/id_rsa.

    Your public key has been saved in /home/ylo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

    The key fingerprint is: SHA256:Up6KjbnEV4Hgfo75YM393QdQsK3Z0aTNBz0DoirrW+c ylo@klar

    The key's randomart image is:

    +---[RSA 2048]----+ |    .      ..oo..| |   . . .  . .o.X.| |    . . o.  ..+ B| 

    |   .   o.o  .+ ..| |    ..o.S   o..  | |   . %o=      .  | |    @.B...     . |

    |   o.=. o. . .  .| |    .oo  E. . .. | +----[SHA256]-----+ klar (11:40) ~>

First, the tool asked where to save the file. SSH keys for user authentication are usually stored in the user's `.ssh` directory under the home directory. However, in enterprise environments, the location is often different. The default key file name depends on the algorithm, in this case `id_rsa` when using the default RSA algorithm. It could also be, for example, `id_dsa` or `id_ecdsa`.

Then it asks to enter a [passphrase](/ssh/passphrase). The passphrase is used for encrypting the key, so that it cannot be used even if someone obtains the private key file. The passphrase should be cryptographically strong. Our [online random password generator](/iam/password/generator) is one possible tool for generating strong passphrases.

### Choosing an Algorithm and Key Size

SSH supports several public key algorithms for authentication keys. These include:

*   `rsa` - an old algorithm based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. A key size of at least 2048 bits is recommended for RSA; 4096 bits is better. RSA is getting old and significant advances are being made in factoring. Choosing a different algorithm may be advisable. It is quite possible the RSA algorithm will become practically breakable in the foreseeable future. All SSH clients support this algorithm.
    
*   `dsa` - an old US government Digital Signature Algorithm. It is based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms. A key size of 1024 would normally be used with it. DSA in its original form is no longer recommended.
    
*   `ecdsa` - a new Digital Signature Algorithm standarized by the US government, using elliptic curves. This is probably a good algorithm for current applications. Only three key sizes are supported: 256, 384, and 521 (sic!) bits. We would recommend always using it with 521 bits, since the keys are still small and probably more secure than the smaller keys (even though they should be safe as well). Most SSH clients now support this algorithm.
    
*   `ed25519` - this is a new algorithm added in OpenSSH. Support for it in clients is not yet universal. Thus its use in general purpose applications may not yet be advisable.
    

The algorithm is selected using the `-t` option and key size using the `-b` option. The following commands illustrate:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

### Specifying the File Name

Normally, the tool prompts for the file in which to store the key. However, it can also be specified on the command line using the `-f <filename>` option.

    ssh-keygen -f ~/tatu-key-ecdsa -t ecdsa -b 521

Copying the Public Key to the Server
------------------------------------

To use public key authentication, the public key must be copied to a server and installed in an [authorized_keys](/ssh/authorized_keys) file. This can be conveniently done using the [ssh-copy-id](/ssh/copy-id) tool. Like this:

    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/tatu-key-ecdsa user@host

Once the public key has been configured on the server, the server will allow any connecting user that has the private key to log in. During the login process, the client proves possession of the private key by digitally signing the key exchange.

Adding the Key to SSH Agent
---------------------------

`ssh-agent` is a program that can hold a user's private key, so that the private key passphrase only needs to be supplied once. A connection to the agent can also be forwarded when logging into a server, allowing [SSH commands](/ssh/command) on the server to use the agent running on the user's desktop.

For more information on using and configuring the SSH agent, see the [ssh-agent](/ssh/agent) page.

Creating Host Keys
------------------

The tool is also used for creating host authentication keys. Host keys are stored in the `/etc/ssh/` directory.

Host keys are just ordinary SSH key pairs. Each host can have one host key for each algorithm. The host keys are almost always stored in the following files:

    /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key 

    /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key 

    /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key 

    /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

The host keys are usually automatically generated when an SSH server is installed. They can be regenerated at any time. However, if host keys are changed, clients may warn about changed keys. Changed keys are also reported when someone tries to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. Thus it is not advisable to train your users to blindly accept them. Changing the keys is thus either best done using an SSH key management tool that also changes them on clients, or using certificates.

Using X.509 Certificates for Host Authentication 
-------------------

OpenSSH does not support X.509 certificates. [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) does support them. X.509 certificates are widely used in larger organizations for making it easy to change host keys on a period basis while avoiding unnecessary warnings from clients. They also allow using strict host key checking, which means that the clients will outright refuse a connection if the host key has changed.

Using OpenSSH's Proprietary Certificates
----------------------------------------

OpenSSH has its own proprietary certificate format, which can be used for signing host certificates or user certificates. For user authentication, the lack of highly secure certificate authorities combined with the inability to audit who can access a server by inspecting the server makes us recommend against using OpenSSH certificates for user authentication.

However, OpenSSH certificates can be very useful for server authentication and can achieve similar benefits as the standard X.509 certificates. However, they need their own infrastructure for certificate issuance.

Key Management Requires Attention
---------------------------------

It is easy to create and configure new SSH keys. In the default configuration, OpenSSH allows any user to configure new keys. The keys are permanent access credentials that remain valid even after the user's account has been deleted.

In organizations with more than a few dozen users, SSH keys easily accumulate on servers and service accounts over the years. We have seen enterprises with several million keys granting access to their production servers. It only takes one leaked, stolen, or misconfigured key to gain access.

In any larger organization, use of SSH key management solutions is almost necessary. SSH keys should also be moved to root-owned locations with proper provisioning and termination processes. For more information, see [how to manage SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management). A widely used SSH key management tool for OpenSSH is [Universal SSH Key Manager](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager).

Practically all cybersecurity [regulatory frameworks](/compliance/) require managing who can access what. SSH keys grant access, and fall under this requirement. This, organizations under compliance mandates are required to implement proper management processes for the keys. [NIST IR 7966](/compliance/nist-7966) is a good starting point.

Make Sure There Is Enough Randomness
------------------------------------

It is important to ensure there is enough unpredictable entropy in the system when SSH keys are generated. There have been incidents when thousands of devices on the Internet have shared the same host key when they were improperly configured to generate the key without proper randomness.

### General Purpose Systems

On general purpose computers, randomness for SSH key generation is usually not a problem. It may be something of an issue when initially installing the SSH server and generating host keys, and only people building new Linux distributions or SSH installation packages generally need to worry about it.

Our recommendation is to collect randomness during the whole installation of the operating system, save that randomness in a random seed file. Then boot the system, collect some more randomness during the boot, mix in the saved randomness from the seed file, and only then generate the host keys. This maximizes the use of the available randomness. And make sure the random seed file is periodically updated, in particular make sure that it is updated after generating the SSH host keys.

Many modern general-purpose CPUs also have hardware random number generators. This helps a lot with this problem. The best practice is to collect some entropy in other ways, still keep it in a random seed file, and mix in some entropy from the hardware random number generator. This way, even if one of them is compromised somehow, the other source of randomness should keep the keys secure.

### Embedded Devices and Internet of Things

Available entropy can be a real problem on small [IoT devices](/iot/) that don't have much other activity on the system. They may just not have the mechanical randomness from disk drive mechanical movement timings, user-caused interrupts, or network traffic. Furthermore, embedded devices often run on low-end processors that may not have a hardware random number generator.

The availability of entropy is also critically important when such devices generate keys for HTTPS.

Our recommendation is that such devices should have a hardware random number generator. If the CPU does not have one, it should be built onto the motherboard. The cost is rather small.

Command and Option Summary
--------------------------

Here's a summary of commonly used options to the keygen tool:

**-b** “Bits” This option specifies the number of bits in the key. The regulations that govern the use case for SSH may require a specific key length to be used. In general, 2048 bits is considered to be sufficient for RSA keys.

**-e** “Export” This option allows reformatting of existing keys between the OpenSSH key file format and the format documented in [RFC 4716](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4716), “SSH Public Key File Format”.

**-p** “Change the passphrase” This option allows changing the passphrase of a private key file with `**[-P old_passphrase]**` and `**[-N new_passphrase]**`, `**[-f keyfile]**`.

**-t** “Type” This option specifies the type of key to be created. Commonly used values are: **- rsa** for [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) keys **- dsa** for [DSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm) keys **- ecdsa** for [elliptic curve DSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) keys

**-i** "Input" When _ssh-keygen_ is required to access an existing key, this option designates the file.

**-f** "File" Specifies name of the file in which to store the created key.

SSH Tunneling
=============

This page explains _SSH tunneling_ (also called _SSH port forwarding_), how it can be used to get into an internal corporate network from the Internet, and how to prevent SSH tunnels at a firewall. SSH tunneling is a powerful tool, but it can also be abused. Controlling tunneling is particularly important when moving services to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or other cloud computing services.

What is an SSH tunnel?
----------------------

SSH tunneling is a method of transporting arbitrary networking data over an encrypted SSH connection. It can be used to add encryption to legacy applications. It can also be used to implement VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) and access intranet services across firewalls.

[SSH](/ssh/protocol/) is a standard for secure remote logins and file transfers over untrusted networks. It also provides a way to secure the data traffic of any given application using port forwarding, basically tunneling any [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) port over SSH. This means that the application data traffic is directed to flow inside an encrypted SSH connection so that it cannot be eavesdropped or intercepted while it is in transit. SSH tunneling enables adding network security to legacy applications that do not natively support encryption.

![Securing applications with ssh tunneling / port forwarding](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Securing_applications_with_ssh_tunneling___port_forwarding-2.png)

The figure presents a simplified overview of SSH tunneling. The secure connection over the untrusted network is established between an [SSH client](/ssh/client) and an [SSH server](/ssh/server). This SSH connection is encrypted, protects confidentiality and integrity, and authenticates communicating parties.

The SSH connection is used by the application to connect to the application server. With tunneling enabled, the application contacts to a port on the local host that the SSH client listens on. The SSH client then forwards the application over its encrypted tunnel to the server. The server then connects to the actual application server - usually on the same machine or in the same data center as the SSH server. The application communication is thus secured, without having to modify the application or end user workflows.

Who uses SSH tunneling?
-----------------------

The downside is that any user who is able to log into a server can enable port forwarding. This is widely exploited by internal IT people to log into their home machines or servers in a cloud, forwarding a port from the server back into the enterprise intranet to their work machine or suitable server.

Hackers and malware can similarly use it to **leave a backdoor into the internal network**. It can also be used for **hiding attackers's tracks** by bouncing an attack through multiple devices that permit uncontrolled tunneling.

To see how to configure an SSH tunnel, [see this example](/ssh/tunneling/example). Tunneling is often used together with [SSH keys](/ssh/key) and [public key authentication](/ssh/public-key-authentication) to fully automate the process.

Benefits of SSH tunneling for enterprises
-----------------------------------------

SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments that employ mainframe systems as their application backends. In those environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, [compliance](/compliance/) with [SOX](/compliance/sarbanes-oxley/), [HIPAA](/compliance/hipaa/security-rule), [PCI-DSS](/compliance/pci) and other standards can be achieved without having to modify applications.

In many cases these applications and application servers are such that making code changes to them may be impractical or prohibitively expensive. Source code may not be available, the vendor may no longer exist, the product may be out of support, or the development team may no longer exist. Adding a security wrapper, such as SSH tunneling, has provided a cost-effective and practical way to add security for such applications. For example, entire country-wide [ATM](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atm.asp) networks run using tunneling for security.

[SSH's Tectia SSH Client/Server](https://www.ssh.com/products/tectia-ssh/)is a commercial solution that can provide secure application tunneling along with[SFTP](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sftp)and secure remote access for enterprises.


SSH tunneling in the corporate risk portfolio
---------------------------------------------

As useful as SSH tunneling is, it also creates risk that needs to be addressed by corporate IT security teams. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their content is invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH tunnels to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network.

In an SSH back-tunneling attack, the attacker sets up a server outside the target network (in [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), for example). Once the attacker is in the target system, she connects to the outside SSH server from the inside. Most organizations permit outgoing SSH connections, at least if they have servers in a public cloud. This SSH connection is [set up with an option that enables TCP port forwarding](/ssh/tunneling/example) from a port on the external server to an SSH port on a server in the internal network. Setting up this SSH back-tunnel requires a single one-line command on the inside, and it can easily be automated. Most firewalls offer little to no protection against it.

![SSH port forwarding attack using SSH tunneling](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/SSH_port_forwarding_attack_using_SSH_tunneling-2.png)

There are several widely known and documented cases of [malware leveraging the SSH protocol](/malware/) as a means for hiding data exfiltration and command channels. Several instances of malware have been actively collecting SSH keys. Captured and collected SSH keys have also been sold on hacker forums.

Combined with attacks based on [unmanaged SSH keys](/iam/ssh-key-management), SSH tunneling **allows an attacker to utilize stolen SSH keys for an intranet from the public Internet**.

* SSH tunneling attacks can also be used for **hiding the source of the attack**. It is common or hackers to bounce attacks off systems and devices that allow SSH port forwarding to hide their tracks. This allows them to probe for vulnerabilities, try various login credentials, or run attack tools against email, web, telephony and any other protocols. Bouncing an attack through a dozen random devices via encrypted tunnels also carrying other traffic makes it virtually untraceable. [Akamai](https://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/12-year-old-vulnerability-turns-iot-devices-into-proxies-16909.html) 
* [documented](https://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/12-year-old-vulnerability-turns-iot-devices-into-proxies-16909.html) millions of IoT devices being used in this way.

Countering these risks requires the capability to monitor, control and audit encrypted SSH connections. For preventing bouncing, it requires proper configuration and hardening of IoT operating systems.

It should also be noted that tunneling attacks are not specific to SSH - a competent programmer can write a tool to tunnel ports in a few hours and can run it on any machine on the internal network. Any laptop or other device on the internal network can do it - it just needs to be able to communicate with some (any) service on the Internet. Such a tool could be made to work over SSL/TLS, could emulate HTTP, or could operate over UDP and use packets that look like DNS requests and responses. SSH just makes it easier for non-programmers. You can only protect from tunneling attacks against people who are able to run software on the inside or connect any device to the internal network by only allowing protocols you can inspect through the firewall.

How to configure an SSH tunnel
------------------------------

See the [configuration example page](/ssh/tunneling/example) for detailed configuration instructions. The [SSH command line options](/ssh/command) and [SSH server configuration file](/ssh/sshd_config) pages may also be helpful.

What Is SSH Port Forwarding, aka SSH Tunneling?
-----------------------------------------------

SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in [SSH](/ssh/) for tunneling application ports from the client machine to the server machine, or vice versa. It can be used for _adding encryption to legacy applications_, _going through firewalls_, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for _opening backdoors_ into the internal network from their home machines. It can also be abused by hackers and malware to open access from the Internet to the internal network. See the [SSH tunneling](/ssh/tunneling/) page for a broader overview.

Local Forwarding
----------------

Local forwarding is used to forward a port from the client machine to the server machine. Basically, the [SSH client](/ssh/client) listens for connections on a configured port, and when it receives a connection, it tunnels the connection to an [SSH server](/ssh/server). The server connects to a configurated destination port, possibly on a different machine than the SSH server.

Typical uses for local port forwarding include:

*   Tunneling sessions and file transfers through jump servers
    
*   Connecting to a service on an internal network from the outside
    
*   Connecting to a remote file share over the Internet
    

Quite a few organizations for all incoming SSH access through a single [jump server](/iam/jump-server). The server may be a standard Linux/Unix box, usually with some extra hardening, intrusion detection, and/or logging, or it may be a commercial jump server solution.

Many jump servers allow incoming port forwarding, once the connection has been authenticated. Such port forwarding is convenient, because it allows tech-savvy users to use internal resources quite transparently. For example, they may forward a port on their local machine to the corporate intranet web server, to an internal mail server's [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol) port, to a local file server's 445 and 139 ports, to a printer, to a version control repository, or to almost any other system on the internal network. Frequently, the port is tunneled to an SSH port on an internal machine.

In [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/), local port forwarding is configured using the `-L` option:

        ssh -L 80:intra.example.com:80 gw.example.com

This example opens a connection to the `gw.example.com` jump server, and forwards any connection to port 80 on the local machine to port 80 on `intra.example.com`.

By default, anyone (even on different machines) can connect to the specified port on the SSH client machine. However, this can be restricted to programs on the same host by supplying a _bind address_:

        ssh -L 127.0.0.1:80:intra.example.com:80 gw.example.com

The `LocalForward` option in the [OpenSSH client configuration file](/ssh/config/) can be used to configure forwarding without having to specify it on command line.

Remote Forwarding
-----------------

In OpenSSH, remote SSH port forwardings are specified using the `-R` option. For example:

        ssh -R 8080:localhost:80 public.example.com

This allows anyone on the remote server to connect to TCP port 8080 on the remote server. The connection will then be tunneled back to the client host, and the client then makes a TCP connection to port 80 on `localhost`. Any other host name or IP address could be used instead of `localhost` to specify the host to connect to.

This particular example would be useful for giving someone on the outside access to an internal web server. Or exposing an internal web application to the public Internet. This could be done by an employee working from home, or by an attacker.

By default, OpenSSH only allows connecting to remote forwarded ports from the server host. However, the `GatewayPorts` option in the server configuration file [sshd_config](/ssh/sshd_config/) can be used to control this. The following alternatives are possible:

        GatewayPorts no

This prevents connecting to forwarded ports from outside the server computer.

        GatewayPorts yes

This allows anyone to connect to the forwarded ports. If the server is on the public Internet, anyone on the Internet can connect to the port.

        GatewayPorts clientspecified

This means that the client can specify an IP address from which connections to the port are allowed. The syntax for this is:

        ssh -R 52.194.1.73:8080:localhost:80 host147.aws.example.com

In this example, only connections from the IP address `52.194.1.73` to port 8080 are allowed.

OpenSSH also allows the forwarded remote port to specified as 0. In this case, the server will dynamically allocate a port and report it to the client. When used with the `-O forward` option, the client will print the allocated port number to standard output.


Opening Backdoors into the Enterprise
-------------------------------------

Remote SSH port forwarding is commonly used by employees to open backdoors into the enterprise. For example, the employee may set get a [free-tier server from Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), and log in from the office to that server, specifying remote forwarding from a port on the server to some server or application on the internal enterprise network. Multiple remote forwards may be specified to open access to more than one application.

The employee would also set `GatewayPorts yes` on the server (most employees do not have fixed IP addresses at home, so they cannot restrict the IP address).

For example, the following command opens access to an internal Postgres database at port 5432 and an internal SSH port at port 2222.

        ssh -R 2222:d76767.nyc.example.com:22 -R 5432:postgres3.nyc.example.com:5432 aws4.mydomain.net

Server-Side Configuration
-------------------------

The `AllowTcpForwarding` option in the [OpenSSH server configuration file](/ssh/sshd_config/) must be enabled on the server to allow port forwarding. By default, forwarding is allowed. Possible values for this option are `yes` or `all` to allow all TCP forwarding, `no` to prevent all TCP forwarding, `local` to allow local forwardings, and `remote` to allow remote forwardings.

Another option of interest is `AllowStreamLocalForwarding`, which can be used to forward Unix domain sockets. It allows the same values as `AllowTcpForwarding`. The default is `yes`.

For example:

        AllowTcpForwarding remote     AllowStreamLocalForwarding no

The `GatewayPorts` configuration option as described above also affects remote port forwardings. Possible values were `no` (only local connections from server host allowed; default), `yes` (anyone on the Internet can connect to remote forwarded ports), and `clientspecified` (client can specify an IP address that can connect, anyone can if not specified).

How to Prevent SSH Port Forwarding from Circumventing Firewalls
---------------------------------------------------------------

We recommend that port forwarding be expressly disabled when not needed. Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors. For example, if a server intended to only provide [SFTP](/ssh/sftp/) file transfers allows port forwardings, those forwardings might be used to gain unintended access into the internal network from the Intranet.

The problem is that port forwarding can in practice only be prevented by a server or firewall. An enterprise cannot control all servers on the Internet. Firewall-based control can also be tricky, as most organizations have servers in Amazon AWS and other cloud services, and those servers are usually accessed using SSH.

SSH's solution

BothanSpy & Gyrfalcon - CIA SSH hacking tools
=============================================

BothanSpy and Gyrfalcon are alleged CIA hacking tools targeting various SSH (Secure Shell) implementations with the objective of stealing usernames, passwords, [SSH keys](https://ssh.com/ssh/key), and SSH key [passphrases](https://ssh.com/ssh/passphrase). They are tools used after access has already been gained to the target machine - typically a user's desktop/laptop - and are used for stealing credentials that can then be used to spread the attack further into servers and other systems.

Information about these tools was released by Wikileaks on July 6, 2017, as part of their Vault 7 releases. Based on the analysis here, it is completely plausible they are genuine CIA tools.

These are two distinct tools, BothanSpy targeting a fairly esoteric SSH client on Windows and Gyrfalcon targeting the extermely widely used [OpenSSH](https://ssh.com/ssh/openssh) on Linux.

* [Conclusion](#conclusion)

Available Information
---------------------

Wikileaks has published documentation for each tool. The tools themselves were not available for review. However, the documentation is detailed enough that the method of operation of the tools can be easily inferred.

The original Wikileaks release can be found [here](https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#BothanSpy).

Objectives of the Tools
-----------------------

Each of the tools is intended for obtainining additional credentials (passwords, SSH keys) once the attacker has already penetrated a user's laptop or desktop using other methods. The obtained credentials will allow spreading the attack to further machines, particularly servers. It is well known that many organizations have very lax SSH key management practices and that compromise of even a single SSH key can in many cases lead to compromise of the entire server environment. This, of course, makes the tools very useful in preparing for destructive cyberwarfare as well as for gaining access for information exfiltration and disrupting the target's operations by inserting false information, evidence, or directives.

BothanSpy Detailed Analysis
---------------------------

BothanSpy collects credentials from running Xshell processes. Xshell is an [SSH client](https://ssh.com/ssh/client) primarily used in South Korea and the United States.

The attack works by injecting a dynamically linked library `BothanSpy.dll` into each of the `Xshell` processes it finds. This said to be done using Wow64 injection, which is a well-known technique. Its description can be found, e.g., [here](https://modexp.wordpress.com/2015/11/19/dllpic-injection-on-windows-from-wow64-process/).

Once the DLL is injected, it extracts the following credentials for each connection: _user name_ and _password_ for password authenticated connections; _user name_, _private key file name_, and _passphrase_ for [public key authenticated](https://ssh.com/ssh/public-key-authentication) connections. While the private key file itself is not fetched by this tool, it is reasonable to assume that other tools are readily available to fetch the file (and most likely fetch it automatically). The really useful collected information is the passphrase, which is used to encrypt the private key file. Obtaining the passphrase on top of the file itself enables the attacker to log in to any server where that key grants access. The passwords and passphrases are the real targets of this attack tool.

The BothanSpy tool has been designed to be used together with the ShellTerm attack framework. This framework appears to provide covert communications between the attacker's [command and control server](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/command-and-control-server-CC-server), as well as for example DLL injection capabilities in its newer versions (3.0+). When used with ShellTerm, the DLL communicates directly with its Fire and Collect channel, avoiding writing any information to disk. This makes detection harder, and no anti-malware software based on inspecting just written files will detect it.

BothanSpy can also be used without a Fire and Collect connection, writing the credentials to disk for later transmission to its controllers. The files are AES-encrypted, but the details of how the encryption key is selected were not disclosed in the available information. This mode of operation could be used to run BothanSpy offline using any suitable offline attack framework. [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) is an example of such a framework; however, there is no evidence these are connected in any way.

It is easy to surmise that BothanSpy injects the DLL into the Xterm process and intercepts one or more function calls that are called frequently, e.g., from a periodic timer. The function call(s) are redirected to the injected DLL, which then scans the data structures of the process to find data structures for SSH connections and their credentials. All this is well known techniques and fairly easy to implement, probably with a few hours of work to inspect the data structures of the target process. In fact, I have used and documented a [similar technique in a 1999 patent application](http://google.ch/patents/CA2325652C) for the legitimate purpose of intercepting network packets for implementing IPsec encryption.

In summary, BothanSpy appears to be a tool contracted to be built as a component of a larger framework around ShellTerm, but with the proviso that it can also be used independently. It does not break the [SSH protocol](/academy/ssh/protocol) or compromise its encryption. There are no [zero-days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)) involved. It instead compromises the SSH client process by injecting malicious code into it and reading the credentials from the memory of the SSH client process.

Gyrfalcon Detailed Analysis
---------------------------

The Gyrfalcon documentation is for for version 2.0, dated November 2013. Version 1.0 documentation was also available, dated January 2013, but not inspected for this analysis.

Gyrfalcon is designed to obtain credentials from OpenSSH running on various Linux distributions. Linux is the leading operating system used in the [cloud](https://ssh.com/cloud/) and in public web servers. It seems likely that the attack tool could be easily adapted to run on any Unix variant.

The key components of Gyrfalcon are a server process and a DLL library that is loaded into the OpenSSH process. It uses an encrypted configuration file and encrypts collected data using AES. Apparently public key cryptography is used for encrypting the collected data such that only the operator can decrypt it. Additional tools are provided for creating encrypted configuration files and decrypting the output data.

Gyrfalcon appears to have been tested extensively on Linux distributions used in enterprises and the government. At least the Red Hat, CentOS, SuSE, Debian, and Ubuntu distributions are supported by the tool.

The basic interception works by preloading a DLL into the OpenSSH process. The manual contains detailed instructions on how to name the DLL as something that will look inconspicuous on the target machine. It masquerades as a [GSSAPI](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2743.txt) DLL - `libgssapi.so.2.0.1`. While the DLL name could theoretically be used for detecting it, the name can be changed arbitrarily, probably without even recompiling the software. It also does not look like the DLL necessarily needs to be in `/lib64`. Presence of `LD_PRELOAD` in the process's environment would be a red flag, but even that could be easily avoided by actually replacing an existing DLL with the attack DLL, but that would presumably require modifications to the DLL to implement the replaced functionality and/or also load the original DLL.

The documentation says that `LD_PRELOAD` must be added in the user's profile. This could also be done globally in `/etc/profile` on many systems to facilitate global interception of credentials for all users on the target machine, although this does not appear to be mentioned in the documentation.

The attack itself is very trivial and does not involve any advanced hacking techniques. Replacing functions by preloading a DLL is a well-established technique and I first saw it used in mid-1990s for preloading memory allocation debugging libraries. One can surmise that once loaded, the library implements certain library functions the OpenSSH client calls during or after authentication, and uses these functions to capture full session traffic, including user names and passwords. It probably also intercepts some functions involved in processing session traffic to obtain access to sent and received unencrypted packets.

The exact division of work between the application and the DLL remains a bit unclear. A reasonable assumption would be that the application handles configuration file reading, writing the output file, and encryption. In any case, that division of work is an unimportant implementation detail.

In summary, the attack tool is fairly unsurprising and unsophisticated. Its sophistication is more in the encryption of the configuration file and the results rather than the attack itself. The actual DLL implementation and credential interception in this manner could probably be implemented in a few hours to a few days. The software looks like a separately contracted tool built against a loose specification.

Interestingly, this version of Gyrfalcon does not appear to include integration with command-and-control systems. Also, it freely writes and changes files on disk. It performs several operations that could easily be detected as suspicious or anomalous by proper intrusion detection tools. It could have been implemented in a much more covert manner. Perhaps there was a lack of attention to such details because anti-malware software on Linux is still fairly uncommon. To some extent I find myself troubled by this lack of sophistication and lack of stealth. We have seen so much more sophisticated tools coming out from the intelligence community.

Also of some interest is the extensive attention paid to various enterprise Linux versions that are rarely used by individuals. This could suggest a focus on cyberwarfare, disruption, and commercial intelligence rather than targeting individuals or terrorist groups.

Gyrfalcon as an attack relies on the attacker already having [root](https://ssh.com/iam/user/root) access on the target's client machine (typically a desktop or a laptop). It does not suggest compromise of the SSH protocol or its encryption in any way. Instead it compromises the implementation and just reads the data before encryption and after decryption.

Conclusion
----------

These attack tools appear real. My professional judgement is that they are likely to work and were likely commercially contracted as independent development projects. They do not rely on any classified techniques or zero-days and there is nothing surprising about them. Perhaps the biggest surprise is how easily detectable the techniques used by Gyrfalcon are; there really has not been much attention paid to being hard to detect.

Neither of these tools suggests any compromise of the SSH protocol. They do, however, illustrate the strong interest intelligence organizations and other attackers have towards SSH credentials, including SSH keys. They are a primary way for hackers to spread within the target organization.

It seems completely feasible that these tools are actual CIA hacking tools. However, it is impossible to confirm that for sure based on the available information alone.

**IT/OT convergence is moving operations in manufacturing, shipping, utilities, and other operational technology (OT) industries to the hybrid cloud. This shift has opened doors to new attack vectors and prompted more interest from bad actors towards OT. This page lists some notable OT incidents.**

Maersk Case
-----------

In 2017, Maersk was infected by the NotPetya malware that brought down the vast majority of Maersk’s critical network and took hostage of most end-user clients and applications rendering them useless. Moreover, the malware damaged the fixed-line phones and wiped out Outlook contacts which disrupted the entire corporate communication and put the global operation to a halt. In fact, almost the entire Maersk fleet was out of operation for about two weeks.

Being faced with a malicious cyberattack, Maersk learned the hard way that their backup plan did not include images of their network setup. Fortunately, the company was able to retrieve an uninfected copy of its Active Directory from a Maersk office in Nigeria. The copy had been secure thanks to a power outage in the local area that had taken the server offline while the malware was spreading.

By gaining access to that copy and through a huge effort from the Maersk task team, they were able to successfully restore the core access to the essential data. The Maersk team even established contact with the NotPetya creator and gained valuable insight into this dangerous malware. Maersk became the first corporate in the world to reverse engineer the malware.

An interesting opinion of the leader of Maersk’s IT team who won over the cyberattack: _“Automated detection and response are key. Automated protection is worth its weight in gold. And [Privileged Access Management (PAM)](/academy/iam/pam) takes on increasing importance. With a more limited number of privileged accounts, it is reasonable to assume that a much lower number of machines would have been infected, something like 5,000 rather than the 55,000 seen at Maersk,"_ Adam Banks – Chief Technology and Information Officer of Maersk.

Norsk Hydro Case
----------------

In 2019, Norsk Hydro experienced a disruptive attack known as LockerGoga, which brought the giant Norwegian aluminum business down to its knees. LockerGoga is ransomware more sophisticated than NotPetya. Basically, LockerGoga can log existing users off, change their passwords, encrypt the files on servers in the network, and also post ransom messages on the screens of infected computers demanding the company to pay a ransom in bitcoins to gain back the control.

From the investigation review, it turned out that the LockerGoga ransomware was able to enter the Norsk Hydro system when an employee opened an infected email sent by a trusted customer. This attack forced Norsk Hydro to switch to manual operations with pen and paper and the company suffered losses of tens of millions of dollars in damage. Even so, Norsk Hydro refused to pay the ransom and chose to be transparent about the cyberattack while actively seeking help from internal and external sources.

The attack is currently attributed to criminal hackers, but it remains under investigation. Norsk Hydro has recovered by gradually rebuilding its systems, improving its disaster recovery backup plans, and putting more focus on cybersecurity threat mitigation.

Tower Semiconductor LTD. (TSEM) Case
------------------------------------

In 2020, TESM was targeted with a ransomware cyberattack which forced the corporate to halt its operations in certain manufacturing facilities as a preventive strategy. TSEM reported having paid the ransom (approximately $250,000 in Bitcoin) in an attempt to resume normal operations. Tower semiconductor also was implementing measures to prevent the attack from expanding wider. After paying the ransom, TSEM expects to return to normal operation almost immediately.

Florida Water Treatment Plant Case
----------------------------------

In early 2021, a hacker was able to access a Florida water treatment plant monitor software that can adjust the level of sodium hydroxide (lye) in water via remote access.

The attacker attempted to adjust the lye level up to 11,100 ppm which potentially could have severely impacted the health of 15,000 citizens living in the area. Luckily, an employee noticed the suspicious remote access when the bad actor was operating the mouse on the screen to adjust the lye setting. He quickly changed the systems back to the normal settings and informed the management about disabling all remote access.

This attack is particularly serious since it could have potentially caused physical harm or even casualties, had it not been stopped. There are two key elements in this case: the water treatment plant used an outdated operating system (Windows 7) which is no longer supported by Microsoft. This opened backdoors to the attacker.

Another reason was the use of ungoverned shared accounts among the staff for remote access via the TeamViewer application.

Colonial Pipeline Case
----------------------

Colonial Pipeline is responsible for gasoline supply in the East Coast, USA; also known as the largest petroleum pipeline in the US. In 2021, the system of Colonial Pipeline went down for several days due to the cyberattack from a group of criminal hackers based in Eastern Europe called DarkSide.

When the attack happened, it caused chaos in the gasoline supply chain on the East Coast, causing consumers to hoard gas and creating spikes in gas prices. This is considered the largest cyberattack in the energy industry in the United States. As a result of the ransomware attack, the company ended up paying at least 4,4 million USD in bitcoin to restore operations.

Under investigation, they found out that the breach may originate from a leaked password to an old account that had access to the virtual private network (VPN), which is used to make the remote access the corporate’s servers.

The account didn’t have multifactor authentication, so the username and password were the only two things the hacker needed to gain the access to the largest petroleum supplier in the USA. Intriguingly, Colonial Pipeline was able to recover part of its bitcoin deposit by following the trail from the hacker’s wallet. The Colonial Pipeline was able to resume normal operations without a prolonged disruption to its fuel supply.

GoDaddy case 2020 - credential breach
-------------------------------------

A large domain company – GoDaddy announced that they had their servers breached in October 2019. The breach, which was discovered only later in April 2020, affected the SSH credentials of approximately 28,000 of the company’s customers.

All in all, it took the domain company 6 months to discover what went wrong. According to GoDaddy, a hacker broke into their network, bypassed their security controls, and obtained access to SSH login credentials hosted on GoDaddy’s servers. To remedy the situation, the company reset all the exposed credentials and offered 1 year free of charge of premium security services for the affected customers. The unauthorized party was blocked from the server, and there’s no evidence of the attacker tampering with files on the hosted accounts.

The incident happened due to an oversight in critical infrastructure security – [SSH keys](/academy/ssh/ssh-key-basics). SSH keys are a widely used secure remote login method with strong encryption. However, getting hold of an SSH key that grants root-level access often allows the attacker to hop from one environment to another without detection. This is possible because the SSH key itself might be legitimate, even if the user isn't.

Learn why you should [treat SSH keys like passwords and policy them accordingly](https://blog.ssh.com/treat_ssh_keys_like_passwords)

GoDaddy case - password breach
------------------------------

In November 2021, a WordPress hosting service provider GoDaddy announced that they’ve detected suspicious activity in their system which has been confirmed to be a cyberattack. The attack, however, started already two months earlier in September.

The unauthorized activity resulted in a data breach of 1,2 million users, including email addresses and customer numbers. Some of the users got also additional credentials exposed, like their credentials for SFTP, SSL private keys, database usernames and passwords.

Based on the investigation, the breach was caused due to a leak of a single compromised password. It appears that GoDaddy was storing users’ passwords as plaintext or in a format that could be easily reversed into plaintext. Even though the company is using SFTP via SSH, which is currently the most secure way to transfer files, storing passwords as plaintext or in reversible format is not a good practice.

World Health Organization (WHO) case
------------------------------------

In April 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) announced that some of the accounts of their employees were accessed without authorization. This case is not a breach per se, since the credentials used for unlawful access were part of a huge database of credentials collected from various leaks. However, some WHO employees had used the company login credentials on third-party services that were breached, and the hackers used the re-used information to gain access.

As a result, 450 active WHO email addresses and their passwords got published on public sites such as Twitter, etc. The attack did not put WHO systems in danger because the bad actor was not able to penetrate critical WHO systems.

Zoom case - credential breach
-----------------------------

In early 2020, Zoom has announced that 500,000 stolen credentials from its servers were listed for sale. The news scared over 300 million users who were active on Zoom at that time. The investigations revealed that hackers collected the data from online crime forums and dark web supermarkets. Since people tend to re-use their login credentials, the hackers noticed that they could gain access to a lot of Zoom accounts simply by using the information found through other leaks.

Furthermore, Zoom emphasized convenience over security, meaning that options like multi-factor authentication (MFA) were not implemented.

Executive Summary
-----------------

GoScanSSH, a new strain of malware that has been targeting Linux-based SSH servers exposed to the Internet since June 2017. The malware attempts to obtain a valid SSH credential through a wordlist attack and attempts to infect the host. Upon successful login new malware is delivered infecting the host and the process is repeated.

“GoScanSSH is another example of bad actors looking to exploit SSH keys which provide the keys to the kingdom, said Andrew Hammond, VP of Business Development, customers need to proactively manage important credentials like SSH keys with a policy framework that rotates crypto and sets time expiration.”

Threat Summary for GoScanSSH
----------------------------

This advisory is based on research and written reports from Edmund Brumaghin, Andrew Williams, and Alain Zidouemba of Cisco’s Tallos Intelligence Group. Brumaghin, Williams, and Zidouemba performed unique and important research on this topic. SSH is highlighting their research as we feel this is potentially a serious threat vector which the community should be aware of. Please refer to their blog of March 26th: “Discovered by Forgot About Default Accounts? No Worries, GoScanSSH Didn’t” [https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/03/goscanssh-analysis.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/03/goscanssh-analysis.html)

Remediation
-----------

Specifically, SSH recommends the following best practices:

1.  Define a controlled provisioning and termination process for SSH keys
    
2.  Discover existing legacy keys
    
3.  Monitor key usage and eliminating the 90% of keys that are never used

SSH Background and Macro Threats
--------------------------------

The SSH protocol is the de facto standard for remote system administration and secure file transfers. One of the features behind the adoption of the protocol is the strong authentication using SSH Keys.

SSH keys provide the same access as user names and passwords. They often grant access to privileged accounts on the operating system level, giving a command line. SSH keys have been overlooked in identity and access management planning, implementation, and audits. Users have been able to create and install keys without oversight and controls. These keys are like passwords and grant access to resources - production servers, databases, routers, firewalls, disaster recovery systems, financial data, payment systems, intellectual property, and patient information. This has led to violations of corporate access policies and dangerous backdoors. Most large organizations have accumulated large numbers of SSH keys in their environment.

Organizations are finding enterprise wide deployment issues in Secure Shell (SSH) authentication management, which has suffered from lack of governance for years. Many organizations report:

*   Large numbers of SSH keys - even several million - and their use is underestimated
    
*   Have no provisioning and termination processes in place for key based access
    
*   Have no records of who provisioned each key and for what purpose
    
*   Allow their system administrators to self-provision permanent key-based access - without policies, processes, or oversight.

*   Hackers and malware utilizing SSH
    
*   Backdoors into intranet
    
*   Data leaks under encryption
    

Remediation Specifics
---------------------

NIST IR 7966 is a good starting point for understanding how to manage access using SSH. SSH Communications Security also have our own guidelines that build on the NIST guidance. We wrote most of the NIST guidelines, together with the NIST staff, and have the best subject matter experts in the field. SSH Communications recommends utilization of our onsite workshop including the he SSH Risk Assessment. SSH Risk Assessment is a security assessment service that delivers a detailed analysis of how SSH (Secure Shell) is deployed and used in your network and provides an estimate of your SSH key management problem. Long term, SSH Communications recommends a best practice that discovers, monitors, remediates, and manages SSH keys for interactive and automated connections both in on premise and cloud-based environments.

=========================================================

Malware & Hackers Collect SSH Keys to Spread Attack
===================================================

[SSH keys](/ssh/key/) are access credentials that grant access to servers without having to type a password. They are commonly used for automated machine-to-machine access for file transfers and integration of information systems. [Unix and Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) system administrators use them every day.

Advanced malware and hackers have been collecting SSH keys for years. This is for a few reasons:

*   The keys provide a long-term backdoor, and they can be used to spread the attack from one server to another - possibly across nearly all servers in an enterprise, including disaster recovery data centers and backup data centers.
    
*   The keys often grant access to [credit card payment environments](/compliance/pci) and [financial data environments in public companies](/compliance/sarbanes-oxley/).
    
*   The keys commonly provide [root](/iam/user/root) or [administrator](/iam/user/administrator) access, thus allowing installation of malware, compromising of software, or even outright destruction.
    

Hackers have known about SSH keys for years. We have talked to a former government hacker, now a penetration tester, who said he would always first get all SSH keys. In the famous [Sony breach](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2014/12/03/sony-playstation-serving-hacked-data/), hackers stole SSH credentials and apparently used them to attack. Authentication credentials, particularly SSH keys, are [a natural target for attackers](https://securityintelligence.com/could-your-ssh-keys-become-stolen-credentials).

Malware Using SSH Keys
----------------------

The first publicized malware to collect SSH keys was [Careto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careto_(malware)), discovered in 2014 and believed to be the work of a nation state. There have also been many other instances of malware collecting SSH keys and/or otherwise leveraging SSH for attacks:

The list above is far from exhaustive, and many more SSH-using malware packages and modules are likely to exist for systems that are used by cybercriminals, militaries, and intelligence agencies.

SSH keys are often used for copying data into backup systems and disaster recovery data centers. They are also often used for reconfiguring various routers and systems when switching to using a disaster recovery data center. This means that SSH keys can commonly be used to spread an attack to these systems, unless the transitive access graph has been carefully thought out.

Spreading Using SSH Keys
------------------------

We have found that most large organizations have many times more SSH keys than they have servers or user accounts. For example, in one typical financial institution we found 3 million SSH keys granting access to 15,000 servers. That is an average of 200 keys per server.

Once an attacker breaks into one server, it is highly likely that the attacker will find one or more private keys from that initial server. The attacker can then use these discovered private keys to login to other servers - typically more than one - and again find private keys from these servers. Repeating this quickly spreads the breach and exposes more and more of the target network.

Leveraging unmanaged SSH keys allows the attacker to establish and expand a foothold in the target networks, and an attack like this may quickly spread through almost the whole environment.

![ssh-backtunneling-malware-attack-spread-ssh-port-forward](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/ssh-backtunneling-malware-attack-spread-ssh-port-forward-2.png)

What Can Malware and Their Masters Do with the Keys and Access
--------------------------------------------------------------

Once the attackers are in possession of SSH keys that grant access to a system, they gain operating system level access to the system, typically a command line. In our analysis of real-life deployments, we have seen that roughly 10% of all SSH keys grant [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser) access. For the attackers **root privileges allow unrestricted access** to all aspects of the system. In cases where the SSH keys allow non-root access, the attackers will typically attempt to combine local attacks, using vulnerabilities in software and/or operating system on the server, to escalate privileges to root.

Once an attacker has gained root access, anything is possible. The attacker can modify the operating system, [install malware into the BIOS](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/researchers-uncover-way-hack-bios-undermine-secure-operating-systems) or [firmware](https://blog.kaspersky.com/equation-hdd-malware/7623) (e.g., a form of [virtualized rootkit](http://www.zdnet.com/article/blue-pill-the-first-effective-hypervisor-rootkit)), modify the operating system or any services running on it. The attacker can even damage the system and its data beyond repair by wiping the BIOS, hard drive firmware, and network adapter firmware. Root access typically gives the attacker total control of the system.

Even without root access, the attackers can read and modify any data accessible to the account(s) they have access to. For example, access to an [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/index.html) database [service account](https://servergeeks.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/service-account-in-ad) may grant direct read **and modify** access to the raw database files and to the memory of the database server process, bypassing all database-level logging, security controls, and integrity checks. This allows extracting data, subverting encryption, inserting fraudulent data, or damaging or destroying the database.

An attack that uses SSH keys to spread throughout an enterprise could take the target down for months. Or a country, if targeting its critical infrastructure.

Productized Malware - Tools for Criminals
-----------------------------------------

Penetration testing tools, such as [Cobalt Strike/Armitage](http://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2014/10/22/map-of-cobalt-strike-features-for-armitage-users) include modules for exploiting SSH keys in attacks. These tools are highly productized and easy to use. They automate some of the manual tasks involved in attacks. They have been designed to be easy enough to be used even by people without extensive technical knowledge. The existence and design of these tools indicate the high value of SSH keys as targets. Actual attack tools perform similar attacks much more stealthily.

SSH keys are valuable. In one public instance, a key was [sold for 50 Bitcoints](http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/04/25/shapeshift-hack-simply-incredible) and used to penetrate into an organization and steal Bitcoins from a cryptocurrency exchange. The extent of the black market for stolen SSH keys (and [back-tunneling ports](/ssh/tunneling/) into respective intranets) is currently not known. A known fact is that certain government sites receive constant attacks where various SSH keys are tried against them. The attackers are trying to pick the lock with keys they have acquired.

How Hackers Gain Access to Intranet Even when Protected by Firewalls
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Using SSH keys requires a TCP/IP connection to to the server. A common misconception is that the problem would not be so serious in the internal networks as it is on the public Internet. This is a false assumption for a couple of reasons:

*   Attackers are often **already inside** the protected network (either in person, via a connection, or using malware). There have been many cases where SSH keys have been stolen, sold, or misused by employees.
    
*   Attackers commonly leverage [port forwarding](/ssh/tunneling/). Most firewalls are unable to prevent this, and those that do, have very limited functionality.
    

What to Do?
-----------

Risks related to poorly managed SSH keys can be greatly reduced by proper access [provisioning and termination processes](/iam/identity-management), deployment of [key management tools](/iam/ssh-key-management/), and regular [audits](/compliance/).

*   [NIST IR 7966](/compliance/nist-7966/) is US Government best practice guidelines for addressing SSH keys.
    
*   Our [SSH key management page](/iam/ssh-key-management/) contains additional information about risks, the process, and how to approach SSH key management projects.
    
*   Read about [compliance requirements](/compliance/) related to SSH keys.
    
*   [SSH Risk Assessment](/products/ssh-risk-assessment/) is a fast, low-cost service that helps quantify and evaluate an organization's SSH key management state and related risks.
    
*   [Universal SSH Key Manager®](/products/universal-ssh-key-manager/) is the leading tool for addressing SSH key management - discovery, lock-down, remediation, monitoring, and establishing efficient provisioning and termination processes for keys. It enables application teams to take ownership of incoming and outgoing access in their information systems, gives security teams overall visibility over the environment, and facilitates smooth audits.
    

In addition, it is important to [control SSH port forwarding into the organization](/ssh/tunneling/), as it makes utilizing stolen keys and otherwise breaking into the organization frighteningly easy.

What is a man-in-the-middle attack?
-----------------------------------

A _man-in-the-middle attack_ (MITM) is an attack against a cryptographic protocol. As the name implies, in this attack the attacker sits in the middle and negotiates different cryptographic parameters with the client and the server.

Implications of the attack
--------------------------

A man-in-the-middle attack may permit the attacker to completely subvert encryption and gain access to the encrypted contents, including passwords. A successful attacker is able to inject commands into terminal session, to modify data in transit, or to steal data.

The attack also allows injecting malware into any binaries and software updates downloaded through the system. Several attack groups and malware packages have used this technique in the past.

For web traffic, the attack allows utilizing browser vulnerabilities for breaking into the computers running the browsers or completely subverting any browser-based application and stealing passwords and other confidential data from them.

How to do a MITM attack
-----------------------

Technically, performing a successful man-in-the-middle attack is rather complex. However, sophisticated tools for performing them are readily available, both for hackers and for penetration testing. For example, the [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) penetration testing tool supports many kinds of MITM attacks out-of-the-box and tools like [Armitage](http://www.fastandeasyhacking.com/) provide an easy-to-use graphical user interface for performing such attacks remotely.

Performing a MITM attack generally requires being able to direct packets between the client and server to go through a system the attacker controls. [Arp spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing) is commonly used for redirecting traffic in a local network to the attacker's system. Various routing attacks can be used to perform the attack remotely. It is also common for hackers and malware to attack routers, DSL modems, and WiFi base stations to install malware on them that performs the man-in-the-middle attack.

The attack software then implements both the client and server sides for the protocol being attacked. When the client connects, the attack tool acts as a server, and negotiates a session with the client. It then acts as a client, and negotiates another encrypted connection with the server.

Server keys protect against the attack
--------------------------------------

There are basically three different modes for performing a man-in-the middle attack as it comes to keys:

*   The man in the middle may use a newly generated server key, or a self-signed certificate. Many people will automatically accept changed keys, and thus enable the attacker to do anything to their connection.
    
*   The attacker may have been able to penetrate the server earlier and steal its server key. The attacker may also have obtained the key in other ways, such as from decommissioned equipment that was not properly wiped. A stolen key may have also been purchased from cybercriminals.
    
*   The attacker may be able to generate certificates from a certificate authority trusted by the client. This is a typical attack mode used by governments against [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS).
    

Various ways to prevent the attack
----------------------------------

To protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, there needs to be some kind of shared trust or shared secret between the client and server. The most commonly used methods are:

*   An X.509 certificate (as in [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) and [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security))
    
*   Some kind of proprietary certificate mechanism (e.g., [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/))
    
*   A public key on the client and a private key on the server (e.g., [SSH](/ssh/))
    
*   A shared secret value (e.g., [IPSec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) with preshared keys).
    

In the SSH protocol, the traditional method is to use public keys. Most SSH clients will trust the server's key during the first connection, on the theory that at any given time a man-in-the-middle attack on the network is unlikely, and it provides the best possible tradeoff between usability and security for grass-roots deployment.


Managing host keys in SSH
-------------------------

In SSH, host keys protect against man-in-the-attacks, but they need to be [properly managed](/iam/ssh-key-management/), they need to be [unique for each server](http://www.cio.com/article/3009140/millions-of-embedded-devices-use-the-same-hard-coded-ssh-and-tls-private-keys.html), and they need to be changed periodically and whenever a compromise is suspected.

Host certificates (standard [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) certificates in [Tectia SSH](/products/tectia-ssh/) and proprietary certificates in [OpenSSH](/ssh/openssh/)) are very helpful in achieving this goal.

/. 180 [Password Sniffing](https://www.ssh.com/academy/attack/password-sniffing)
=========================================================

Password Sniffing Attack
========================

Password sniffing is an attack on the Internet that is used to steal user names and passwords from the network. Today, it is mostly of historical interest, as most protocols nowadays use strong encryption for passwords. However, it used to be the worst security problem on the Internet in the 1990s, when news of major password sniffing attacks were almost weekly.

The password sniffing problem was largely solved by [SSH](/ssh/), which replaced several prior insecure protocols. Many other protocols have also introduced encryption or at least hashing of passwords, which makes this attack less practical. However, various other credentials stealing and replay attacks are still widely used. [Man-in-the-middle attacks](/attack/man-in-the-middle) are commonly used for stealing passwords and credentials today.

Typical Password Sniffing Implementation
----------------------------------------

The typical implementation of a password sniffing attack involves gaining access to a computer connected to a local area network and installing a `password sniffer` on it. The password sniffer is a small program that listens to all traffic in the attached network(s), builds data streams out of TCP/IP packets, and extracts user names and passwords from those streams that contain protocols that send cleartext passwords. (A similar approach can be applied to other credentials.)

I (Tatu Ylönen) once tried to implement such an attack as an experiment. It took me three hours to have a program that processed the data from each TCP/IP stream separately and extracted information from them. It is not a difficult attack to code.

The attack can also be performed in switches, routers, and printers. It is common nowadays for attackers to install presence on such devices. They don't run anti-virus and aren't easy to audit. Furthermore, traffic naturally goes through switches and routers, so no extra network packets need to be sent to fool switches into sending traffic of interest to the listening node.

Existing Implementations
------------------------

There are many implementations of password sniffers, many dating back to 1990s. Here are just some examples:

*   [SniffPass from NirSoft](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/password_sniffer.html)
    
*   [Password Sniffer Spy](http://securityxploded.com/password-sniffer-spy.php)

*   [Build an FTP Password Sniffer with Scapy and Python](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/build-ftp-password-sniffer-with-scapy-and-python-0169759/)
    

Modern Complications
--------------------

Besides adding encryption, various other developments have made wide-scale password sniffing somewhat more difficult. However, encryption is the only reliable solution, and due to man-in-the-middle attack risks, the encryption must include proper authentication of communicating parties.

*   In the 1990s, thick ethernet was common, and every host typically saw all traffic in the network. Thus, it was enough to put a network interface into `promiscuous mode` to see all traffic. Today, networks use switches and star-like topologies, which make this more difficult. However, it is often possible to fool switches to send traffic to any host, or perform the attack on the switch itself.
    
*   Some enterprises hard-code MAC addresses for each network port in switches and update and set passwords on switches. Such configurations may make this attack difficult. However, it is impossible to control all switches and routers on long-distance connections.
    
*   Intrusion detection systems may be able to detect log records resulting from some techniques of getting the traffic to the attacker's system. However, attacks performed by installing software on switches (e.g., using default passwords) generally cannot be detected this way, and most smaller organizations don't deploy intrusion detection systems today.
