         FFplay is a very simple and portable media player using the
         FFmpeg libraries and the SDL library. It is mostly used as a
         testbed for the various FFmpeg APIs.

            :class: chapter

         All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a
         string representing a number as input, which may be followed by
         one of the SI unit prefixes, for example: ’K’, ’M’, or ’G’.

         If ’i’ is appended to the SI unit prefix, the complete prefix
         will be interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiples,
         which are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000.
         Appending ’B’ to the SI unit prefix multiplies the value by 8.
         This allows using, for example: ’KB’, ’MiB’, ’G’ and ’B’ as
         number suffixes.

         Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and
         set the corresponding value to true. They can be set to false
         by prefixing the option name with "no". For example using
         "-nofoo" will set the boolean option with name "foo" to false.

               :name: stream-specifiers
               :class: section

            Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec.
            Stream specifiers are used to precisely specify which
            stream(s) a given option belongs to.

            A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the
            option name and separated from it by a colon. E.g.
            ``-codec:a:1 ac3`` contains the ``a:1`` stream specifier,
            which matches the second audio stream. Therefore, it would
            select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

            A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the
            option is applied to all of them. E.g. the stream specifier
            in ``-b:a 128k`` matches all audio streams.

            An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example,
            ``-codec copy`` or ``-codec: copy`` would copy all the
            streams without reencoding.

            Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

            ``stream_index``
               Matches the stream with this index. E.g. ``-threads:1 4``
               would set the thread count for the second stream to 4. If
               ``stream_index`` is used as an additional stream
               specifier (see below), then it selects stream number
               ``stream_index`` from the matching streams. Stream
               numbering is based on the order of the streams as
               detected by libavformat except when a program ID is also
               specified. In this case it is based on the ordering of
               the streams in the program.

            ``stream_type``\ ``[:``\ ``additional_stream_specifier``\ ``]``
               ``stream_type`` is one of following: ’v’ or ’V’ for
               video, ’a’ for audio, ’s’ for subtitle, ’d’ for data, and
               ’t’ for attachments. ’v’ matches all video streams, ’V’
               only matches video streams which are not attached
               pictures, video thumbnails or cover arts. If
               ``additional_stream_specifier`` is used, then it matches
               streams which both have this type and match the
               ``additional_stream_specifier``. Otherwise, it matches
               all streams of the specified type.

            ``p:``\ ``program_id``\ ``[:``\ ``additional_stream_specifier``\ ``]``
               Matches streams which are in the program with the id
               ``program_id``. If ``additional_stream_specifier`` is
               used, then it matches streams which both are part of the
               program and match the ``additional_stream_specifier``.

            ``#``\ ``stream_id``\ ``or i:``\ ``stream_id``
               Match the stream by stream id (e.g. PID in MPEG-TS
               container).

            ``m:``\ ``key``\ ``[:``\ ``value``\ ``]``
               Matches streams with the metadata tag ``key`` having the
               specified value. If ``value`` is not given, matches
               streams that contain the given tag with any value.

            ``u``
               Matches streams with usable configuration, the codec must
               be defined and the essential information such as video
               dimension or audio sample rate must be present.

               Note that in ``ffmpeg``, matching by metadata will only
               work properly for input files.

            ``-sinks``\ ``device``\ ``[,``\ ``opt1``\ ``=``\ ``val1``\ ``[,``\ ``opt2``\ ``=``\ ``val2``\ ``]...]``
            Show autodetected sinks of the output device. Some devices
            may provide system-dependent sink names that cannot be

            ``-loglevel [``\ ``flags``\ ``+]``\ ``loglevel``\ ``| -v [``\ ``flags``\ ``+]``\ ``loglevel``
            Set logging level and flags used by the library.

            The optional ``flags`` prefix can consist of the following
            values:

            ‘\ ``repeat``\ ’
               Indicates that repeated log output should not be
               compressed to the first line and the "Last message
               repeated n times" line will be omitted.

            ‘\ ``level``\ ’
               Indicates that log output should add a ``[level]`` prefix
               to each message line. This can be used as an alternative
               to log coloring, e.g. when dumping the log to file.

            Flags can also be used alone by adding a ’+’/’-’ prefix to
            set/reset a single flag without affecting other ``flags`` or
            changing ``loglevel``. When setting both ``flags`` and
            ``loglevel``, a ’+’ separator is expected between the last
            ``flags`` value and before ``loglevel``.

            ``loglevel`` is a string or a number containing one of the
            following values:

            ‘\ ``quiet, -8``\ ’
            Show nothing at all; be silent.

            ‘\ ``panic, 0``\ ’
            Only show fatal errors which could lead the process to
            crash, such as an assertion failure. This is not currently
            used for anything.

            ‘\ ``fatal, 8``\ ’
            Only show fatal errors. These are errors after which the
            process absolutely cannot continue.

            ‘\ ``error, 16``\ ’
            Show all errors, including ones which can be recovered from.

            ‘\ ``warning, 24``\ ’
            Show all warnings and errors. Any message related to
            possibly incorrect or unexpected events will be shown.

            ‘\ ``info, 32``\ ’
            Show informative messages during processing. This is in
            addition to warnings and errors. This is the default value.

            ‘\ ``verbose, 40``\ ’
            Same as ``info``, except more verbose.

            ‘\ ``debug, 48``\ ’
            Show everything, including debugging information.

            ‘\ ``trace, 56``\ ’
            For example to enable repeated log output, add the ``level``
            prefix, and set ``loglevel`` to ``verbose``:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -loglevel repeat+level+verbose -i input output

            Another example that enables repeated log output without
            affecting current state of ``level`` prefix flag or
            ``loglevel``:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg [...] -loglevel +repeat

            By default the program logs to stderr. If coloring is
            supported by the terminal, colors are used to mark errors
            and warnings. Log coloring can be disabled setting the
            environment variable ``AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR``, or can be
            forced setting the environment variable
            ``AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR``.

            ``-report``
            Dump full command line and log output to a file named
            ``program``\ ``-``\ ``YYYYMMDD``\ ``-``\ ``HHMMSS``\ ``.log``
            in the current directory. This file can be useful for bug
            reports. It also implies ``-loglevel debug``.

            Setting the environment variable ``FFREPORT`` to any value
            has the same effect. If the value is a ’:’-separated
            key=value sequence, these options will affect the report;
            option values must be escaped if they contain special
            characters or the options delimiter ’:’ (see the “Quoting
            and escaping” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual).

            The following options are recognized:

            ``file``
               set the file name to use for the report; ``%p`` is
               expanded to the name of the program, ``%t`` is expanded
               to a timestamp, ``%%`` is expanded to a plain ``%``

            ``level``
               set the log verbosity level using a numerical value (see
               ``-loglevel``).

            For example, to output a report to a file named
            ``ffreport.log`` using a log level of ``32`` (alias for log
            level ``info``):

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  FFREPORT=file=ffreport.log:level=32 ffmpeg -i input output

            Errors in parsing the environment variable are not fatal,
            and will not appear in the report.

            ``-hide_banner``
            Suppress printing banner.

            All FFmpeg tools will normally show a copyright notice,
            build options and library versions. This option can be used
            to suppress printing this information.

            ``-cpuflags flags (``\ *``global``*\ ``)``
            Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is
            intended for testing. Do not use it unless you know what
            you’re doing.

            .. container:: example

            These options are provided directly by the libavformat,
            libavdevice and libavcodec libraries. To see the list of
            available AVOptions, use the ``-help`` option. They are
            separated into two categories:

            ``generic``
               These options can be set for any container, codec or
               device. Generic options are listed under AVFormatContext
               options for containers/devices and under AVCodecContext
               options for codecs.

            ``private``
               These options are specific to the given container, device
               or codec. Private options are listed under their
               corresponding containers/devices/codecs.

            For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default
            ID3v2.4 to an MP3 file, use the ``id3v2_version`` private
            option of the MP3 muxer:

                  ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3

            All codec AVOptions are per-stream, and thus a stream
            specifier should be attached to them:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -i multichannel.mxf -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 -map 0:a:0 -c:a:0 ac3 -b:a:0 640k -ac:a:1 2 -c:a:1 aac -b:2 128k out.mp4

            In the above example, a multichannel audio stream is mapped
            twice for output. The first instance is encoded with codec
            ac3 and bitrate 640k. The second instance is downmixed to 2
            channels and encoded with codec aac. A bitrate of 128k is
            specified for it using absolute index of the output stream.

            Note: the ``-nooption`` syntax cannot be used for boolean
            AVOptions, use ``-option 0``/``-option 1``.

            Note: the old undocumented way of specifying per-stream
            AVOptions by prepending v/a/s to the options name is now
            obsolete and will be removed soon.

               2.0.5, Windows SDL >= 2.0.6.

            ``-volume``
               Set the startup volume. 0 means silence, 100 means no
               volume reduction or amplification. Negative values are
               treated as 0, values above 100 are treated as 100.

               a centered window).

            ``-top``\ ``title``
               Set the y position for the top of the window (default is
               a centered window).

            ``-loop``\ ``number``

               Create the filtergraph specified by ``filtergraph`` and
               use it to filter the video stream.

               ``filtergraph`` is a description of the filtergraph to
               apply to the stream, and must have a single video input
               and a single video output. In the filtergraph, the input
               is associated to the label ``in``, and the output to the
               label ``out``. See the ffmpeg-filters manual for more
               information about the filtergraph syntax.

               You can specify this parameter multiple times and cycle
               through the specified filtergraphs along with the show
               modes by pressing the key w.

            ``-af``\ ``filtergraph``
               ``filtergraph`` is a description of the filtergraph to
               apply to the input audio. Use the option "-filters" to
               show all the available filters (including sources and
               sinks).

            ``-i``\ ``input_url``
               Read ``input_url``.

            ``-stats``
               Print several playback statistics, in particular show the
               stream duration, the codec parameters, the current
               position in the stream and the audio/video
               synchronisation drift. It is shown by default, unless the
               log level is lower than ``info``. Its display can be
               forced by manually specifying this option. To disable it,
               you need to specify ``-nostats``.

            ``-fast``
               Non-spec-compliant optimizations.

            ``-genpts``

            ``-sync``\ ``type``
               Set the master clock to audio (``type=audio``), video
               (``type=video``) or external (``type=ext``). Default is
               audio. The master clock is used to control audio-video
               synchronization. Most media players use audio as master
               clock, but in some cases (streaming or high quality
               broadcast) it is necessary to change that. This option is
               mainly used for debugging purposes.

            ``-ast``\ ``audio_stream_specifier``
               Select the desired audio stream using the given stream
               specifier. The stream specifiers are described in the
               `Stream specifiers <#Stream-specifiers>`__ chapter. If
               this option is not specified, the "best" audio stream is
               selected in the program of the already selected video
               stream.

            ``-vst``\ ``video_stream_specifier``
               Select the desired video stream using the given stream
               specifier. The stream specifiers are described in the
               `Stream specifiers <#Stream-specifiers>`__ chapter. If
               this option is not specified, the "best" video stream is
               selected.

            ``-sst``\ ``subtitle_stream_specifier``
               Select the desired subtitle stream using the given stream
               specifier. The stream specifiers are described in the
               `Stream specifiers <#Stream-specifiers>`__ chapter. If
               this option is not specified, the "best" subtitle stream
               is selected in the program of the already selected video
               or audio stream.

            ``-autoexit``
               Exit when video is done playing.

            ``-exitonkeydown``
               Exit if any key is pressed.

            ``-exitonmousedown``
               Exit if any mouse button is pressed.

            ``-codec:``\ ``media_specifier``\ ````\ ``codec_name``
               Force a specific decoder implementation for the stream
               identified by ``media_specifier``, which can assume the
               values ``a`` (audio), ``v`` (video), and ``s`` subtitle.

            ``-acodec``\ ``codec_name``
               Force a specific audio decoder.

            ``-vcodec``\ ``codec_name``
               Force a specific video decoder.

            ``-scodec``\ ``codec_name``
               Force a specific subtitle decoder.

            ``-autorotate``
               Automatically rotate the video according to file
               metadata. Enabled by default, use ``-noautorotate`` to
               disable it.

            ``-framedrop``
               Drop video frames if video is out of sync. Enabled by
               default if the master clock is not set to video. Use this
               option to enable frame dropping for all master clock
               sources, use ``-noframedrop`` to disable it.

            ``-infbuf``
               Do not limit the input buffer size, read as much data as
               possible from the input as soon as possible. Enabled by
               default for realtime streams, where data may be dropped
               if not read in time. Use this option to enable infinite
               buffers for all inputs, use ``-noinfbuf`` to disable it.

            ``-filter_threads``\ ``nb_threads``
               Defines how many threads are used to process a filter
               pipeline. Each pipeline will produce a thread pool with
               this many threads available for parallel processing. The
               default is 0 which means that the thread count will be
               determined by the number of available CPUs.

            .. rubric:: 4.1 Quoting and escaping
               :name: quoting-and-escaping
               :class: section

            FFmpeg adopts the following quoting and escaping mechanism,
            unless explicitly specified. The following rules are
            applied:

            -  ‘\ ``'``\ ’ and ‘\ ``\``\ ’ are special characters
               (respectively used for quoting and escaping). In addition
               to them, there might be other special characters
               depending on the specific syntax where the escaping and
               quoting are employed.
            -  A special character is escaped by prefixing it with a
               ‘\ ``\``\ ’.
            -  All characters enclosed between ‘\ ``''``\ ’ are included
               literally in the parsed string. The quote character
               ‘\ ``'``\ ’ itself cannot be quoted, so you may need to
               close the quote and escape it.
            -  Leading and trailing whitespaces, unless escaped or
               quoted, are removed from the parsed string.

            Note that you may need to add a second level of escaping
            when using the command line or a script, which depends on
            the syntax of the adopted shell language.

            The function ``av_get_token`` defined in
            ``libavutil/avstring.h`` can be used to parse a token quoted
            or escaped according to the rules defined above.

            The tool ``tools/ffescape`` in the FFmpeg source tree can be
            used to automatically quote or escape a string in a script.

                  :class: subsection

               -  Escape the string ``Crime d'Amour`` containing the
                  ``'`` special character:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        Crime d\'Amour

               -  The string above contains a quote, so the ``'`` needs
                  to be escaped when quoting it:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        'Crime d'\''Amour'

               -  Include leading or trailing whitespaces using quoting:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        '  this string starts and ends with whitespaces  '

               -  Escaping and quoting can be mixed together:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        ' The string '\'string\'' is a string '

               -  To include a literal ‘\ ``\``\ ’ you can use either
                  escaping or quoting:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        'c:\foo' can be written as c:\\foo

            .. rubric:: 4.2 Date
               :name: date
               :class: section

            The accepted syntax is:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  [(YYYY-MM-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...]]])|(HHMMSS[.m...]]]))[Z]
                  now

            If the value is "now" it takes the current time.

            Time is local time unless Z is appended, in which case it is
            interpreted as UTC. If the year-month-day part is not
            specified it takes the current year-month-day.

            ``HH`` expresses the number of hours, ``MM`` the number of
            minutes for a maximum of 2 digits, and ``SS`` the number of
            seconds for a maximum of 2 digits. The ``m`` at the end
            expresses decimal value for ``SS``.

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  [-]S+[.m...][s|ms|us]

            ``S`` expresses the number of seconds, with the optional
            decimal part ``m``. The optional literal suffixes
            ‘\ ``s``\ ’, ‘\ ``ms``\ ’ or ‘\ ``us``\ ’ indicate to
            interpret the value as seconds, milliseconds or
            microseconds, respectively.

            In both expressions, the optional ‘\ ``-``\ ’ indicates
            negative duration.

            A ratio can be expressed as an expression, or in the form
            ``numerator``:``denominator``.

            Note that a ratio with infinite (1/0) or negative value is
            considered valid, so you should check on the returned value
            if you want to exclude those values.

            The undefined value can be expressed using the "0:0" string.

            insensitive match) or a ``[0x|#]RRGGBB[AA]`` sequence,
            possibly followed by @ and a string representing the alpha
            component.

            The alpha component may be a string composed by "0x"
            followed by an hexadecimal number or a decimal number
            between 0.0 and 1.0, which represents the opacity value
            (‘\ ``0x00``\ ’ or ‘\ ``0.0``\ ’ means completely
            transparent, ‘\ ``0xff``\ ’ or ‘\ ``1.0``\ ’ completely
            opaque). If the alpha component is not specified then
            ‘\ ``0xff``\ ’ is assumed.

            The string ‘\ ``random``\ ’ will result in a random color.

            A channel layout specifies the spatial disposition of the
            channels in a multi-channel audio stream. To specify a
            channel layout, FFmpeg makes use of a special syntax.

            Individual channels are identified by an id, as given by the
            table below:

            ‘\ ``FL``\ ’

            A custom channel layout can be specified as a sequence of
            terms, separated by ’+’. Each term can be:

            -  the name of a single channel (e.g. ‘\ ``FL``\ ’,
               ‘\ ``FR``\ ’, ‘\ ``FC``\ ’, ‘\ ``LFE``\ ’, etc.), each
               optionally containing a custom name after a ’@’, (e.g.
               ‘\ ``FL@Left``\ ’, ‘\ ``FR@Right``\ ’,
               ‘\ ``FC@Center``\ ’, ‘\ ``LFE@Low_Frequency``\ ’, etc.)

            A standard channel layout can be specified by the following:

            -  the name of a single channel (e.g. ‘\ ``FL``\ ’,
               ‘\ ``FR``\ ’, ‘\ ``FC``\ ’, ‘\ ``LFE``\ ’, etc.)
            -  the name of a standard channel layout (e.g.
               ‘\ ``mono``\ ’, ‘\ ``stereo``\ ’, ‘\ ``4.0``\ ’,
               ‘\ ``quad``\ ’, ‘\ ``5.0``\ ’, etc.)
            -  a number of channels, in decimal, followed by ’c’,
               yielding the default channel layout for that number of
               channels (see the function
               ``av_channel_layout_default``). Note that not all channel
               counts have a default layout.
            -  a number of channels, in decimal, followed by ’C’,
               yielding an unknown channel layout with the specified
               number of channels. Note that not all channel layout
               specification strings support unknown channel layouts.
            -  a channel layout mask, in hexadecimal starting with "0x"
               (see the ``AV_CH_*`` macros in
               ``libavutil/channel_layout.h``.

            Before libavutil version 53 the trailing character "c" to
            specify a number of channels was optional, but now it is
            required, while a channel layout mask can also be specified
            as a decimal number (if and only if not followed by "c" or
            "C").

            See also the function ``av_channel_layout_from_string``
            defined in ``libavutil/channel_layout.h``.

            :class: chapter

         When evaluating an arithmetic expression, FFmpeg uses an
         internal formula evaluator, implemented through the
         ``libavutil/eval.h`` interface.

         An expression may contain unary, binary operators, constants,
         and functions.

         Two expressions ``expr1`` and ``expr2`` can be combined to form
         another expression "``expr1``;\ ``expr2``". ``expr1`` and
         ``expr2`` are evaluated in turn, and the new expression
         evaluates to the value of ``expr2``.

         The following binary operators are available: ``+``, ``-``,
         ``*``, ``/``, ``^``.

         The following unary operators are available: ``+``, ``-``.

         The following functions are available:

         ``abs(x)``
            Compute absolute value of ``x``.

         ``acos(x)``
            Compute arccosine of ``x``.

         ``asin(x)``
            Compute arcsine of ``x``.

         ``atan(x)``
            Compute arctangent of ``x``.

         ``atan2(x, y)``
            Compute principal value of the arc tangent of ``y``/``x``.

         ``between(x, min, max)``
            Return 1 if ``x`` is greater than or equal to ``min`` and
            lesser than or equal to ``max``, 0 otherwise.

         ``bitand(x, y)``
         ``bitor(x, y)``
            Compute bitwise and/or operation on ``x`` and ``y``.

            The results of the evaluation of ``x`` and ``y`` are
            converted to integers before executing the bitwise
            operation.

            Note that both the conversion to integer and the conversion
            back to floating point can lose precision. Beware of
            unexpected results for large numbers (usually 2^53 and
            larger).

         ``ceil(expr)``
            Round the value of expression ``expr`` upwards to the
            nearest integer. For example, "ceil(1.5)" is "2.0".

         ``clip(x, min, max)``
            Return the value of ``x`` clipped between ``min`` and
            ``max``.

         ``cos(x)``
            Compute cosine of ``x``.

         ``cosh(x)``
            Compute hyperbolic cosine of ``x``.

         ``eq(x, y)``
            Return 1 if ``x`` and ``y`` are equivalent, 0 otherwise.

         ``exp(x)``
            Compute exponential of ``x`` (with base ``e``, the Euler’s
            number).

         ``floor(expr)``
            Round the value of expression ``expr`` downwards to the
            nearest integer. For example, "floor(-1.5)" is "-2.0".

         ``gauss(x)``
            Compute Gauss function of ``x``, corresponding to
            ``exp(-x*x/2) / sqrt(2*PI)``.

         ``gcd(x, y)``
            Return the greatest common divisor of ``x`` and ``y``. If
            both ``x`` and ``y`` are 0 or either or both are less than
            zero then behavior is undefined.

         ``gt(x, y)``
            Return 1 if ``x`` is greater than ``y``, 0 otherwise.

         ``gte(x, y)``
            Return 1 if ``x`` is greater than or equal to ``y``, 0
            otherwise.

         ``hypot(x, y)``
            This function is similar to the C function with the same
            name; it returns "sqrt(``x``\ \*\ ``x`` +
            ``y``\ \*\ ``y``)", the length of the hypotenuse of a right
            triangle with sides of length ``x`` and ``y``, or the
            distance of the point (``x``, ``y``) from the origin.

         ``if(x, y)``
            Evaluate ``x``, and if the result is non-zero return the
            result of the evaluation of ``y``, return 0 otherwise.

         ``if(x, y, z)``
            Evaluate ``x``, and if the result is non-zero return the
            evaluation result of ``y``, otherwise the evaluation result
            of ``z``.

         ``ifnot(x, y)``
            Evaluate ``x``, and if the result is zero return the result
            of the evaluation of ``y``, return 0 otherwise.

            Evaluate ``x``, and if the result is zero return the
            evaluation result of ``y``, otherwise the evaluation result
            of ``z``.

         ``isinf(x)``
            Return 1.0 if ``x`` is +/-INFINITY, 0.0 otherwise.

         ``isnan(x)``
            Return 1.0 if ``x`` is NAN, 0.0 otherwise.

         ``ld(var)``
            Load the value of the internal variable with number ``var``,
            which was previously stored with st(``var``, ``expr``). The
            function returns the loaded value.

         ``lerp(x, y, z)``
            Return linear interpolation between ``x`` and ``y`` by
            amount of ``z``.

         ``log(x)``
            Compute natural logarithm of ``x``.

         ``lt(x, y)``
            Return 1 if ``x`` is lesser than ``y``, 0 otherwise.

         ``lte(x, y)``
            Return 1 if ``x`` is lesser than or equal to ``y``, 0
            otherwise.

         ``max(x, y)``
            Return the maximum between ``x`` and ``y``.

         ``min(x, y)``
            Return the minimum between ``x`` and ``y``.

         ``mod(x, y)``
            Compute the remainder of division of ``x`` by ``y``.

         ``not(expr)``
            Return 1.0 if ``expr`` is zero, 0.0 otherwise.

         ``pow(x, y)``
            Compute the power of ``x`` elevated ``y``, it is equivalent
            to "(``x``)^(``y``)".

         ``print(t)``
         ``print(t, l)``
            Print the value of expression ``t`` with loglevel ``l``. If
            ``l`` is not specified then a default log level is used.
            Returns the value of the expression printed.

            Prints t with loglevel l

         ``random(x)``
            Return a pseudo random value between 0.0 and 1.0. ``x`` is
            the index of the internal variable which will be used to
            save the seed/state.

         ``root(expr, max)``
            Find an input value for which the function represented by
            ``expr`` with argument ``ld(0)`` is 0 in the interval
            0..\ ``max``.

            The expression in ``expr`` must denote a continuous function
            or the result is undefined.

            ``ld(0)`` is used to represent the function input value,
            which means that the given expression will be evaluated
            multiple times with various input values that the expression
            can access through ``ld(0)``. When the expression evaluates
            to 0 then the corresponding input value will be returned.

         ``round(expr)``
            Round the value of expression ``expr`` to the nearest
            integer. For example, "round(1.5)" is "2.0".

         ``sgn(x)``
            Compute sign of ``x``.

         ``sin(x)``
            Compute sine of ``x``.

         ``sinh(x)``
            Compute hyperbolic sine of ``x``.

         ``sqrt(expr)``
            Compute the square root of ``expr``. This is equivalent to
            "(``expr``)^.5".

         ``squish(x)``
            Compute expression ``1/(1 + exp(4*x))``.

         ``st(var, expr)``
            Store the value of the expression ``expr`` in an internal
            variable. ``var`` specifies the number of the variable where
            to store the value, and it is a value ranging from 0 to 9.
            The function returns the value stored in the internal
            variable. Note, Variables are currently not shared between
            expressions.

         ``tan(x)``
            Compute tangent of ``x``.

         ``tanh(x)``
            Compute hyperbolic tangent of ``x``.

         ``taylor(expr, x)``
         ``taylor(expr, x, id)``
            Evaluate a Taylor series at ``x``, given an expression
            representing the ``ld(id)``-th derivative of a function at
            0.

            When the series does not converge the result is undefined.

            ``ld(id)`` is used to represent the derivative order in
            ``expr``, which means that the given expression will be
            evaluated multiple times with various input values that the
            expression can access through ``ld(id)``. If ``id`` is not
            specified then 0 is assumed.

            Note, when you have the derivatives at y instead of 0,
            ``taylor(expr, x-y)`` can be used.

         ``time(0)``
            Return the current (wallclock) time in seconds.

         ``trunc(expr)``
            Round the value of expression ``expr`` towards zero to the
            nearest integer. For example, "trunc(-1.5)" is "-1.0".

         ``while(cond, expr)``
            Evaluate expression ``expr`` while the expression ``cond``
            is non-zero, and returns the value of the last ``expr``
            evaluation, or NAN if ``cond`` was always false.

         The following constants are available:

         ``PI``
            area of the unit disc, approximately 3.14

         ``E``
            exp(1) (Euler’s number), approximately 2.718

         ``PHI``
            golden ratio (1+sqrt(5))/2, approximately 1.618

         Assuming that an expression is considered "true" if it has a
         non-zero value, note that:

         ``*`` works like AND

         ``+`` works like OR

         For example the construct:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               if (A AND B) then C

         is equivalent to:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               if(A*B, C)

         In your C code, you can extend the list of unary and binary
         functions, and define recognized constants, so that they are
         available for your expressions.

         The evaluator also recognizes the International System unit
         prefixes. If ’i’ is appended after the prefix, binary prefixes
         are used, which are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers
         of 1000. The ’B’ postfix multiplies the value by 8, and can be
         appended after a unit prefix or used alone. This allows using
         for example ’KB’, ’MiB’, ’G’ and ’B’ as number postfix.

         The list of available International System prefixes follows,
         with indication of the corresponding powers of 10 and of 2.

         .. rubric:: 6 Codec Options
            :name: codec-options
            :class: chapter

         libavcodec provides some generic global options, which can be
         set on all the encoders and decoders. In addition each codec
         may support so-called private options, which are specific for a
         given codec.

         Sometimes, a global option may only affect a specific kind of
         codec, and may be nonsensical or ignored by another, so you
         need to be aware of the meaning of the specified options. Also
         some options are meant only for decoding or encoding.

         Options may be set by specifying -``option`` ``value`` in the
         FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
         ``AVCodecContext`` options or using the ``libavutil/opt.h`` API
         for programmatic use.

         The list of supported options follow:

         ``b``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``encoding,audio,video``*\ ``)``
         Set bitrate in bits/s. Default value is 200K.

         ``ab``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``encoding,audio``*\ ``)``
         Set audio bitrate (in bits/s). Default value is 128K.

         ``bt``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``encoding,video``*\ ``)``
         Set video bitrate tolerance (in bits/s). In 1-pass mode,
         bitrate tolerance specifies how far ratecontrol is willing to
         deviate from the target average bitrate value. This is not
         related to min/max bitrate. Lowering tolerance too much has an
         adverse effect on quality.

         ``flags``\ ``flags``\ ``(``\ *``decoding/encoding,audio,video,subtitles``*\ ``)``
         Set generic flags.

         Possible values:

         ‘\ ``mv4``\ ’
            Use four motion vector by macroblock (mpeg4).

         ‘\ ``qpel``\ ’
            Use 1/4 pel motion compensation.

         ‘\ ``loop``\ ’
            Use loop filter.

         ‘\ ``qscale``\ ’
            Use fixed qscale.

         ‘\ ``pass1``\ ’
            Use internal 2pass ratecontrol in first pass mode.

         ‘\ ``pass2``\ ’
            Use internal 2pass ratecontrol in second pass mode.

         ‘\ ``gray``\ ’
            Only decode/encode grayscale.

         ‘\ ``psnr``\ ’
            Set error[?] variables during encoding.

         ‘\ ``truncated``\ ’
            Input bitstream might be randomly truncated.

         ‘\ ``drop_changed``\ ’
            Don’t output frames whose parameters differ from first
            decoded frame in stream. Error AVERROR_INPUT_CHANGED is
            returned when a frame is dropped.

         ‘\ ``ildct``\ ’
            Use interlaced DCT.

         ‘\ ``low_delay``\ ’
            Force low delay.

         ‘\ ``global_header``\ ’
            Place global headers in extradata instead of every keyframe.

         ‘\ ``bitexact``\ ’
            Only write platform-, build- and time-independent data.
            (except (I)DCT). This ensures that file and data checksums
            are reproducible and match between platforms. Its primary
            use is for regression testing.

         ‘\ ``aic``\ ’
            Apply H263 advanced intra coding / mpeg4 ac prediction.

         ‘\ ``ilme``\ ’
            Apply interlaced motion estimation.

         ‘\ ``cgop``\ ’
            Use closed gop.

         ‘\ ``output_corrupt``\ ’
            Output even potentially corrupted frames.

         ``time_base``\ ``rational number``
         Set codec time base.

         It is the fundamental unit of time (in seconds) in terms of
         which frame timestamps are represented. For fixed-fps content,
         timebase should be ``1 / frame_rate`` and timestamp increments
         should be identically 1.

         ``g``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``encoding,video``*\ ``)``
         Set the group of picture (GOP) size. Default value is 12.

         ``ar``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``decoding/encoding,audio``*\ ``)``
         Set audio sampling rate (in Hz).

         ``ac``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``decoding/encoding,audio``*\ ``)``
         Set number of audio channels.

         ``cutoff``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``encoding,audio``*\ ``)``
         Set cutoff bandwidth. (Supported only by selected encoders, see

         ``skip_alpha``\ ``bool``\ ``(``\ *``decoding,video``*\ ``)``
         Set to 1 to disable processing alpha (transparency). This works
         like the ‘\ ``gray``\ ’ flag in the ``flags`` option which
         skips chroma information instead of alpha. Default is 0.

         ``codec_whitelist``\ ``list``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``

         Separator used to separate the fields printed on the command
         line about the Stream parameters. For example, to separate the
         fields with newlines and indentation:

         .. container:: example

         ``max_pixels``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``decoding/encoding,video``*\ ``)``
         Maximum number of pixels per image. This value can be used to
         avoid out of memory failures due to large images.

         ``apply_cropping``\ ``bool``\ ``(``\ *``decoding,video``*\ ``)``
         Enable cropping if cropping parameters are multiples of the
         required alignment for the left and top parameters. If the
         alignment is not met the cropping will be partially applied to
         maintain alignment. Default is 1 (enabled). Note: The required
         alignment depends on if ``AV_CODEC_FLAG_UNALIGNED`` is set and
         the CPU. ``AV_CODEC_FLAG_UNALIGNED`` cannot be changed from the
         command line. Also hardware decoders will not apply left/top
         Cropping.

         Decoders are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow the
         decoding of multimedia streams.

         When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported native
         decoders are enabled by default. Decoders requiring an external
         library must be enabled manually via the corresponding

            libopus decoder wrapper.

            libopus allows libavcodec to decode the Opus Interactive
            Audio Codec. Requires the presence of the libopus headers
            and library during configuration. You need to explicitly
            configure the build with ``--enable-libopus``.

            An FFmpeg native decoder for Opus exists, so users can
            decode Opus without this library.

               ``-font``\ ``font_name[,font_name2,...]``
                  Specify comma-separated list of font family names to
                  be used for *bitmap* or *ass* type subtitle rendering.
                  Only first font name is used for *ass* type subtitle.

                  If not specified, use internaly defined default font
                  family.

               ``-ass_single_rect``\ ``boolean``
                  ARIB STD-B24 specifies that some captions may be
                  displayed at different positions at a time
                  (multi-rectangle subtitle). Since some players (e.g.,
                  old *mpv*) can’t handle multiple ASS rectangles in a
                  single AVSubtitle, or multiple ASS rectangles of
                  indeterminate duration with the same start timestamp,
                  this option can change the behavior so that all the
                  texts are displayed in a single ASS rectangle.

                  The default is ``false``.

                  If your player cannot handle AVSubtitles with multiple
                  ASS rectangles properly, set this option to ``true``
                  or define ``ASS_SINGLE_RECT=1`` to change default
                  behavior at compilation.

               ``-force_outline_text``\ ``boolean``
                  Specify whether always render outline text for all
                  characters regardless of the indication by charactor
                  style.

                  The default is ``false``.

               ``-outline_width``\ ``number``\ ``(0.0 - 3.0)``
                  Specify width for outline text, in dots (relative).

                  The default is ``1.5``.

               ``-ignore_background``\ ``boolean``
                  Specify whether to ignore background color rendering.

                  The default is ``false``.

               ``-ignore_ruby``\ ``boolean``
                  Specify whether to ignore rendering for ruby-like
                  (furigana) characters.

                  The default is ``false``.

               ``-replace_drcs``\ ``boolean``
                  Specify whether to render replaced DRCS characters as
                  Unicode characters.

                  The default is ``true``.

               ``-replace_msz_ascii``\ ``boolean``
                  Specify whether to replace MSZ (Middle Size; half
                  width) fullwidth alphanumerics with halfwidth
                  alphanumerics.

                  The default is ``true``.

               ``-replace_msz_japanese``\ ``boolean``
                  Specify whether to replace some MSZ (Middle Size; half
                  width) fullwidth japanese special characters with
                  halfwidth ones.

                  The default is ``true``.

               ``-replace_msz_glyph``\ ``boolean``
                  Specify whether to replace MSZ (Middle Size; half
                  width) characters with halfwidth glyphs if the fonts
                  supports it. This option works under FreeType or
                  DirectWrite renderer with Adobe-Japan1 compliant
                  fonts. e.g., IBM Plex Sans JP, Morisawa BIZ UDGothic,
                  Morisawa BIZ UDMincho, Yu Gothic, Yu Mincho, and
                  Meiryo.

                  The default is ``true``.

               ``-canvas_size``\ ``image_size``
                  Specify the resolution of the canvas to render
                  subtitles to; usually, this should be frame size of
                  input video. This only applies when ``-subtitle_type``
                  is set to ``bitmap``.

                  The libaribcaption decoder assumes input frame size
                  for bitmap rendering as below:

                  #. PROFILE_A : 1440 x 1080 with SAR (PAR) 4:3
                  #. PROFILE_C : 320 x 180 with SAR (PAR) 1:1

                  If actual frame size of input video does not match
                  above assumption, the rendered captions may be
                  distorted. To make the captions undistorted, add
                  ``-canvas_size`` option to specify actual input video
                  size.

                  Note that the ``-canvas_size`` option is not required
                  for video with different size but same aspect ratio.
                  In such cases, the caption will be stretched or shrunk
                  to actual video size if ``-canvas_size`` option is not
                  specified. If ``-canvas_size`` option is specified
                  with different size, the caption will be stretched or
                  shrunk as specified size with calculated SAR.

                     Simple text based output without formatting.

                  ``ass``
                     Formatted ASS output, subtitle pages and teletext
                     pages are returned in different styles, subtitle
                     pages are stripped down to text, but an effort is
                     made to keep the text alignment and the formatting.

               ``txt_left``
                  X offset of generated bitmaps, default is 0.

               ``txt_top``
                  Y offset of generated bitmaps, default is 0.

               ``txt_chop_spaces``
                  Chops leading and trailing spaces and removes empty
                  lines from the generated text. This option is useful
                  for teletext based subtitles where empty spaces may be
                  present at the start or at the end of the lines or
                  empty lines may be present between the subtitle lines
                  because of double-sized teletext characters. Default
                  value is 1.

               ``txt_duration``
                  Sets the display duration of the decoded teletext
                  pages or subtitles in milliseconds. Default value is
                  -1 which means infinity or until the next subtitle
                  event comes.

               ``txt_transparent``
                  Force transparent background of the generated teletext
                  bitmaps. Default value is 0 which means an opaque
                  background.

               ``txt_opacity``
                  Sets the opacity (0-255) of the teletext background.
                  If ``txt_transparent`` is not set, it only affects
                  characters between a start box and an end box,
                  typically subtitles. Default value is 0 if
                  ``txt_transparent`` is set, 255 otherwise.

         When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported
         bitstream filters are enabled by default. You can list all
         available ones using the configure option ``--list-bsfs``.

         You can disable all the bitstream filters using the configure
         option ``--disable-bsfs``, and selectively enable any bitstream
         filter using the option ``--enable-bsf=BSF``, or you can
         disable a particular bitstream filter using the option
         ``--disable-bsf=BSF``.

         The option ``-bsfs`` of the ff\* tools will display the list of
         all the supported bitstream filters included in your build.

         The ff\* tools have a -bsf option applied per stream, taking a
         comma-separated list of filters, whose parameters follow the
         filter name after a ’=’.

            Convert MPEG-2/4 AAC ADTS to an MPEG-4 Audio Specific
            Configuration bitstream.

            This filter creates an MPEG-4 AudioSpecificConfig from an
            MPEG-2/4 ADTS header and removes the ADTS header.

            This filter is required for example when copying an AAC
            stream from a raw ADTS AAC or an MPEG-TS container to
            MP4A-LATM, to an FLV file, or to MOV/MP4 files and related
            formats such as 3GP or M4A. Please note that it is

            Modify metadata embedded in an AV1 stream.

            ``td``
               Insert or remove temporal delimiter OBUs in all temporal
               units of the stream.

               ‘\ ``insert``\ ’
                  Insert a TD at the beginning of every TU which does
                  not already have one.

               ‘\ ``remove``\ ’
                  Remove the TD from the beginning of every TU which has

               section 6.4.2).

            ``color_range``
               Set the color range in the stream (see AV1 section 6.4.2;
               note that this cannot be set for streams using BT.709
               primaries, sRGB transfer characteristic and identity
               (RGB) matrix coefficients).

               ‘\ ``tv``\ ’

            ``chroma_sample_position``
               Set the chroma sample location in the stream (see AV1
               section 6.4.2). This can only be set for 4:2:0 streams.

               ‘\ ``vertical``\ ’
                  Left position (matching the default in MPEG-2 and
                  H.264).

               ‘\ ``colocated``\ ’
                  Top-left position.

            ``tick_rate``
               Set the tick rate (*time_scale /
               num_units_in_display_tick*) in the timing info in the
               sequence header.

            ``num_ticks_per_picture``
               Set the number of ticks in each picture, to indicate that
               the stream has a fixed framerate. Ignored if
               ``tick_rate`` is not also set.

            ``delete_padding``

            Add extradata to the beginning of the filtered packets
            except when said packets already exactly begin with the
            extradata that is intended to be added.

            ``freq``
               The additional argument specifies which packets should be
               filtered. It accepts the values:

               ‘\ ``k``\ ’
               ‘\ ``keyframe``\ ’
                  add extradata to all key packets

               ‘\ ``e``\ ’
               ‘\ ``all``\ ’
                  add extradata to all packets

            If not specified it is assumed ‘\ ``k``\ ’.

            For example the following ``ffmpeg`` command forces a global
            header (thus disabling individual packet headers) in the
            H.264 packets generated by the ``libx264`` encoder, but
            corrects them by adding the header stored in extradata to
            the key packets:

            Blocks in DV which are marked as damaged are replaced by
            blocks of the specified color.

            ``color``
               The color to replace damaged blocks by

            ``sta``
               A 16 bit mask which specifies which of the 16 possible
               error status values are to be replaced by colored blocks.
               0xFFFE is the default which replaces all non 0 error
               status values.

               ‘\ ``ok``\ ’
                  No error, no concealment

               ‘\ ``err``\ ’
                  Error, No concealment

               ‘\ ``res``\ ’
                  Reserved

               ‘\ ``notok``\ ’
                  Error or concealment

               ‘\ ``notres``\ ’
                  Not reserved

               :class: section

            Extract the in-band extradata.

            Certain codecs allow the long-term headers (e.g. MPEG-2
            sequence headers, or H.264/HEVC (VPS/)SPS/PPS) to be
            transmitted either "in-band" (i.e. as a part of the
            bitstream containing the coded frames) or "out of band"
            (e.g. on the container level). This latter form is called
            "extradata" in FFmpeg terminology.

            This bitstream filter detects the in-band headers and makes
            them available as extradata.

            ``remove``
               When this option is enabled, the long-term headers are
               removed from the bitstream after extraction.

               :name: filter_units
               :class: section

            Remove units with types in or not in a given set from the
            stream.

            ``pass_types``
               List of unit types or ranges of unit types to pass
               through while removing all others. This is specified as a
               ’\|’-separated list of unit type values or ranges of
               values with ’-’.

            ``remove_types``
               Identical to ``pass_types``, except the units in the
               given set removed and all others passed through.

            Extradata is unchanged by this transformation, but note that
            if the stream contains inline parameter sets then the output
            may be unusable if they are removed.

            For example, to remove all non-VCL NAL units from an H.264
            stream:

            Set whether the stream is suitable for display using
            overscan or not (see H.264 section E.2.1).

            ``video_format``
            ``video_full_range_flag``
            Set the video format in the stream (see H.264 section E.2.1
            and table E-2).

            ``colour_primaries``
            ``transfer_characteristics``
            ``matrix_coefficients``
            Set the colour description in the stream (see H.264 section
            E.2.1 and tables E-3, E-4 and E-5).

            ``chroma_sample_loc_type``
            Set the chroma sample location in the stream (see H.264
            section E.2.1 and figure E-1).

            ``tick_rate``
            Set the tick rate (time_scale / num_units_in_tick) in the
            VUI parameters. This is the smallest time unit representable
            in the stream, and in many cases represents the field rate
            of the stream (double the frame rate).

            ``fixed_frame_rate_flag``
            Set whether the stream has fixed framerate - typically this
            indicates that the framerate is exactly half the tick rate,
            but the exact meaning is dependent on interlacing and the
            picture structure (see H.264 section E.2.1 and table E-6).

            ``zero_new_constraint_set_flags``
            Zero constraint_set4_flag and constraint_set5_flag in the
            SPS. These bits were reserved in a previous version of the
            H.264 spec, and thus some hardware decoders require these to
            be zero. The result of zeroing this is still a valid
            bitstream.

            ``crop_left``
            ``crop_right``
            ``crop_top``
            ``crop_bottom``
            Set the frame cropping offsets in the SPS. These values will
            replace the current ones if the stream is already cropped.

            These fields are set in pixels. Note that some sizes may not
            be representable if the chroma is subsampled or the stream
            is interlaced (see H.264 section 7.4.2.1.1).

            ``sei_user_data``
            Insert a string as SEI unregistered user data. The argument
            must be of the form *UUID+string*, where the UUID is as hex
            digits possibly separated by hyphens, and the string can be
            anything.

            For example,
            ‘\ ``086f3693-b7b3-4f2c-9653-21492feee5b8+hello``\ ’ will
            insert the string “hello” associated with the given UUID.

            ``delete_filler``
            Deletes both filler NAL units and filler SEI messages.

            ``display_orientation``
            Insert, extract or remove Display orientation SEI messages.
            See H.264 section D.1.27 and D.2.27 for syntax and
            semantics.

            ‘\ ``pass``\ ’
            ‘\ ``insert``\ ’
            ‘\ ``remove``\ ’
            ‘\ ``extract``\ ’
            Default is pass.

            Insert mode works in conjunction with ``rotate`` and
            ``flip`` options. Any pre-existing Display orientation
            messages will be removed in insert or remove mode. Extract
            mode attaches the display matrix to the packet as side data.

            ``rotate``
            Set rotation in display orientation SEI (anticlockwise angle
            in degrees). Range is -360 to +360. Default is NaN.

            ``flip``
            Set flip in display orientation SEI.

            ‘\ ``horizontal``\ ’
            ‘\ ``vertical``\ ’
            Default is unset.

            ``level``
            Set the level in the SPS. Refer to H.264 section A.3 and
            tables A-1 to A-5.

            The argument must be the name of a level (for example,
            ‘\ ``4.2``\ ’), a level_idc value (for example,
            ‘\ ``42``\ ’), or the special name ‘\ ``auto``\ ’ indicating
            that the filter should attempt to guess the level from the
            input stream properties.

            ``tick_rate``
            Set the tick rate in the VPS and VUI parameters (time_scale
            / num_units_in_tick). Combined with
            ``num_ticks_poc_diff_one``, this can set a constant
            framerate in the stream. Note that it is likely to be
            overridden by container parameters when the stream is in a
            container.

            ``num_ticks_poc_diff_one``
            Set poc_proportional_to_timing_flag in VPS and VUI and use
            this value to set num_ticks_poc_diff_one_minus1 (see H.265
            sections 7.4.3.1 and E.3.1). Ignored if ``tick_rate`` is not
            also set.

            ``crop_right``
            ``crop_top``
            ``crop_bottom``

            These values will replace the current ones if the stream is
            already cropped.

            These fields are set in pixels. Note that some sizes may not

            Convert MJPEG/AVI1 packets to full JPEG/JFIF packets.

            MJPEG is a video codec wherein each video frame is
            essentially a JPEG image. The individual frames can be
            extracted without loss, e.g. by

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -i ../some_mjpeg.avi -c:v copy frames_%d.jpg

            Unfortunately, these chunks are incomplete JPEG images,
            because they lack the DHT segment required for decoding.
            Quoting from
            http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000063.shtml:

            Avery Lee, writing in the rec.video.desktop newsgroup in
            2001, commented that "MJPEG, or at least the MJPEG in AVIs
            having the MJPG fourcc, is restricted JPEG with a fixed –
            and \*omitted\* – Huffman table. The JPEG must be YCbCr
            colorspace, it must be 4:2:2, and it must use basic Huffman
            encoding, not arithmetic or progressive. . . . You can
            indeed extract the MJPEG frames and decode them with a
            regular JPEG decoder, but you have to prepend the DHT
            segment to them, or else the decoder won’t have any idea how
            to decompress the data. The exact table necessary is given
            in the OpenDML spec."

            This bitstream filter patches the header of frames extracted
            from an MJPEG stream (carrying the AVI1 header ID and
            lacking a DHT segment) to produce fully qualified JPEG
            images.

            The following fixed values are supported:

            ``4/3``
            ``16/9``

            divisor - if the supplied value is not exactly
            representable, the nearest representable value will be used
            instead (see H.262 section 6.3.3 and table 6-4).

            ``video_format``
            Set the video format in the stream (see H.262 section 6.3.6

            ``colour_primaries``
            ``transfer_characteristics``

            Unpack DivX-style packed B-frames.

            DivX-style packed B-frames are not valid MPEG-4 and were
            only a workaround for the broken Video for Windows
            subsystem. They use more space, can cause minor AV sync
            issues, require more CPU power to decode (unless the player
            has some decoded picture queue to compensate the 2,0,2,0
            frame per packet style) and cause trouble if copied into a
            standard container like mp4 or mpeg-ps/ts, because MPEG-4
            decoders may not be able to decode them, since they are not
            valid MPEG-4.

            For example to fix an AVI file containing an MPEG-4 stream
            with DivX-style packed B-frames using ``ffmpeg``, you can
            use the command:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

            Damages the contents of packets or simply drops them without
            damaging the container. Can be used for fuzzing or testing
            error resilience/concealment.

            Parameters:

            ``amount``
               Accepts an expression whose evaluation per-packet
               determines how often bytes in that packet will be
               modified. A value below 0 will result in a variable
               frequency. Default is 0 which results in no modification.
               However, if neither amount nor drop is specified, amount
               will be set to ``-1``. See below for accepted variables.

            ``drop``
               Accepts an expression evaluated per-packet whose value
               determines whether that packet is dropped. Evaluation to
               a positive value results in the packet being dropped.
               Evaluation to a negative value results in a variable
               chance of it being dropped, roughly inverse in proportion
               to the magnitude of the value. Default is 0 which results
               in no drops. See below for accepted variables.

            ``dropamount``
               Accepts a non-negative integer, which assigns a variable
               chance of it being dropped, roughly inverse in proportion
               to the value. Default is 0 which results in no drops.
               This option is kept for backwards compatibility and is
               equivalent to setting drop to a negative value with the
               same magnitude i.e. ``dropamount=4`` is the same as
               ``drop=-4``. Ignored if drop is also specified.

            Both ``amount`` and ``drop`` accept expressions containing
            the following variables:

            ‘\ ``n``\ ’
               The index of the packet, starting from zero.

            ‘\ ``tb``\ ’
               The timebase for packet timestamps.

            ‘\ ``pts``\ ’
               Packet presentation timestamp.

            ‘\ ``dts``\ ’
               Packet decoding timestamp.

            ‘\ ``nopts``\ ’
               Constant representing AV_NOPTS_VALUE.

            ‘\ ``startpts``\ ’
               First non-AV_NOPTS_VALUE PTS seen in the stream.

            ‘\ ``startdts``\ ’
               First non-AV_NOPTS_VALUE DTS seen in the stream.

            ‘\ ``duration``\ ’
            ‘\ ``d``\ ’
               Packet duration, in timebase units.

            ‘\ ``pos``\ ’
               Packet position in input; may be -1 when unknown or not
               set.

            ‘\ ``size``\ ’
               Packet size, in bytes.

            ‘\ ``key``\ ’
               Whether packet is marked as a keyframe.

            ‘\ ``state``\ ’
               A pseudo random integer, primarily derived from the
               content of packet payload.

            Repacketize PCM audio to a fixed number of samples per
            packet or a fixed packet rate per second. This is similar to
            the `(ffmpeg-filters)asetnsamples audio
            filter <ffmpeg-filters.html#asetnsamples>`__ but works on
            audio packets instead of audio frames.

            ``nb_out_samples, n``
               Set the number of samples per each output audio packet.
               The number is intended as the number of samples *per each
               channel*. Default value is 1024.

            ``pad, p``
               If set to 1, the filter will pad the last audio packet
               with silence, so that it will contain the same number of
               samples (or roughly the same number of samples, see
               ``frame_rate``) as the previous ones. Default value is 1.

            ``frame_rate, r``
               This option makes the filter output a fixed number of
               packets per second instead of a fixed number of samples
               per packet. If the audio sample rate is not divisible by
               the frame rate then the number of samples will not be
               constant but will vary slightly so that each packet will
               start as close to the frame boundary as possible. Using
               this option has precedence over ``nb_out_samples``.

            You can generate the well known 1602-1601-1602-1601-1602
            pattern of 48kHz audio for NTSC frame rate using the
            ``frame_rate`` option.

         The libavformat library provides some generic global options,
         which can be set on all the muxers and demuxers. In addition
         each muxer or demuxer may support so-called private options,
         which are specific for that component.

         Options may be set by specifying -``option`` ``value`` in the
         FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
         ``AVFormatContext`` options or using the ``libavutil/opt.h``
         API for programmatic use.

         The list of supported options follows:

         ``avioflags``\ ``flags``\ ``(``\ *``input/output``*\ ``)``
         Possible values:

         ‘\ ``direct``\ ’
            Reduce buffering.

         ``probesize``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Set probing size in bytes, i.e. the size of the data to analyze
         to get stream information. A higher value will enable detecting
         more information in case it is dispersed into the stream, but
         will increase latency. Must be an integer not lesser than 32.
         It is 5000000 by default.

         ``max_probe_packets``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Set the maximum number of buffered packets when probing a
         codec. Default is 2500 packets.

         ``packetsize``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``output``*\ ``)``
         Set packet size.

         ``fflags``\ ``flags``
         Set format flags. Some are implemented for a limited number of
         formats.

         Possible values for input files:

         ‘\ ``discardcorrupt``\ ’
            Discard corrupted packets.

         ‘\ ``fastseek``\ ’
            Enable fast, but inaccurate seeks for some formats.

         ‘\ ``genpts``\ ’
            Generate missing PTS if DTS is present.

         ‘\ ``igndts``\ ’
            Ignore DTS if PTS is set. Inert when nofillin is set.

         ‘\ ``ignidx``\ ’
            Ignore index.

         ‘\ ``nobuffer``\ ’
            Reduce the latency introduced by buffering during initial
            input streams analysis.

         ‘\ ``nofillin``\ ’
            Do not fill in missing values in packet fields that can be
            exactly calculated.

         ‘\ ``noparse``\ ’
            Disable AVParsers, this needs ``+nofillin`` too.

         ‘\ ``sortdts``\ ’
            Try to interleave output packets by DTS. At present,
            available only for AVIs with an index.

         Possible values for output files:

         ‘\ ``autobsf``\ ’
            Automatically apply bitstream filters as required by the
            output format. Enabled by default.

         ‘\ ``bitexact``\ ’
            Only write platform-, build- and time-independent data. This
            ensures that file and data checksums are reproducible and
            match between platforms. Its primary use is for regression
            testing.

         ‘\ ``flush_packets``\ ’
            Write out packets immediately.

         ‘\ ``shortest``\ ’
            Stop muxing at the end of the shortest stream. It may be
            needed to increase max_interleave_delta to avoid flushing
            the longer streams before EOF.

         ``seek2any``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Allow seeking to non-keyframes on demuxer level when supported
         if set to 1. Default is 0.

         ``analyzeduration``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Specify how many microseconds are analyzed to probe the input.
         A higher value will enable detecting more accurate information,
         but will increase latency. It defaults to 5,000,000
         microseconds = 5 seconds.

         ``cryptokey``\ ``hexadecimal string``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Set decryption key.

         ``indexmem``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Set max memory used for timestamp index (per stream).

         ``rtbufsize``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Set max memory used for buffering real-time frames.

         ``fdebug``\ ``flags``\ ``(``\ *``input/output``*\ ``)``
         Print specific debug info.

         Possible values:

         ‘\ ``ts``\ ’
         ``max_delay``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input/output``*\ ``)``
         Set maximum muxing or demuxing delay in microseconds.

         ``fpsprobesize``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Set number of frames used to probe fps.

         ``audio_preload``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``output``*\ ``)``
         Set microseconds by which audio packets should be interleaved
         earlier.

         ``chunk_duration``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``output``*\ ``)``
         Set microseconds for each chunk.

         ``chunk_size``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``output``*\ ``)``
         Set size in bytes for each chunk.

         ``err_detect, f_err_detect``\ ``flags``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Set error detection flags. ``f_err_detect`` is deprecated and
         should be used only via the ``ffmpeg`` tool.

         Possible values:

         ‘\ ``crccheck``\ ’
            Verify embedded CRCs.

         ‘\ ``bitstream``\ ’
            Detect bitstream specification deviations.

         ‘\ ``buffer``\ ’
            Detect improper bitstream length.

         ‘\ ``explode``\ ’
            Abort decoding on minor error detection.

         ‘\ ``careful``\ ’
            Consider things that violate the spec and have not been seen
            in the wild as errors.

         ‘\ ``compliant``\ ’
            Consider all spec non compliancies as errors.

         ‘\ ``aggressive``\ ’
            Consider things that a sane encoder should not do as an
            error.

         ``max_interleave_delta``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``output``*\ ``)``
         Set maximum buffering duration for interleaving. The duration
         is expressed in microseconds, and defaults to 10000000 (10
         seconds).

         To ensure all the streams are interleaved correctly,
         libavformat will wait until it has at least one packet for each
         stream before actually writing any packets to the output file.
         When some streams are "sparse" (i.e. there are large gaps
         between successive packets), this can result in excessive
         buffering.

         This field specifies the maximum difference between the
         timestamps of the first and the last packet in the muxing
         queue, above which libavformat will output a packet regardless
         of whether it has queued a packet for all the streams.

         If set to 0, libavformat will continue buffering packets until
         it has a packet for each stream, regardless of the maximum
         timestamp difference between the buffered packets.

         ``use_wallclock_as_timestamps``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Use wallclock as timestamps if set to 1. Default is 0.

         ``avoid_negative_ts``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``output``*\ ``)``
         Possible values:

         ‘\ ``make_non_negative``\ ’
            Shift timestamps to make them non-negative. Also note that
            this affects only leading negative timestamps, and not
            non-monotonic negative timestamps.

         ‘\ ``make_zero``\ ’
            Shift timestamps so that the first timestamp is 0.

         ‘\ ``auto (default)``\ ’
            Enables shifting when required by the target format.

         ‘\ ``disabled``\ ’
            Disables shifting of timestamp.

         When shifting is enabled, all output timestamps are shifted by
         the same amount. Audio, video, and subtitles desynching and
         relative timestamp differences are preserved compared to how
         they would have been without shifting.

         ``skip_initial_bytes``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Set number of bytes to skip before reading header and frames if
         set to 1. Default is 0.

         ``correct_ts_overflow``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Correct single timestamp overflows if set to 1. Default is 1.

         ``flush_packets``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``output``*\ ``)``
         Flush the underlying I/O stream after each packet. Default is
         -1 (auto), which means that the underlying protocol will
         decide, 1 enables it, and has the effect of reducing the
         latency, 0 disables it and may increase IO throughput in some
         cases.

         ``output_ts_offset``\ ``offset``\ ``(``\ *``output``*\ ``)``
         Set the output time offset.

         ``offset`` must be a time duration specification, see
         `(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1)
         manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax>`__.

         The offset is added by the muxer to the output timestamps.

         Specifying a positive offset means that the corresponding
         streams are delayed bt the time duration specified in
         ``offset``. Default value is ``0`` (meaning that no offset is
         applied).

         ``format_whitelist``\ ``list``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         "," separated list of allowed demuxers. By default all are
         allowed.

         ``dump_separator``\ ``string``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Separator used to separate the fields printed on the command
         line about the Stream parameters. For example, to separate the
         fields with newlines and indentation:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               ffprobe -dump_separator "
                                         "  -i ~/videos/matrixbench_mpeg2.mpg

         ``max_streams``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Specifies the maximum number of streams. This can be used to
         reject files that would require too many resources due to a
         large number of streams.

         ``skip_estimate_duration_from_pts``\ ``bool``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
         Skip estimation of input duration when calculated using PTS. At
         present, applicable for MPEG-PS and MPEG-TS.

         ``strict, f_strict``\ ``integer``\ ``(``\ *``input/output``*\ ``)``
         Specify how strictly to follow the standards. ``f_strict`` is
         deprecated and should be used only via the ``ffmpeg`` tool.

         Possible values:

         ‘\ ``very``\ ’
            strictly conform to an older more strict version of the spec
            or reference software

         ‘\ ``strict``\ ’
            strictly conform to all the things in the spec no matter
            what consequences

         ‘\ ``normal``\ ’
         ‘\ ``unofficial``\ ’
            allow unofficial extensions

         ‘\ ``experimental``\ ’
            allow non standardized experimental things, experimental
            (unfinished/work in progress/not well tested) decoders and
            encoders. Note: experimental decoders can pose a security
            risk, do not use this for decoding untrusted input.

         Demuxers are configured elements in FFmpeg that can read the
         multimedia streams from a particular type of file.

         When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported
         demuxers are enabled by default. You can list all available
         ones using the configure option ``--list-demuxers``.

         You can disable all the demuxers using the configure option
         ``--disable-demuxers``, and selectively enable a single demuxer
         with the option ``--enable-demuxer=``\ ``DEMUXER``, or disable
         it with the option ``--disable-demuxer=``\ ``DEMUXER``.

         The option ``-demuxers`` of the ff\* tools will display the
         list of enabled demuxers. Use ``-formats`` to view a combined
         list of enabled demuxers and muxers.

            This demuxer is used to demux APNG files. All headers, but
            the PNG signature, up to (but not including) the first fcTL
            chunk are transmitted as extradata. Frames are then split as

            Virtual concatenation script demuxer.

            This demuxer reads a list of files and other directives from
            a text file and demuxes them one after the other, as if all
            their packets had been muxed together.

            The timestamps in the files are adjusted so that the first
            file starts at 0 and each next file starts where the
            previous one finishes. Note that it is done globally and may
            cause gaps if all streams do not have exactly the same
            length.

            All files must have the same streams (same codecs, same time
            base, etc.).

            The duration of each file is used to adjust the timestamps
            of the next file: if the duration is incorrect (because it
            was computed using the bit-rate or because the file is
            truncated, for example), it can cause artifacts. The
            ``duration`` directive can be used to override the duration
            stored in each file.

               The script is a text file in extended-ASCII, with one
               directive per line. Empty lines, leading spaces and lines
               starting with ’#’ are ignored. The following directive is
               recognized:

               ``file``\ ``path``
                  Path to a file to read; special characters and spaces
                  must be escaped with backslash or single quotes.

                  All subsequent file-related directives apply to that
                  file.

               ``ffconcat version 1.0``
                  Identify the script type and version.

                  To make FFmpeg recognize the format automatically,
                  this directive must appear exactly as is (no extra
                  space or byte-order-mark) on the very first line of
                  the script.

               ``duration``\ ``dur``
                  Duration of the file. This information can be
                  specified from the file; specifying it here may be
                  more efficient or help if the information from the
                  file is not available or accurate.

                  If the duration is set for all files, then it is
                  possible to seek in the whole concatenated video.

                  In point of the file. When the demuxer opens the file
                  it instantly seeks to the specified timestamp. Seeking
                  is done so that all streams can be presented
                  successfully at In point.

                  This directive works best with intra frame codecs,
                  because for non-intra frame ones you will usually get
                  extra packets before the actual In point and the
                  decoded content will most likely contain frames before
                  In point too.

                  For each file, packets before the file In point will
                  have timestamps less than the calculated start
                  timestamp of the file (negative in case of the first
                  file), and the duration of the files (if not specified
                  by the ``duration`` directive) will be reduced based
                  on their specified In point.

                  Because of potential packets before the specified In
                  point, packet timestamps may overlap between two
                  concatenated files.

               ``outpoint``\ ``timestamp``
                  Out point of the file. When the demuxer reaches the
                  specified decoding timestamp in any of the streams, it
                  handles it as an end of file condition and skips the
                  current and all the remaining packets from all
                  streams.

                  Out point is exclusive, which means that the demuxer
                  will not output packets with a decoding timestamp
                  greater or equal to Out point.

                  This directive works best with intra frame codecs and
                  formats where all streams are tightly interleaved. For
                  non-intra frame codecs you will usually get additional
                  packets with presentation timestamp after Out point
                  therefore the decoded content will most likely contain
                  frames after Out point too. If your streams are not
                  tightly interleaved you may not get all the packets
                  from all streams before Out point and you may only
                  will be able to decode the earliest stream until Out
                  point.

                  The duration of the files (if not specified by the
                  ``duration`` directive) will be reduced based on their
                  specified Out point.

               ``file_packet_metadata``\ ``key=value``
                  Metadata of the packets of the file. The specified
                  metadata will be set for each file packet. You can
                  specify this directive multiple times to add multiple
                  metadata entries. This directive is deprecated, use
                  ``file_packet_meta`` instead.

               ``file_packet_meta``\ ``key``\ ````\ ``value``
                  Metadata of the packets of the file. The specified
                  metadata will be set for each file packet. You can
                  specify this directive multiple times to add multiple
                  metadata entries.

               ``option``\ ``key``\ ````\ ``value``
                  Option to access, open and probe the file. Can be
                  present multiple times.

               ``stream``
                  Introduce a stream in the virtual file. All subsequent
                  stream-related directives apply to the last introduced
                  stream. Some streams properties must be set in order
                  to allow identifying the matching streams in the
                  subfiles. If no streams are defined in the script, the
                  streams from the first file are copied.

               ``exact_stream_id``\ ``id``
                  Set the id of the stream. If this directive is given,
                  the string with the corresponding id in the subfiles
                  will be used. This is especially useful for MPEG-PS
                  (VOB) files, where the order of the streams is not
                  reliable.

               ``stream_meta``\ ``key``\ ````\ ``value``
                  Metadata for the stream. Can be present multiple
                  times.

               ``stream_codec``\ ``value``
                  Codec for the stream.

               ``stream_extradata``\ ``hex_string``
                  Extradata for the string, encoded in hexadecimal.

               ``chapter``\ ``id``\ ````\ ``start``\ ````\ ``end``
                  Add a chapter. ``id`` is an unique identifier,
                  possibly small and consecutive.

                  If set to 1, reject unsafe file paths and directives.
                  A file path is considered safe if it does not contain
                  a protocol specification and is relative and all
                  components only contain characters from the portable
                  character set (letters, digits, period, underscore and
                  hyphen) and have no period at the beginning of a
                  component.

                  If set to 0, any file name is accepted.

                  The default is 1.

               ``auto_convert``
                  If set to 1, try to perform automatic conversions on
                  packet data to make the streams concatenable. The
                  default is 1.

                  Currently, the only conversion is adding the
                  h264_mp4toannexb bitstream filter to H.264 streams in
                  MP4 format. This is necessary in particular if there
                  are resolution changes.

               ``segment_time_metadata``
                  If set to 1, every packet will contain the
                  ``lavf.concat.start_time`` and the
                  ``lavf.concat.duration`` packet metadata values which
                  are the start_time and the duration of the respective
                  file segments in the concatenated output expressed in
                  microseconds. The duration metadata is only set if it
                  is known based on the concat file. The default is 0.

            Animated GIF demuxer.

            It accepts the following options:

            ``min_delay``
               Set the minimum valid delay between frames in hundredths
               of seconds. Range is 0 to 6000. Default value is 2.

            ``max_gif_delay``
               Set the maximum valid delay between frames in hundredth
               of seconds. Range is 0 to 65535. Default value is 65535
               (nearly eleven minutes), the maximum value allowed by the
               specification.

            ``default_delay``
               Set the default delay between frames in hundredths of
               seconds. Range is 0 to 6000. Default value is 10.

            ``ignore_loop``
               GIF files can contain information to loop a certain
               number of times (or infinitely). If ``ignore_loop`` is
               set to 1, then the loop setting from the input will be
               ignored and looping will not occur. If set to 0, then
               looping will occur and will cycle the number of times
               according to the GIF. Default value is 1.

            For example, with the overlay filter, place an infinitely
            looping GIF over another video:

            .. container:: example

                  ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ignore_loop 0 -i input.gif -filter_complex overlay=shortest=1 out.mkv

            Note that in the above example the shortest option for
            overlay filter is used to end the output video at the length
            of the shortest input file, which in this case is
            ``input.mp4`` as the GIF in this example loops infinitely.

            streams. The id field is set to the bitrate variant index
            number. By setting the discard flags on AVStreams (by
            pressing ’a’ or ’v’ in ffplay), the caller can decide which
            variant streams to actually receive. The total bitrate of
            the variant that the stream belongs to is available in a
            metadata key named "variant_bitrate".

            It accepts the following options:

            ``live_start_index``
               segment index to start live streams at (negative values
               are from the end).

            ``prefer_x_start``
               prefer to use #EXT-X-START if it’s in playlist instead of
               live_start_index.

            ``allowed_extensions``
               ’,’ separated list of file extensions that hls is allowed
               to access.

            ``max_reload``
               Maximum number of times a insufficient list is attempted
               to be reloaded. Default value is 1000.

            ``m3u8_hold_counters``
               The maximum number of times to load m3u8 when it
               refreshes without new segments. Default value is 1000.

            ``http_persistent``
               Use persistent HTTP connections. Applicable only for HTTP
               streams. Enabled by default.

            ``http_multiple``
               Use multiple HTTP connections for downloading HTTP
               segments. Enabled by default for HTTP/1.1 servers.

            ``http_seekable``
               Use HTTP partial requests for downloading HTTP segments.
               0 = disable, 1 = enable, -1 = auto, Default is auto.

            ``seg_format_options``
               Set options for the demuxer of media segments using a
               list of key=value pairs separated by ``:``.

            ``seg_max_retry``
               Maximum number of times to reload a segment on error,
               useful when segment skip on network error is not desired.
               Default value is 0.

            The size, the pixel format, and the format of each image
            must be the same for all the files in the sequence.

            This demuxer accepts the following options:

            ``framerate``
               Set the frame rate for the video stream. It defaults to
               25.

            ``loop``
               If set to 1, loop over the input. Default value is 0.

            ``pattern_type``
               Select the pattern type used to interpret the provided
               filename.

               ``pattern_type`` accepts one of the following values.

               ``none``
                  Disable pattern matching, therefore the video will
                  only contain the specified image. You should use this
                  option if you do not want to create sequences from
                  multiple images and your filenames may contain special
                  pattern characters.

               ``sequence``
                  Select a sequence pattern type, used to specify a
                  sequence of files indexed by sequential numbers.

                  A sequence pattern may contain the string "%d" or
                  "%0\ ``N``\ d", which specifies the position of the
                  characters representing a sequential number in each
                  filename matched by the pattern. If the form
                  "%d0\ ``N``\ d" is used, the string representing the
                  number in each filename is 0-padded and ``N`` is the
                  total number of 0-padded digits representing the
                  number. The literal character ’%’ can be specified in
                  the pattern with the string "%%".

                  If the sequence pattern contains "%d" or
                  "%0\ ``N``\ d", the first filename of the file list
                  specified by the pattern must contain a number
                  inclusively contained between ``start_number`` and
                  ``start_number``\ +\ ``start_number_range``-1, and all
                  the following numbers must be sequential.

                  For example the pattern "img-%03d.bmp" will match a
                  sequence of filenames of the form ``img-001.bmp``,
                  ``img-002.bmp``, ..., ``img-010.bmp``, etc.; the
                  pattern "i%%m%%g-%d.jpg" will match a sequence of
                  filenames of the form ``i%m%g-1.jpg``,
                  ``i%m%g-2.jpg``, ..., ``i%m%g-10.jpg``, etc.

                  Note that the pattern must not necessarily contain
                  "%d" or "%0\ ``N``\ d", for example to convert a
                  single image file ``img.jpeg`` you can employ the
                  command:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        ffmpeg -i img.jpeg img.png

               ``glob``
                  Select a glob wildcard pattern type.

                  The pattern is interpreted like a ``glob()`` pattern.
                  This is only selectable if libavformat was compiled
                  with globbing support.

               ``glob_sequence``\ *``(deprecated, will be removed)``*
                  Select a mixed glob wildcard/sequence pattern.

                  If your version of libavformat was compiled with
                  globbing support, and the provided pattern contains at
                  least one glob meta character among ``%*?[]{}`` that
                  is preceded by an unescaped "%", the pattern is
                  interpreted like a ``glob()`` pattern, otherwise it is
                  interpreted like a sequence pattern.

                  All glob special characters ``%*?[]{}`` must be
                  prefixed with "%". To escape a literal "%" you shall
                  use "%%".

                  For example the pattern ``foo-%*.jpeg`` will match all
                  the filenames prefixed by "foo-" and terminating with
                  ".jpeg", and ``foo-%?%?%?.jpeg`` will match all the
                  filenames prefixed with "foo-", followed by a sequence
                  of three characters, and terminating with ".jpeg".

                  This pattern type is deprecated in favor of ``glob``
                  and ``sequence``.

               Default value is ``glob_sequence``.

            ``pixel_format``
               Set the pixel format of the images to read. If not
               specified the pixel format is guessed from the first
               image file in the sequence.

            ``start_number``
               Set the index of the file matched by the image file
               pattern to start to read from. Default value is 0.

            ``start_number_range``
               Set the index interval range to check when looking for
               the first image file in the sequence, starting from
               ``start_number``. Default value is 5.

            ``ts_from_file``
               If set to 1, will set frame timestamp to modification
               time of image file. Note that monotonity of timestamps is
               not provided: images go in the same order as without this
               option. Default value is 0. If set to 2, will set frame
               timestamp to the modification time of the image file in
               nanosecond precision.

            ``video_size``
               Set the video size of the images to read. If not
               specified the video size is guessed from the first image
               file in the sequence.

            ``export_path_metadata``
               If set to 1, will add two extra fields to the metadata
               found in input, making them also available for other
               filters (see ``drawtext`` filter for examples). Default
               value is 0. The extra fields are described below:

               ``lavf.image2dec.source_path``
                  Corresponds to the full path to the input file being
                  read.

               ``lavf.image2dec.source_basename``
                  Corresponds to the name of the file being read.

               This demuxer accepts the following options:

               ``enable_drefs``
                  Enable loading of external tracks, disabled by
                  default. Enabling this can theoretically leak
                  information in some use cases.

               ``use_absolute_path``
                  Allows loading of external tracks via absolute paths,
                  disabled by default. Enabling this poses a security
                  risk. It should only be enabled if the source is known
                  to be non-malicious.

               ``seek_streams_individually``
                  When seeking, identify the closest point in each
                  stream individually and demux packets in that stream
                  from identified point. This can lead to a different
                  sequence of packets compared to demuxing linearly from
                  the beginning. Default is true.

               ``ignore_editlist``
                  Ignore any edit list atoms. The demuxer, by default,
                  modifies the stream index to reflect the timeline
                  described by the edit list. Default is false.

               ``advanced_editlist``
                  Modify the stream index to reflect the timeline
                  described by the edit list. ``ignore_editlist`` must
                  be set to false for this option to be effective. If
                  both ``ignore_editlist`` and this option are set to
                  false, then only the start of the stream index is
                  modified to reflect initial dwell time or starting
                  timestamp described by the edit list. Default is true.

               ``ignore_chapters``
                  Don’t parse chapters. This includes GoPro ’HiLight’
                  tags/moments. Note that chapters are only parsed when
                  input is seekable. Default is false.

               ``use_mfra_for``
                  For seekable fragmented input, set fragment’s starting
                  timestamp from media fragment random access box, if
                  present.

                     Don’t use mfra box to set timestamps

               ``use_tfdt``
                  For fragmented input, set fragment’s starting
                  timestamp to ``baseMediaDecodeTime`` from the ``tfdt``
                  box. Default is enabled, which will prefer to use the
                  ``tfdt`` box to set DTS. Disable to use the
                  ``earliest_presentation_time`` from the ``sidx`` box.
                  In either case, the timestamp from the ``mfra`` box
                  will be used if it’s available and ``use_mfra_for`` is
                  set to pts or dts.

               ``export_all``
                  Export unrecognized boxes within the ``udta`` box as
                  metadata entries. The first four characters of the box
                  type are set as the key. Default is false.

               ``export_xmp``
                  Export entire contents of ``XMP_`` box and ``uuid``
                  box as a string with key ``xmp``. Note that if
                  ``export_all`` is set and this option isn’t, the
                  contents of ``XMP_`` box are still exported but with
                  key ``XMP_``. Default is false.

               ``activation_bytes``
                  4-byte key required to decrypt Audible AAX and AAX+
                  files. See Audible AAX subsection below.

               ``audible_fixed_key``
                  Fixed key used for handling Audible AAX/AAX+ files. It
                  has been pre-set so should not be necessary to
                  specify.

               ``decryption_key``
                  16-byte key, in hex, to decrypt files encrypted using
                  ISO Common Encryption (CENC/AES-128 CTR; ISO/IEC
                  23001-7).

               ``max_stts_delta``
                  Very high sample deltas written in a trak’s stts box
                  may occasionally be intended but usually they are
                  written in error or used to store a negative value for
                  dts correction when treated as signed 32-bit integers.
                  This option lets the user set an upper limit, beyond
                  which the delta is clamped to 1. Values greater than
                  the limit if negative when cast to int32 are used to
                  adjust onward dts.

                  Unit is the track time scale. Range is 0 to UINT_MAX.
                  Default is ``UINT_MAX - 48000*10`` which allows upto a
                  10 second dts correction for 48 kHz audio streams
                  while accommodating 99.9% of ``uint32`` range.

               ``interleaved_read``
                  Interleave packets from multiple tracks at demuxer
                  level. For badly interleaved files, this prevents
                  playback issues caused by large gaps between packets
                  in different tracks, as MOV/MP4 do not have packet
                  placement requirements. However, this can cause
                  excessive seeking on very badly interleaved files, due
                  to seeking between tracks, so disabling it may prevent
                  I/O issues, at the expense of playback.

            MPEG-2 transport stream demuxer.

            This demuxer accepts the following options:

            ``resync_size``
               Set size limit for looking up a new synchronization.
               Default value is 65536.

            ``skip_unknown_pmt``
               Skip PMTs for programs not defined in the PAT. Default
               value is 0.

            ``fix_teletext_pts``
               Override teletext packet PTS and DTS values with the
               timestamps calculated from the PCR of the first program
               which the teletext stream is part of and is not
               discarded. Default value is 1, set this option to 0 if
               you want your teletext packet PTS and DTS values
               untouched.

            ``ts_packetsize``
               Output option carrying the raw packet size in bytes. Show
               the detected raw packet size, cannot be set by the user.

            ``scan_all_pmts``
               Scan and combine all PMTs. The value is an integer with
               value from -1 to 1 (-1 means automatic setting, 1 means
               enabled, 0 means disabled). Default value is -1.

            ``merge_pmt_versions``
               Re-use existing streams when a PMT’s version is updated
               and elementary streams move to different PIDs. Default
               value is 0.

            ``max_packet_size``
               Set maximum size, in bytes, of packet emitted by the
               demuxer. Payloads above this size are split across
               multiple packets. Range is 1 to INT_MAX/2. Default is
               204800 bytes.

            MJPEG encapsulated in multi-part MIME demuxer.

            This demuxer allows reading of MJPEG, where each frame is
            represented as a part of multipart/x-mixed-replace stream.

            ``strict_mime_boundary``
               Default implementation applies a relaxed standard to
               multi-part MIME boundary detection, to prevent regression
               with numerous existing endpoints not generating a proper
               MIME MJPEG stream. Turning this option on by setting it
               to 1 will result in a stricter check of the boundary
               value.

            Raw video demuxer.

            This demuxer allows one to read raw video data. Since there
            is no header specifying the assumed video parameters, the
            user must specify them in order to be able to decode the
            data correctly.

            This demuxer accepts the following options:

            ``framerate``
               Set input video frame rate. Default value is 25.

            ``pixel_format``
               Set the input video pixel format. Default value is
               ``yuv420p``.

            ``video_size``
               Set the input video size. This value must be specified
               explicitly.

            For example to read a rawvideo file ``input.raw`` with
            ``ffplay``, assuming a pixel format of ``rgb24``, a video
            size of ``320x240``, and a frame rate of 10 images per
            second, use the command:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffplay -f rawvideo -pixel_format rgb24 -video_size 320x240 -framerate 10 input.raw

            SBaGen script demuxer.

            This demuxer reads the script language used by SBaGen
            http://uazu.net/sbagen/ to generate binaural beats sessions.
            A SBG script looks like that:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  -SE
                  a: 300-2.5/3 440+4.5/0
                  b: 300-2.5/0 440+4.5/3
                  off: -
                  NOW      == a
                  +0:07:00 == b
                  +0:14:00 == a
                  +0:21:00 == b
                  +0:30:00    off

            A SBG script can mix absolute and relative timestamps. If
            the script uses either only absolute timestamps (including
            the script start time) or only relative ones, then its
            layout is fixed, and the conversion is straightforward. On
            the other hand, if the script mixes both kind of timestamps,
            then the ``NOW`` reference for relative timestamps will be
            taken from the current time of day at the time the script is
            read, and the script layout will be frozen according to that
            reference. That means that if the script is directly played,
            the actual times will match the absolute timestamps up to
            the sound controller’s clock accuracy, but if the user
            somehow pauses the playback or seeks, all times will be
            shifted accordingly.

            JSON captions used for `TED Talks <http://www.ted.com/>`__.

            TED does not provide links to the captions, but they can be
            guessed from the page. The file ``tools/bookmarklets.html``
            from the FFmpeg source tree contains a bookmarklet to expose
            them.

            This demuxer accepts the following option:

            ``start_time``
               Set the start time of the TED talk, in milliseconds. The
               default is 15000 (15s). It is used to sync the captions
               with the downloadable videos, because they include a 15s
               intro.

            Example: convert the captions to a format most players

            ``-i yourscript.vpy``.

            This demuxer accepts the following option:

            ``max_script_size``
               The demuxer buffers the entire script into memory. Adjust
               this value to set the maximum buffer size, which in turn,
               acts as a ceiling for the size of scripts that can be
               read. Default is 1 MiB.

            :name: metadata
            :class: chapter

         FFmpeg is able to dump metadata from media files into a simple
         UTF-8-encoded INI-like text file and then load it back using
         the metadata muxer/demuxer.

         The file format is as follows:

         #. A file consists of a header and a number of metadata tags
            divided into sections, each on its own line.

         #. The header is a ‘\ ``;FFMETADATA``\ ’ string, followed by a
            version number (now 1).

         #. Metadata tags are of the form ‘\ ``key=value``\ ’

         #. Immediately after header follows global metadata

         #. After global metadata there may be sections with
            per-stream/per-chapter metadata.

         #. A section starts with the section name in uppercase (i.e.
            STREAM or CHAPTER) in brackets (‘\ ``[``\ ’, ‘\ ``]``\ ’)
            and ends with next section or end of file.

         #. At the beginning of a chapter section there may be an
            optional timebase to be used for start/end values. It must
            be in form ‘\ ``TIMEBASE=``\ ``num``\ ``/``\ ``den``\ ’,
            where ``num`` and ``den`` are integers. If the timebase is
            missing then start/end times are assumed to be in
            nanoseconds.

            Next a chapter section must contain chapter start and end
            times in form ‘\ ``START=``\ ``num``\ ’,
            ‘\ ``END=``\ ``num``\ ’, where ``num`` is a positive
            integer.

         #. Empty lines and lines starting with ‘\ ``;``\ ’ or
            ‘\ ``#``\ ’ are ignored.

         #. Metadata keys or values containing special characters
            (‘\ ``=``\ ’, ‘\ ``;``\ ’, ‘\ ``#``\ ’, ‘\ ``\``\ ’ and a
            newline) must be escaped with a backslash ‘\ ``\``\ ’.

         #. Note that whitespace in metadata (e.g. ‘\ ``foo = bar``\ ’)
            is considered to be a part of the tag (in the example above
            key is ‘\ ``foo``\ ’, value is ‘\ ``bar``\ ’).

         A ffmetadata file might look like this:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               ;FFMETADATA1

               ;this is a comment

               title=multi\
               line

         By using the ffmetadata muxer and demuxer it is possible to
         extract metadata from an input file to an ffmetadata file, and
         then transcode the file into an output file with the edited
         ffmetadata file.

         Extracting an ffmetadata file with ``ffmpeg`` goes as follows:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f ffmetadata FFMETADATAFILE

         Reinserting edited metadata information from the FFMETADATAFILE
         file can be done as:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -i FFMETADATAFILE -map_metadata 1 -codec copy OUTPUT

            :name: protocol-options
            :class: chapter

         The libavformat library provides some generic global options,
         which can be set on all the protocols. In addition each
         protocol may support so-called private options, which are
         specific for that component.

         Options may be set by specifying -``option`` ``value`` in the
         FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
         ``AVFormatContext`` options or using the ``libavutil/opt.h``
         API for programmatic use.

         The list of supported options follows:

         ``protocol_whitelist``\ ``list``\ ``(``\ *``input``*\ ``)``
            Set a ","-separated list of allowed protocols. "ALL" matches
            all protocols. Protocols prefixed by "-" are disabled. All
            protocols are allowed by default but protocols used by an
            another protocol (nested protocols) are restricted to a per
            protocol subset.

      .. container:: chapter-level-extent

            :name: protocols
            :class: chapter

         Protocols are configured elements in FFmpeg that enable access
         to resources that require specific protocols.

         When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported
         protocols are enabled by default. You can list all available
         ones using the configure option "–list-protocols".

         You can disable all the protocols using the configure option
         "–disable-protocols", and selectively enable a protocol using
         the option "–enable-protocol=\ ``PROTOCOL``", or you can
         disable a particular protocol using the option
         "–disable-protocol=\ ``PROTOCOL``".

         The option "-protocols" of the ff\* tools will display the list
         of supported protocols.

         All protocols accept the following options:

         ``rw_timeout``
            Maximum time to wait for (network) read/write operations to
            complete, in microseconds.

         A description of the currently available protocols follows.

         .. container:: section-level-extent
            :name: amqp

            .. rubric:: 16.1 amqp
               :class: section

            Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) version 0-9-1 is a
            broker based publish-subscribe communication protocol.

            FFmpeg must be compiled with –enable-librabbitmq to support
            AMQP. A separate AMQP broker must also be run. An example
            open-source AMQP broker is RabbitMQ.

            After starting the broker, an FFmpeg client may stream data
            to the broker using the command:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -re -i input -f mpegts amqp://[[user]:[password]@]hostname[:port][/vhost]

            Where hostname and port (default is 5672) is the address of
            the broker. The client may also set a user/password for
            authentication. The default for both fields is "guest". Name
            of virtual host on broker can be set with vhost. The default
            value is "/".

            Muliple subscribers may stream from the broker using the
            command:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffplay amqp://[[user]:[password]@]hostname[:port][/vhost]

            In RabbitMQ all data published to the broker flows through a
            specific exchange, and each subscribing client has an
            assigned queue/buffer. When a packet arrives at an exchange,
            it may be copied to a client’s queue depending on the
            exchange and routing_key fields.

            The following options are supported:

            ``exchange``
               Sets the exchange to use on the broker. RabbitMQ has
               several predefined exchanges: "amq.direct" is the default
               exchange, where the publisher and subscriber must have a
               matching routing_key; "amq.fanout" is the same as a
               broadcast operation (i.e. the data is forwarded to all
               queues on the fanout exchange independent of the
               routing_key); and "amq.topic" is similar to "amq.direct",
               but allows for more complex pattern matching (refer to
               the RabbitMQ documentation).

            ``routing_key``
               Sets the routing key. The default value is "amqp". The
               routing key is used on the "amq.direct" and "amq.topic"
               exchanges to decide whether packets are written to the
               queue of a subscriber.

            ``pkt_size``
               Maximum size of each packet sent/received to the broker.
               Default is 131072. Minimum is 4096 and max is any large
               value (representable by an int). When receiving packets,
               this sets an internal buffer size in FFmpeg. It should be
               equal to or greater than the size of the published
               packets to the broker. Otherwise the received message may
               be truncated causing decoding errors.

            ``connection_timeout``
               The timeout in seconds during the initial connection to
               the broker. The default value is rw_timeout, or 5 seconds
               if rw_timeout is not set.

            ``delivery_mode``\ ``mode``
               Sets the delivery mode of each message sent to broker.
               The following values are accepted:

               ‘\ ``persistent``\ ’
                  Delivery mode set to "persistent" (2). This is the
                  default value. Messages may be written to the broker’s
                  disk depending on its setup.

               ‘\ ``non-persistent``\ ’
                  Delivery mode set to "non-persistent" (1). Messages
                  will stay in broker’s memory unless the broker is
                  under memory pressure.

            Physical concatenation protocol.

            Read and seek from many resources in sequence as if they
            were a unique resource.

            A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  concat:URL1|URL2|...|URLN

            where ``URL1``, ``URL2``, ..., ``URLN`` are the urls of the
            resource to be concatenated, each one possibly specifying a
            distinct protocol.

            For example to read a sequence of files ``split1.mpeg``,
            ``split2.mpeg``, ``split3.mpeg`` with ``ffplay`` use the
            command:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffplay concat:split1.mpeg\|split2.mpeg\|split3.mpeg

            Note that you may need to escape the character "\|" which is
            special for many shells.

            list of resources.

            Read and seek from many resources in sequence as if they
            were a unique resource.

            A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  concatf:URL

            where ``URL`` is the url containing a line break delimited
            list of resources to be concatenated, each one possibly
            specifying a distinct protocol. Special characters must be
            escaped with backslash or single quotes. See
            `(ffmpeg-utils)the "Quoting and escaping" section in the
            ffmpeg-utils(1)
            manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#quoting_005fand_005fescaping>`__.

            For example to read a sequence of files ``split1.mpeg``,
            ``split2.mpeg``, ``split3.mpeg`` listed in separate lines
            within a file ``split.txt`` with ``ffplay`` use the command:

               :class: section

            File descriptor access protocol.

            The accepted syntax is:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  fd: -fd file_descriptor

            If ``fd`` is not specified, by default the stdout file
            descriptor will be used for writing, stdin for reading.
            Unlike the pipe protocol, fd protocol has seek support if it
            corresponding to a regular file. fd protocol doesn’t support
            pass file descriptor via URL for security.

            This protocol accepts the following options:

            ``blocksize``
               Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default
               value is ``INT_MAX``, which results in not limiting the
               requested block size. Setting this value reasonably low
               improves user termination request reaction time, which is
               valuable if data transmission is slow.

            ``fd``
               Set file descriptor.

         .. container:: section-level-extent
            :name: file

            .. rubric:: 16.10 file
               :class: section

            File access protocol.

            Read from or write to a file.

            A file URL can have the form:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  file:filename

            where ``filename`` is the path of the file to read.

            An URL that does not have a protocol prefix will be assumed
            to be a file URL. Depending on the build, an URL that looks
            like a Windows path with the drive letter at the beginning
            will also be assumed to be a file URL (usually not the case
            in builds for unix-like systems).

            For example to read from a file ``input.mpeg`` with
            ``ffmpeg`` use the command:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -i file:input.mpeg output.mpeg

            This protocol accepts the following options:

            ``truncate``
               Truncate existing files on write, if set to 1. A value of
               0 prevents truncating. Default value is 1.

            ``blocksize``
               Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default
               value is ``INT_MAX``, which results in not limiting the
               requested block size. Setting this value reasonably low
               improves user termination request reaction time, which is
               valuable for files on slow medium.

            ``follow``
               If set to 1, the protocol will retry reading at the end
               of the file, allowing reading files that still are being
               written. In order for this to terminate, you either need
               to use the rw_timeout option, or use the interrupt
               callback (for API users).

            ``seekable``
               Controls if seekability is advertised on the file. 0
               means non-seekable, -1 means auto (seekable for normal
               files, non-seekable for named pipes).

               Many demuxers handle seekable and non-seekable resources
               differently, overriding this might speed up opening
               certain files at the cost of losing some features (e.g.
               accurate seeking).

            This protocol accepts the following options.

            ``timeout``
               Set timeout in microseconds of socket I/O operations used
               by the underlying low level operation. By default it is
               set to -1, which means that the timeout is not specified.

            ``ftp-user``
               Set a user to be used for authenticating to the FTP
               server. This is overridden by the user in the FTP URL.

            ``ftp-password``
               Set a password to be used for authenticating to the FTP
               server. This is overridden by the password in the FTP
               URL, or by ``ftp-anonymous-password`` if no user is set.

            ``ftp-anonymous-password``
               Password used when login as anonymous user. Typically an
               e-mail address should be used.

            ``ftp-write-seekable``
               Control seekability of connection during encoding. If set
               to 1 the resource is supposed to be seekable, if set to 0
               it is assumed not to be seekable. Default value is 0.

            NOTE: Protocol can be used as output, but it is recommended
            to not do it, unless special care is taken (tests,
            customized server configuration etc.). Different FTP servers
            behave in different way during seek operation. ff\* tools
            may produce incomplete content due to server limitations.

            can be remote HTTP resources or local files, accessed using
            the standard file protocol. The nested protocol is declared
            by specifying "+\ ``proto``" after the hls URI scheme name,
            where ``proto`` is either "file" or "http".

            HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

            This protocol accepts the following options:

            ``seekable``
               Control seekability of connection. If set to 1 the
               resource is supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is
               assumed not to be seekable, if set to -1 it will try to
               autodetect if it is seekable. Default value is -1.

            ``chunked_post``
               If set to 1 use chunked Transfer-Encoding for posts,
               default is 1.

            ``content_type``
               Set a specific content type for the POST messages or for
               listen mode.

            ``http_proxy``
               set HTTP proxy to tunnel through e.g.
               http://example.com:1234

            ``headers``
               Set custom HTTP headers, can override built in default
               headers. The value must be a string encoding the headers.

            ``multiple_requests``
               Use persistent connections if set to 1, default is 0.

            ``post_data``
               Set custom HTTP post data.

            ``referer``
               Set the Referer header. Include ’Referer: URL’ header in
               HTTP request.

            ``user_agent``
               Override the User-Agent header. If not specified the
               protocol will use a string describing the libavformat
               build. ("Lavf/<version>")

            ``reconnect_at_eof``
               If set then eof is treated like an error and causes
               reconnection, this is useful for live / endless streams.

            ``reconnect_streamed``
               If set then even streamed/non seekable streams will be
               reconnected on errors.

            ``reconnect_on_network_error``
               Reconnect automatically in case of TCP/TLS errors during
               connect.

            ``reconnect_on_http_error``
               A comma separated list of HTTP status codes to reconnect
               on. The list can include specific status codes (e.g.
               ’503’) or the strings ’4xx’ / ’5xx’.

            ``reconnect_delay_max``
               Sets the maximum delay in seconds after which to give up
               reconnecting

            ``mime_type``
               Export the MIME type.

            ``http_version``
               Exports the HTTP response version number. Usually "1.0"
               or "1.1".

            ``icy``
               If set to 1 request ICY (SHOUTcast) metadata from the
               server. If the server supports this, the metadata has to
               be retrieved by the application by reading the
               ``icy_metadata_headers`` and ``icy_metadata_packet``
               options. The default is 1.

            ``icy_metadata_headers``
               If the server supports ICY metadata, this contains the
               ICY-specific HTTP reply headers, separated by newline
               characters.

            ``icy_metadata_packet``
               If the server supports ICY metadata, and ``icy`` was set
               to 1, this contains the last non-empty metadata packet
               sent by the server. It should be polled in regular
               intervals by applications interested in mid-stream
               metadata updates.

            ``cookies``
               Set the cookies to be sent in future requests. The format
               of each cookie is the same as the value of a Set-Cookie
               HTTP response field. Multiple cookies can be delimited by
               a newline character.

            ``offset``
               Set initial byte offset.

            ``end_offset``
               Try to limit the request to bytes preceding this offset.

            ``method``
               When used as a client option it sets the HTTP method for
               the request.

               When used as a server option it sets the HTTP method that
               is going to be expected from the client(s). If the
               expected and the received HTTP method do not match the
               client will be given a Bad Request response. When unset
               the HTTP method is not checked for now. This will be
               replaced by autodetection in the future.

            ``listen``
               If set to 1 enables experimental HTTP server. This can be
               used to send data when used as an output option, or read
               data from a client with HTTP POST when used as an input
               option. If set to 2 enables experimental multi-client
               HTTP server. This is not yet implemented in ffmpeg.c and
               thus must not be used as a command line option.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     # Server side (sending):

                     # Client side (receiving):
                     ffmpeg -i http://server:port -c copy somefile.ogg

                     # Client can also be done with wget:

                     # Server side (receiving):

                     # Client can also be done with wget:
                     wget --post-file=somefile.ogg http://server:port

            ``send_expect_100``
               Send an Expect: 100-continue header for POST. If set to 1
               it will send, if set to 0 it won’t, if set to -1 it will
               try to send if it is applicable. Default value is -1.

            ``auth_type``
               Set HTTP authentication type. No option for Digest, since
               this method requires getting nonce parameters from the
               server first and can’t be used straight away like Basic.

               ``none``
                  Choose the HTTP authentication type automatically.
                  This is the default.

               ``basic``
                  Choose the HTTP basic authentication.

                  Basic authentication sends a Base64-encoded string
                  that contains a user name and password for the client.
                  Base64 is not a form of encryption and should be
                  considered the same as sending the user name and
                  password in clear text (Base64 is a reversible
                  encoding). If a resource needs to be protected,
                  strongly consider using an authentication scheme other
                  than basic authentication. HTTPS/TLS should be used
                  with basic authentication. Without these additional
                  security enhancements, basic authentication should not
                  be used to protect sensitive or valuable information.

                  :class: subsection

               Some HTTP requests will be denied unless cookie values
               are passed in with the request. The ``cookies`` option
               allows these cookies to be specified. At the very least,
               each cookie must specify a value along with a path and
               domain. HTTP requests that match both the domain and path
               will automatically include the cookie value in the HTTP
               Cookie header field. Multiple cookies can be delimited by
               a newline.

               The required syntax to play a stream specifying a cookie
               is:

            ``ice_genre``
               Set the stream genre.

            ``ice_name``
               Set the stream name.

            ``ice_description``
               Set the stream description.

            ``ice_url``
               Set the stream website URL.

            ``ice_public``
               Set if the stream should be public. The default is 0 (not
               public).

            ``user_agent``
               Override the User-Agent header. If not specified a string
               of the form "Lavf/<version>" will be used.

            ``password``
               Set the Icecast mountpoint password.

            ``content_type``
               Set the stream content type. This must be set if it is
               different from audio/mpeg.

            ``legacy_icecast``
               This enables support for Icecast versions < 2.4.0, that
               do not support the HTTP PUT method but the SOURCE method.

               :class: section

            InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol support. One can
            access files stored on the IPFS network through so-called
            gateways. These are http(s) endpoints. This protocol wraps
            the IPFS native protocols (ipfs:// and ipns://) to be sent
            to such a gateway. Users can (and should) host their own
            node which means this protocol will use one’s local gateway
            to access files on the IPFS network.

            This protocol accepts the following options:

            ``gateway``
               Defines the gateway to use. When not set, the protocol
               will first try locating the local gateway by looking at
               ``$IPFS_GATEWAY``, ``$IPFS_PATH`` and ``$HOME/.ipfs/``,
               in that order.

            One can use this protocol in 2 ways. Using IPFS:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffplay ipfs://<hash>

            Or the IPNS protocol (IPNS is mutable IPFS):

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffplay ipns://<hash>

            MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over HTTP.

            The required syntax is:

            MD5 output protocol.

            Computes the MD5 hash of the data to be written, and on
            close writes this to the designated output or stdout if none
            is specified. It can be used to test muxers without writing
            an actual file.

            Some examples follow.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  # Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to the file output.avi.md5.

                  # Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to stdout.
                  ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:

            Note that some formats (typically MOV) require the output
            protocol to be seekable, so they will fail with the MD5
            output protocol.

            UNIX pipe access protocol.

            Read and write from UNIX pipes.

            The accepted syntax is:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  pipe:[number]

            If ``fd`` isn’t specified, ``number`` is the number
            corresponding to the file descriptor of the pipe (e.g. 0 for
            stdin, 1 for stdout, 2 for stderr). If ``number`` is not
            specified, by default the stdout file descriptor will be
            used for writing, stdin for reading.

            For example to read from stdin with ``ffmpeg``:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:0
                  # ...this is the same as...
                  cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:

            For writing to stdout with ``ffmpeg``:

            .. container:: example

            This protocol accepts the following options:

            ``blocksize``
               Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default
               value is ``INT_MAX``, which results in not limiting the
               requested block size. Setting this value reasonably low
               improves user termination request reaction time, which is
               valuable if data transmission is slow.

            ``fd``
               Set file descriptor.

            Note that some formats (typically MOV), require the output
            protocol to be seekable, so they will fail with the pipe
            output protocol.

            Pro-MPEG Code of Practice #3 Release 2 FEC protocol.

            The Pro-MPEG CoP#3 FEC is a 2D parity-check forward error
            correction mechanism for MPEG-2 Transport Streams sent over
            RTP.

            This protocol must be used in conjunction with the
            ``rtp_mpegts`` muxer and the ``rtp`` protocol.

            The required syntax is:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  -f rtp_mpegts -fec prompeg=option=val... rtp://hostname:port

            The destination UDP ports are ``port + 2`` for the column
            FEC stream and ``port + 4`` for the row FEC stream.

            This protocol accepts the following options:

            ``l=``\ ``n``
               The number of columns (4-20, LxD <= 100)

            ``d=``\ ``n``
               The number of rows (4-20, LxD <= 100)

            ‘\ ``simple``\ ’
            ‘\ ``main``\ ’
            This one is default.

            ‘\ ``advanced``\ ’
            ``buffer_size``
            Set internal RIST buffer size in milliseconds for
            retransmission of data. Default value is 0 which means the
            librist default (1 sec). Maximum value is 30 seconds.

            ``fifo_size``
            Size of the librist receiver output fifo in number of
            packets. This must be a power of 2. Defaults to 8192 (vs the
            librist default of 1024).

            ``overrun_nonfatal=``\ ``1|0``
            Survive in case of librist fifo buffer overrun. Default
            value is 0.

            ``pkt_size``
            Set maximum packet size for sending data. 1316 by default.

            ``log_level``
            Set loglevel for RIST logging messages. You only need to set
            this if you explicitly want to enable debug level messages
            or packet loss simulation, otherwise the regular loglevel is
            respected.

            ``secret``
            Set override of encryption secret, by default is unset.

            ``encryption``

            Real-Time Messaging Protocol.

            The Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is used for
            streaming multimedia content across a TCP/IP network.

            The required syntax is:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  rtmp://[username:password@]server[:port][/app][/instance][/playpath]

            The accepted parameters are:

            ``username``
               An optional username (mostly for publishing).

            ``password``
               An optional password (mostly for publishing).

            ``server``
               The address of the RTMP server.

            ``port``
               The number of the TCP port to use (by default is 1935).

            ``app``
               It is the name of the application to access. It usually
               corresponds to the path where the application is
               installed on the RTMP server (e.g. ``/ondemand/``,
               ``/flash/live/``, etc.). You can override the value
               parsed from the URI through the ``rtmp_app`` option, too.

            ``playpath``
               It is the path or name of the resource to play with
               reference to the application specified in ``app``, may be
               prefixed by "mp4:". You can override the value parsed
               from the URI through the ``rtmp_playpath`` option, too.

            ``listen``
               Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

            ``timeout``
               Maximum time to wait for the incoming connection. Implies
               listen.

            Additionally, the following parameters can be set via
            command line options (or in code via ``AVOption``\ s):

            ``rtmp_app``
               Name of application to connect on the RTMP server. This
               option overrides the parameter specified in the URI.

            ``rtmp_buffer``
               Set the client buffer time in milliseconds. The default
               is 3000.

            ``rtmp_conn``
               Extra arbitrary AMF connection parameters, parsed from a
               string, e.g. like
               ``B:1 S:authMe O:1 NN:code:1.23 NS:flag:ok O:0``. Each
               value is prefixed by a single character denoting the
               type, B for Boolean, N for number, S for string, O for
               object, or Z for null, followed by a colon. For Booleans
               the data must be either 0 or 1 for FALSE or TRUE,
               respectively. Likewise for Objects the data must be 0 or
               1 to end or begin an object, respectively. Data items in
               subobjects may be named, by prefixing the type with ’N’
               and specifying the name before the value (i.e.
               ``NB:myFlag:1``). This option may be used multiple times
               to construct arbitrary AMF sequences.

            ``rtmp_enhanced_codecs``
               Specify the list of codecs the client advertises to
               support in an enhanced RTMP stream. This option should be
               set to a comma separated list of fourcc values, like
               ``hvc1,av01,vp09`` for multiple codecs or ``hvc1`` for
               only one codec. The specified list will be presented in
               the "fourCcLive" property of the Connect Command Message.

            ``rtmp_flashver``
               Version of the Flash plugin used to run the SWF player.
               The default is LNX 9,0,124,2. (When publishing, the
               default is FMLE/3.0 (compatible; <libavformat version>).)

            ``rtmp_flush_interval``
               Number of packets flushed in the same request (RTMPT
               only). The default is 10.

            ``rtmp_live``
               Specify that the media is a live stream. No resuming or
               seeking in live streams is possible. The default value is
               ``any``, which means the subscriber first tries to play
               the live stream specified in the playpath. If a live
               stream of that name is not found, it plays the recorded
               stream. The other possible values are ``live`` and
               ``recorded``.

            ``rtmp_pageurl``
               URL of the web page in which the media was embedded. By
               default no value will be sent.

            ``rtmp_playpath``
               Stream identifier to play or to publish. This option
               overrides the parameter specified in the URI.

            ``rtmp_subscribe``
               Name of live stream to subscribe to. By default no value
               will be sent. It is only sent if the option is specified
               or if rtmp_live is set to live.

            ``rtmp_swfhash``
               SHA256 hash of the decompressed SWF file (32 bytes).

            ``rtmp_swfsize``
               Size of the decompressed SWF file, required for
               SWFVerification.

            ``rtmp_swfurl``
               URL of the SWF player for the media. By default no value
               will be sent.

            ``rtmp_swfverify``
               URL to player swf file, compute hash/size automatically.

            ``rtmp_tcurl``
               URL of the target stream. Defaults to
               proto://host[:port]/app.

            ``tcp_nodelay=``\ ``1|0``
               Set TCP_NODELAY to disable Nagle’s algorithm. Default
               value is 0.

               *Remark: Writing to the socket is currently not optimized
               to minimize system calls and reduces the efficiency /
               effect of TCP_NODELAY.*

            Requires the presence of the librtmp headers and library
            during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the
            build with "–enable-librtmp". If enabled this will replace
            the native RTMP protocol.

            This protocol provides most client functions and a few
            server functions needed to support RTMP, RTMP tunneled in
            HTTP (RTMPT), encrypted RTMP (RTMPE), RTMP over SSL/TLS
            (RTMPS) and tunneled variants of these encrypted types

            "rtmpe", "rtmps", "rtmpte", "rtmpts" corresponding to each
            RTMP variant, and ``server``, ``port``, ``app`` and
            ``playpath`` have the same meaning as specified for the RTMP
            native protocol. ``options`` contains a list of
            space-separated options of the form ``key``\ =\ ``val``.

            Real-time Transport Protocol.

            The required syntax for an RTP URL is:
            rtp://``hostname``\ [:``port``][?\ ``option``\ =\ ``val``...]

            ``port`` specifies the RTP port to use.

            The following URL options are supported:

            ``ttl=``\ ``n``
               Set the TTL (Time-To-Live) value (for multicast only).

            ``rtcpport=``\ ``n``
               Set the remote RTCP port to ``n``.

            ``localrtpport=``\ ``n``
               Set the local RTP port to ``n``.

            ``localrtcpport=``\ ``n``\ ``'``
               Set the local RTCP port to ``n``.

            ``pkt_size=``\ ``n``
               Set max packet size (in bytes) to ``n``.

            ``buffer_size=``\ ``size``
               Set the maximum UDP socket buffer size in bytes.

            ``connect=0|1``
               Do a ``connect()`` on the UDP socket (if set to 1) or not
               (if set to 0).

            ``sources=``\ ``ip``\ ``[,``\ ``ip``\ ``]``
               List allowed source IP addresses.

            ``block=``\ ``ip``\ ``[,``\ ``ip``\ ``]``
               List disallowed (blocked) source IP addresses.

            ``write_to_source=0|1``
               Send packets to the source address of the latest received
               packet (if set to 1) or to a default remote address (if
               set to 0).

            ``localport=``\ ``n``
               Set the local RTP port to ``n``.

            ``localaddr=``\ ``addr``
               Local IP address of a network interface used for sending
               packets or joining multicast groups.

            ``timeout=``\ ``n``
               Set timeout (in microseconds) of socket I/O operations to
               ``n``.

               This is a deprecated option. Instead, ``localrtpport``
               should be used.

            Important notes:

            #. If ``rtcpport`` is not set the RTCP port will be set to
               the RTP port value plus 1.
            #. If ``localrtpport`` (the local RTP port) is not set any
               available port will be used for the local RTP and RTCP
               ports.
            #. If ``localrtcpport`` (the local RTCP port) is not set it
               will be set to the local RTP port value plus 1.

            Real-Time Streaming Protocol.

            RTSP is not technically a protocol handler in libavformat,
            it is a demuxer and muxer. The demuxer supports both normal
            RTSP (with data transferred over RTP; this is used by e.g.
            Apple and Microsoft) and Real-RTSP (with data transferred
            over RDT).

            The muxer can be used to send a stream using RTSP ANNOUNCE
            to a server supporting it (currently Darwin Streaming Server
            and Mischa Spiegelmock’s `RTSP
            server <https://github.com/revmischa/rtsp-server>`__).

            The required syntax for a RTSP url is:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  rtsp://hostname[:port]/path

            Options can be set on the ``ffmpeg``/``ffplay`` command
            line, or set in code via ``AVOption``\ s or in
            ``avformat_open_input``.

                     channel) as lower transport protocol.

                  Default value is ‘\ ``0``\ ’.

               ``rtsp_flags``
                  Set RTSP flags.

                  The following values are accepted:

                  ‘\ ``latm``\ ’

                  ‘\ ``h264_mode0``\ ’
                     Use mode 0 for H.264 in RTP.

                  ‘\ ``send_bye``\ ’
                     Send RTCP BYE packets when finishing.

               The following options are supported.

               ``initial_pause``
               Do not start playing the stream immediately if set to 1.

               ``rtsp_transport``
               Set RTSP transport protocols.

               It accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``udp``\ ’
                  Use UDP as lower transport protocol.

               ‘\ ``tcp``\ ’
                  Use TCP (interleaving within the RTSP control channel)
                  as lower transport protocol.

               ‘\ ``udp_multicast``\ ’
                  Use UDP multicast as lower transport protocol.

               ‘\ ``http``\ ’
                  Use HTTP tunneling as lower transport protocol, which
                  is useful for passing proxies.

               ‘\ ``https``\ ’
                  Use HTTPs tunneling as lower transport protocol, which
                  is useful for passing proxies and widely used for
                  security consideration.

               Multiple lower transport protocols may be specified, in
               that case they are tried one at a time (if the setup of
               one fails, the next one is tried). For the muxer, only
               the ‘\ ``tcp``\ ’ and ‘\ ``udp``\ ’ options are
               supported.

               ``rtsp_flags``
               Set RTSP flags.

               The following values are accepted:

               ‘\ ``filter_src``\ ’
                  Accept packets only from negotiated peer address and
                  port.

               ‘\ ``listen``\ ’
                  Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

               ‘\ ``prefer_tcp``\ ’
                  Try TCP for RTP transport first, if TCP is available
                  as RTSP RTP transport.

               ‘\ ``satip_raw``\ ’
                  Export raw MPEG-TS stream instead of demuxing. The
                  flag will simply write out the raw stream, with the
                  original PAT/PMT/PIDs intact.

               Default value is ‘\ ``none``\ ’.

               ``allowed_media_types``
               Set media types to accept from the server.

               The following flags are accepted:

               ‘\ ``video``\ ’
               ‘\ ``audio``\ ’
               ‘\ ``data``\ ’
               ‘\ ``subtitle``\ ’
               By default it accepts all media types.

               ``min_port``
               Set minimum local UDP port. Default value is 5000.

               ``max_port``
               Set maximum local UDP port. Default value is 65000.

               ``listen_timeout``
               Set maximum timeout (in seconds) to establish an initial
               connection. Setting ``listen_timeout`` > 0 sets
               ``rtsp_flags`` to ‘\ ``listen``\ ’. Default is -1 which
               means an infinite timeout when ‘\ ``listen``\ ’ mode is
               set.

               ``reorder_queue_size``
               Set number of packets to buffer for handling of reordered
               packets.

               ``timeout``
               Set socket TCP I/O timeout in microseconds.

               ``user_agent``
               Override User-Agent header. If not specified, it defaults
               to the libavformat identifier string.

               ``buffer_size``
               Set the maximum socket buffer size in bytes.

               When receiving data over UDP, the demuxer tries to
               reorder received packets (since they may arrive out of
               order, or packets may get lost totally). This can be
               disabled by setting the maximum demuxing delay to zero
               (via the ``max_delay`` field of AVFormatContext).

               When watching multi-bitrate Real-RTSP streams with
               ``ffplay``, the streams to display can be chosen with
               ``-vst`` ``n`` and ``-ast`` ``n`` for video and audio
               respectively, and can be switched on the fly by pressing
               ``v`` and ``a``.

                     sap://destination[:port][?options]

               The RTP packets are sent to ``destination`` on port
               ``port``, or to port 5004 if no port is specified.
               ``options`` is a ``&``-separated list. The following
               options are supported:

               ``announce_addr=``\ ``address``
                  Specify the destination IP address for sending the
                  announcements to. If omitted, the announcements are
                  sent to the commonly used SAP announcement multicast
                  address 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net), or ff0e::2:7ffe
                  if ``destination`` is an IPv6 address.

               ``announce_port=``\ ``port``
                  Specify the port to send the announcements on,
                  defaults to 9875 if not specified.

               ``ttl=``\ ``ttl``
                  Specify the time to live value for the announcements
                  and RTP packets, defaults to 255.

               ``same_port=``\ ``0|1``
                  If set to 1, send all RTP streams on the same port
                  pair. If zero (the default), all streams are sent on
                  unique ports, with each stream on a port 2 numbers
                  higher than the previous. VLC/Live555 requires this to
                  be set to 1, to be able to receive the stream. The RTP
                  stack in libavformat for receiving requires all
                  streams to be sent on unique ports.

               Example command lines follow.

               The syntax for a SAP url given to the demuxer is:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     sap://[address][:port]

               ``address`` is the multicast address to listen for
               announcements on, if omitted, the default 224.2.127.254
               (sap.mcast.net) is used. ``port`` is the port that is
               listened on, 9875 if omitted.

               The demuxers listens for announcements on the given
               address and port. Once an announcement is received, it
               tries to receive that particular stream.

               Example command lines follow.

               To play back the first stream announced on the normal SAP
               multicast address:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     ffplay sap://

               To play back the first stream announced on one the
               default IPv6 SAP multicast address:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     ffplay sap://[ff0e::2:7ffe]

               :class: section

            Stream Control Transmission Protocol.

            The accepted URL syntax is:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  sctp://host:port[?options]

            The protocol accepts the following options:

            ``listen``
               If set to any value, listen for an incoming connection.
               Outgoing connection is done by default.

            ``max_streams``
               Set the maximum number of streams. By default no limit is
               set.

               :class: section

            Haivision Secure Reliable Transport Protocol via libsrt.

            The supported syntax for a SRT URL is:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  srt://hostname:port[?options]

            ``options`` contains a list of &-separated options of the
            form ``key``\ =\ ``val``.

            or

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  options srt://hostname:port

            ``options`` contains a list of ’-``key`` ``val``\ ’ options.

            This protocol accepts the following options.

            ``connect_timeout=``\ ``milliseconds``
               Connection timeout; SRT cannot connect for RTT > 1500
               msec (2 handshake exchanges) with the default connect
               timeout of 3 seconds. This option applies to the caller
               and rendezvous connection modes. The connect timeout is
               10 times the value set for the rendezvous mode (which can
               be used as a workaround for this connection problem with
               earlier versions).

            ``ffs=``\ ``bytes``
               Flight Flag Size (Window Size), in bytes. FFS is actually
               an internal parameter and you should set it to not less
               than ``recv_buffer_size`` and ``mss``. The default value
               is relatively large, therefore unless you set a very
               large receiver buffer, you do not need to change this
               option. Default value is 25600.

            ``inputbw=``\ ``bytes/seconds``
               Sender nominal input rate, in bytes per seconds. Used
               along with ``oheadbw``, when ``maxbw`` is set to relative
               (0), to calculate maximum sending rate when recovery
               packets are sent along with the main media stream:
               ``inputbw`` \* (100 + ``oheadbw``) / 100 if ``inputbw``
               is not set while ``maxbw`` is set to relative (0), the
               actual input rate is evaluated inside the library.
               Default value is 0.

            ``iptos=``\ ``tos``
               IP Type of Service. Applies to sender only. Default value
               is 0xB8.

            ``ipttl=``\ ``ttl``
               IP Time To Live. Applies to sender only. Default value is
               64.

            ``latency=``\ ``microseconds``
               Timestamp-based Packet Delivery Delay. Used to absorb
               bursts of missed packet retransmissions. This flag sets
               both ``rcvlatency`` and ``peerlatency`` to the same
               value. Note that prior to version 1.3.0 this is the only
               flag to set the latency, however this is effectively
               equivalent to setting ``peerlatency``, when side is
               sender and ``rcvlatency`` when side is receiver, and the
               bidirectional stream sending is not supported.

            ``listen_timeout=``\ ``microseconds``
               Set socket listen timeout.

            ``maxbw=``\ ``bytes/seconds``
               Maximum sending bandwidth, in bytes per seconds. -1
               infinite (CSRTCC limit is 30mbps) 0 relative to input
               rate (see ``inputbw``) >0 absolute limit value Default
               value is 0 (relative)

            ``mode=``\ ``caller|listener|rendezvous``
               Connection mode. ``caller`` opens client connection.
               ``listener`` starts server to listen for incoming
               connections. ``rendezvous`` use Rendez-Vous connection
               mode. Default value is caller.

            ``mss=``\ ``bytes``
               Maximum Segment Size, in bytes. Used for buffer
               allocation and rate calculation using a packet counter
               assuming fully filled packets. The smallest MSS between
               the peers is used. This is 1500 by default in the overall
               internet. This is the maximum size of the UDP packet and
               can be only decreased, unless you have some unusual
               dedicated network settings. Default value is 1500.

            ``nakreport=``\ ``1|0``
               If set to 1, Receiver will send ‘UMSG_LOSSREPORT‘
               messages periodically until a lost packet is
               retransmitted or intentionally dropped. Default value is
               1.

            ``oheadbw=``\ ``percents``
               Recovery bandwidth overhead above input rate, in
               percents. See ``inputbw``. Default value is 25%.

            ``passphrase=``\ ``string``
               HaiCrypt Encryption/Decryption Passphrase string, length
               from 10 to 79 characters. The passphrase is the shared
               secret between the sender and the receiver. It is used to
               generate the Key Encrypting Key using PBKDF2
               (Password-Based Key Derivation Function). It is used only
               if ``pbkeylen`` is non-zero. It is used on the receiver
               only if the received data is encrypted. The configured
               passphrase cannot be recovered (write-only).

            ``enforced_encryption=``\ ``1|0``
               If true, both connection parties must have the same
               password set (including empty, that is, with no
               encryption). If the password doesn’t match or only one
               side is unencrypted, the connection is rejected. Default
               is true.

            ``kmrefreshrate=``\ ``packets``
               The number of packets to be transmitted after which the
               encryption key is switched to a new key. Default is -1.
               -1 means auto (0x1000000 in srt library). The range for
               this option is integers in the 0 - ``INT_MAX``.

            ``kmpreannounce=``\ ``packets``
               The interval between when a new encryption key is sent
               and when switchover occurs. This value also applies to
               the subsequent interval between when switchover occurs
               and when the old encryption key is decommissioned.
               Default is -1. -1 means auto (0x1000 in srt library). The
               range for this option is integers in the 0 - ``INT_MAX``.

            ``snddropdelay=``\ ``microseconds``
               The sender’s extra delay before dropping packets. This
               delay is added to the default drop delay time interval
               value.

               Special value -1: Do not drop packets on the sender at
               all.

            ``payload_size=``\ ``bytes``
               Sets the maximum declared size of a packet transferred
               during the single call to the sending function in Live
               mode. Use 0 if this value isn’t used (which is default in
               file mode). Default is -1 (automatic), which typically
               means MPEG-TS; if you are going to use SRT to send any
               different kind of payload, such as, for example, wrapping
               a live stream in very small frames, then you can use a
               bigger maximum frame size, though not greater than 1456
               bytes.

            ``pkt_size=``\ ``bytes``
               Alias for ‘\ ``payload_size``\ ’.

            ``peerlatency=``\ ``microseconds``
               The latency value (as described in ``rcvlatency``) that
               is set by the sender side as a minimum value for the
               receiver.

            ``pbkeylen=``\ ``bytes``
               Sender encryption key length, in bytes. Only can be set
               to 0, 16, 24 and 32. Enable sender encryption if not 0.
               Not required on receiver (set to 0), key size obtained
               from sender in HaiCrypt handshake. Default value is 0.

            ``rcvlatency=``\ ``microseconds``
               The time that should elapse since the moment when the
               packet was sent and the moment when it’s delivered to the
               receiver application in the receiving function. This time
               should be a buffer time large enough to cover the time
               spent for sending, unexpectedly extended RTT time, and
               the time needed to retransmit the lost UDP packet. The
               effective latency value will be the maximum of this
               options’ value and the value of ``peerlatency`` set by
               the peer side. Before version 1.3.0 this option is only
               available as ``latency``.

            ``recv_buffer_size=``\ ``bytes``
               Set UDP receive buffer size, expressed in bytes.

            ``send_buffer_size=``\ ``bytes``
               Set UDP send buffer size, expressed in bytes.

            ``timeout=``\ ``microseconds``
               Set raise error timeouts for read, write and connect
               operations. Note that the SRT library has internal
               timeouts which can be controlled separately, the value
               set here is only a cap on those.

            ``tlpktdrop=``\ ``1|0``
               Too-late Packet Drop. When enabled on receiver, it skips
               missing packets that have not been delivered in time and
               delivers the following packets to the application when
               their time-to-play has come. It also sends a fake ACK to
               the sender. When enabled on sender and enabled on the
               receiving peer, the sender drops the older packets that
               have no chance of being delivered in time. It was
               automatically enabled in the sender if the receiver
               supports it.

            ``sndbuf=``\ ``bytes``
               Set send buffer size, expressed in bytes.

            ``rcvbuf=``\ ``bytes``
               Set receive buffer size, expressed in bytes.

               Receive buffer must not be greater than ``ffs``.

            ``lossmaxttl=``\ ``packets``
               The value up to which the Reorder Tolerance may grow.
               When Reorder Tolerance is > 0, then packet loss report is
               delayed until that number of packets come in. Reorder
               Tolerance increases every time a "belated" packet has
               come, but it wasn’t due to retransmission (that is, when
               UDP packets tend to come out of order), with the
               difference between the latest sequence and this packet’s
               sequence, and not more than the value of this option. By
               default it’s 0, which means that this mechanism is turned
               off, and the loss report is always sent immediately upon
               experiencing a "gap" in sequences.

            ``minversion``
               The minimum SRT version that is required from the peer. A
               connection to a peer that does not satisfy the minimum
               version requirement will be rejected.

               The version format in hex is 0xXXYYZZ for x.y.z in human
               readable form.

            ``streamid=``\ ``string``
               A string limited to 512 characters that can be set on the
               socket prior to connecting. This stream ID will be able
               to be retrieved by the listener side from the socket that
               is returned from srt_accept and was connected by a socket
               with that set stream ID. SRT does not enforce any special
               interpretation of the contents of this string. This
               option doesn’t make sense in Rendezvous connection; the
               result might be that simply one side will override the
               value from the other side and it’s the matter of luck
               which one would win

            ``srt_streamid=``\ ``string``
               Alias for ‘\ ``streamid``\ ’ to avoid conflict with
               ffmpeg command line option.

            ``smoother=``\ ``live|file``
               The type of Smoother used for the transmission for that
               socket, which is responsible for the transmission and
               congestion control. The Smoother type must be exactly the
               same on both connecting parties, otherwise the connection
               is rejected.

            ``messageapi=``\ ``1|0``
               When set, this socket uses the Message API, otherwise it
               uses Buffer API. Note that in live mode (see
               ``transtype``) there’s only message API available. In
               File mode you can chose to use one of two modes:

               Stream API (default, when this option is false). In this
               mode you may send as many data as you wish with one
               sending instruction, or even use dedicated functions that
               read directly from a file. The internal facility will
               take care of any speed and congestion control. When
               receiving, you can also receive as many data as desired,
               the data not extracted will be waiting for the next call.
               There is no boundary between data portions in the Stream
               mode.

               Message API. In this mode your single sending instruction
               passes exactly one piece of data that has boundaries (a
               message). Contrary to Live mode, this message may span
               across multiple UDP packets and the only size limitation
               is that it shall fit as a whole in the sending buffer.
               The receiver shall use as large buffer as necessary to
               receive the message, otherwise the message will not be
               given up. When the message is not complete (not all
               packets received or there was a packet loss) it will not
               be given up.

            ``transtype=``\ ``live|file``
               Sets the transmission type for the socket, in particular,
               setting this option sets multiple other parameters to
               their default values as required for a particular
               transmission type.

               live: Set options as for live transmission. In this mode,
               you should send by one sending instruction only so many
               data that fit in one UDP packet, and limited to the value
               defined first in ``payload_size`` (1316 is default in
               this mode). There is no speed control in this mode, only
               the bandwidth control, if configured, in order to not
               exceed the bandwidth with the overhead transmission
               (retransmitted and control packets).

               file: Set options as for non-live transmission. See
               ``messageapi`` for further explanations

            ``linger=``\ ``seconds``
               The number of seconds that the socket waits for unsent
               data when closing. Default is -1. -1 means auto (off with
               0 seconds in live mode, on with 180 seconds in file
               mode). The range for this option is integers in the 0 -
               ``INT_MAX``.

            ``tsbpd=``\ ``1|0``
               When true, use Timestamp-based Packet Delivery mode. The
               default behavior depends on the transmission type:

            ``options`` contains a list of &-separated options of the
            form ``key``\ =\ ``val``.

            The list of supported options follows.

            ``listen=``\ ``2|1|0``
               Listen for an incoming connection. 0 disables listen, 1
               enables listen in single client mode, 2 enables listen in
               multi-client mode. Default value is 0.

            ``local_addr=``\ ``addr``
               Local IP address of a network interface used for tcp
               socket connect.

            ``local_port=``\ ``port``
               Local port used for tcp socket connect.

            ``timeout=``\ ``microseconds``
               Set raise error timeout, expressed in microseconds.

               This option is only relevant in read mode: if no data
               arrived in more than this time interval, raise error.

            ``listen_timeout=``\ ``milliseconds``
               Set listen timeout, expressed in milliseconds.

            ``recv_buffer_size=``\ ``bytes``
               Set receive buffer size, expressed bytes.

            ``send_buffer_size=``\ ``bytes``
               Set send buffer size, expressed bytes.

            ``tcp_nodelay=``\ ``1|0``
               Set TCP_NODELAY to disable Nagle’s algorithm. Default
               value is 0.

               *Remark: Writing to the socket is currently not optimized
               to minimize system calls and reduces the efficiency /
               effect of TCP_NODELAY.*

            ``tcp_mss=``\ ``bytes``
               Set maximum segment size for outgoing TCP packets,
               expressed in bytes.

            The following example shows how to setup a listening TCP

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  tls://hostname:port[?options]

            The following parameters can be set via command line options
            (or in code via ``AVOption``\ s):

            ``ca_file, cafile=``\ ``filename``
               A file containing certificate authority (CA) root
               certificates to treat as trusted. If the linked TLS
               library contains a default this might not need to be
               specified for verification to work, but not all libraries
               and setups have defaults built in. The file must be in
               OpenSSL PEM format.

            ``tls_verify=``\ ``1|0``
               If enabled, try to verify the peer that we are
               communicating with. Note, if using OpenSSL, this
               currently only makes sure that the peer certificate is
               signed by one of the root certificates in the CA
               database, but it does not validate that the certificate
               actually matches the host name we are trying to connect
               to. (With other backends, the host name is validated as
               well.)

               This is disabled by default since it requires a CA
               database to be provided by the caller in many cases.

            ``cert_file, cert=``\ ``filename``
               A file containing a certificate to use in the handshake
               with the peer. (When operating as server, in listen mode,
               this is more often required by the peer, while client
               certificates only are mandated in certain setups.)

            ``key_file, key=``\ ``filename``
               A file containing the private key for the certificate.

            ``listen=``\ ``1|0``
               If enabled, listen for connections on the provided port,
               and assume the server role in the handshake instead of
               the client role.

            ``http_proxy``
               The HTTP proxy to tunnel through, e.g.
               ``http://example.com:1234``. The proxy must support the
               CONNECT method.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  udp://hostname:port[?options]

            ``options`` contains a list of &-separated options of the
            form ``key``\ =\ ``val``.

            In case threading is enabled on the system, a circular
            buffer is used to store the incoming data, which allows one
            to reduce loss of data due to UDP socket buffer overruns.
            The ``fifo_size`` and ``overrun_nonfatal`` options are
            related to this buffer.

            The list of supported options follows.

            ``buffer_size=``\ ``size``
               Set the UDP maximum socket buffer size in bytes. This is
               used to set either the receive or send buffer size,
               depending on what the socket is used for. Default is 32
               KB for output, 384 KB for input. See also ``fifo_size``.

            ``bitrate=``\ ``bitrate``
               If set to nonzero, the output will have the specified
               constant bitrate if the input has enough packets to
               sustain it.

            ``burst_bits=``\ ``bits``
               When using ``bitrate`` this specifies the maximum number
               of bits in packet bursts.

            ``localport=``\ ``port``
               Override the local UDP port to bind with.

            ``localaddr=``\ ``addr``
               Local IP address of a network interface used for sending
               packets or joining multicast groups.

            ``pkt_size=``\ ``size``
               Set the size in bytes of UDP packets.

            ``reuse=``\ ``1|0``
               Explicitly allow or disallow reusing UDP sockets.

            ``ttl=``\ ``ttl``
               Set the time to live value (for multicast only).

            ``connect=``\ ``1|0``
               Initialize the UDP socket with ``connect()``. In this
               case, the destination address can’t be changed with
               ff_udp_set_remote_url later. If the destination address
               isn’t known at the start, this option can be specified in
               ff_udp_set_remote_url, too. This allows finding out the
               source address for the packets with getsockname, and
               makes writes return with AVERROR(ECONNREFUSED) if
               "destination unreachable" is received. For receiving,
               this gives the benefit of only receiving packets from the
               specified peer address/port.

            ``sources=``\ ``address``\ ``[,``\ ``address``\ ``]``
               Only receive packets sent from the specified addresses.
               In case of multicast, also subscribe to multicast traffic
               coming from these addresses only.

            ``block=``\ ``address``\ ``[,``\ ``address``\ ``]``
               Ignore packets sent from the specified addresses. In case
               of multicast, also exclude the source addresses in the
               multicast subscription.

            ``fifo_size=``\ ``units``
               Set the UDP receiving circular buffer size, expressed as
               a number of packets with size of 188 bytes. If not
               specified defaults to 7*4096.

            ``overrun_nonfatal=``\ ``1|0``
               Survive in case of UDP receiving circular buffer overrun.
               Default value is 0.

            ``timeout=``\ ``microseconds``
               Set raise error timeout, expressed in microseconds.

               This option is only relevant in read mode: if no data
               arrived in more than this time interval, raise error.

            ``broadcast=``\ ``1|0``
               Explicitly allow or disallow UDP broadcasting.

               Note that broadcasting may not work properly on networks
               having a broadcast storm protection.

            ZeroMQ asynchronous messaging using the libzmq library.

            This library supports unicast streaming to multiple clients
            without relying on an external server.

            The required syntax for streaming or connecting to a stream
            is:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  zmq:tcp://ip-address:port

            Example: Create a localhost stream on port 5555:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -re -i input -f mpegts zmq:tcp://127.0.0.1:5555

            Multiple clients may connect to the stream using:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffplay zmq:tcp://127.0.0.1:5555

            Streaming to multiple clients is implemented using a ZeroMQ
            Pub-Sub pattern. The server side binds to a port and
            publishes data. Clients connect to the server (via IP
            address/port) and subscribe to the stream. The order in
            which the server and client start generally does not matter.

            ffmpeg must be compiled with the –enable-libzmq option to
            support this protocol.

            Options can be set on the ``ffmpeg``/``ffplay`` command
            line. The following options are supported:

            ``pkt_size``
               Forces the maximum packet size for sending/receiving
               data. The default value is 131,072 bytes. On the server
               side, this sets the maximum size of sent packets via
               ZeroMQ. On the clients, it sets an internal buffer size
               for receiving packets. Note that pkt_size on the clients
               should be equal to or greater than pkt_size on the
               server. Otherwise the received message may be truncated
               causing decoding errors.

         and generic device options are the same provided by libavformat
         (see the ffmpeg-formats manual).

         In addition each input or output device may support so-called
         private options, which are specific for that component.

         Options may be set by specifying -``option`` ``value`` in the
         FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the device
         ``AVFormatContext`` options or using the ``libavutil/opt.h``
         API for programmatic use.

         Input devices are configured elements in FFmpeg which enable
         accessing the data coming from a multimedia device attached to
         your system.

         When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported input
         devices are enabled by default. You can list all available ones
         using the configure option "–list-indevs".

         You can disable all the input devices using the configure
         option "–disable-indevs", and selectively enable an input
         device using the option "–enable-indev=\ ``INDEV``", or you can
         disable a particular input device using the option
         "–disable-indev=\ ``INDEV``".

         The option "-devices" of the ff\* tools will display the list
         of supported input devices.

         A description of the currently available input devices follows.

               :class: section

            ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) input device.

            To enable this input device during configuration you need
            libasound installed on your system.

            This device allows capturing from an ALSA device. The name
            of the device to capture has to be an ALSA card identifier.

            An ALSA identifier has the syntax:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  hw:CARD[,DEV[,SUBDEV]]

            where the ``DEV`` and ``SUBDEV`` components are optional.

            The three arguments (in order:
            ``CARD``,\ ``DEV``,\ ``SUBDEV``) specify card number or
            identifier, device number and subdevice number (-1 means
            any).

            To see the list of cards currently recognized by your system
            check the files ``/proc/asound/cards`` and
            ``/proc/asound/devices``.

            For example to capture with ``ffmpeg`` from an ALSA device
            with card id 0, you may run the command:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:0 alsaout.wav

            This input devices uses the Android Camera2 NDK API which is
            available on devices with API level 24+. The availability of
            android_camera is autodetected during configuration.

            This device allows capturing from all cameras on an Android
            device, which are integrated into the Camera2 NDK API.

            The available cameras are enumerated internally and can be
            selected with the ``camera_index`` parameter. The input file
            string is discarded.

            Generally the back facing camera has index 0 while the front
            facing camera has index 1.

            AVFoundation input device.

            AVFoundation is the currently recommended framework by Apple
            for streamgrabbing on OSX >= 10.7 as well as on iOS.

            The input filename has to be given in the following syntax:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  -i "[[VIDEO]:[AUDIO]]"

            The first entry selects the video input while the latter
            selects the audio input. The stream has to be specified by
            the device name or the device index as shown by the device
            list. Alternatively, the video and/or audio input device can
            be chosen by index using the ``-video_device_index <INDEX>``
            and/or ``-audio_device_index <INDEX>`` , overriding any
            device name or index given in the input filename.

            All available devices can be enumerated by using
            ``-list_devices true``, listing all device names and
            corresponding indices.

            There are two device name aliases:

            ``default``
               Select the AVFoundation default device of the
               corresponding type.

            ``none``
               Do not record the corresponding media type. This is
               equivalent to specifying an empty device name or index.

               AVFoundation supports the following options:

               ``-list_devices <TRUE|FALSE>``
                  If set to true, a list of all available input devices
                  is given showing all device names and indices.

               ``-video_device_index <INDEX>``
                  Specify the video device by its index. Overrides
                  anything given in the input filename.

               ``-audio_device_index <INDEX>``
                  Specify the audio device by its index. Overrides
                  anything given in the input filename.

               ``-pixel_format <FORMAT>``
                  Request the video device to use a specific pixel
                  format. If the specified format is not supported, a
                  list of available formats is given and the first one
                  in this list is used instead. Available pixel formats
                  are:
                  ``monob, rgb555be, rgb555le, rgb565be, rgb565le, rgb24, bgr24, 0rgb, bgr0, 0bgr, rgb0, bgr48be, uyvy422, yuva444p, yuva444p16le, yuv444p, yuv422p16, yuv422p10, yuv444p10, yuv420p, nv12, yuyv422, gray``

               ``-framerate``
                  Set the grabbing frame rate. Default is ``ntsc``,
                  corresponding to a frame rate of ``30000/1001``.

               ``-video_size``
                  Set the video frame size.

               ``-capture_cursor``
                  Capture the mouse pointer. Default is 0.

               ``-capture_mouse_clicks``
                  Capture the screen mouse clicks. Default is 0.

               ``-capture_raw_data``
                  Capture the raw device data. Default is 0. Using this
                  option may result in receiving the underlying data
                  delivered to the AVFoundation framework. E.g. for
                  muxed devices that sends raw DV data to the framework
                  (like tape-based camcorders), setting this option to
                  false results in extracted video frames captured in
                  the designated pixel format only. Setting this option
                  to true results in receiving the raw DV stream
                  untouched.

            The decklink input device provides capture capabilities for
            Blackmagic DeckLink devices.

            To enable this input device, you need the Blackmagic
            DeckLink SDK and you need to configure with the appropriate
            ``--extra-cflags`` and ``--extra-ldflags``. On Windows, you
            need to run the IDL files through ``widl``.

            DeckLink is very picky about the formats it supports. Pixel
            format of the input can be set with ``raw_format``.
            Framerate and video size must be determined for your device
            with ``-list_formats 1``. Audio sample rate is always 48 kHz
            and the number of channels can be 2, 8 or 16. Note that all
            audio channels are bundled in one single audio track.

               ``teletext_lines``
                  If set to nonzero, an additional teletext stream will
                  be captured from the vertical ancillary data. Both SD
                  PAL (576i) and HD (1080i or 1080p) sources are
                  supported. In case of HD sources, OP47 packets are
                  decoded.

                  This option is a bitmask of the SD PAL VBI lines
                  captured, specifically lines 6 to 22, and lines 318 to
                  335. Line 6 is the LSB in the mask. Selected lines
                  which do not contain teletext information will be
                  ignored. You can use the special ``all`` constant to
                  select all possible lines, or ``standard`` to skip
                  lines 6, 318 and 319, which are not compatible with
                  all receivers.

                  For SD sources, ffmpeg needs to be compiled with
                  ``--enable-libzvbi``. For HD sources, on older
                  (pre-4K) DeckLink card models you have to capture in
                  10 bit mode.

               ``channels``
                  Defines number of audio channels to capture. Must be
                  ‘\ ``2``\ ’, ‘\ ``8``\ ’ or ‘\ ``16``\ ’. Defaults to
                  ‘\ ``2``\ ’.

               ``duplex_mode``
                  Sets the decklink device duplex/profile mode. Must be
                  ‘\ ``unset``\ ’, ‘\ ``half``\ ’, ‘\ ``full``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``one_sub_device_full``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``one_sub_device_half``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``two_sub_device_full``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``four_sub_device_half``\ ’ Defaults to
                  ‘\ ``unset``\ ’.

                  Note: DeckLink SDK 11.0 have replaced the duplex
                  property by a profile property. For the DeckLink Duo 2
                  and DeckLink Quad 2, a profile is shared between any 2
                  sub-devices that utilize the same connectors. For the
                  DeckLink 8K Pro, a profile is shared between all 4
                  sub-devices. So DeckLink 8K Pro support four profiles.

                  Valid profile modes for DeckLink 8K Pro(with DeckLink
                  SDK >= 11.0): ‘\ ``one_sub_device_full``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``one_sub_device_half``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``two_sub_device_full``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``four_sub_device_half``\ ’

                  Valid profile modes for DeckLink Quad 2 and DeckLink
                  Duo 2: ‘\ ``half``\ ’, ‘\ ``full``\ ’

               ``timecode_format``
                  Timecode type to include in the frame and video stream
                  metadata. Must be ‘\ ``none``\ ’, ‘\ ``rp188vitc``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``rp188vitc2``\ ’, ‘\ ``rp188ltc``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``rp188hfr``\ ’, ‘\ ``rp188any``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``vitc``\ ’, ‘\ ``vitc2``\ ’, or ‘\ ``serial``\ ’.
                  Defaults to ‘\ ``none``\ ’ (not included).

                  In order to properly support 50/60 fps timecodes, the
                  ordering of the queried timecode types for
                  ‘\ ``rp188any``\ ’ is HFR, VITC1, VITC2 and LTC for
                  >30 fps content. Note that this is slightly different
                  to the ordering used by the DeckLink API, which is
                  HFR, VITC1, LTC, VITC2.

               ``video_input``
                  Sets the video input source. Must be ‘\ ``unset``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``sdi``\ ’, ‘\ ``hdmi``\ ’, ‘\ ``optical_sdi``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``component``\ ’, ‘\ ``composite``\ ’ or
                  ‘\ ``s_video``\ ’. Defaults to ‘\ ``unset``\ ’.

               ``audio_input``
                  Sets the audio input source. Must be ‘\ ``unset``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``embedded``\ ’, ‘\ ``aes_ebu``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``analog``\ ’, ‘\ ``analog_xlr``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``analog_rca``\ ’ or ‘\ ``microphone``\ ’. Defaults
                  to ‘\ ``unset``\ ’.

               ``video_pts``
                  Sets the video packet timestamp source. Must be
                  ‘\ ``video``\ ’, ‘\ ``audio``\ ’, ‘\ ``reference``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``wallclock``\ ’ or ‘\ ``abs_wallclock``\ ’.
                  Defaults to ‘\ ``video``\ ’.

               ``audio_pts``
                  Sets the audio packet timestamp source. Must be
                  ‘\ ``video``\ ’, ‘\ ``audio``\ ’, ‘\ ``reference``\ ’,
                  ‘\ ``wallclock``\ ’ or ‘\ ``abs_wallclock``\ ’.
                  Defaults to ‘\ ``audio``\ ’.

               ``draw_bars``
                  If set to ‘\ ``true``\ ’, color bars are drawn in the
                  event of a signal loss. Defaults to ‘\ ``true``\ ’.

               ``queue_size``
                  Sets maximum input buffer size in bytes. If the
                  buffering reaches this value, incoming frames will be
                  dropped. Defaults to ‘\ ``1073741824``\ ’.

               ``audio_depth``
                  Sets the audio sample bit depth. Must be ‘\ ``16``\ ’
                  or ‘\ ``32``\ ’. Defaults to ‘\ ``16``\ ’.

               ``decklink_copyts``
                  If set to ``true``, timestamps are forwarded as they
                  are without removing the initial offset. Defaults to
                  ``false``.

               ``timestamp_align``
                  Capture start time alignment in seconds. If set to
                  nonzero, input frames are dropped till the system
                  timestamp aligns with configured value. Alignment
                  difference of up to one frame duration is tolerated.
                  This is useful for maintaining input synchronization
                  across N different hardware devices deployed for
                  ’N-way’ redundancy. The system time of different
                  hardware devices should be synchronized with protocols
                  such as NTP or PTP, before using this option. Note
                  that this method is not foolproof. In some border
                  cases input synchronization may not happen due to
                  thread scheduling jitters in the OS. Either sync could
                  go wrong by 1 frame or in a rarer case
                  ``timestamp_align`` seconds. Defaults to ‘\ ``0``\ ’.

               ``wait_for_tc (``\ *``bool``*\ ``)``
                  Drop frames till a frame with timecode is received.
                  Sometimes serial timecode isn’t received with the
                  first input frame. If that happens, the stored stream
                  timecode will be inaccurate. If this option is set to
                  ``true``, input frames are dropped till a frame with
                  timecode is received. Option ``timecode_format`` must
                  be specified. Defaults to ``false``.

               ``enable_klv(``\ *``bool``*\ ``)``
                  If set to ``true``, extracts KLV data from VANC and
                  outputs KLV packets. KLV VANC packets are joined based
                  on MID and PSC fields and aggregated into one KLV
                  packet. Defaults to ``false``.

            Windows DirectShow input device.

            DirectShow support is enabled when FFmpeg is built with the
            mingw-w64 project. Currently only audio and video devices
            are supported.

            Multiple devices may be opened as separate inputs, but they
            may also be opened on the same input, which should improve
            synchronism between them.

            The input name should be in the format:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  TYPE=NAME[:TYPE=NAME]

            where ``TYPE`` can be either ``audio`` or ``video``, and
            ``NAME`` is the device’s name or alternative name..

               If no options are specified, the device’s defaults are
               used. If the device does not support the requested
               options, it will fail to open.

               ``video_size``
                  Set the video size in the captured video.

               ``framerate``
                  Set the frame rate in the captured video.

               ``sample_rate``
                  Set the sample rate (in Hz) of the captured audio.

               ``sample_size``
                  Set the sample size (in bits) of the captured audio.

               ``channels``
                  Set the number of channels in the captured audio.

               ``list_devices``
                  If set to ``true``, print a list of devices and exit.

               ``list_options``
                  If set to ``true``, print a list of selected device’s
                  options and exit.

               ``video_device_number``
                  Set video device number for devices with the same name
                  (starts at 0, defaults to 0).

               ``audio_device_number``
                  Set audio device number for devices with the same name
                  (starts at 0, defaults to 0).

               ``pixel_format``
                  Select pixel format to be used by DirectShow. This may
                  only be set when the video codec is not set or set to
                  rawvideo.

               ``audio_buffer_size``
                  Set audio device buffer size in milliseconds (which
                  can directly impact latency, depending on the device).
                  Defaults to using the audio device’s default buffer
                  size (typically some multiple of 500ms). Setting this
                  value too low can degrade performance. See also
                  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd377582(v=vs.85).aspx

               ``video_pin_name``
                  Select video capture pin to use by name or alternative
                  name.

               ``audio_pin_name``
                  Select audio capture pin to use by name or alternative
                  name.

               ``crossbar_video_input_pin_number``
                  Select video input pin number for crossbar device.
                  This will be routed to the crossbar device’s Video
                  Decoder output pin. Note that changing this value can
                  affect future invocations (sets a new default) until
                  system reboot occurs.

               ``crossbar_audio_input_pin_number``
                  Select audio input pin number for crossbar device.
                  This will be routed to the crossbar device’s Audio
                  Decoder output pin. Note that changing this value can
                  affect future invocations (sets a new default) until
                  system reboot occurs.

               ``show_video_device_dialog``
                  If set to ``true``, before capture starts, popup a
                  display dialog to the end user, allowing them to
                  change video filter properties and configurations
                  manually. Note that for crossbar devices, adjusting
                  values in this dialog may be needed at times to toggle
                  between PAL (25 fps) and NTSC (29.97) input frame
                  rates, sizes, interlacing, etc. Changing these values
                  can enable different scan rates/frame rates and
                  avoiding green bars at the bottom, flickering scan
                  lines, etc. Note that with some devices, changing
                  these properties can also affect future invocations
                  (sets new defaults) until system reboot occurs.

               ``show_audio_device_dialog``
                  If set to ``true``, before capture starts, popup a
                  display dialog to the end user, allowing them to
                  change audio filter properties and configurations
                  manually.

               ``show_video_crossbar_connection_dialog``
                  If set to ``true``, before capture starts, popup a
                  display dialog to the end user, allowing them to
                  manually modify crossbar pin routings, when it opens a
                  video device.

               ``show_audio_crossbar_connection_dialog``
                  If set to ``true``, before capture starts, popup a
                  display dialog to the end user, allowing them to
                  manually modify crossbar pin routings, when it opens
                  an audio device.

               ``show_analog_tv_tuner_dialog``
                  If set to ``true``, before capture starts, popup a
                  display dialog to the end user, allowing them to
                  manually modify TV channels and frequencies.

               ``show_analog_tv_tuner_audio_dialog``
                  If set to ``true``, before capture starts, popup a
                  display dialog to the end user, allowing them to
                  manually modify TV audio (like mono vs. stereo,
                  Language A,B or C).

               ``audio_device_load``
                  Load an audio capture filter device from file instead
                  of searching it by name. It may load additional
                  parameters too, if the filter supports the
                  serialization of its properties to. To use this an

                  be anything even fake one.

               ``audio_device_save``
                  Save the currently used audio capture filter device
                  and its parameters (if the filter supports it) to a
                  file. If a file with the same name exists it will be
                  overwritten.

               ``video_device_load``
                  Load a video capture filter device from file instead
                  of searching it by name. It may load additional
                  parameters too, if the filter supports the
                  serialization of its properties to. To use this a
                  video capture source has to be specified, but it can
                  be anything even fake one.

               ``video_device_save``
                  Save the currently used video capture filter device
                  and its parameters (if the filter supports it) to a
                  file. If a file with the same name exists it will be
                  overwritten.

               ``use_video_device_timestamps``
                  If set to ``false``, the timestamp for video frames
                  will be derived from the wallclock instead of the
                  timestamp provided by the capture device. This allows
                  working around devices that provide unreliable
                  timestamps.

            Linux framebuffer input device.

            The Linux framebuffer is a graphic hardware-independent
            abstraction layer to show graphics on a computer monitor,
            typically on the console. It is accessed through a file
            device node, usually ``/dev/fb0``.

            For more detailed information read the file
            Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt included in the Linux
            source tree.

            See also http://linux-fbdev.sourceforge.net/, and fbset(1).

            To record from the framebuffer device ``/dev/fb0`` with
            ``ffmpeg``:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -f fbdev -framerate 10 -i /dev/fb0 out.avi

            You can take a single screenshot image with the command:

            Win32 GDI-based screen capture device.

            This device allows you to capture a region of the display on
            Windows.

            There are two options for the input filename:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  desktop

            or

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  title=window_title

            The first option will capture the entire desktop, or a fixed
            region of the desktop. The second option will instead
            capture the contents of a single window, regardless of its
            position on the screen.

            For example, to grab the entire desktop using ``ffmpeg``:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -i desktop out.mpg

            Grab a 640x480 region at position ``10,20``:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -offset_x 10 -offset_y 20 -video_size vga -i desktop out.mpg

            Grab the contents of the window named "Calculator"

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -i title=Calculator out.mpg

               ``draw_mouse``
                  Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. Use the
                  value ``0`` to not draw the pointer. Default value is
                  ``1``.

               ``framerate``
                  Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is
                  ``ntsc``, corresponding to a frame rate of
                  ``30000/1001``.

               ``show_region``
                  Show grabbed region on screen.

                  If ``show_region`` is specified with ``1``, then the
                  grabbing region will be indicated on screen. With this
                  option, it is easy to know what is being grabbed if
                  only a portion of the screen is grabbed.

                  Note that ``show_region`` is incompatible with
                  grabbing the contents of a single window.

                  For example:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        ffmpeg -f gdigrab -show_region 1 -framerate 6 -video_size cif -offset_x 10 -offset_y 20 -i desktop out.mpg

               ``video_size``
                  Set the video frame size. The default is to capture
                  the full screen if ``desktop`` is selected, or the
                  full window size if ``title=``\ ``window_title`` is
                  selected.

               ``offset_x``
                  When capturing a region with ``video_size``, set the
                  distance from the left edge of the screen or desktop.

                  Note that the offset calculation is from the top left
                  corner of the primary monitor on Windows. If you have
                  a monitor positioned to the left of your primary
                  monitor, you will need to use a negative ``offset_x``
                  value to move the region to that monitor.

               ``offset_y``
                  When capturing a region with ``video_size``, set the
                  distance from the top edge of the screen or desktop.

                  Note that the offset calculation is from the top left
                  corner of the primary monitor on Windows. If you have
                  a monitor positioned above your primary monitor, you
                  will need to use a negative ``offset_y`` value to move
                  the region to that monitor.

            FireWire DV/HDV input device using libiec61883.

            To enable this input device, you need libiec61883,
            libraw1394 and libavc1394 installed on your system. Use the
            configure option ``--enable-libiec61883`` to compile with
            the device enabled.

            The iec61883 capture device supports capturing from a video
            device connected via IEEE1394 (FireWire), using libiec61883
            and the new Linux FireWire stack (juju). This is the default
            DV/HDV input method in Linux Kernel 2.6.37 and later, since
            the old FireWire stack was removed.

            Specify the FireWire port to be used as input file, or
            "auto" to choose the first port connected.

                  used if auto detection does not work, or if usage of a
                  different device type should be prohibited. Treating a
                  DV device as HDV (or vice versa) will not work and
                  result in undefined behavior. The values ``auto``,
                  ``dv`` and ``hdv`` are supported.

               ``dvbuffer``
                  Set maximum size of buffer for incoming data, in
                  frames. For DV, this is an exact value. For HDV, it is
                  not frame exact, since HDV does not have a fixed frame
                  size.

               ``dvguid``
                  Select the capture device by specifying its GUID.
                  Capturing will only be performed from the specified
                  device and fails if no device with the given GUID is
                  found. This is useful to select the input if multiple
                  devices are connected at the same time. Look at
                  /sys/bus/firewire/devices to find out the GUIDs.

            JACK input device.

            To enable this input device during configuration you need
            libjack installed on your system.

            A JACK input device creates one or more JACK writable
            clients, one for each audio channel, with name
            ``client_name``:input\_\ ``N``, where ``client_name`` is the
            name provided by the application, and ``N`` is a number
            which identifies the channel. Each writable client will send
            the acquired data to the FFmpeg input device.

            Once you have created one or more JACK readable clients, you
            need to connect them to one or more JACK writable clients.

            To connect or disconnect JACK clients you can use the
            ``jack_connect`` and ``jack_disconnect`` programs, or do it
            through a graphical interface, for example with
            ``qjackctl``.

            To list the JACK clients and their properties you can invoke
            the command ``jack_lsp``.

            Follows an example which shows how to capture a JACK
            readable client with ``ffmpeg``.

            Requires either DRM master or CAP_SYS_ADMIN to run.

            If you don’t understand what all of that means, you probably
            don’t want this. Look at ``x11grab`` instead.

               ``device``
                  DRM device to capture on. Defaults to
                  ``/dev/dri/card0``.

               ``format``
                  Pixel format of the framebuffer. This can be
                  autodetected if you are running Linux 5.7 or later,
                  but needs to be provided for earlier versions.
                  Defaults to ``bgr0``, which is the most common format
                  used by the Linux console and Xorg X server.

               ``format_modifier``
                  Format modifier to signal on output frames. This is
                  necessary to import correctly into some APIs. It can
                  be autodetected if you are running Linux 5.7 or later,
                  but will need to be provided explicitly when needed in
                  earlier versions. See the libdrm documentation for
                  possible values.

               ``crtc_id``
                  KMS CRTC ID to define the capture source. The first
                  active plane on the given CRTC will be used.

               ``plane_id``
                  KMS plane ID to define the capture source. Defaults to
                  the first active plane found if neither ``crtc_id``
                  nor ``plane_id`` are specified.

               ``framerate``
                  Framerate to capture at. This is not synchronised to
                  any page flipping or framebuffer changes - it just
                  defines the interval at which the framebuffer is
                  sampled. Sampling faster than the framebuffer update
                  rate will generate independent frames with the same
                  content. Defaults to ``30``.

               -  Capture from the first active plane, download the
                  result to normal frames and encode. This will only
                  work if the framebuffer is both linear and mappable -

               -  To capture only part of a plane the output can be
                  cropped - this can be used to capture a single window,
                  as long as it has a known absolute position and size.

            Libavfilter input virtual device.

            This input device reads data from the open output pads of a
            libavfilter filtergraph.

            For each filtergraph open output, the input device will
            create a corresponding stream which is mapped to the
            generated output. The filtergraph is specified through the
            option ``graph``.

                  :class: subsection

               ``graph``
                  Specify the filtergraph to use as input. Each video
                  open output must be labelled by a unique string of the
                  form "out\ ``N``", where ``N`` is a number starting
                  from 0 corresponding to the mapped input stream
                  generated by the device. The first unlabelled output
                  is automatically assigned to the "out0" label, but all
                  the others need to be specified explicitly.

                  The suffix "+subcc" can be appended to the output
                  label to create an extra stream with the closed
                  captions packets attached to that output
                  (experimental; only for EIA-608 / CEA-708 for now).
                  The subcc streams are created after all the normal
                  streams, in the order of the corresponding stream. For
                  example, if there is "out19+subcc", "out7+subcc" and
                  up to "out42", the stream #43 is subcc for stream #7
                  and stream #44 is subcc for stream #19.

                  If not specified defaults to the filename specified
                  for the input device.

               ``graph_file``
                  Set the filename of the filtergraph to be read and
                  sent to the other filters. Syntax of the filtergraph
                  is the same as the one specified by the option
                  ``graph``.

               ``dumpgraph``
                  Dump graph to stderr.

            The OpenAL input device provides audio capture on all
            systems with a working OpenAL 1.1 implementation.

            To enable this input device during configuration, you need
            OpenAL headers and libraries installed on your system, and
            need to configure FFmpeg with ``--enable-openal``.

            OpenAL headers and libraries should be provided as part of
            your OpenAL implementation, or as an additional download (an
            SDK). Depending on your installation you may need to specify
            additional flags via the ``--extra-cflags`` and
            ``--extra-ldflags`` for allowing the build system to locate
            the OpenAL headers and libraries.

            An incomplete list of OpenAL implementations follows:

            **Creative**
               The official Windows implementation, providing hardware
               acceleration with supported devices and software
               fallback. See http://openal.org/.

            **OpenAL Soft**
               Portable, open source (LGPL) software implementation.
               Includes backends for the most common sound APIs on the
               Windows, Linux, Solaris, and BSD operating systems. See
               http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html.

            **Apple**
               OpenAL is part of Core Audio, the official Mac OS X Audio
               interface. See
               http://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/audio-and-video.html

            This device allows one to capture from an audio input device
            handled through OpenAL.

            You need to specify the name of the device to capture in the
            provided filename. If the empty string is provided, the
            device will automatically select the default device. You can
            get the list of the supported devices by using the option
            ``list_devices``.

                  Set the sample size (in bits) of the captured audio.
                  Only the values ``8`` and ``16`` are currently

               :name: video4linux2-v4l2
               :class: section

            Video4Linux2 input video device.

            "v4l2" can be used as alias for "video4linux2".

            If FFmpeg is built with v4l-utils support (by using the
            ``--enable-libv4l2`` configure option), it is possible to
            use it with the ``-use_libv4l2`` input device option.

            The name of the device to grab is a file device node,
            usually Linux systems tend to automatically create such
            nodes when the device (e.g. an USB webcam) is plugged into
            the system, and has a name of the kind
            ``/dev/video``\ ``N``, where ``N`` is a number associated to
            the device.

            Video4Linux2 devices usually support a limited set of
            ``width``\ x\ ``height`` sizes and frame rates. You can
            check which are supported using ``-list_formats all`` for
            Video4Linux2 devices. Some devices, like TV cards, support
            one or more standards. It is possible to list all the
            supported standards using ``-list_standards all``.

            The time base for the timestamps is 1 microsecond. Depending
            on the kernel version and configuration, the timestamps may
            be derived from the real time clock (origin at the Unix
            Epoch) or the monotonic clock (origin usually at boot time,
            unaffected by NTP or manual changes to the clock). The
            ``-timestamps abs`` or ``-ts abs`` option can be used to
            force conversion into the real time clock.

            Some usage examples of the video4linux2 device with
            ``ffmpeg`` and ``ffplay``:

            -  List supported formats for a video4linux2 device:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     ffplay -f video4linux2 -list_formats all /dev/video0

            -  Grab and show the input of a video4linux2 device:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     ffplay -f video4linux2 -framerate 30 -video_size hd720 /dev/video0

            -  Grab and record the input of a video4linux2 device, leave
               the frame rate and size as previously set:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -input_format mjpeg -i /dev/video0 out.mpeg

            X11 video input device.

            To enable this input device during configuration you need
            libxcb installed on your system. It will be automatically
            detected during configuration.

            This device allows one to capture a region of an X11
            display.

            The filename passed as input has the syntax:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  [hostname]:display_number.screen_number[+x_offset,y_offset]

            ``hostname``:``display_number``.\ ``screen_number``
            specifies the X11 display name of the screen to grab from.
            ``hostname`` can be omitted, and defaults to "localhost".
            The environment variable ``DISPLAY`` contains the default
            display name.

            ``x_offset`` and ``y_offset`` specify the offsets of the
            grabbed area with respect to the top-left border of the X11
            screen. They default to 0.

            Check the X11 documentation (e.g. ``man X``) for more
            detailed information.

            Use the ``xdpyinfo`` program for getting basic information
            about the properties of your X11 display (e.g. grep for
            "name" or "dimensions").

            For example to grab from ``:0.0`` using ``ffmpeg``:

               ``select_region``
                  Specify whether to select the grabbing area
                  graphically using the pointer. A value of ``1``
                  prompts the user to select the grabbing area
                  graphically by clicking and dragging. A single click
                  with no dragging will select the whole screen. A
                  region with zero width or height will also select the
                  whole screen. This option overwrites the
                  ``video_size``, ``grab_x``, and ``grab_y`` options.
                  Default value is ``0``.

               ``draw_mouse``
                  Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. A value of
                  ``0`` specifies not to draw the pointer. Default value
                  is ``1``.

               ``follow_mouse``
                  Make the grabbed area follow the mouse. The argument
                  can be ``centered`` or a number of pixels ``PIXELS``.

                  When it is specified with "centered", the grabbing
                  region follows the mouse pointer and keeps the pointer
                  at the center of region; otherwise, the region follows
                  only when the mouse pointer reaches within ``PIXELS``
                  (greater than zero) to the edge of region.

                  For example:

                  100 pixels to edge:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse 100 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

               ``framerate``
                  Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is
                  ``ntsc``, corresponding to a frame rate of
                  ``30000/1001``.

               ``show_region``
                  Show grabbed region on screen.

                  If ``show_region`` is specified with ``1``, then the
                  grabbing region will be indicated on screen. With this
                  option, it is easy to know what is being grabbed if
                  only a portion of the screen is grabbed.

               ``region_border``
                  Set the region border thickness if ``-show_region 1``
                  is used. Range is 1 to 128 and default is 3 (XCB-based
                  x11grab only).

                  For example:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        ffmpeg -f x11grab -show_region 1 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg

                  With ``follow_mouse``:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -show_region 1 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

               ``window_id``
                  Grab this window, instead of the whole screen. Default
                  value is 0, which maps to the whole screen (root
                  window).

                  The id of a window can be found using the ``xwininfo``
                  program, possibly with options -tree and -root.

                  If the window is later enlarged, the new area is not
                  recorded. Video ends when the window is closed,
                  unmapped (i.e., iconified) or shrunk beyond the video
                  size (which defaults to the initial window size).

                  This option disables options ``follow_mouse`` and
                  ``select_region``.

               ``video_size``
                  Set the video frame size. Default is the full desktop
                  or window.

               ``grab_x``
               ``grab_y``
                  Set the grabbing region coordinates. They are
                  expressed as offset from the top left corner of the
                  X11 window and correspond to the ``x_offset`` and
                  ``y_offset`` parameters in the device name. The
                  default value for both options is 0.

         .. rubric:: 19 Resampler Options
            :name: resampler-options
            :class: chapter

         The audio resampler supports the following named options.

         Options may be set by specifying -``option`` ``value`` in the
         FFmpeg tools, ``option``\ =\ ``value`` for the aresample
         filter, by setting the value explicitly in the ``SwrContext``
         options or using the ``libavutil/opt.h`` API for programmatic
         use.

         ``uchl, used_chlayout``
            Set used input channel layout. Default is unset. This option
            is only used for special remapping.

         ``isr, in_sample_rate``
            Set the input sample rate. Default value is 0.

         ``osr, out_sample_rate``
            Set the output sample rate. Default value is 0.

         ``isf, in_sample_fmt``
            Specify the input sample format. It is set by default to
            ``none``.

         ``osf, out_sample_fmt``
            Specify the output sample format. It is set by default to
            ``none``.

         ``tsf, internal_sample_fmt``
            Set the internal sample format. Default value is ``none``.
            This will automatically be chosen when it is not explicitly
            set.

         ``ichl, in_chlayout``
         ``ochl, out_chlayout``
            Set the input/output channel layout.

            See `(ffmpeg-utils)the Channel Layout section in the
            ffmpeg-utils(1)
            manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#channel-layout-syntax>`__ for the
            required syntax.

         ``clev, center_mix_level``
            Set the center mix level. It is a value expressed in
            deciBel, and must be in the interval [-32,32].

         ``slev, surround_mix_level``
            Set the surround mix level. It is a value expressed in
            deciBel, and must be in the interval [-32,32].

         ``lfe_mix_level``
            Set LFE mix into non LFE level. It is used when there is a
            LFE input but no LFE output. It is a value expressed in
            deciBel, and must be in the interval [-32,32].

         ``rmvol, rematrix_volume``
            Set rematrix volume. Default value is 1.0.

         ``rematrix_maxval``
            Set maximum output value for rematrixing. This can be used
            to prevent clipping vs. preventing volume reduction. A value
            of 1.0 prevents clipping.

         ``flags, swr_flags``
            Set flags used by the converter. Default value is 0.

            It supports the following individual flags:

            ``res``
               force resampling, this flag forces resampling to be used
               even when the input and output sample rates match.

         ``dither_scale``
            Set the dither scale. Default value is 1.

         ``dither_method``
            Set dither method. Default value is 0.

            Supported values:

            ‘\ ``rectangular``\ ’
               select rectangular dither

            ‘\ ``triangular``\ ’
               select triangular dither

            ‘\ ``triangular_hp``\ ’
               select triangular dither with high pass

            ‘\ ``lipshitz``\ ’
               select Lipshitz noise shaping dither.

            ‘\ ``shibata``\ ’
               select Shibata noise shaping dither.

            ‘\ ``low_shibata``\ ’
               select low Shibata noise shaping dither.

            ‘\ ``high_shibata``\ ’
               select high Shibata noise shaping dither.

            ‘\ ``f_weighted``\ ’
               select f-weighted noise shaping dither

            ‘\ ``modified_e_weighted``\ ’
               select modified-e-weighted noise shaping dither

            ‘\ ``improved_e_weighted``\ ’
               select improved-e-weighted noise shaping dither

         ``resampler``
            Set resampling engine. Default value is swr.

            Supported values:

            ‘\ ``swr``\ ’
               select the native SW Resampler; filter options precision
               and cheby are not applicable in this case.

            ‘\ ``soxr``\ ’
               select the SoX Resampler (where available); compensation,
               and filter options filter_size, phase_shift,
               exact_rational, filter_type & kaiser_beta, are not
               applicable in this case.

         ``filter_size``
            For swr only, set resampling filter size, default value is
            32.

         ``phase_shift``
            For swr only, set resampling phase shift, default value is
            10, and must be in the interval [0,30].

         ``linear_interp``
            Use linear interpolation when enabled (the default). Disable
            it if you want to preserve speed instead of quality when
            exact_rational fails.

         ``exact_rational``
            For swr only, when enabled, try to use exact phase_count
            based on input and output sample rate. However, if it is
            larger than ``1 << phase_shift``, the phase_count will be
            ``1 << phase_shift`` as fallback. Default is enabled.

         ``cutoff``
            Set cutoff frequency (swr: 6dB point; soxr: 0dB point)
            ratio; must be a float value between 0 and 1. Default value
            is 0.97 with swr, and 0.91 with soxr (which, with a
            sample-rate of 44100, preserves the entire audio band to
            20kHz).

         ``precision``
            For soxr only, the precision in bits to which the resampled
            signal will be calculated. The default value of 20 (which,
            with suitable dithering, is appropriate for a destination
            bit-depth of 16) gives SoX’s ’High Quality’; a value of 28
            gives SoX’s ’Very High Quality’.

         ``cheby``
            For soxr only, selects passband rolloff none (Chebyshev) &
            higher-precision approximation for ’irrational’ ratios.
            Default value is 0.

         ``async``
            For swr only, simple 1 parameter audio sync to timestamps
            using stretching, squeezing, filling and trimming. Setting
            this to 1 will enable filling and trimming, larger values
            represent the maximum amount in samples that the data may be
            stretched or squeezed for each second. Default value is 0,
            thus no compensation is applied to make the samples match
            the audio timestamps.

         ``first_pts``
            For swr only, assume the first pts should be this value. The
            time unit is 1 / sample rate. This allows for
            padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no
            assumption is made about the first frame’s expected pts, so
            no padding or trimming is done. For example, this could be
            set to 0 to pad the beginning with silence if an audio
            stream starts after the video stream or to trim any samples
            with a negative pts due to encoder delay.

         ``min_comp``
            For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps
            and audio data (in seconds) to trigger
            stretching/squeezing/filling or trimming of the data to make
            it match the timestamps. The default is that
            stretching/squeezing/filling and trimming is disabled
            (``min_comp`` = ``FLT_MAX``).

         ``min_hard_comp``
            For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps
            and audio data (in seconds) to trigger adding/dropping
            samples to make it match the timestamps. This option
            effectively is a threshold to select between hard
            (trim/fill) and soft (squeeze/stretch) compensation. Note
            that all compensation is by default disabled through
            ``min_comp``. The default is 0.1.

         ``comp_duration``
            For swr only, set duration (in seconds) over which data is
            stretched/squeezed to make it match the timestamps. Must be
            a non-negative double float value, default value is 1.0.

         ``max_soft_comp``
            For swr only, set maximum factor by which data is
            stretched/squeezed to make it match the timestamps. Must be
            a non-negative double float value, default value is 0.

         ``matrix_encoding``
            Select matrixed stereo encoding.

            It accepts the following values:

            ‘\ ``none``\ ’
               select none

            ‘\ ``dolby``\ ’
               select Dolby

            ‘\ ``dplii``\ ’
               select Dolby Pro Logic II

            Default value is ``none``.

         ``filter_type``
            For swr only, select resampling filter type. This only
            affects resampling operations.

            It accepts the following values:

            ‘\ ``cubic``\ ’
               select cubic

            ‘\ ``blackman_nuttall``\ ’
               select Blackman Nuttall windowed sinc

            ‘\ ``kaiser``\ ’
               select Kaiser windowed sinc

         ``kaiser_beta``
            For swr only, set Kaiser window beta value. Must be a double
            float value in the interval [2,16], default value is 9.

         ``output_sample_bits``
            For swr only, set number of used output sample bits for
            dithering. Must be an integer in the interval [0,64],
            default value is 0, which means it’s not used.

         Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.

         In libavfilter, a filter can have multiple inputs and multiple
         outputs. To illustrate the sorts of things that are possible,
         we consider the following filtergraph.

         .. code:: verbatim

                            [main]
            input --> split ---------------------> overlay --> output
                        |                             ^
                        |[tmp]                  [flip]|
                        +-----> crop --> vflip -------+

         This filtergraph splits the input stream in two streams, then
         sends one stream through the crop filter and the vflip filter,
         before merging it back with the other stream by overlaying it
         on top. You can use the following command to achieve this:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] crop=iw:ih/2:0:0, vflip [flip]; [main][flip] overlay=0:H/2" OUTPUT

         The result will be that the top half of the video is mirrored
         onto the bottom half of the output video.

         Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas, and
         distinct linear chains of filters are separated by semicolons.
         In our example, ``crop,vflip`` are in one linear chain,
         ``split`` and ``overlay`` are separately in another. The points
         where the linear chains join are labelled by names enclosed in
         square brackets. In the example, the split filter generates two
         outputs that are associated to the labels ``[main]`` and
         ``[tmp]``.

         The stream sent to the second output of ``split``, labelled as
         ``[tmp]``, is processed through the ``crop`` filter, which
         crops away the lower half part of the video, and then
         vertically flipped. The ``overlay`` filter takes in input the
         first unchanged output of the split filter (which was labelled
         as ``[main]``), and overlay on its lower half the output
         generated by the ``crop,vflip`` filterchain.

         Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are
         specified after the filter name and an equal sign, and are
         separated from each other by a colon.

         There exist so-called ``source filters`` that do not have an
         audio/video input, and ``sink filters`` that will not have
         audio/video output.

         :name: graph2dot

         .. rubric:: 22 graph2dot
            :class: chapter

         The ``graph2dot`` program included in the FFmpeg ``tools``
         directory can be used to parse a filtergraph description and
         issue a corresponding textual representation in the dot
         language.

         Invoke the command:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               graph2dot -h

         to see how to use ``graph2dot``.

         You can then pass the dot description to the ``dot`` program
         (from the graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical
         representation of the filtergraph.

         For example the sequence of commands:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               echo GRAPH_DESCRIPTION | \
               tools/graph2dot -o graph.tmp && \
               dot -Tpng graph.tmp -o graph.png && \
               display graph.png

         can be used to create and display an image representing the
         graph described by the ``GRAPH_DESCRIPTION`` string. Note that
         this string must be a complete self-contained graph, with its
         inputs and outputs explicitly defined. For example if your
         command line is of the form:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               ffmpeg -i infile -vf scale=640:360 outfile

         your ``GRAPH_DESCRIPTION`` string will need to be of the form:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink

         you may also need to set the ``nullsrc`` parameters and add a
         ``format`` filter in order to simulate a specific input file.

         A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can
         contain cycles, and there can be multiple links between a pair
         of filters. Each link has one input pad on one side connecting
         it to one filter from which it takes its input, and one output
         pad on the other side connecting it to one filter accepting its
         output.

         Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class
         registered in the application, which defines the features and
         the number of input and output pads of the filter.

         A filter with no input pads is called a "source", and a filter
         with no output pads is called a "sink".

            A filtergraph has a textual representation, which is
            recognized by the ``-filter``/``-vf``/``-af`` and
            ``-filter_complex`` options in ``ffmpeg`` and
            ``-vf``/``-af`` in ``ffplay``, and by the
            ``avfilter_graph_parse_ptr()`` function defined in
            ``libavfilter/avfilter.h``.

            A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters,
            each one connected to the previous one in the sequence. A
            filterchain is represented by a list of ","-separated filter
            descriptions.

            A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A
            sequence of filterchains is represented by a list of
            ";"-separated filterchain descriptions.

            A filter is represented by a string of the form:
            [``in_link_1``]...[``in_link_N``]\ ``filter_name``\ @\ ``id``\ =\ ``arguments``\ [``out_link_1``]...[``out_link_M``]

            ``filter_name`` is the name of the filter class of which the
            described filter is an instance of, and has to be the name
            of one of the filter classes registered in the program
            optionally followed by "@\ ``id``". The name of the filter
            class is optionally followed by a string "=\ ``arguments``".

            ``arguments`` is a string which contains the parameters used
            to initialize the filter instance. It may have one of two
            forms:

            -  A ’:’-separated list of ``key=value`` pairs.
            -  A ’:’-separated list of ``value``. In this case, the keys
               are assumed to be the option names in the order they are
               declared. E.g. the ``fade`` filter declares three options
               in this order – ``type``, ``start_frame`` and
               ``nb_frames``. Then the parameter list ``in:0:30`` means
               that the value ``in`` is assigned to the option ``type``,
               ``0`` to ``start_frame`` and ``30`` to ``nb_frames``.
            -  A ’:’-separated list of mixed direct ``value`` and long
               ``key=value`` pairs. The direct ``value`` must precede
               the ``key=value`` pairs, and follow the same constraints
               order of the previous point. The following ``key=value``
               pairs can be set in any preferred order.

            If the option value itself is a list of items (e.g. the
            ``format`` filter takes a list of pixel formats), the items
            in the list are usually separated by ‘\ ``|``\ ’.

            The list of arguments can be quoted using the character
            ‘\ ``'``\ ’ as initial and ending mark, and the character
            ‘\ ``\``\ ’ for escaping the characters within the quoted
            text; otherwise the argument string is considered terminated
            when the next special character (belonging to the set
            ‘\ ``[]=;,``\ ’) is encountered.

            A special syntax implemented in the ``ffmpeg`` CLI tool
            allows loading option values from files. This is done be
            prepending a slash ’/’ to the option name, then the supplied
            value is interpreted as a path from which the actual value
            is loaded. E.g.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -i <INPUT> -vf drawtext=/text=/tmp/some_text <OUTPUT>

            will load the text to be drawn from ``/tmp/some_text``. API
            users wishing to implement a similar feature should use the
            ``avfilter_graph_segment_*()`` functions together with
            custom IO code.

            The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded
            and followed by a list of link labels. A link label allows
            one to name a link and associate it to a filter output or
            input pad. The preceding labels ``in_link_1`` ...
            ``in_link_N``, are associated to the filter input pads, the
            following labels ``out_link_1`` ... ``out_link_M``, are
            associated to the output pads.

            When two link labels with the same name are found in the
            filtergraph, a link between the corresponding input and
            output pad is created.

            If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to
            the first unlabelled input pad of the next filter in the
            filterchain. For example in the filterchain

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink

            the split filter instance has two output pads, and the
            overlay filter instance two input pads. The first output pad
            of split is labelled "L1", the first input pad of overlay is
            labelled "L2", and the second output pad of split is linked
            to the second input pad of overlay, which are both
            unlabelled.

            In a filter description, if the input label of the first
            filter is not specified, "in" is assumed; if the output
            label of the last filter is not specified, "out" is assumed.

            In a complete filterchain all the unlabelled filter input
            and output pads must be connected. A filtergraph is
            considered valid if all the filter input and output pads of
            all the filterchains are connected.

            Leading and trailing whitespaces (space, tabs, or line
            feeds) separating tokens in the filtergraph specification
            are ignored. This means that the filtergraph can be
            expressed using empty lines and spaces to improve
            redability.

            For example, the filtergraph:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  testsrc,split[L1],hflip[L2];[L1][L2] hstack

            can be represented as:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  testsrc,
                  split [L1], hflip [L2];

                  [L1][L2] hstack

            Libavfilter will automatically insert `scale <#scale>`__
            filters where format conversion is required. It is possible
            to specify swscale flags for those automatically inserted
            scalers by prepending ``sws_flags=``\ ``flags``\ ``;`` to
            the filtergraph description.

            Here is a BNF description of the filtergraph syntax:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  NAME             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and '_'
                  FILTER_NAME      ::= NAME["@"NAME]
                  LINKLABEL        ::= "[" NAME "]"
                  LINKLABELS       ::= LINKLABEL [LINKLABELS]
                  FILTER_ARGUMENTS ::= sequence of chars (possibly quoted)
                  FILTER           ::= [LINKLABELS] FILTER_NAME ["=" FILTER_ARGUMENTS] [LINKLABELS]
                  FILTERCHAIN      ::= FILTER [,FILTERCHAIN]
                  FILTERGRAPH      ::= [sws_flags=flags;] FILTERCHAIN [;FILTERGRAPH]

               :name: notes-on-filtergraph-escaping
               :class: section

            Filtergraph description composition entails several levels
            of escaping. See `(ffmpeg-utils)the "Quoting and escaping"
            section in the ffmpeg-utils(1)
            manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#quoting_005fand_005fescaping>`__
            for more information about the employed escaping procedure.

            A first level escaping affects the content of each filter
            option value, which may contain the special character ``:``
            used to separate values, or one of the escaping characters
            ``\'``.

            A second level escaping affects the whole filter
            description, which may contain the escaping characters
            ``\'`` or the special characters ``[],;`` used by the
            filtergraph description.

            Finally, when you specify a filtergraph on a shell
            commandline, you need to perform a third level escaping for
            the shell special characters contained within it.

            For example, consider the following string to be embedded in
            the `drawtext <#drawtext>`__ filter description ``text``
            value:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  this is a 'string': may contain one, or more, special characters

            This string contains the ``'`` special escaping character,
            and the ``:`` special character, so it needs to be escaped
            in this way:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  text=this is a \'string\'\: may contain one, or more, special characters

            A second level of escaping is required when embedding the
            filter description in a filtergraph description, in order to
            escape all the filtergraph special characters. Thus the
            example above becomes:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  drawtext=text=this is a \\\'string\\\'\\: may contain one\, or more\, special characters

            (note that in addition to the ``\'`` escaping special
            characters, also ``,`` needs to be escaped).

            Finally an additional level of escaping is needed when
            writing the filtergraph description in a shell command,
            which depends on the escaping rules of the adopted shell.
            For example, assuming that ``\`` is special and needs to be
            escaped with another ``\``, the previous string will finally
            result in:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  -vf "drawtext=text=this is a \\\\\\'string\\\\\\'\\\\: may contain one\\, or more\\, special characters"

            In order to avoid cumbersome escaping when using a
            commandline tool accepting a filter specification as input,
            it is advisable to avoid direct inclusion of the filter or
            options specification in the shell.

            For example, in case of the `drawtext filter <#drawtext>`__,
            you might prefer to use the ``textfile`` option in place of
            ``text`` to specify the text to render.

            When using the ``ffmpeg`` tool, you might consider to use
            the `(ffmpeg)-filter_script
            option <ffmpeg.html#filter_005fscript-option>`__ or
            `(ffmpeg)-filter_complex_script
            option <ffmpeg.html#filter_005fcomplex_005fscript-option>`__.

            :name: timeline-editing
            :class: chapter

         Some filters support a generic ``enable`` option. For the
         filters supporting timeline editing, this option can be set to
         an expression which is evaluated before sending a frame to the
         filter. If the evaluation is non-zero, the filter will be
         enabled, otherwise the frame will be sent unchanged to the next
         filter in the filtergraph.

         The expression accepts the following values:

         ‘\ ``t``\ ’
            timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp
            is unknown

         ‘\ ``n``\ ’
            sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0

         ‘\ ``pos``\ ’
            the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown;
            deprecated, do not use

         ‘\ ``w``\ ’
         ‘\ ``h``\ ’
            width and height of the input frame if video

         Additionally, these filters support an ``enable`` command that
         can be used to re-define the expression.

         Like any other filtering option, the ``enable`` option follows
         the same rules.

         For example, to enable a blur filter
         (`smartblur <#smartblur>`__) from 10 seconds to 3 minutes, and
         a `curves <#curves>`__ filter starting at 3 seconds:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               smartblur = enable='between(t,10,3*60)',
               curves    = enable='gte(t,3)' : preset=cross_process

         See ``ffmpeg -filters`` to view which filters have timeline
         support.

            :class: chapter

         Some options can be changed during the operation of the filter
         using a command. These options are marked ’T’ on the output of
         ``ffmpeg`` ``-h filter=<name of filter>``. The name of the
         command is the name of the option and the argument is the new
         value.

         Some filters with several inputs support a common set of
         options. These options can only be set by name, not with the
         short notation.

         ``eof_action``
            The action to take when EOF is encountered on the secondary
            input; it accepts one of the following values:

            ``repeat``
               Repeat the last frame (the default).

            ``endall``
               End both streams.

            ``pass``
               Pass the main input through.

         ``shortest``
            If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest
            input terminates. Default value is 0.

         ``repeatlast``
            If set to 1, force the filter to extend the last frame of
            secondary streams until the end of the primary stream. A
            value of 0 disables this behavior. Default value is 1.

         ``ts_sync_mode``
            How strictly to sync streams based on secondary input
            timestamps; it accepts one of the following values:

            ``default``
               Frame from secondary input with the nearest lower or
               equal timestamp to the primary input frame.

            ``nearest``
               Frame from secondary input with the absolute nearest
               timestamp to the primary input frame.

         When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of
         the existing filters using ``--disable-filters``. The configure
         output will show the audio filters included in your build.

            .. rubric:: 27.1 acompressor
               :class: section

            A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a
            signal. Especially modern music is mostly compressed at a
            high ratio to improve the overall loudness. It’s done to get
            the highest attention of a listener, "fatten" the sound and
            bring more "power" to the track. If a signal is compressed
            too much it may sound dull or "dead" afterwards or it may
            start to "pump" (which could be a powerful effect but can
            also destroy a track completely). The right compression is
            the key to reach a professional sound and is the high art of
            mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings it may
            take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of
            effect.

            Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen
            level ``threshold`` and dividing it by the factor set with
            ``ratio``. So if you set the threshold to -12dB and your
            signal reaches -6dB a ratio of 2:1 will result in a signal
            at -9dB. Because an exact manipulation of the signal would
            cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be
            levelled over the time. This is done by setting "Attack" and
            "Release". ``attack`` determines how long the signal has to
            rise above the threshold before any reduction will occur and
            ``release`` sets the time the signal has to fall below the
            threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals
            than the chosen attack time will be left untouched. The
            overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards
            with the ``makeup`` setting. So compressing the peaks of a
            signal about 6dB and raising the makeup to this level
            results in a signal twice as loud than the source. To gain a
            softer entry in the compression the ``knee`` flattens the
            hard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen
            decibels.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``level_in``
               Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625
               and 64.

            ``mode``
               Set mode of compressor operation. Can be ``upward`` or
               ``downward``. Default is ``downward``.

            ``threshold``
               If a signal of stream rises above this level it will
               affect the gain reduction. By default it is 0.125. Range
               is between 0.00097563 and 1.

            ``ratio``
               Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means
               that if the level rose 4dB above the threshold, it will
               be only 2dB above after the reduction. Default is 2.
               Range is between 1 and 20.

            ``attack``
               Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the
               threshold before gain reduction starts. Default is 20.
               Range is between 0.01 and 2000.

            ``release``
               Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the
               threshold before reduction is decreased again. Default is
               250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.

            ``makeup``
               Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after
               processing. Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.

            ``knee``
               Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain
               reduction more softly. Default is 2.82843. Range is
               between 1 and 8.

            ``link``
               Choose if the ``average`` level between all channels of
               input stream or the louder(``maximum``) channel of input
               stream affects the reduction. Default is ``average``.

            ``detection``
               Should the exact signal be taken in case of ``peak`` or
               an RMS one in case of ``rms``. Default is ``rms`` which
               is mostly smoother.

            ``mix``
               How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is
               1. Range is between 0 and 1.

               Specify the number of samples for which the cross fade
               effect has to last. At the end of the cross fade effect
               the first input audio will be completely silent. Default
               is 44100.

            ``duration, d``
               Specify the duration of the cross fade effect. See

            Reduce audio bit resolution.

            This filter is bit crusher with enhanced functionality. A
            bit crusher is used to audibly reduce number of bits an
            audio signal is sampled with. This doesn’t change the bit
            depth at all, it just produces the effect. Material reduced
            in bit depth sounds more harsh and "digital". This filter is
            able to even round to continuous values instead of discrete
            bit depths. Additionally it has a D/C offset which results
            in different crushing of the lower and the upper half of the
            signal. An Anti-Aliasing setting is able to produce "softer"
            crushing sounds.

            Another feature of this filter is the logarithmic mode. This
            setting switches from linear distances between bits to
            logarithmic ones. The result is a much more "natural"
            sounding crusher which doesn’t gate low signals for example.
            The human ear has a logarithmic perception, so this kind of
            crushing is much more pleasant. Logarithmic crushing is also
            able to get anti-aliased.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``level_in``
               Set level in.

            ``level_out``
               Set level out.

            ``bits``
               Set bit reduction.

            ``mix``
               Set mixing amount.

            ``mode``
               Can be linear: ``lin`` or logarithmic: ``log``.

            ``dc``
               Set DC.

            ``aa``
               Set anti-aliasing.

            ``samples``
               Set sample reduction.

            ``lfo``
               Enable LFO. By default disabled.

            ``lforange``
               Set LFO range.

            ``lforate``

            Remove impulsive noise from input audio.

            Samples detected as impulsive noise are replaced by
            interpolated samples using autoregressive modelling.

            ``window, w``
               Set window size, in milliseconds. Allowed range is from
               ``10`` to ``100``. Default value is ``55`` milliseconds.
               This sets size of window which will be processed at once.

            ``overlap, o``
               Set window overlap, in percentage of window size. Allowed
               range is from ``50`` to ``95``. Default value is ``75``
               percent. Setting this to a very high value increases
               impulsive noise removal but makes whole process much
               slower.

            ``arorder, a``
               Set autoregression order, in percentage of window size.
               Allowed range is from ``0`` to ``25``. Default value is
               ``2`` percent. This option also controls quality of
               interpolated samples using neighbour good samples.

            ``threshold, t``
               Set threshold value. Allowed range is from ``1`` to
               ``100``. Default value is ``2``. This controls the
               strength of impulsive noise which is going to be removed.
               The lower value, the more samples will be detected as
               impulsive noise.

            ``burst, b``
               Set burst fusion, in percentage of window size. Allowed
               range is ``0`` to ``10``. Default value is ``2``. If any
               two samples detected as noise are spaced less than this
               value then any sample between those two samples will be
               also detected as noise.

            ``method, m``
               Set overlap method.

               It accepts the following values:

               ``add, a``
                  Select overlap-add method. Even not interpolated
                  samples are slightly changed with this method.

               ``save, s``
                  Select overlap-save method. Not interpolated samples
                  remain unchanged.

            Remove clipped samples from input audio.

            Samples detected as clipped are replaced by interpolated
            samples using autoregressive modelling.

            ``window, w``
               Set window size, in milliseconds. Allowed range is from
               ``10`` to ``100``. Default value is ``55`` milliseconds.
               This sets size of window which will be processed at once.

            ``overlap, o``
               Set window overlap, in percentage of window size. Allowed
               range is from ``50`` to ``95``. Default value is ``75``
               percent.

            ``arorder, a``
               Set autoregression order, in percentage of window size.
               Allowed range is from ``0`` to ``25``. Default value is
               ``8`` percent. This option also controls quality of
               interpolated samples using neighbour good samples.

            ``threshold, t``
               Set threshold value. Allowed range is from ``1`` to
               ``100``. Default value is ``10``. Higher values make clip
               detection less aggressive.

            ``hsize, n``
               Set size of histogram used to detect clips. Allowed range
               is from ``100`` to ``9999``. Default value is ``1000``.
               Higher values make clip detection less aggressive.

            ``method, m``
               Set overlap method.

            Samples in delayed channel are filled with silence.

            The filter accepts the following option:

            ``delays``
               Set list of delays in milliseconds for each channel
               separated by ’\|’. Unused delays will be silently
               ignored. If number of given delays is smaller than number
               of channels all remaining channels will not be delayed.
               If you want to delay exact number of samples, append ’S’
               to number. If you want instead to delay in seconds,
               append ’s’ to number.

            ``all``
               Use last set delay for all remaining channels. By default
               is disabled. This option if enabled changes how option
               ``delays`` is interpreted.

               :class: section

            Apply echoing to the input audio.

            Echoes are reflected sound and can occur naturally amongst
            mountains (and sometimes large buildings) when talking or
            shouting; digital echo effects emulate this behaviour and
            are often used to help fill out the sound of a single
            instrument or vocal. The time difference between the
            original signal and the reflection is the ``delay``, and the
            loudness of the reflected signal is the ``decay``. Multiple
            echoes can have different delays and decays.

            A description of the accepted parameters follows.

            ``in_gain``
               Set input gain of reflected signal. Default is ``0.6``.

            ``out_gain``
               Set output gain of reflected signal. Default is ``0.3``.

            ``delays``
               Set list of time intervals in milliseconds between
               original signal and reflections separated by ’\|’.
               Allowed range for each ``delay`` is ``(0 - 90000.0]``.
               Default is ``1000``.

            ``decays``
               Set list of loudness of reflected signals separated by
               ’\|’. Allowed range for each ``decay`` is ``(0 - 1.0]``.
               Default is ``0.5``.

            Audio emphasis filter creates or restores material directly
            taken from LPs or emphased CDs with different filter curves.
            E.g. to store music on vinyl the signal has to be altered by
            a filter first to even out the disadvantages of this
            recording medium. Once the material is played back the
            inverse filter has to be applied to restore the distortion
            of the frequency response.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``level_in``
               Set input gain.

            ``level_out``
               Set output gain.

            ``mode``
               Set filter mode. For restoring material use
               ``reproduction`` mode, otherwise use ``production`` mode.
               Default is ``reproduction`` mode.

            ``type``
               Set filter type. Selects medium. Can be one of the
               following:

            Modify an audio signal according to the specified
            expressions.

            This filter accepts one or more expressions (one for each
            channel), which are evaluated and used to modify a
            corresponding audio signal.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``exprs``
               Set the ’\|’-separated expressions list for each separate
               channel. If the number of input channels is greater than
               the number of expressions, the last specified expression
               is used for the remaining output channels.

            ``channel_layout, c``
               Set output channel layout. If not specified, the channel
               layout is specified by the number of expressions. If set
               to ‘\ ``same``\ ’, it will use by default the same input
               channel layout.

            Each expression in ``exprs`` can contain the following
            constants and functions:

            ``ch``
               channel number of the current expression

            ``n``
               number of the evaluated sample, starting from 0

            ``s``
               sample rate

            ``t``
               time of the evaluated sample expressed in seconds

            ``nb_in_channels``
            ``nb_out_channels``
               input and output number of channels

            An exciter is used to produce high sound that is not present
            in the original signal. This is done by creating harmonic
            distortions of the signal which are restricted in range and
            added to the original signal. An Exciter raises the upper
            end of an audio signal without simply raising the higher
            frequencies like an equalizer would do to create a more
            "crisp" or "brilliant" sound.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``level_in``
               Set input level prior processing of signal. Allowed range
               is from 0 to 64. Default value is 1.

            ``level_out``
               Set output level after processing of signal. Allowed
               range is from 0 to 64. Default value is 1.

            ``amount``
               Set the amount of harmonics added to original signal.
               Allowed range is from 0 to 64. Default value is 1.

            ``drive``
               Set the amount of newly created harmonics. Allowed range
               is from 0.1 to 10. Default value is 8.5.

            ``blend``
               Set the octave of newly created harmonics. Allowed range
               is from -10 to 10. Default value is 0.

            ``freq``
               Set the lower frequency limit of producing harmonics in
               Hz. Allowed range is from 2000 to 12000 Hz. Default is
               7500 Hz.

            ``ceil``
               Set the upper frequency limit of producing harmonics.
               Allowed range is from 9999 to 20000 Hz. If value is lower
               than 10000 Hz no limit is applied.

            ``listen``
               Mute the original signal and output only added harmonics.
               By default is disabled.

            Apply an arbitrary Finite Impulse Response filter.

            This filter is designed for applying long FIR filters, up to
            60 seconds long.

            It can be used as component for digital crossover filters,
            room equalization, cross talk cancellation, wavefield
            synthesis, auralization, ambiophonics, ambisonics and
            spatialization.

            This filter uses the streams higher than first one as FIR
            coefficients. If the non-first stream holds a single
            channel, it will be used for all input channels in the first
            stream, otherwise the number of channels in the non-first
            stream must be same as the number of channels in the first
            stream.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``dry``
               Set dry gain. This sets input gain.

            ``wet``
               Set wet gain. This sets final output gain.

            ``length``
               Set Impulse Response filter length. Default is 1, which
               means whole IR is processed.

            ``gtype``
               Enable applying gain measured from power of IR.

               Set which approach to use for auto gain measurement.

               ``none``
                  Do not apply any gain.

               ``peak``
                  select peak gain, very conservative approach. This is
                  default value.

               ``dc``
                  select DC gain, limited application.

               ``gn``
                  select gain to noise approach, this is most popular
                  one.

               ``ac``
                  select AC gain.

               ``rms``
                  select RMS gain.

            ``irgain``
               Set gain to be applied to IR coefficients before
               filtering. Allowed range is 0 to 1. This gain is applied
               after any gain applied with ``gtype`` option.

            ``irfmt``
               Set format of IR stream. Can be ``mono`` or ``input``.
               Default is ``input``.

            ``maxir``
               Set max allowed Impulse Response filter duration in
               seconds. Default is 30 seconds. Allowed range is 0.1 to
               60 seconds.

            ``response``
               Show IR frequency response, magnitude(magenta),
               phase(green) and group delay(yellow) in additional video
               stream. By default it is disabled.

            ``channel``
               Set for which IR channel to display frequency response.
               By default is first channel displayed. This option is
               used only when ``response`` is enabled.

            ``size``
               Set video stream size. This option is used only when
               ``response`` is enabled.

            ``rate``
               Set video stream frame rate. This option is used only
               when ``response`` is enabled.

            ``minp``
               Set minimal partition size used for convolution. Default
               is ``8192``. Allowed range is from ``1`` to ``65536``.
               Lower values decreases latency at cost of higher CPU
               usage.

            ``maxp``
               Set maximal partition size used for convolution. Default
               is ``8192``. Allowed range is from ``8`` to ``65536``.
               Lower values may increase CPU usage.

            ``nbirs``
               Set number of input impulse responses streams which will
               be switchable at runtime. Allowed range is from ``1`` to
               ``32``. Default is ``1``.

            ``ir``
               Set IR stream which will be used for convolution,
               starting from ``0``, should always be lower than supplied
               value by ``nbirs`` option. Default is ``0``. This option
               can be changed at runtime via `commands <#commands>`__.

            ``precision``
               Set which precision to use when processing samples.

               ``auto``
                  Auto pick internal sample format depending on other
                  filters.

               ``float``
                  Always use single-floating point precision sample
                  format.

               ``double``
                  Always use double-floating point precision sample
                  format.

               Default value is auto.

            ``irload``
               Set when to load IR stream. Can be ``init`` or
               ``access``. First one load and prepares all IRs on
               initialization, second one once on first access of
               specific IR. Default is ``init``.

            Reduce broadband noise from input samples using Wavelets.

            A description of the accepted options follows.

            ``sigma``
            Set the noise sigma, allowed range is from 0 to 1. Default
            value is 0. This option controls strength of denoising
            applied to input samples. Most useful way to set this option
            is via decibels, eg. -45dB.

            ``levels``
            Set the number of wavelet levels of decomposition. Allowed
            range is from 1 to 12. Default value is 10. Setting this too
            low make denoising performance very poor.

            ``wavet``
            Set wavelet type for decomposition of input frame. They are
            sorted by number of coefficients, from lowest to highest.
            More coefficients means worse filtering speed, but overall
            better quality. Available wavelets are:

            ‘\ ``sym2``\ ’

            ``percent``
            Set percent of full denoising. Allowed range is from 0 to
            100 percent. Default value is 85 percent or partial
            denoising.

            ``profile``
            If enabled, first input frame will be used as noise profile.
            If first frame samples contain non-noise performance will be
            very poor.

            ``adaptive``
            If enabled, input frames are analyzed for presence of noise.
            If noise is detected with high possibility then input frame
            profile will be used for processing following frames, until
            new noise frame is detected.

            ``samples``
            Set size of single frame in number of samples. Allowed range
            is from 512 to 65536. Default frame size is 8192 samples.

            ``softness``
            Set softness applied inside thresholding function. Allowed
            range is from 0 to 10. Default softness is 1.

            A gate is mainly used to reduce lower parts of a signal.
            This kind of signal processing reduces disturbing noise
            between useful signals.

            Gating is done by detecting the volume below a chosen level
            ``threshold`` and dividing it by the factor set with
            ``ratio``. The bottom of the noise floor is set via
            ``range``. Because an exact manipulation of the signal would
            cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be
            levelled over time. This is done by setting ``attack`` and
            ``release``.

            ``attack`` determines how long the signal has to fall below
            the threshold before any reduction will occur and
            ``release`` sets the time the signal has to rise above the
            threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals
            than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.

            ``level_in``
               Set input level before filtering. Default is 1. Allowed
               range is from 0.015625 to 64.

            ``mode``
               Set the mode of operation. Can be ``upward`` or
               ``downward``. Default is ``downward``. If set to
               ``upward`` mode, higher parts of signal will be
               amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction.
               Otherwise, in case of ``downward`` lower parts of signal
               will be reduced.

            ``range``
               Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below
               the threshold. Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from
               0 to 1. Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then
               filter behaves like expander.

            ``threshold``
               If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is
               released. Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.

            ``ratio``
               Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. Default is 2.
               Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.

            ``attack``
               Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the
               threshold before gain reduction stops. Default is 20
               milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.

            ``release``
               Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the
               threshold before the reduction is increased again.
               Default is 250 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01
               to 9000.

            ``makeup``
               Set amount of amplification of signal after processing.
               Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.

            ``knee``
               Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain
               reduction more softly. Default is 2.828427125. Allowed
               range is from 1 to 8.

            ``detection``
               Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or
               an RMS like one. Default is ``rms``. Can be ``peak`` or
               ``rms``.

            ``link``
               Choose if the average level between all channels or the
               louder channel affects the reduction. Default is
               ``average``. Can be ``average`` or ``maximum``.

            The limiter prevents an input signal from rising over a
            desired threshold. This limiter uses lookahead technology to
            prevent your signal from distorting. It means that there is
            a small delay after the signal is processed. Keep in mind
            that the delay it produces is the attack time you set.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``level_in``
               Set input gain. Default is 1.

            ``level_out``
               Set output gain. Default is 1.

            ``limit``
               Don’t let signals above this level pass the limiter.
               Default is 1.

            ``attack``
               The limiter will reach its attenuation level in this
               amount of time in milliseconds. Default is 5
               milliseconds.

            ``release``
               Come back from limiting to attenuation 1.0 in this amount
               of milliseconds. Default is 50 milliseconds.

            ``asc``
               When gain reduction is always needed ASC takes care of
               releasing to an average reduction level rather than
               reaching a reduction of 0 in the release time.

            ``asc_level``
               Select how much the release time is affected by ASC, 0
               means nearly no changes in release time while 1 produces
               higher release times.

            ``level``
               Auto level output signal. Default is enabled. This
               normalizes audio back to 0dB if enabled.

            ``latency``
               Compensate the delay introduced by using the lookahead
               buffer set with attack parameter. Also flush the valid
               audio data in the lookahead buffer when the stream hits
               EOF.

            Depending on picked setting it is recommended to upsample
            input 2x or 4x times with `aresample <#aresample>`__ before
            applying this filter.

            Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel
            stream.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``inputs``
               Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.

            If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and
            therefore compatible, the channel layout of the output will
            be set accordingly and the channels will be reordered as
            necessary. If the channel layouts of the inputs are not
            disjoint, the output will have all the channels of the first
            input then all the channels of the second input, in that
            order, and the channel layout of the output will be the
            default value corresponding to the total number of channels.

            For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (FL+FR+LF) and the
            second input is FC+BL+BR, then the output will be in 5.1,
            with the channels in the following order: a1, a2, b1, a3,
            b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of the first input, b1 is
            the first channel of the second input).

            On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output
            channels will be in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and
            the channel layout will be arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may
            or may not be the expected value.

            All inputs must have the same sample rate, and format.

            If inputs do not have the same duration, the output will
            stop with the shortest.

            Mixes multiple audio inputs into a single output.

            Note that this filter only supports float samples (the
            ``amerge`` and ``pan`` audio filters support many formats).
            If the ``amix`` input has integer samples then
            `aresample <#aresample>`__ will be automatically inserted to
            perform the conversion to float samples.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``inputs``
               The number of inputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.

            ``duration``
               How to determine the end-of-stream.

               ``longest``
                  The duration of the longest input. (default)

               ``shortest``
                  The duration of the shortest input.

               ``first``
                  The duration of the first input.

            ``dropout_transition``
               The transition time, in seconds, for volume
               renormalization when an input stream ends. The default
               value is 2 seconds.

            ``weights``
               Specify weight of each input audio stream as a sequence
               of numbers separated by a space. If fewer weights are
               specified compared to number of inputs, the last weight
               is assigned to the remaining inputs. Default weight for
               each input is 1.

            ``normalize``
               Always scale inputs instead of only doing summation of
               samples. Beware of heavy clipping if inputs are not
               normalized prior or after filtering by this filter if
               this option is disabled. By default is enabled.

            High-order parametric multiband equalizer for each channel.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``params``
               This option string is in format: "c\ ``chn`` f=\ ``cf``
               w=\ ``w`` g=\ ``g`` t=\ ``f`` \| ..." Each equalizer band
               is separated by ’\|’.

               ``chn``
                  Set channel number to which equalization will be
                  applied. If input doesn’t have that channel the entry
                  is ignored.

               ``f``
                  Set central frequency for band. If input doesn’t have
                  that frequency the entry is ignored.

               ``w``
                  Set band width in Hertz.

               ``g``
                  Set band gain in dB.

               ``t``
                  Set filter type for band, optional, can be:

                  ‘\ ``0``\ ’
                     Butterworth, this is default.

                  ‘\ ``1``\ ’
                     Chebyshev type 1.

                  ‘\ ``2``\ ’
                     Chebyshev type 2.

            ``curves``
               With this option activated frequency response of
               anequalizer is displayed in video stream.

            ``size``
               Set video stream size. Only useful if curves option is
               activated.

            ``mgain``
               Set max gain that will be displayed. Only useful if
               curves option is activated. Setting this to a reasonable
               value makes it possible to display gain which is derived
               from neighbour bands which are too close to each other
               and thus produce higher gain when both are activated.

            ``fscale``
               Set frequency scale used to draw frequency response in
               video output. Can be linear or logarithmic. Default is
               logarithmic.

            ``colors``
               Set color for each channel curve which is going to be
               displayed in video stream. This is list of color names
               separated by space or by ’\|’. Unrecognised or missing
               colors will be replaced by white color.

            Reduce broadband noise in audio samples using Non-Local
            Means algorithm.

            Each sample is adjusted by looking for other samples with
            similar contexts. This context similarity is defined by
            comparing their surrounding patches of size ``p``. Patches
            are searched in an area of ``r`` around the sample.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``strength, s``
               Set denoising strength. Allowed range is from 0.00001 to

            Pad the end of an audio stream with silence.

            This can be used together with ``ffmpeg`` ``-shortest`` to
            extend audio streams to the same length as the video stream.

            A description of the accepted options follows.

            ``packet_size``
               Set silence packet size. Default value is 4096.

            ``pad_len``
               Set the number of samples of silence to add to the end.
               After the value is reached, the stream is terminated.
               This option is mutually exclusive with ``whole_len``.

            ``whole_len``
               Set the minimum total number of samples in the output
               audio stream. If the value is longer than the input audio
               length, silence is added to the end, until the value is
               reached. This option is mutually exclusive with
               ``pad_len``.

            ``pad_dur``
               Specify the duration of samples of silence to add. See
               `(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the
               ffmpeg-utils(1)
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax>`__ for
               the accepted syntax. Used only if set to non-negative
               value.

            ``whole_dur``
               Specify the minimum total duration in the output audio
               stream. See `(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in
               the ffmpeg-utils(1)
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax>`__ for
               the accepted syntax. Used only if set to non-negative
               value. If the value is longer than the input audio
               length, silence is added to the end, until the value is
               reached. This option is mutually exclusive with
               ``pad_dur``

            If neither the ``pad_len`` nor the ``whole_len`` nor
            ``pad_dur`` nor ``whole_dur`` option is set, the filter will

            Note that for ffmpeg 4.4 and earlier a zero ``pad_dur`` or
            ``whole_dur`` also caused the filter to add silence
            indefinitely.

               :class: section

            Audio pulsator is something between an autopanner and a
            tremolo. But it can produce funny stereo effects as well.
            Pulsator changes the volume of the left and right channel
            based on a LFO (low frequency oscillator) with different
            waveforms and shifted phases. This filter have the ability
            to define an offset between left and right channel. An
            offset of 0 means that both LFO shapes match each other. The
            left and right channel are altered equally - a conventional
            tremolo. An offset of 50% means that the shape of the right
            channel is exactly shifted in phase (or moved backwards
            about half of the frequency) - pulsator acts as an
            autopanner. At 1 both curves match again. Every setting in
            between moves the phase shift gapless between all stages and
            produces some "bypassing" sounds with sine and triangle
            waveforms. The more you set the offset near 1 (starting from
            the 0.5) the faster the signal passes from the left to the
            right speaker.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``level_in``
               Set input gain. By default it is 1. Range is [0.015625 -
               64].

            ``level_out``
               Set output gain. By default it is 1. Range is [0.015625 -
               64].

            ``mode``
               Set waveform shape the LFO will use. Can be one of: sine,
               triangle, square, sawup or sawdown. Default is sine.

            ``amount``
               Set modulation. Define how much of original signal is
               affected by the LFO.

            ``offset_l``
               Set left channel offset. Default is 0. Allowed range is
               [0 - 1].

            ``offset_r``
               Set right channel offset. Default is 0.5. Allowed range
               is [0 - 1].

            ``width``
               Set pulse width. Default is 1. Allowed range is [0 - 2].

            ``timing``
               Set possible timing mode. Can be one of: bpm, ms or hz.
               Default is hz.

            ``bpm``
               Set bpm. Default is 120. Allowed range is [30 - 300].

            than blend them in. If for any reason this is a concern it
            is always possible to daisy-chain several instances of

            Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous
            subpart of the input.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``start``
               Timestamp (in seconds) of the start of the section to
               keep. I.e. the audio sample with the timestamp ``start``
               will be the first sample in the output.

            ``end``
               Specify time of the first audio sample that will be
               dropped, i.e. the audio sample immediately preceding the
               one with the timestamp ``end`` will be the last sample in
               the output.

            ``start_pts``
               Same as ``start``, except this option sets the start
               timestamp in samples instead of seconds.

            ``end_pts``
               Same as ``end``, except this option sets the end
               timestamp in samples instead of seconds.

            ``duration``
               The maximum duration of the output in seconds.

            ``start_sample``
               The number of the first sample that should be output.

            ``end_sample``
               The number of the first sample that should be dropped.

            ``start``, ``end``, and ``duration`` are expressed as time
            duration specifications; see `(ffmpeg-utils)the Time
            duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1)
            manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax>`__.

            Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and
            the ``duration`` option look at the frame timestamp, while
            the \_sample options simply count the samples that pass
            through the filter. So start/end_pts and start/end_sample
            will give different results when the timestamps are wrong,
            inexact or do not start at zero. Also note that this filter
            does not modify the timestamps. If you wish to have the
            output timestamps start at zero, insert the asetpts filter
            after the atrim filter.

            If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries
            to be greedy and keep all samples that match at least one of
            the specified constraints. To keep only the part that
            matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple atrim
            filters.

            The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is
            possible to set e.g. just the end values to keep everything
            before the specified time.

            Examples:

            -  Drop everything except the second minute of input:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=60:120

            -  Keep only the first 1000 samples:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

            Calculate normalized windowed cross-correlation between two
            input audio streams.

            Resulted samples are always between -1 and 1 inclusive. If
            result is 1 it means two input samples are highly correlated
            in that selected segment. Result 0 means they are not
            correlated at all. If result is -1 it means two input
            samples are out of phase, which means they cancel each
            other.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``size``
               Set size of segment over which cross-correlation is
               calculated. Default is 256. Allowed range is from 2 to
               131072.

            ``algo``
               Set algorithm for cross-correlation. Can be ``slow`` or
               ``fast`` or ``best``. Default is ``best``. Fast algorithm
               assumes mean values over any given segment are always
               zero and thus need much less calculations to make. This
               is generally not true, but is valid for typical audio
               streams.

            ``block_size, b``
            Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this
            value is set to high enough value (higher than impulse
            response length truncated when reaches near zero values)
            filtering will become linear phase otherwise if not big
            enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.

            Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples
            when set to non-zero value.

               ``in_channel``\ ``-``\ ``out_channel`` or ``in_channel``
               form. ``in_channel`` can be either the name of the input
               channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its index in the
               input channel layout. ``out_channel`` is the name of the
               output channel or its index in the output channel layout.
               If ``out_channel`` is not given then it is implicitly an
               index, starting with zero and increasing by one for each
               mapping.

            Add a chorus effect to the audio.

            Can make a single vocal sound like a chorus, but can also be
            applied to instrumentation.

            Chorus resembles an echo effect with a short delay, but
            whereas with echo the delay is constant, with chorus, it is
            varied using using sinusoidal or triangular modulation. The
            modulation depth defines the range the modulated delay is
            played before or after the delay. Hence the delayed sound
            will sound slower or faster, that is the delayed sound tuned
            around the original one, like in a chorus where some vocals
            are slightly off key.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``in_gain``
               Set input gain. Default is 0.4.

            ``out_gain``
               Set output gain. Default is 0.4.

            ``delays``
               Set delays. A typical delay is around 40ms to 60ms.

            ``decays``
               Set decays.

            ``speeds``

            Compress or expand the audio’s dynamic range.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``attacks``
            ``decays``
               A list of times in seconds for each channel over which
               the instantaneous level of the input signal is averaged
               to determine its volume. ``attacks`` refers to increase
               of volume and ``decays`` refers to decrease of volume.
               For most situations, the attack time (response to the
               audio getting louder) should be shorter than the decay
               time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden
               loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for
               attack is 0.3 seconds and a typical value for decay is
               0.8 seconds. If specified number of attacks & decays is
               lower than number of channels, the last set attack/decay
               will be used for all remaining channels.

            ``points``
               A list of points for the transfer function, specified in
               dB relative to the maximum possible signal amplitude.
               Each key points list must be defined using the following
               syntax: ``x0/y0|x1/y1|x2/y2|....`` or
               ``x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ....``

               The input values must be in strictly increasing order but
               the transfer function does not have to be monotonically
               rising. The point ``0/0`` is assumed but may be
               overridden (by ``0/out-dBn``). Typical values for the
               transfer function are ``-70/-70|-60/-20|1/0``.

            ``soft-knee``
               Set the curve radius in dB for all joints. It defaults to
               0.01.

            ``gain``
               Set the additional gain in dB to be applied at all points
               on the transfer function. This allows for easy adjustment
               of the overall gain. It defaults to 0.

            ``volume``
               Set an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each
               channel when filtering starts. This permits the user to
               supply a nominal level initially, so that, for example, a
               very large gain is not applied to initial signal levels
               before the companding has begun to operate. A typical
               value for audio which is initially quiet is -90 dB. It
               defaults to 0.

            ``delay``
               Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed
               immediately, but audio is delayed before being fed to the
               volume adjuster. Specifying a delay approximately equal
               to the attack/decay times allows the filter to
               effectively operate in predictive rather than reactive
               mode. It defaults to 0.

               :class: section

            Compensation Delay Line is a metric based delay to
            compensate differing positions of microphones or speakers.

            For example, you have recorded guitar with two microphones
            placed in different locations. Because the front of sound
            wave has fixed speed in normal conditions, the phasing of
            microphones can vary and depends on their location and
            interposition. The best sound mix can be achieved when these
            microphones are in phase (synchronized). Note that a
            distance of ~30 cm between microphones makes one microphone
            capture the signal in antiphase to the other microphone.
            That makes the final mix sound moody. This filter helps to
            solve phasing problems by adding different delays to each
            microphone track and make them synchronized.

            The best result can be reached when you take one track as
            base and synchronize other tracks one by one with it.
            Remember that synchronization/delay tolerance depends on
            sample rate, too. Higher sample rates will give more
            tolerance.

            The filter accepts the following parameters:

            ``mm``
               Set millimeters distance. This is compensation distance
               for fine tuning. Default is 0.

            ``cm``
               Set cm distance. This is compensation distance for
               tightening distance setup. Default is 0.

            ``m``
               Set meters distance. This is compensation distance for
               hard distance setup. Default is 0.

            ``dry``
               Set dry amount. Amount of unprocessed (dry) signal.
               Default is 0.

            ``wet``
               Set wet amount. Amount of processed (wet) signal. Default
               is 1.

            ``temp``
               Set temperature in degrees Celsius. This is the
               temperature of the environment. Default is 20.

            Apply headphone crossfeed filter.

            Crossfeed is the process of blending the left and right
            channels of stereo audio recording. It is mainly used to
            reduce extreme stereo separation of low frequencies.

            The intent is to produce more speaker like sound to the
            listener.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``strength``
               Set strength of crossfeed. Default is 0.2. Allowed range
               is from 0 to 1. This sets gain of low shelf filter for
               side part of stereo image. Default is -6dB. Max allowed
               is -30db when strength is set to 1.

            ``range``
               Set soundstage wideness. Default is 0.5. Allowed range is
               from 0 to 1. This sets cut off frequency of low shelf
               filter. Default is cut off near 1550 Hz. With range set
               to 1 cut off frequency is set to 2100 Hz.

            ``slope``
               Set curve slope of low shelf filter. Default is 0.5.
               Allowed range is from 0.01 to 1.

            ``level_in``
               Set input gain. Default is 0.9.

            ``level_out``
               Set output gain. Default is 1.

            ``block_size``
               Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this
               value is set to high enough value (higher than impulse
               response length truncated when reaches near zero values)
               filtering will become linear phase otherwise if not big
               enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.

               Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples
               when set to non-zero value.

               Sets the intensity of effect (default: 2.0). Must be in
               range between -10.0 to 0 (unchanged sound) to 10.0
               (maximum effect). To inverse filtering use negative
               value.

            Apply a DC shift to the audio.

            This can be useful to remove a DC offset (caused perhaps by
            a hardware problem in the recording chain) from the audio.
            The effect of a DC offset is reduced headroom and hence
            volume. The `astats <#astats>`__ filter can be used to
            determine if a signal has a DC offset.

            ``shift``
               Set the DC shift, allowed range is [-1, 1]. It indicates
               the amount to shift the audio.

            ``limitergain``
               Optional. It should have a value much less than 1 (e.g.
               0.05 or 0.02) and is used to prevent clipping.

            Dynamic Audio Normalizer.

            This filter applies a certain amount of gain to the input
            audio in order to bring its peak magnitude to a target level
            (e.g. 0 dBFS). However, in contrast to more "simple"
            normalization algorithms, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer
            \*dynamically\* re-adjusts the gain factor to the input
            audio. This allows for applying extra gain to the "quiet"
            sections of the audio while avoiding distortions or clipping
            the "loud" sections. In other words: The Dynamic Audio
            Normalizer will "even out" the volume of quiet and loud
            sections, in the sense that the volume of each section is
            brought to the same target level. Note, however, that the
            Dynamic Audio Normalizer achieves this goal \*without\*
            applying "dynamic range compressing". It will retain 100% of
            the dynamic range \*within\* each section of the audio file.

            ``framelen, f``
               Set the frame length in milliseconds. In range from 10 to
               8000 milliseconds. Default is 500 milliseconds. The
               Dynamic Audio Normalizer processes the input audio in
               small chunks, referred to as frames. This is required,
               because a peak magnitude has no meaning for just a single
               sample value. Instead, we need to determine the peak
               magnitude for a contiguous sequence of sample values.
               While a "standard" normalizer would simply use the peak
               magnitude of the complete file, the Dynamic Audio
               Normalizer determines the peak magnitude individually for
               each frame. The length of a frame is specified in
               milliseconds. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer
               uses a frame length of 500 milliseconds, which has been
               found to give good results with most files. Note that the
               exact frame length, in number of samples, will be
               determined automatically, based on the sampling rate of
               the individual input audio file.

            ``gausssize, g``
               Set the Gaussian filter window size. In range from 3 to
               301, must be odd number. Default is 31. Probably the most
               important parameter of the Dynamic Audio Normalizer is
               the ``window size`` of the Gaussian smoothing filter. The
               filter’s window size is specified in frames, centered
               around the current frame. For the sake of simplicity,
               this must be an odd number. Consequently, the default
               value of 31 takes into account the current frame, as well
               as the 15 preceding frames and the 15 subsequent frames.
               Using a larger window results in a stronger smoothing
               effect and thus in less gain variation, i.e. slower gain
               adaptation. Conversely, using a smaller window results in
               a weaker smoothing effect and thus in more gain
               variation, i.e. faster gain adaptation. In other words,
               the more you increase this value, the more the Dynamic
               Audio Normalizer will behave like a "traditional"
               normalization filter. On the contrary, the more you
               decrease this value, the more the Dynamic Audio
               Normalizer will behave like a dynamic range compressor.

            ``peak, p``
               Set the target peak value. This specifies the highest
               permissible magnitude level for the normalized audio
               input. This filter will try to approach the target peak
               magnitude as closely as possible, but at the same time it
               also makes sure that the normalized signal will never
               exceed the peak magnitude. A frame’s maximum local gain
               factor is imposed directly by the target peak magnitude.
               The default value is 0.95 and thus leaves a headroom of
               5%\*. It is not recommended to go above this value.

            ``maxgain, m``
               Set the maximum gain factor. In range from 1.0 to 100.0.
               Default is 10.0. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines
               the maximum possible (local) gain factor for each input
               frame, i.e. the maximum gain factor that does not result
               in clipping or distortion. The maximum gain factor is
               determined by the frame’s highest magnitude sample.
               However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer additionally bounds
               the frame’s maximum gain factor by a predetermined
               (global) maximum gain factor. This is done in order to
               avoid excessive gain factors in "silent" or almost silent
               frames. By default, the maximum gain factor is 10.0, For
               most inputs the default value should be sufficient and it
               usually is not recommended to increase this value.
               Though, for input with an extremely low overall volume
               level, it may be necessary to allow even higher gain
               factors. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer
               does not simply apply a "hard" threshold (i.e. cut off
               values above the threshold). Instead, a "sigmoid"
               threshold function will be applied. This way, the gain
               factors will smoothly approach the threshold value, but
               never exceed that value.

            ``targetrms, r``
               Set the target RMS. In range from 0.0 to 1.0. Default is
               0.0 - disabled. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer
               performs "peak" normalization. This means that the
               maximum local gain factor for each frame is defined
               (only) by the frame’s highest magnitude sample. This way,
               the samples can be amplified as much as possible without
               exceeding the maximum signal level, i.e. without
               clipping. Optionally, however, the Dynamic Audio
               Normalizer can also take into account the frame’s root
               mean square, abbreviated RMS. In electrical engineering,
               the RMS is commonly used to determine the power of a
               time-varying signal. It is therefore considered that the
               RMS is a better approximation of the "perceived loudness"
               than just looking at the signal’s peak magnitude.
               Consequently, by adjusting all frames to a constant RMS
               value, a uniform "perceived loudness" can be established.
               If a target RMS value has been specified, a frame’s local
               gain factor is defined as the factor that would result in
               exactly that RMS value. Note, however, that the maximum
               local gain factor is still restricted by the frame’s
               highest magnitude sample, in order to prevent clipping.

            ``coupling, n``
               Enable channels coupling. By default is enabled. By
               default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will amplify all
               channels by the same amount. This means the same gain
               factor will be applied to all channels, i.e. the maximum
               possible gain factor is determined by the "loudest"
               channel. However, in some recordings, it may happen that
               the volume of the different channels is uneven, e.g. one
               channel may be "quieter" than the other one(s). In this
               case, this option can be used to disable the channel
               coupling. This way, the gain factor will be determined
               independently for each channel, depending only on the
               individual channel’s highest magnitude sample. This
               allows for harmonizing the volume of the different
               channels.

            ``correctdc, c``
               Enable DC bias correction. By default is disabled. An
               audio signal (in the time domain) is a sequence of sample
               values. In the Dynamic Audio Normalizer these sample
               values are represented in the -1.0 to 1.0 range,
               regardless of the original input format. Normally, the
               audio signal, or "waveform", should be centered around
               the zero point. That means if we calculate the mean value
               of all samples in a file, or in a single frame, then the
               result should be 0.0 or at least very close to that
               value. If, however, there is a significant deviation of
               the mean value from 0.0, in either positive or negative
               direction, this is referred to as a DC bias or DC offset.
               Since a DC bias is clearly undesirable, the Dynamic Audio
               Normalizer provides optional DC bias correction. With DC
               bias correction enabled, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer
               will determine the mean value, or "DC correction" offset,
               of each input frame and subtract that value from all of
               the frame’s sample values which ensures those samples are
               centered around 0.0 again. Also, in order to avoid "gaps"
               at the frame boundaries, the DC correction offset values
               will be interpolated smoothly between neighbouring
               frames.

            ``altboundary, b``
               Enable alternative boundary mode. By default is disabled.
               The Dynamic Audio Normalizer takes into account a certain
               neighbourhood around each frame. This includes the
               preceding frames as well as the subsequent frames.
               However, for the "boundary" frames, located at the very
               beginning and at the very end of the audio file, not all
               neighbouring frames are available. In particular, for the
               first few frames in the audio file, the preceding frames
               are not known. And, similarly, for the last few frames in
               the audio file, the subsequent frames are not known.
               Thus, the question arises which gain factors should be
               assumed for the missing frames in the "boundary" region.
               The Dynamic Audio Normalizer implements two modes to deal
               with this situation. The default boundary mode assumes a
               gain factor of exactly 1.0 for the missing frames,
               resulting in a smooth "fade in" and "fade out" at the
               beginning and at the end of the input, respectively.

            ``compress, s``
               Set the compress factor. In range from 0.0 to 30.0.
               Default is 0.0. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer
               does not apply "traditional" compression. This means that
               signal peaks will not be pruned and thus the full dynamic
               range will be retained within each local neighbourhood.
               However, in some cases it may be desirable to combine the
               Dynamic Audio Normalizer’s normalization algorithm with a
               more "traditional" compression. For this purpose, the
               Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides an optional compression
               (thresholding) function. If (and only if) the compression
               feature is enabled, all input frames will be processed by
               a soft knee thresholding function prior to the actual
               normalization process. Put simply, the thresholding
               function is going to prune all samples whose magnitude
               exceeds a certain threshold value. However, the Dynamic
               Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a fixed threshold
               value. Instead, the threshold value will be adjusted for
               each individual frame. In general, smaller parameters
               result in stronger compression, and vice versa. Values
               below 3.0 are not recommended, because audible distortion
               may appear.

            ``threshold, t``
               Set the target threshold value. This specifies the lowest
               permissible magnitude level for the audio input which
               will be normalized. If input frame volume is above this
               value frame will be normalized. Otherwise frame may not
               be normalized at all. The default value is set to 0,
               which means all input frames will be normalized. This
               option is mostly useful if digital noise is not wanted to
               be amplified.

            ``channels, h``
               Specify which channels to filter, by default all
               available channels are filtered.

            ``overlap, o``
               Specify overlap for frames. If set to 0 (default) no
               frame overlapping is done. Using >0 and <1 values will
               make less conservative gain adjustments, like when
               framelen option is set to smaller value, if framelen
               option value is compensated for non-zero overlap then
               gain adjustments will be smoother across time compared to

            Make audio easier to listen to on headphones.

            This filter adds ‘cues’ to 44.1kHz stereo (i.e. audio CD
            format) audio so that when listened to on headphones the
            stereo image is moved from inside your head (standard for
            headphones) to outside and in front of the listener
            (standard for speakers).

            Apply a two-pole peaking equalisation (EQ) filter. With this
            filter, the signal-level at and around a selected frequency
            can be increased or decreased, whilst (unlike bandpass and
            bandreject filters) that at all other frequencies is
            unchanged.

            In order to produce complex equalisation curves, this filter
            can be given several times, each with a different central
            frequency.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``frequency, f``
            Set the filter’s central frequency in Hz.

            ``width_type, t``

            ``o``
               octave

            ``s``
               slope

            ``k``
               kHz

            ``width, w``
            Specify the band-width of a filter in width_type units.

            ``gain, g``
            Set the required gain or attenuation in dB. Beware of
            clipping when using a positive gain.

            ``mix, m``
            How much to use filtered signal in output. Default is 1.
            Range is between 0 and 1.

            ``channels, c``
            Specify which channels to filter, by default all available
            are filtered.

            ``normalize, n``
            Normalize biquad coefficients, by default is disabled.
            Enabling it will normalize magnitude response at DC to 0dB.

            ``transform, a``
            Set transform type of IIR filter.

            ``di``

            Set precison of filtering.

            ``auto``
               Pick automatic sample format depending on surround
               filters.

            ``s16``
               Always use signed 16-bit.

            ``s32``
               Always use signed 32-bit.

            ``f32``
               Always use float 32-bit.

            ``f64``
               Always use float 64-bit.

            ``block_size, b``
            Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this
            value is set to high enough value (higher than impulse
            response length truncated when reaches near zero values)
            filtering will become linear phase otherwise if not big
            enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.

            Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples
            when set to non-zero value.

            Apply Haas effect to audio.

            Note that this makes most sense to apply on mono signals.
            With this filter applied to mono signals it give some
            directionality and stretches its stereo image.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``level_in``
               Set input level. By default is ``1``, or 0dB

            Decodes High Definition Compatible Digital (HDCD) data. A
            16-bit PCM stream with embedded HDCD codes is expanded into
            a 20-bit PCM stream.

            The filter supports the Peak Extend and Low-level Gain
            Adjustment features of HDCD, and detects the Transient
            Filter flag.

            When using the filter with wav, note the default encoding
            for wav is 16-bit, so the resulting 20-bit stream will be
            truncated back to 16-bit. Use something like
            ``-acodec pcm_s24le`` after the filter to get 24-bit PCM
            output.

               Disable any automatic format conversion or resampling in
               the filter graph.

            ``process_stereo``
               Process the stereo channels together. If target_gain does
               not match between channels, consider it invalid and use
               the last valid target_gain.

            ``cdt_ms``
               Set the code detect timer period in ms.

            ``force_pe``
               Always extend peaks above -3dBFS even if PE isn’t
               signaled.

            ``analyze_mode``
               Replace audio with a solid tone and adjust the amplitude
               to signal some specific aspect of the decoding process.
               The output file can be loaded in an audio editor
               alongside the original to aid analysis.

               ``analyze_mode=pe:force_pe=true`` can be used to see all
               samples above the PE level.

               Modes are:

               ‘\ ``0, off``\ ’
                  Disabled

            virtual loudspeakers around the user for binaural listening
            via headphones. The HRIRs are provided via additional
            streams, for each channel one stereo input stream is needed.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``map``
               Set mapping of input streams for convolution. The
               argument is a ’\|’-separated list of channel names in
               order as they are given as additional stream inputs for
               filter. This also specify number of input streams. Number
               of input streams must be not less than number of channels
               in first stream plus one.

            ``gain``
               Set gain applied to audio. Value is in dB. Default is 0.

            ``type``
               Set processing type. Can be ``time`` or ``freq``.
               ``time`` is processing audio in time domain which is
               slow. ``freq`` is processing audio in frequency domain
               which is fast. Default is ``freq``.

            ``lfe``
               Set custom gain for LFE channels. Value is in dB. Default
               is 0.

            ``size``
               Set size of frame in number of samples which will be
               processed at once. Default value is ``1024``. Allowed
               range is from 1024 to 96000.

            ``hrir``
               Set format of hrir stream. Default value is ``stereo``.
               Alternative value is ``multich``. If value is set to
               ``stereo``, number of additional streams should be
               greater or equal to number of input channels in first
               input stream. Also each additional stream should have
               stereo number of channels. If value is set to
               ``multich``, number of additional streams should be
               exactly one. Also number of input channels of additional
               stream should be equal or greater than twice number of
               channels of first input stream.

            value is set to high enough value (higher than impulse
            response length truncated when reaches near zero values)
            filtering will become linear phase otherwise if not big
            enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.

            Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples
            when set to non-zero value.

            Join multiple input streams into one multi-channel stream.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``inputs``
               The number of input streams. It defaults to 2.

            ``channel_layout``
               The desired output channel layout. It defaults to stereo.

            ``map``
               Map channels from inputs to output. The argument is a
               ’\|’-separated list of mappings, each in the
               ``input_idx``\ ``.``\ ``in_channel``\ ``-``\ ``out_channel``
               form. ``input_idx`` is the 0-based index of the input
               stream. ``in_channel`` can be either the name of the
               input channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its index in
               the specified input stream. ``out_channel`` is the name
               of the output channel.

            The filter will attempt to guess the mappings when they are
            not specified explicitly. It does so by first trying to find
            an unused matching input channel and if that fails it picks
            the first unused input channel.

               control. Alternatively they can be also defined using the
               following syntax:
               ``value0``\ \|\ ``value1``\ \|\ ``value2``\ \|..., where
               ``valuei`` is the value set on the ``i``-th control. If
               ``controls`` is set to ``help``, all available controls
               and their valid ranges are printed.

            ``sample_rate, s``
               Specify the sample rate, default to 44100. Only used if
               plugin have zero inputs.

            ``nb_samples, n``
               Set the number of samples per channel per each output
               frame, default is 1024. Only used if plugin have zero
               inputs.

            ``duration, d``
               Set the minimum duration of the sourced audio. See
               `(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the
               ffmpeg-utils(1)
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax>`__ for
               the accepted syntax. Note that the resulting duration may
               be greater than the specified duration, as the generated
               audio is always cut at the end of a complete frame. If
               not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the
               audio is supposed to be generated forever. Only used if
               plugin have zero inputs.

            ``latency, l``
               Enable latency compensation, by default is disabled. Only
               used if plugin have inputs.

            .. rubric:: 27.96 loudnorm
               :class: section

            EBU R128 loudness normalization. Includes both dynamic and
            linear normalization modes. Support for both single pass
            (livestreams, files) and double pass (files) modes. This
            algorithm can target IL, LRA, and maximum true peak. In
            dynamic mode, to accurately detect true peaks, the audio
            stream will be upsampled to 192 kHz. Use the ``-ar`` option
            or ``aresample`` filter to explicitly set an output sample
            rate.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``I, i``
               Set integrated loudness target. Range is -70.0 - -5.0.
               Default value is -24.0.

            ``LRA, lra``
               Set loudness range target. Range is 1.0 - 50.0. Default
               value is 7.0.

            ``TP, tp``
               Set maximum true peak. Range is -9.0 - +0.0. Default
               value is -2.0.

            ``measured_I, measured_i``
               Measured IL of input file. Range is -99.0 - +0.0.

            ``measured_LRA, measured_lra``
               Measured LRA of input file. Range is 0.0 - 99.0.

            ``measured_TP, measured_tp``
               Measured true peak of input file. Range is -99.0 - +99.0.

            ``measured_thresh``
               Measured threshold of input file. Range is -99.0 - +0.0.

            ``offset``
               Set offset gain. Gain is applied before the true-peak
               limiter. Range is -99.0 - +99.0. Default is +0.0.

            ``linear``
               Normalize by linearly scaling the source audio.
               ``measured_I``, ``measured_LRA``, ``measured_TP``, and
               ``measured_thresh`` must all be specified. Target LRA
               shouldn’t be lower than source LRA and the change in
               integrated loudness shouldn’t result in a true peak which
               exceeds the target TP. If any of these conditions aren’t
               met, normalization mode will revert to ``dynamic``.
               Options are ``true`` or ``false``. Default is ``true``.

            ``dual_mono``
               Treat mono input files as "dual-mono". If a mono file is
               intended for playback on a stereo system, its EBU R128
               measurement will be perceptually incorrect. If set to
               ``true``, this option will compensate for this effect.
               Multi-channel input files are not affected by this
               option. Options are true or false. Default is false.

            ``print_format``
               Set print format for stats. Options are summary, json, or
               none. Default value is none.

            Apply a low-pass filter with 3dB point frequency. The filter
            can be either single-pole or double-pole (the default). The
            filter roll off at 6dB per pole per octave (20dB per pole
            per decade).

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``frequency, f``
            Set frequency in Hz. Default is 500.

            ``poles, p``
            Set number of poles. Default is 2.

            ``width_type, t``
            Set method to specify band-width of filter.

            ``h``
               Hz

            ``q``
               Q-Factor

            ``o``
               octave

            ``s``
               slope

            ``k``
               kHz

            ``width, w``
            Specify the band-width of a filter in width_type units.
            Applies only to double-pole filter. The default is 0.707q
            and gives a Butterworth response.

            ``mix, m``
            How much to use filtered signal in output. Default is 1.
            Range is between 0 and 1.

            ``channels, c``
            Specify which channels to filter, by default all available
            are filtered.

            ``normalize, n``
            Normalize biquad coefficients, by default is disabled.
            Enabling it will normalize magnitude response at DC to 0dB.

            ``transform, a``
            Set transform type of IIR filter.

            ``di``
            ``dii``
            ``tdi``
            ``tdii``
            ``latt``
            ``svf``
            ``zdf``
            ``precision, r``
            Set precison of filtering.

            ``auto``
               Pick automatic sample format depending on surround
               filters.

            ``s16``
               Always use signed 16-bit.

            ``s32``
               Always use signed 32-bit.

            ``f32``
               Always use float 32-bit.

            ``f64``
               Always use float 64-bit.

            ``block_size, b``
            Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this
            value is set to high enough value (higher than impulse
            response length truncated when reaches near zero values)
            filtering will become linear phase otherwise if not big
            enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.

            Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples
            when set to non-zero value.

               more floating point values that determine the behavior of
               the loaded plugin (for example delay, threshold or gain).
               If ``controls`` is set to ``help``, all available
               controls and their valid ranges are printed.

            ``sample_rate, s``

            Multiband Compress or expand the audio’s dynamic range.

            The input audio is divided into bands using 4th order
            Linkwitz-Riley IIRs. This is akin to the crossover of a
            loudspeaker, and results in flat frequency response when
            absent compander action.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            Mix channels with specific gain levels. The filter accepts
            the output channel layout followed by a set of channels
            definitions.

            This filter is also designed to efficiently remap the
            channels of an audio stream.

            The filter accepts parameters of the form:
            "``l``\ \|\ ``outdef``\ \|\ ``outdef``\ \|..."

            ``l``
               output channel layout or number of channels

            ``outdef``
               output channel specification, of the form:
               "``out_name``\ =[``gain``\ \*]\ ``in_name``\ [(+-)[``gain``\ \*]\ ``in_name``...]"

            ``out_name``
               output channel to define, either a channel name (FL, FR,
               etc.) or a channel number (c0, c1, etc.)

            ``gain``
               multiplicative coefficient for the channel, 1 leaving the
               volume unchanged

            ``in_name``
               input channel to use, see out_name for details; it is not
               possible to mix named and numbered input channels

            If the ‘=’ in a channel specification is replaced by ‘<’,
            then the gains for that specification will be renormalized
            so that the total is 1, thus avoiding clipping noise.

               For example, if you want to down-mix from stereo to mono,
               but with a bigger factor for the left channel:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     pan=1c|c0=0.9*c0+0.1*c1

               A customized down-mix to stereo that works automatically
               for 3-, 4-, 5- and 7-channels surround:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     pan=stereo| FL < FL + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BL + 0.6*SL | FR < FR + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BR + 0.6*SR

               Note that ``ffmpeg`` integrates a default down-mix (and
               up-mix) system that should be preferred (see "-ac"
               option) unless you have very specific needs.

                  :class: subsection

               The channel remapping will be effective if, and only if:

               -  gain coefficients are zeroes or ones,
               -  only one input per channel output,

               If all these conditions are satisfied, the filter will
               notify the user ("Pure channel mapping detected"), and
               use an optimized and lossless method to do the remapping.

               For example, if you have a 5.1 source and want a stereo
               audio stream by dropping the extra channels:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     pan="stereo| c0=FL | c1=FR"

               Given the same source, you can also switch front left and
               front right channels and keep the input channel layout:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     pan="5.1| c0=c1 | c1=c0 | c2=c2 | c3=c3 | c4=c4 | c5=c5"

               If the input is a stereo audio stream, you can mute the
               front left channel (and still keep the stereo channel
               layout) with:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     pan="stereo|c1=c1"

               Still with a stereo audio stream input, you can copy the
               right channel in both front left and right:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     pan="stereo| c0=FR | c1=FR"

            This filter acts like normal compressor but has the ability
            to compress detected signal using second input signal. It
            needs two input streams and returns one output stream. First
            input stream will be processed depending on second stream
            signal. The filtered signal then can be filtered with other
            filters in later stages of processing. See `pan <#pan>`__
            and `amerge <#amerge>`__ filter.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``level_in``
               Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625
               and 64.

            ``mode``
               Set mode of compressor operation. Can be ``upward`` or
               ``downward``. Default is ``downward``.

            ``threshold``
               If a signal of second stream raises above this level it
               will affect the gain reduction of first stream. By
               default is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.

            ``ratio``
               Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means
               that if the level raised 4dB above the threshold, it will
               be only 2dB above after the reduction. Default is 2.
               Range is between 1 and 20.

            ``attack``
               Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the
               threshold before gain reduction starts. Default is 20.
               Range is between 0.01 and 2000.

            ``release``
               Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the
               threshold before reduction is decreased again. Default is
               250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.

            ``makeup``
               Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after
               processing. Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.

            ``knee``
               Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain
               reduction more softly. Default is 2.82843. Range is
               between 1 and 8.

            ``link``
               Choose if the ``average`` level between all channels of
               side-chain stream or the louder(``maximum``) channel of
               side-chain stream affects the reduction. Default is
               ``average``.

            ``detection``
               Should the exact signal be taken in case of ``peak`` or
               an RMS one in case of ``rms``. Default is ``rms`` which
               is mainly smoother.

            ``level_sc``
               Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is between
               0.015625 and 64.

            ``mix``
               How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is

            A sidechain gate acts like a normal (wideband) gate but has
            the ability to filter the detected signal before sending it
            to the gain reduction stage. Normally a gate uses the full
            range signal to detect a level above the threshold. For
            example: If you cut all lower frequencies from your
            sidechain signal the gate will decrease the volume of your
            track only if not enough highs appear. With this technique
            you are able to reduce the resonation of a natural drum or
            remove "rumbling" of muted strokes from a heavily distorted
            guitar. It needs two input streams and returns one output
            stream. First input stream will be processed depending on
            second stream signal.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``level_in``
               Set input level before filtering. Default is 1. Allowed
               range is from 0.015625 to 64.

            ``mode``
               Set the mode of operation. Can be ``upward`` or
               ``downward``. Default is ``downward``. If set to
               ``upward`` mode, higher parts of signal will be
               amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction.
               Otherwise, in case of ``downward`` lower parts of signal
               will be reduced.

            ``range``
               Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below
               the threshold. Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from
               0 to 1. Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then
               filter behaves like expander.

            ``threshold``
               If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is
               released. Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.

            ``ratio``
               Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. Default is
               2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.

            ``attack``
               Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the
               threshold before gain reduction stops. Default is 20
               milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.

            ``release``
               Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the
               threshold before the reduction is increased again.
               Default is 250 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01
               to 9000.

            ``makeup``
               Set amount of amplification of signal after processing.
               Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.

            ``knee``
               Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain
               reduction more softly. Default is 2.828427125. Allowed
               range is from 1 to 8.

            ``detection``
               Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or
               an RMS like one. Default is rms. Can be peak or rms.

            ``link``
               Choose if the average level between all channels or the
               louder channel affects the reduction. Default is average.
               Can be average or maximum.

            ``level_sc``
               Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is from 0.015625
               to 64.

            Detect silence in an audio stream.

            This filter logs a message when it detects that the input
            audio volume is less or equal to a noise tolerance value for
            a duration greater or equal to the minimum detected noise
            duration.

            The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The
            ``lavfi.silence_start`` or ``lavfi.silence_start.X``
            metadata key is set on the first frame whose timestamp
            equals or exceeds the detection duration and it contains the
            timestamp of the first frame of the silence.

            The ``lavfi.silence_duration`` or
            ``lavfi.silence_duration.X`` and ``lavfi.silence_end`` or
            ``lavfi.silence_end.X`` metadata keys are set on the first
            frame after the silence. If ``mono`` is enabled, and each
            channel is evaluated separately, the ``.X`` suffixed keys
            are used, and ``X`` corresponds to the channel number.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``noise, n``
               Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB"
               is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio.
               Default is -60dB, or 0.001.

            ``duration, d``
               Set silence duration until notification (default is 2
               seconds). See `(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in
               the ffmpeg-utils(1)
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax>`__ for
               the accepted syntax.

            ``mono, m``
               Process each channel separately, instead of combined. By
               default is disabled.

            Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the
            audio.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``start_periods``
               This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed
               at beginning of the audio. A value of zero indicates no
               silence should be trimmed from the beginning. When
               specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it
               finds non-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from
               beginning of audio the ``start_periods`` will be ``1``
               but it can be increased to higher values to trim all
               audio up to specific count of non-silence periods.
               Default value is ``0``.

            ``start_duration``
               Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be
               detected before it stops trimming audio. By increasing
               the duration, bursts of noises can be treated as silence
               and trimmed off. Default value is ``0``.

            ``start_threshold``
               This indicates what sample value should be treated as
               silence. For digital audio, a value of ``0`` may be fine
               but for audio recorded from analog, you may wish to
               increase the value to account for background noise. Can
               be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the
               specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default value is
               ``0``.

            ``start_silence``
               Specify max duration of silence at beginning that will be
               kept after trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to
               trimming all samples detected as silence.

            ``start_mode``
               Specify mode of detection of silence end at start of
               multi-channel audio. Can be ``any`` or ``all``. Default
               is ``any``. With ``any``, any sample from any channel
               that is detected as non-silence will trigger end of
               silence trimming at start of audio stream. With ``all``,
               only if every sample from every channel is detected as
               non-silence will trigger end of silence trimming at start
               of audio stream, limited usage.

            ``stop_periods``
               Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio.
               When specifying a positive value, it trims audio after it
               finds specified silence period. To remove silence from
               the middle of a file, specify a ``stop_periods`` that is
               negative. This value is then treated as a positive value
               and is used to indicate the effect should restart
               processing as specified by ``stop_periods``, making it
               suitable for removing periods of silence in the middle of
               the audio. Default value is ``0``.

            ``stop_duration``
               Specify a duration of silence that must exist before
               audio is not copied any more. By specifying a higher
               duration, silence that is wanted can be left in the
               audio. Default value is ``0``.

            ``stop_threshold``
               This is the same as ``start_threshold`` but for trimming
               silence from the end of audio. Can be specified in dB (in
               case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or
               amplitude ratio. Default value is ``0``.

            ``stop_silence``
               Specify max duration of silence at end that will be kept
               after trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming
               all samples detected as silence.

            ``stop_mode``
               Specify mode of detection of silence start after start of
               multi-channel audio. Can be ``any`` or ``all``. Default
               is ``all``. With ``any``, any sample from any channel
               that is detected as silence will trigger start of silence
               trimming after start of audio stream, limited usage. With
               ``all``, only if every sample from every channel is
               detected as silence will trigger start of silence
               trimming after start of audio stream.

            ``detection``
               Set how is silence detected.

               ``avg``
                  Mean of absolute values of samples in moving window.

               ``rms``
                  Root squared mean of absolute values of samples in
                  moving window.

               ``peak``
                  Maximum of absolute values of samples in moving
                  window.

               ``median``
                  Median of absolute values of samples in moving window.

               ``ptp``
                  Absolute of max peak to min peak difference of samples
                  in moving window.

               ``dev``
                  Standard deviation of values of samples in moving
                  window.

               Default value is ``rms``.

            ``window``
               Set duration in number of seconds used to calculate size
               of window in number of samples for detecting silence.
               Using ``0`` will effectively disable any windowing and
               use only single sample per channel for silence detection.
               In that case it may be needed to also set
               ``start_silence`` and/or ``stop_silence`` to nonzero
               values with also ``start_duration`` and/or
               ``stop_duration`` to nonzero values. Default value is
               ``0.02``. Allowed range is from ``0`` to ``10``.

            ``timestamp``
               Set processing mode of every audio frame output
               timestamp.

               ``write``
                  Full timestamps rewrite, keep only the start time for
                  the first output frame.

               ``copy``
                  Non-dropped frames are left with same timestamp as
                  input audio frame.

               Defaults value is ``write``.

            SOFAlizer uses head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to
            create virtual loudspeakers around the user for binaural
            listening via headphones (audio formats up to 9 channels
            supported). The HRTFs are stored in SOFA files (see
            http://www.sofacoustics.org/ for a database). SOFAlizer is
            developed at the Acoustics Research Institute (ARI) of the
            Austrian Academy of Sciences.

            To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure
            FFmpeg with ``--enable-libmysofa``.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``sofa``
               Set the SOFA file used for rendering.

            ``gain``
               Set gain applied to audio. Value is in dB. Default is 0.

            ``rotation``
               Set rotation of virtual loudspeakers in deg. Default is
               0.

            ``elevation``
               Set elevation of virtual speakers in deg. Default is 0.

            ``radius``
               Set distance in meters between loudspeakers and the
               listener with near-field HRTFs. Default is 1.

            ``type``
               Set processing type. Can be ``time`` or ``freq``.
               ``time`` is processing audio in time domain which is
               slow. ``freq`` is processing audio in frequency domain
               which is fast. Default is ``freq``.

            ``speakers``
               Set custom positions of virtual loudspeakers. Syntax for
               this option is: <CH> <AZIM> <ELEV>[\|<CH> <AZIM>
               <ELEV>\|...]. Each virtual loudspeaker is described with
               short channel name following with azimuth and elevation
               in degrees. Each virtual loudspeaker description is
               separated by ’\|’. For example to override front left and
               front right channel positions use: ’speakers=FL 45 15|FR
               345 15’. Descriptions with unrecognised channel names are
               ignored.

            ``lfegain``
               Set custom gain for LFE channels. Value is in dB. Default
               is 0.

            ``framesize``
               Set custom frame size in number of samples. Default is
               1024. Allowed range is from 1024 to 96000. Only used if
               option ‘\ ``type``\ ’ is set to ``freq``.

            ``normalize``
               Should all IRs be normalized upon importing SOFA file. By
               default is enabled.

            ``interpolate``
               Should nearest IRs be interpolated with neighbor IRs if
               exact position does not match. By default is disabled.

            Speech Normalizer.

            This filter expands or compresses each half-cycle of audio
            samples (local set of samples all above or all below zero
            and between two nearest zero crossings) depending on
            threshold value, so audio reaches target peak value under
            conditions controlled by below options.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``peak, p``
               Set the expansion target peak value. This specifies the
               highest allowed absolute amplitude level for the
               normalized audio input. Default value is 0.95. Allowed
               range is from 0.0 to 1.0.

            ``expansion, e``
               Set the maximum expansion factor. Allowed range is from
               1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0. This option controls
               maximum local half-cycle of samples expansion. The
               maximum expansion would be such that local peak value
               reaches target peak value but never to surpass it and
               that ratio between new and previous peak value does not
               surpass this option value.

            ``compression, c``
               Set the maximum compression factor. Allowed range is from
               1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0. This option controls
               maximum local half-cycle of samples compression. This
               option is used only if ``threshold`` option is set to
               value greater than 0.0, then in such cases when local
               peak is lower or same as value set by ``threshold`` all
               samples belonging to that peak’s half-cycle will be
               compressed by current compression factor.

            ``threshold, t``
               Set the threshold value. Default value is 0.0. Allowed
               range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This option specifies which
               half-cycles of samples will be compressed and which will
               be expanded. Any half-cycle samples with their local peak
               value below or same as this option value will be
               compressed by current compression factor, otherwise, if
               greater than threshold value they will be expanded with
               expansion factor so that it could reach peak target value
               but never surpass it.

            ``raise, r``
               Set the expansion raising amount per each half-cycle of
               samples. Default value is 0.001. Allowed range is from
               0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast expansion factor is
               raised per each new half-cycle until it reaches
               ``expansion`` value. Setting this options too high may
               lead to distortions.

            ``fall, f``
               Set the compression raising amount per each half-cycle of
               samples. Default value is 0.001. Allowed range is from
               0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast compression factor is
               raised per each new half-cycle until it reaches
               ``compression`` value.

            ``channels, h``
               Specify which channels to filter, by default all
               available channels are filtered.

            ``invert, i``
               Enable inverted filtering, by default is disabled. This
               inverts interpretation of ``threshold`` option. When
               enabled any half-cycle of samples with their local peak
               value below or same as ``threshold`` option will be
               expanded otherwise it will be compressed.

            ``link, l``
               Link channels when calculating gain applied to each
               filtered channel sample, by default is disabled. When
               disabled each filtered channel gain calculation is
               independent, otherwise when this option is enabled the
               minimum of all possible gains for each filtered channel
               is used.

            ``rms, m``
               Set the expansion target RMS value. This specifies the
               highest allowed RMS level for the normalized audio input.
               Default value is 0.0, thus disabled. Allowed range is
               from 0.0 to 1.0.

               :class: section

            Apply audio surround upmix filter.

            This filter allows to produce multichannel output from audio
            stream.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``chl_out``
            Set output channel layout. By default, this is ``5.1``.

            See `(ffmpeg-utils)the Channel Layout section in the
            ffmpeg-utils(1)
            manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#channel-layout-syntax>`__ for the
            required syntax.

            ``chl_in``
            Set input channel layout. By default, this is ``stereo``.

            In ``add`` mode, LFE channel is created from input audio and
            added to output. In ``sub`` mode, LFE channel is created
            from input audio and added to output but also all non-LFE
            output channels are subtracted with output LFE channel.

            ``smooth``

            Boost or cut the lower frequencies and cut or boost higher
            frequencies of the audio using a two-pole shelving filter
            with a response similar to that of a standard hi-fi’s
            tone-controls. This is also known as shelving equalisation
            (EQ).

            The filter accepts the following options:

            Give the gain at 0 Hz. Its useful range is about -20 (for a
            large cut) to +20 (for a large boost). Beware of clipping
            when using a positive gain.

            ``frequency, f``
            Set the filter’s central frequency and so can be used to
            extend or reduce the frequency range to be boosted or cut.

            Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this
            value is set to high enough value (higher than impulse
            response length truncated when reaches near zero values)
            filtering will become linear phase otherwise if not big
            enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.

            This filter accepts stereo input and produce stereo with LFE
            (2.1) channels output. The newly produced LFE channel have
            enhanced virtual bass originally obtained from both stereo
            channels. This filter outputs front left and front right
            channels unchanged as available in stereo input.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``cutoff``
               Set the virtual bass cutoff frequency. Default value is
               250 Hz. Allowed range is from 100 to 500 Hz.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``volume``
               Set audio volume expression.

               Output values are clipped to the maximum value.

               The output audio volume is given by the relation:

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     output_volume = volume * input_volume

               The default value for ``volume`` is "1.0".

            ``precision``
               This parameter represents the mathematical precision.

               It determines which input sample formats will be allowed,
               which affects the precision of the volume scaling.

               ``fixed``
                  8-bit fixed-point; this limits input sample format to
                  U8, S16, and S32.

               ``float``
                  32-bit floating-point; this limits input sample format
                  to FLT. (default)

               ``double``
                  64-bit floating-point; this limits input sample format
                  to DBL.

                  Remove ReplayGain side data, ignoring its contents
                  (the default).

               ``ignore``
                  Ignore ReplayGain side data, but leave it in the
                  frame.

               ``track``
                  Prefer the track gain, if present.

               ``album``
                  Prefer the album gain, if present.

            ``replaygain_preamp``
               Pre-amplification gain in dB to apply to the selected
               replaygain gain.

               Default value for ``replaygain_preamp`` is 0.0.

            ``replaygain_noclip``
               Prevent clipping by limiting the gain applied.

               Default value for ``replaygain_noclip`` is 1.

            ``eval``
               Set when the volume expression is evaluated.

               It accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``once``\ ’
                  only evaluate expression once during the filter
                  initialization, or when the ‘\ ``volume``\ ’ command
                  is sent

               ‘\ ``frame``\ ’
                  evaluate expression for each incoming frame

               Default value is ‘\ ``once``\ ’.

            The volume expression can contain the following parameters.

            ``n``
               frame number (starting at zero)

            ``nb_channels``

               time at start of stream

            ``t``
               frame time

            ``tb``
               timestamp timebase

            ``volume``
               last set volume value

            Note that when ``eval`` is set to ‘\ ``once``\ ’ only the
            ``sample_rate`` and ``tb`` variables are available, all
            other variables will evaluate to NAN.

            The filter has no parameters. It supports only 16-bit signed
            integer samples, so the input will be converted when needed.
            Statistics about the volume will be printed in the log when
            the input stream end is reached.

            In particular it will show the mean volume (root mean
            square), maximum volume (on a per-sample basis), and the
            beginning of a histogram of the registered volume values
            (from the maximum value to a cumulated 1/1000 of the
            samples).

                     [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_10db: 8409

               It means that:

               -  The mean square energy is approximately -27 dB, or
                  10^-2.7.
               -  The largest sample is at -4 dB, or more precisely
                  between -4 dB and -5 dB.
               -  There are 6 samples at -4 dB, 62 at -5 dB, 286 at -6
                  dB, etc.

               In other words, raising the volume by +4 dB does not
               cause any clipping, raising it by +5 dB causes clipping
               for 6 samples, etc.

            This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in
            particular through the interface defined in
            ``libavfilter/buffersrc.h``.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``time_base``
               The timebase which will be used for timestamps of
               submitted frames. It must be either a floating-point
               number or in ``numerator``/``denominator`` form.

            ``sample_rate``
               The sample rate of the incoming audio buffers.

            ``sample_fmt``
               The sample format of the incoming audio buffers. Either a
               sample format name or its corresponding integer
               representation from the enum AVSampleFormat in
               ``libavutil/samplefmt.h``

            ``channel_layout``
               The channel layout of the incoming audio buffers. Either
               a channel layout name from channel_layout_map in
               ``libavutil/channel_layout.c`` or its corresponding
               integer representation from the AV_CH_LAYOUT\_\* macros
               in ``libavutil/channel_layout.h``

            ``channels``
               The number of channels of the incoming audio buffers. If
               both ``channels`` and ``channel_layout`` are specified,
               then they must be consistent.

            Generate an audio signal specified by an expression.

            This source accepts in input one or more expressions (one
            for each channel), which are evaluated and used to generate
            a corresponding audio signal.

            This source accepts the following options:

            ``exprs``
               Set the ’\|’-separated expressions list for each separate
               channel. In case the ``channel_layout`` option is not
               specified, the selected channel layout depends on the
               number of provided expressions. Otherwise the last
               specified expression is applied to the remaining output
               channels.

            ``channel_layout, c``
               Set the channel layout. The number of channels in the
               specified layout must be equal to the number of specified
               expressions.

            ``duration, d``
               Set the minimum duration of the sourced audio. See
               `(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the
               ffmpeg-utils(1)
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax>`__ for
               the accepted syntax. Note that the resulting duration may
               be greater than the specified duration, as the generated
               audio is always cut at the end of a complete frame.

               If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative,
               the audio is supposed to be generated forever.

            ``nb_samples, n``
               Set the number of samples per channel per each output
               frame, default to 1024.

            ``sample_rate, s``
               Specify the sample rate, default to 44100.

            Each expression in ``exprs`` can contain the following
            constants:

            ``n``
               number of the evaluated sample, starting from 0

               Set low-pass frequency. Default is 0. If high-pass
               frequency is lower than low-pass frequency and low-pass
               frequency is higher than 0 then filter will create
               band-pass filter coefficients, otherwise band-reject
               filter coefficients.

            ``phase``
               Set filter phase response. Default is 50. Allowed range
               is from 0 to 100.

            ``beta``
               Set Kaiser window beta.

            ``att``
               Set stop-band attenuation. Default is 120dB, allowed
               range is from 40 to 180 dB.

            ``round``
               Enable rounding, by default is disabled.

            ``hptaps``
               Set number of taps for high-pass filter.

            ``lptaps``
               Set number of taps for low-pass filter.

            Generate an audio signal made of a sine wave with amplitude
            1/8.

            The audio signal is bit-exact.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``frequency, f``
               Set the carrier frequency. Default is 440 Hz.

            ``beep_factor, b``
               Enable a periodic beep every second with frequency
               ``beep_factor`` times the carrier frequency. Default is
               0, meaning the beep is disabled.

            ``sample_rate, r``
               Specify the sample rate, default is 44100.

            ``duration, d``
               Specify the duration of the generated audio stream.

            ``samples_per_frame``
               Set the number of samples per output frame.

               The expression can contain the following constants:

               ``n``
                  The (sequential) number of the output audio frame,
                  starting from 0.

               ``pts``
                  The PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the output audio
                  frame, expressed in ``TB`` units.

               ``t``
                  The PTS of the output audio frame, expressed in
                  seconds.

               ``TB``
                  The timebase of the output audio frames.

               Default is ``1024``.

            Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the end of
            filter chain.

            This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in
            particular through the interface defined in
            ``libavfilter/buffersink.h`` or the options system.

            It accepts a pointer to an AVABufferSinkContext structure,
            which defines the incoming buffers’ formats, to be passed as
            the opaque parameter to ``avfilter_init_filter`` for
            initialization.

               :class: section

            Mark a region of interest in a video frame.

            The frame data is passed through unchanged, but metadata is
            attached to the frame indicating regions of interest which
            can affect the behaviour of later encoding. Multiple regions
            can be marked by applying the filter multiple times.

            ``x``
               Region distance in pixels from the left edge of the
               frame.

            ``y``
               Region distance in pixels from the top edge of the frame.

            ``w``
               Region width in pixels.

            ``h``
               Region height in pixels.

               The parameters ``x``, ``y``, ``w`` and ``h`` are
               expressions, and may contain the following variables:

               ``iw``
                  Width of the input frame.

               ``ih``
                  Height of the input frame.

            ``qoffset``
               Quantisation offset to apply within the region.

               This must be a real value in the range -1 to +1. A value
               of zero indicates no quality change. A negative value
               asks for better quality (less quantisation), while a
               positive value asks for worse quality (greater
               quantisation).

               The range is calibrated so that the extreme values
               indicate the largest possible offset - if the rest of the
               frame is encoded with the worst possible quality, an
               offset of -1 indicates that this region should be encoded
               with the best possible quality anyway. Intermediate
               values are then interpolated in some codec-dependent way.

               For example, in 10-bit H.264 the quantisation parameter
               varies between -12 and 51. A typical qoffset value of
               -1/10 therefore indicates that this region should be
               encoded with a QP around one-tenth of the full range
               better than the rest of the frame. So, if most of the
               frame were to be encoded with a QP of around 30, this
               region would get a QP of around 24 (an offset of
               approximately -1/10 \* (51 - -12) = -6.3). An extreme
               value of -1 would indicate that this region should be
               encoded with the best possible quality regardless of the
               treatment of the rest of the frame - that is, should be
               encoded at a QP of -12.

            ``clear``
               If set to true, remove any existing regions of interest
               marked on the frame before adding the new one.

            Extract the alpha component from the input as a grayscale
            video. This is especially useful with the ``alphamerge``
            filter.

            Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with
            the grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for
            use with ``alphaextract`` to allow the transmission or
            storage of frame sequences that have alpha in a format that
            doesn’t support an alpha channel.

            For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal
            YUV-encoded video and a separate video created with

            Amplify differences between current pixel and pixels of
            adjacent frames in same pixel location.

            This filter accepts the following options:

            ``radius``
               Set frame radius. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1
               to 63. For example radius of 3 will instruct filter to
               calculate average of 7 frames.

            ``factor``
               Set factor to amplify difference. Default is 2. Allowed
               range is from 0 to 65535.

            ``threshold``
               Set threshold for difference amplification. Any
               difference greater or equal to this value will not alter
               source pixel. Default is 10. Allowed range is from 0 to
               65535.

            ``tolerance``
               Set tolerance for difference amplification. Any
               difference lower to this value will not alter source
               pixel. Default is 0. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.

            ``low``
               Set lower limit for changing source pixel. Default is
               65535. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535. This option
               controls maximum possible value that will decrease source
               pixel value.

            ``high``
               Set high limit for changing source pixel. Default is
               65535. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535. This option
               controls maximum possible value that will increase source
               pixel value.

            ``planes``
               Set which planes to filter. Default is all. Allowed range
               is from 0 to 15.

            Same as the `subtitles <#subtitles>`__ filter, except that
            it doesn’t require libavcodec and libavformat to work. On
            the other hand, it is limited to ASS (Advanced Substation
            Alpha) subtitles files.

            This filter accepts the following option in addition to the
            common options from the `subtitles <#subtitles>`__ filter:

            ``shaping``
               Set the shaping engine

               Available values are:

               ‘\ ``auto``\ ’
                  The default libass shaping engine, which is the best
                  available.

               ‘\ ``simple``\ ’
                  Fast, font-agnostic shaper that can do only
                  substitutions

               ‘\ ``complex``\ ’
                  Slower shaper using OpenType for substitutions and
                  positioning

            Apply an Adaptive Temporal Averaging Denoiser to the video
            input.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``0a``
               Set threshold A for 1st plane. Default is 0.02. Valid
               range is 0 to 0.3.

            ``0b``
               Set threshold B for 1st plane. Default is 0.04. Valid
               range is 0 to 5.

            ``1a``
               Set threshold A for 2nd plane. Default is 0.02. Valid
               range is 0 to 0.3.

            ``1b``
               Set threshold B for 2nd plane. Default is 0.04. Valid
               range is 0 to 5.

            ``2a``
               Set threshold A for 3rd plane. Default is 0.02. Valid
               range is 0 to 0.3.

            ``2b``
               Set threshold B for 3rd plane. Default is 0.04. Valid
               range is 0 to 5.

               Threshold A is designed to react on abrupt changes in the
               input signal and threshold B is designed to react on
               continuous changes in the input signal.

            ``s``
               Set number of frames filter will use for averaging.
               Default is 9. Must be odd number in range [5, 129].

            ``p``
               Set what planes of frame filter will use for averaging.
               Default is all.

            ``a``
               Set what variant of algorithm filter will use for
               averaging. Default is ``p`` parallel. Alternatively can
               be set to ``s`` serial.

               Parallel can be faster then serial, while other way
               around is never true. Parallel will abort early on first
               change being greater then thresholds, while serial will
               continue processing other side of frames if they are
               equal or below thresholds.

            ``0s``
            ``1s``
            ``2s``
               Set sigma for 1st plane, 2nd plane or 3rd plane. Default
               is 32767. Valid range is from 0 to 32767. This options
               controls weight for each pixel in radius defined by size.
               Default value means every pixel have same weight. Setting
               this option to 0 effectively disables filtering.

            CUDA accelerated bilateral filter, an edge preserving
            filter. This filter is mathematically accurate thanks to the
            use of GPU acceleration. For best output quality, use one to

               :class: section

            Detect video intervals that are (almost) completely black.
            Can be useful to detect chapter transitions, commercials, or
            invalid recordings.

            The filter outputs its detection analysis to both the log as
            well as frame metadata. If a black segment of at least the
            specified minimum duration is found, a line with the start
            and end timestamps as well as duration is printed to the log
            with level ``info``. In addition, a log line with level
            ``debug`` is printed per frame showing the black amount
            detected for that frame.

            The filter also attaches metadata to the first frame of a
            black segment with key ``lavfi.black_start`` and to the
            first frame after the black segment ends with key
            ``lavfi.black_end``. The value is the frame’s timestamp.
            This metadata is added regardless of the minimum duration
            specified.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``black_min_duration, d``
               Set the minimum detected black duration expressed in
               seconds. It must be a non-negative floating point number.

               Default value is 2.0.

            ``picture_black_ratio_th, pic_th``
               Set the threshold for considering a picture "black".
               Express the minimum value for the ratio:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     nb_black_pixels / nb_pixels

               for which a picture is considered black. Default value is
               0.98.

            ``pixel_black_th, pix_th``
               Set the threshold for considering a pixel "black".

               The threshold expresses the maximum pixel luma value for
               which a pixel is considered "black". The provided value
               is scaled according to the following equation:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     absolute_threshold = luma_minimum_value + pixel_black_th * luma_range_size

               ``luma_range_size`` and ``luma_minimum_value`` depend on
               the input video format, the range is [0-255] for YUV
               full-range formats and [16-235] for YUV non full-range
               formats.

               Default value is 0.10.

            The following example sets the maximum pixel threshold to
            the minimum value, and detects only black intervals of 2 or
            more seconds:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  blackdetect=d=2:pix_th=0.00

               :class: section

            Detect frames that are (almost) completely black. Can be
            useful to detect chapter transitions or commercials. Output
            lines consist of the frame number of the detected frame, the
            percentage of blackness, the position in the file if known
            or -1 and the timestamp in seconds.

            In order to display the output lines, you need to set the
            loglevel at least to the AV_LOG_INFO value.

            This filter exports frame metadata
            ``lavfi.blackframe.pblack``. The value represents the
            percentage of pixels in the picture that are below the
            threshold value.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``amount``
               The percentage of the pixels that have to be below the
               threshold; it defaults to ``98``.

            ``threshold, thresh``
               The threshold below which a pixel value is considered
               black; it defaults to ``32``.

               :class: section

            Blend two video frames into each other.

            The ``blend`` filter takes two input streams and outputs one
            stream, the first input is the "top" layer and second input
            is "bottom" layer. By default, the output terminates when
            the longest input terminates.

            The ``tblend`` (time blend) filter takes two consecutive
            frames from one single stream, and outputs the result
            obtained by blending the new frame on top of the old frame.

            A description of the accepted options follows.

            Determines blurriness of frames without altering the input
            frames.

            Based on Marziliano, Pina, et al. "A no-reference perceptual
            blur metric." Allows for a block-based abbreviation.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``low``
            ``high``
               Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny
               thresholding algorithm.

               The high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels,
               which are then connected through 8-connectivity with the
               "weak" edge pixels selected by the low threshold.

               ``low`` and ``high`` threshold values must be chosen in
               the range [0,1], and ``low`` should be lesser or equal to
               ``high``.

               Default value for ``low`` is ``20/255``, and default
               value for ``high`` is ``50/255``.

            ``radius``
               Define the radius to search around an edge pixel for
               local maxima.

            ``block_pct``
               Determine blurriness only for the most significant
               blocks, given in percentage.

            ``block_width``
               Determine blurriness for blocks of width ``block_width``.
               If set to any value smaller 1, no blocks are used and the
               whole image is processed as one no matter of
               ``block_height``.

            ``block_height``
               Determine blurriness for blocks of height
               ``block_height``. If set to any value smaller 1, no
               blocks are used and the whole image is processed as one
               no matter of ``block_width``.

            The filter accepts the following options.

            ``sigma``
               Set denoising strength. Default value is 1. Allowed range
               is from 0 to 999.9. The denoising algorithm is very
               sensitive to sigma, so adjust it according to the source.

            ``block``
               Set local patch size. This sets dimensions in 2D.

            ``bstep``
               Set sliding step for processing blocks. Default value is
               4. Allowed range is from 1 to 64. Smaller values allows
               processing more reference blocks and is slower.

            ``group``
               Set maximal number of similar blocks for 3rd dimension.
               Default value is 1. When set to 1, no block matching is
               done. Larger values allows more blocks in single group.
               Allowed range is from 1 to 256.

            ``range``
               Set radius for search block matching. Default is 9.
               Allowed range is from 1 to INT32_MAX.

            ``mstep``
               Set step between two search locations for block matching.
               Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64. Smaller is
               slower.

            ``thmse``
               Set threshold of mean square error for block matching.
               Valid range is 0 to INT32_MAX.

            ``hdthr``
               Set thresholding parameter for hard thresholding in 3D
               transformed domain. Larger values results in stronger
               hard-thresholding filtering in frequency domain.

            ``estim``
               Set filtering estimation mode. Can be ``basic`` or
               ``final``. Default is ``basic``.

            ``ref``
               If enabled, filter will use 2nd stream for block
               matching. Default is disabled for ``basic`` value of
               ``estim`` option, and always enabled if value of
               ``estim`` is ``final``.

            ``planes``
               Set planes to filter. Default is all available except
               alpha.

               Set an expression for the box radius in pixels used for
               blurring the corresponding input plane.

               The radius value must be a non-negative number, and must
               not be greater than the value of the expression
               ``min(w,h)/2`` for the luma and alpha planes, and of
               ``min(cw,ch)/2`` for the chroma planes.

               Default value for ``luma_radius`` is "2". If not
               specified, ``chroma_radius`` and ``alpha_radius`` default
               to the corresponding value set for ``luma_radius``.

               The expressions can contain the following constants:

               ``w``
               ``h``
                  The input width and height in pixels.

               ``ch``
                  The input chroma image width and height in pixels.

               ``hsub``
               ``vsub``
                  The horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values.
                  For example, for the pixel format "yuv422p", ``hsub``
                  is 2 and ``vsub`` is 1.

            ``luma_power, lp``
            ``chroma_power, cp``
            ``alpha_power, ap``
               Specify how many times the boxblur filter is applied to
               the corresponding plane.

               Default value for ``luma_power`` is 2. If not specified,
               ``chroma_power`` and ``alpha_power`` default to the
               corresponding value set for ``luma_power``.

               A value of 0 will disable the effect.

            RGB colorspace color keying. This filter operates on 8-bit
            RGB format frames by setting the alpha component of each
            pixel which falls within the similarity radius of the key
            color to 0. The alpha value for pixels outside the
            similarity radius depends on the value of the blend option.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``color``
               Set the color for which alpha will be set to 0 (full
               transparency). See `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the
               ffmpeg-utils manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__.
               Default is ``black``.

            ``similarity``
               Set the radius from the key color within which other
               colors also have full transparency. The computed distance
               is related to the unit fractional distance in 3D space
               between the RGB values of the key color and the pixel’s
               color. Range is 0.01 to 1.0. 0.01 matches within a very
               small radius around the exact key color, while 1.0
               matches everything. Default is ``0.01``.

            ``blend``
               Set how the alpha value for pixels that fall outside the
               similarity radius is computed. 0.0 makes pixels either
               fully transparent or fully opaque. Higher values result
               in semi-transparent pixels, with greater transparency the
               more similar the pixel color is to the key color. Range
               is 0.0 to 1.0. Default is ``0.0``.

            Remove all color information for all RGB colors except for
            certain one.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``color``
               The color which will not be replaced with neutral gray.

            ``similarity``
               Similarity percentage with the above color. 0.01 matches
               only the exact key color, while 1.0 matches everything.

            ``blend``
               Blend percentage. 0.0 makes pixels fully gray. Higher
               values result in more preserved color.

            Override input transfer characteristics. Same accepted
            values as `trc <#trc>`__.

            ``irange``
            Override input color range. Same accepted values as
            `range <#range>`__.

            The filter converts the transfer characteristics, color
            space and color primaries to the specified user values. The
            output value, if not specified, is set to a default value
            based on the "all" property. If that property is also not
            specified, the filter will log an error. The output color
            range and format default to the same value as the input
            color range and format. The input transfer characteristics,
            color space, color primaries and color range should be set
            on the input data. If any of these are missing, the filter
            will log an error and no conversion will take place.

            For example to convert the input to SMPTE-240M, use the
            command:

            .. container:: example

            color range conversion between jpeg/full and mpeg/limited

            Video filtering on GPU using Apple’s CoreImage API on OSX.

            Hardware acceleration is based on an OpenGL context.
            Usually, this means it is processed by video hardware.
            However, software-based OpenGL implementations exist which
            means there is no guarantee for hardware processing. It
            depends on the respective OSX.

            There are many filters and image generators provided by
            Apple that come with a large variety of options. The filter
            has to be referenced by its name along with its options.

            The coreimage filter accepts the following options:

            ``list_filters``
               List all available filters and generators along with all
               their respective options as well as possible minimum and
               maximum values along with the default values.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     list_filters=true

            ``filter``
               Specify all filters by their respective name and options.
               Use ``list_filters`` to determine all valid filter names
               and options. Numerical options are specified by a float
               value and are automatically clamped to their respective
               value range. Vector and color options have to be
               specified by a list of space separated float values.
               Character escaping has to be done. A special option name
               ``default`` is available to use default options for a
               filter.

               It is required to specify either ``default`` or at least
               one of the filter options. All omitted options are used
               with their default values. The syntax of the filter
               string is as follows:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     filter=<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...][#<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...]][#...]

            ``output_rect``
               Specify a rectangle where the output of the filter chain
               is copied into the input image. It is given by a list of
               space separated float values:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     output_rect=x\ y\ width\ height

               If not given, the output rectangle equals the dimensions
               of the input image. The output rectangle is automatically
               cropped at the borders of the input image. Negative
               values are valid for each component.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     output_rect=25\ 25\ 100\ 100

            Several filters can be chained for successive processing
            without GPU-HOST transfers allowing for fast processing of
            complex filter chains. Currently, only filters with zero
            (generators) or exactly one (filters) input image and one
            output image are supported. Also, transition filters are not
            yet usable as intended.

            Some filters generate output images with additional padding
            depending on the respective filter kernel. The padding is
            automatically removed to ensure the filter output has the
            same size as the input image.

            For image generators, the size of the output image is
            determined by the previous output image of the filter chain
            or the input image of the whole filterchain, respectively.
            The generators do not use the pixel information of this
            image to generate their output. However, the generated
            output is blended onto this image, resulting in partial or
            complete coverage of the output image.

            The `coreimagesrc <#coreimagesrc>`__ video source can be
            used for generating input images which are directly fed into
            the filter chain. By using it, providing input images by
            another video source or an input video is not required.

            Obtain the correlation between two input videos.

            This filter takes two input videos.

            Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel
            format for this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes
            that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are
            compared one by one.

            The obtained per component, average, min and max correlation
            is printed through the logging system.

            The filter stores the calculated correlation of each frame
            in frame metadata.

            Crop the input video to given dimensions.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``w, out_w``
               The width of the output video. It defaults to ``iw``.
               This expression is evaluated only once during the filter
               configuration, or when the ‘\ ``w``\ ’ or ‘\ ``out_w``\ ’
               command is sent.

            ``h, out_h``
               The height of the output video. It defaults to ``ih``.
               This expression is evaluated only once during the filter
               configuration, or when the ‘\ ``h``\ ’ or ‘\ ``out_h``\ ’
               command is sent.

            ``x``
               The horizontal position, in the input video, of the left
               edge of the output video. It defaults to
               ``(in_w-out_w)/2``. This expression is evaluated
               per-frame.

            ``y``
               The vertical position, in the input video, of the top
               edge of the output video. It defaults to
               ``(in_h-out_h)/2``. This expression is evaluated
               per-frame.

            ``keep_aspect``
               If set to 1 will force the output display aspect ratio to
               be the same of the input, by changing the output sample
               aspect ratio. It defaults to 0.

            ``exact``
               Enable exact cropping. If enabled, subsampled videos will
               be cropped at exact width/height/x/y as specified and
               will not be rounded to nearest smaller value. It defaults
               to 0.

            The ``out_w``, ``out_h``, ``x``, ``y`` parameters are
            expressions containing the following constants:

            ``x``
            ``y``
               The computed values for ``x`` and ``y``. They are
               evaluated for each new frame.

            ``in_w``
            ``in_h``
               The input width and height.

            ``iw``
            ``ih``
               These are the same as ``in_w`` and ``in_h``.

            ``out_w``
            ``out_h``
               The output (cropped) width and height.

            ``ow``
            ``oh``
               These are the same as ``out_w`` and ``out_h``.

            ``a``
               same as ``iw`` / ``ih``

            ``sar``
               input sample aspect ratio

            ``dar``
               input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (``iw`` /
               ``ih``) \* ``sar``

            ``hsub``
            ``vsub``
               horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For
               example for the pixel format "yuv422p" ``hsub`` is 2 and
               ``vsub`` is 1.

            ``n``
               The number of the input frame, starting from 0.

            ``pos``
               the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if
               unknown; deprecated, do not use

            ``t``
               The timestamp expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if the input
               timestamp is unknown.

            The expression for ``out_w`` may depend on the value of
            ``out_h``, and the expression for ``out_h`` may depend on
            ``out_w``, but they cannot depend on ``x`` and ``y``, as
            ``x`` and ``y`` are evaluated after ``out_w`` and ``out_h``.

            The ``x`` and ``y`` parameters specify the expressions for
            the position of the top-left corner of the output
            (non-cropped) area. They are evaluated for each frame. If
            the evaluated value is not valid, it is approximated to the
            nearest valid value.

            The expression for ``x`` may depend on ``y``, and the
            expression for ``y`` may depend on ``x``.

            .. rubric:: 30.51 cropdetect
               :class: section

            Auto-detect the crop size.

            It calculates the necessary cropping parameters and prints
            the recommended parameters via the logging system. The
            detected dimensions correspond to the non-black or video
            area of the input video according to ``mode``.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``mode``
               Depending on ``mode`` crop detection is based on either
               the mere black value of surrounding pixels or a
               combination of motion vectors and edge pixels.

               ‘\ ``black``\ ’
                  Detect black pixels surrounding the playing video. For
                  fine control use option ``limit``.

               ‘\ ``mvedges``\ ’
                  Detect the playing video by the motion vectors inside
                  the video and scanning for edge pixels typically
                  forming the border of a playing video.

            ``limit``
               Set higher black value threshold, which can be optionally
               specified from nothing (0) to everything (255 for 8-bit
               based formats). An intensity value greater to the set
               value is considered non-black. It defaults to 24. You can
               also specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which will be
               scaled depending on the bitdepth of the pixel format.

            ``round``
               The value which the width/height should be divisible by.
               It defaults to 16. The offset is automatically adjusted
               to center the video. Use 2 to get only even dimensions
               (needed for 4:2:2 video). 16 is best when encoding to
               most video codecs.

            ``skip``
               Set the number of initial frames for which evaluation is
               skipped. Default is 2. Range is 0 to INT_MAX.

            ``reset_count, reset``
               Set the counter that determines after how many frames
               cropdetect will reset the previously detected largest
               video area and start over to detect the current optimal
               crop area. Default value is 0.

               This can be useful when channel logos distort the video
               area. 0 indicates ’never reset’, and returns the largest
               area encountered during playback.

            ``mv_threshold``
               Set motion in pixel units as threshold for motion
               detection. It defaults to 8.

            ``low``
            ``high``
               Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny
               thresholding algorithm.

               The high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels,
               which are then connected through 8-connectivity with the
               "weak" edge pixels selected by the low threshold.

               ``low`` and ``high`` threshold values must be chosen in
               the range [0,1], and ``low`` should be lesser or equal to
               ``high``.

               Default value for ``low`` is ``5/255``, and default value
               for ``high`` is ``15/255``.

               :class: section

            Delay video filtering until a given wallclock timestamp. The
            filter first passes on ``preroll`` amount of frames, then it
            buffers at most ``buffer`` amount of frames and waits for
            the cue. After reaching the cue it forwards the buffered
            frames and also any subsequent frames coming in its input.

            The filter can be used synchronize the output of multiple
            ffmpeg processes for realtime output devices like decklink.
            By putting the delay in the filtering chain and
            pre-buffering frames the process can pass on data to output
            almost immediately after the target wallclock timestamp is
            reached.

            Perfect frame accuracy cannot be guaranteed, but the result
            is good enough for some use cases.

            ``cue``
               The cue timestamp expressed in a UNIX timestamp in
               microseconds. Default is 0.

            ``preroll``
               The duration of content to pass on as preroll expressed
               in seconds. Default is 0.

            ``buffer``
               The maximum duration of content to buffer before waiting
               for the cue expressed in seconds. Default is 0.

            This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop and GIMP
            curves tools. Each component (red, green and blue) has its
            values defined by ``N`` key points tied from each other
            using a smooth curve. The x-axis represents the pixel values
            from the input frame, and the y-axis the new pixel values to
            be set for the output frame.

            By default, a component curve is defined by the two points
            ``(0;0)`` and ``(1;1)``. This creates a straight line where
            each original pixel value is "adjusted" to its own value,
            which means no change to the image.

            The filter allows you to redefine these two points and add
            some more. A new curve will be define to pass smoothly
            through all these new coordinates. The new defined points
            needs to be strictly increasing over the x-axis, and their
            ``x`` and ``y`` values must be in the ``[0;1]`` interval.
            The curve is formed by using a natural or monotonic cubic
            spline interpolation, depending on the ``interp`` option
            (default: ``natural``). The ``natural`` spline produces a
            smoother curve in general while the monotonic (``pchip``)
            spline guarantees the transitions between the specified
            points to be monotonic. If the computed curves happened to
            go outside the vector spaces, the values will be clipped
            accordingly.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``preset``
            Select one of the available color presets. This option can
            be used in addition to the ``r``, ``g``, ``b`` parameters;
            in this case, the later options takes priority on the preset
            values. Available presets are:

            ‘\ ``none``\ ’
            ‘\ ``color_negative``\ ’
            ‘\ ``cross_process``\ ’
            ‘\ ``darker``\ ’
            ‘\ ``increase_contrast``\ ’
            ‘\ ``lighter``\ ’
            ‘\ ``linear_contrast``\ ’
            ‘\ ``medium_contrast``\ ’
            ‘\ ``negative``\ ’
            ‘\ ``strong_contrast``\ ’
            ‘\ ``vintage``\ ’
            Default is ``none``.

            ``master, m``
            Set the master key points. These points will define a second
            pass mapping. It is sometimes called a "luminance" or
            "value" mapping. It can be used with ``r``, ``g``, ``b`` or
            ``all`` since it acts like a post-processing LUT.

            ``red, r``
            Set the key points for the red component.

            ``green, g``
            Set the key points for the green component.

            ``blue, b``
            Set the key points for the blue component.

            ``all``
            Set the key points for all components (not including
            master). Can be used in addition to the other key points
            component options. In this case, the unset component(s) will
            fallback on this ``all`` setting.

            ``psfile``
            Specify a Photoshop curves file (``.acv``) to import the
            settings from.

            ``plot``
            Save Gnuplot script of the curves in specified file.

            ``interp``
            Specify the kind of interpolation. Available algorithms are:

            ‘\ ``natural``\ ’
               Natural cubic spline using a piece-wise cubic polynomial
               that is twice continuously differentiable.

            ‘\ ``pchip``\ ’
               Monotonic cubic spline using a piecewise cubic Hermite
               interpolating polynomial (PCHIP).

            To avoid some filtergraph syntax conflicts, each key points
            list need to be defined using the following syntax:
            ``x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ...``.

                  Here we obtain the following coordinates for each

            Denoise frames using 2D DCT (frequency domain filtering).

            This filter is not designed for real time.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``sigma, s``
               Set the noise sigma constant.

               This ``sigma`` defines a hard threshold of ``3 * sigma``;
               every DCT coefficient (absolute value) below this
               threshold with be dropped.

               If you need a more advanced filtering, see ``expr``.

               Default is ``0``.

            ``overlap``
               Set number overlapping pixels for each block. Since the
               filter can be slow, you may want to reduce this value, at
               the cost of a less effective filter and the risk of
               various artefacts.

               If the overlapping value doesn’t permit processing the
               whole input width or height, a warning will be displayed
               and according borders won’t be denoised.

               Default value is ``blocksize``-1, which is the best
               possible setting.

            ``expr, e``
               Set the coefficient factor expression.

               For each coefficient of a DCT block, this expression will
               be evaluated as a multiplier value for the coefficient.

               If this is option is set, the ``sigma`` option will be
               ignored.

               The absolute value of the coefficient can be accessed
               through the ``c`` variable.

            ``n``
               Set the ``blocksize`` using the number of bits.
               ``1<<``\ ``n`` defines the ``blocksize``, which is the
               width and height of the processed blocks.

               The default value is ``3`` (8x8) and can be raised to
               ``4`` for a ``blocksize`` of 16x16. Note that changing
               this setting has huge consequences on the speed
               processing. Also, a larger block size does not
               necessarily means a better de-noising.

            Remove banding artifacts from input video. It works by
            replacing banded pixels with average value of referenced
            pixels.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``1thr``
            ``2thr``
            ``3thr``
            ``4thr``
               Set banding detection threshold for each plane. Default
               is 0.02. Valid range is 0.00003 to 0.5. If difference
               between current pixel and reference pixel is less than
               threshold, it will be considered as banded.

            ``range, r``
               Banding detection range in pixels. Default is 16. If
               positive, random number in range 0 to set value will be
               used. If negative, exact absolute value will be used. The
               range defines square of four pixels around current pixel.

            ``direction, d``
               Set direction in radians from which four pixel will be
               compared. If positive, random direction from 0 to set
               direction will be picked. If negative, exact of absolute
               value will be picked. For example direction 0, -PI or
               -2*PI radians will pick only pixels on same row and -PI/2
               will pick only pixels on same column.

            ``blur, b``
               If enabled, current pixel is compared with average value
               of all four surrounding pixels. The default is enabled.
               If disabled current pixel is compared with all four
               surrounding pixels. The pixel is considered banded if
               only all four differences with surrounding pixels are
               less than threshold.

            ``coupling, c``
               If enabled, current pixel is changed if and only if all
               pixel components are banded, e.g. banding detection
               threshold is triggered for all color components. The
               default is disabled.

               Set blocking detection thresholds. Allowed range is 0 to
               1. Defaults are: ``0.098`` for ``alpha`` and ``0.05`` for
               the rest. Using higher threshold gives more deblocking
               strength. Setting ``alpha`` controls threshold detection
               at exact edge of block. Remaining options controls
               threshold detection near the edge. Each one for
               below/above or left/right. Setting any of those to ``0``
               disables deblocking.

            ``planes``
               Set planes to filter. Default is to filter all available
               planes.

            Drop duplicated frames at regular intervals.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``cycle``
               Set the number of frames from which one will be dropped.
               Setting this to ``N`` means one frame in every batch of
               ``N`` frames will be dropped. Default is ``5``.

            ``dupthresh``
               Set the threshold for duplicate detection. If the
               difference metric for a frame is less than or equal to
               this value, then it is declared as duplicate. Default is
               ``1.1``

            ``scthresh``
               Set scene change threshold. Default is ``15``.

            ``blockx``
            ``blocky``
               Set the size of the x and y-axis blocks used during
               metric calculations. Larger blocks give better noise
               suppression, but also give worse detection of small
               movements. Must be a power of two. Default is ``32``.

            ``ppsrc``
               Mark main input as a pre-processed input and activate
               clean source input stream. This allows the input to be
               pre-processed with various filters to help the metrics
               calculation while keeping the frame selection lossless.
               When set to ``1``, the first stream is for the
               pre-processed input, and the second stream is the clean
               source from where the kept frames are chosen. Default is
               ``0``.

            ``chroma``
               Set whether or not chroma is considered in the metric
               calculations. Default is ``1``.

            ``mixed``
               Set whether or not the input only partially contains
               content to be decimated. Default is ``false``. If enabled
               video output stream will be in variable frame rate.

            using second stream as impulse.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``planes``
               Set which planes to process.

            ``impulse``
               Set which impulse video frames will be processed, can be
               ``first`` or ``all``. Default is ``all``.

            ``noise``
               Set noise when doing divisions. Default is ``0.0000001``.
               Useful when width and height are not same and not power
               of 2 or if stream prior to convolving had noise.

            (rainbows) from video.

            It accepts the following options:

            ``m``
               Set mode of operation. Can be combination of ``dotcrawl``
               for cross-luminance reduction and/or ``rainbows`` for
               cross-color reduction.

            ``lt``
               Set spatial luma threshold. Lower values increases
               reduction of cross-luminance.

            ``tl``
               Set tolerance for temporal luma. Higher values increases
               reduction of cross-luminance.

            ``tc``
               Set tolerance for chroma temporal variation. Higher
               values increases reduction of cross-color.

            ``ct``
               Set temporal chroma threshold. Lower values increases
               reduction of cross-color.

            Remove judder produced by partially interlaced telecined
            content.

            Judder can be introduced, for instance, by
            `pullup <#pullup>`__ filter. If the original source was
            partially telecined content then the output of
            ``pullup,dejudder`` will have a variable frame rate. May
            change the recorded frame rate of the container. Aside from
            that change, this filter will not affect constant frame rate
            video.

            The option available in this filter is:

            ``cycle``
               Specify the length of the window over which the judder
               repeats.

               Accepts any integer greater than 1. Useful values are:

               ‘\ ``4``\ ’
                  If the original was telecined from 24 to 30 fps (Film
                  to NTSC).

               ‘\ ``5``\ ’
                  If the original was telecined from 25 to 30 fps (PAL
                  to NTSC).

               ‘\ ``20``\ ’
                  If a mixture of the two.

            Suppress a TV station logo by a simple interpolation of the
            surrounding pixels. Just set a rectangle covering the logo
            and watch it disappear (and sometimes something even uglier
            appear - your mileage may vary).

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``x``
            ``y``
               Specify the top left corner coordinates of the logo. They
               must be specified.

            ``w``
            ``h``
               Specify the width and height of the logo to clear. They
               must be specified.

            ``show``
               When set to 1, a green rectangle is drawn on the screen
               to simplify finding the right ``x``, ``y``, ``w``, and
               ``h`` parameters. The default value is 0.

               The rectangle is drawn on the outermost pixels which will
               be (partly) replaced with interpolated values. The values
               of the next pixels immediately outside this rectangle in
               each direction will be used to compute the interpolated
               pixel values inside the rectangle.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``filter_type``
               Specify which filter to use. This option accepts the
               following values:

               ‘\ ``derain``\ ’
                  Derain filter. To conduct derain filter, you need to
                  use a derain model.

               ‘\ ``dehaze``\ ’
                  Dehaze filter. To conduct dehaze filter, you need to
                  use a dehaze model.

               Default value is ‘\ ``derain``\ ’.

            ``dnn_backend``
               Specify which DNN backend to use for model loading and
               execution. This option accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``tensorflow``\ ’
                  TensorFlow backend. To enable this backend you need to
                  install the TensorFlow for C library (see
                  https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c) and
                  configure FFmpeg with ``--enable-libtensorflow``

            ``model``
               Set path to model file specifying network architecture
               and its parameters. Note that different backends use
               different file formats. TensorFlow can load files for
               only its format.

            Attempt to fix small changes in horizontal and/or vertical
            shift. This filter helps remove camera shake from
            hand-holding a camera, bumping a tripod, moving on a
            vehicle, etc.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``x``
            ``y``
            ``w``
            ``h``
               Specify a rectangular area where to limit the search for
               motion vectors. If desired the search for motion vectors
               can be limited to a rectangular area of the frame defined
               by its top left corner, width and height. These
               parameters have the same meaning as the drawbox filter
               which can be used to visualise the position of the
               bounding box.

               This is useful when simultaneous movement of subjects
               within the frame might be confused for camera motion by
               the motion vector search.

               If any or all of ``x``, ``y``, ``w`` and ``h`` are set to
               -1 then the full frame is used. This allows later options
               to be set without specifying the bounding box for the
               motion vector search.

               Default - search the whole frame.

            ``rx``
            ``ry``
               Specify the maximum extent of movement in x and y
               directions in the range 0-64 pixels. Default 16.

            ``edge``
               Specify how to generate pixels to fill blanks at the edge
               of the frame. Available values are:

               Specify the color of the box to write. For the general
               syntax of this option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color"
               section in the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__. If the
               special value ``invert`` is used, the box edge color is
               the same as the video with inverted luma.

            ``thickness, t``
               The expression which sets the thickness of the box edge.
               A value of ``fill`` will create a filled box. Default
               value is ``3``.

               See below for the list of accepted constants.

            ``replace``
               Applicable if the input has alpha. With value ``1``, the
               pixels of the painted box will overwrite the video’s
               color and alpha pixels. Default is ``0``, which
               composites the box onto the input, leaving the video’s
               alpha intact.

            The parameters for ``x``, ``y``, ``w`` and ``h`` and ``t``
            are expressions containing the following constants:

            ``dar``
               The input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (``w``
               / ``h``) \* ``sar``.

            ``hsub``
            ``vsub``
               horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For
               example for the pixel format "yuv422p" ``hsub`` is 2 and
               ``vsub`` is 1.

            ``in_h, ih``
            ``in_w, iw``
               The input width and height.

            ``sar``
               The input sample aspect ratio.

            ``x``
            ``y``
               The x and y offset coordinates where the box is drawn.

            ``w``
            ``h``
               The width and height of the drawn box.

            ``box_source``
               Box source can be set as side_data_detection_bboxes if
               you want to use box data in detection bboxes of side
               data.

               If ``box_source`` is set, the ``x``, ``y``, ``width`` and
               ``height`` will be ignored and still use box data in
               detection bboxes of side data. So please do not use this
               parameter if you were not sure about the box source.

            ``t``
               The thickness of the drawn box.

               These constants allow the ``x``, ``y``, ``w``, ``h`` and
               ``t`` expressions to refer to each other, so you may for
               example specify ``y=x/dar`` or ``h=w/dar``.

               :class: section

            Draw a grid on the input image.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``x``
            ``y``
               The expressions which specify the coordinates of some
               point of grid intersection (meant to configure offset).
               Both default to 0.

            ``width, w``
            ``height, h``
               The expressions which specify the width and height of the
               grid cell, if 0 they are interpreted as the input width
               and height, respectively, minus ``thickness``, so image
               gets framed. Default to 0.

            ``color, c``
               Specify the color of the grid. For the general syntax of
               this option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in
               the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__. If the
               special value ``invert`` is used, the grid color is the
               same as the video with inverted luma.

            ``thickness, t``
               The expression which sets the thickness of the grid line.
               Default value is ``1``.

               See below for the list of accepted constants.

            ``replace``
               Applicable if the input has alpha. With ``1`` the pixels
               of the painted grid will overwrite the video’s color and
               alpha pixels. Default is ``0``, which composites the grid
               onto the input, leaving the video’s alpha intact.

            The parameters for ``x``, ``y``, ``w`` and ``h`` and ``t``
            are expressions containing the following constants:

            ``dar``
               The input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (``w``
               / ``h``) \* ``sar``.

            ``hsub``
            ``vsub``
               horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For
               example for the pixel format "yuv422p" ``hsub`` is 2 and
               ``vsub`` is 1.

            ``in_h, ih``
            ``in_w, iw``
               The input grid cell width and height.

            ``sar``
               The input sample aspect ratio.

            ``x``
            ``y``
               The x and y coordinates of some point of grid
               intersection (meant to configure offset).

            ``w``
            ``h``
               The width and height of the drawn cell.

            ``t``
               The thickness of the drawn cell.

               These constants allow the ``x``, ``y``, ``w``, ``h`` and
               ``t`` expressions to refer to each other, so you may for
               example specify ``y=x/dar`` or ``h=w/dar``.

               tab characters are only supported with the left
               horizontal alignment.

               ``y_align``
               Specify what the ``y`` value is referred to. Possible
               values are:

               -  ``text`` the top of the highest glyph of the first
                  text line is placed at ``y``
               -  ``baseline`` the baseline of the first text line is
                  placed at ``y``
               -  ``font`` the baseline of the first text line is placed
                  at ``y`` plus the ascent (in pixels) defined in the
                  font metrics

               The default value of ``y_align`` is "text" for backward
               compatibility.

               ``borderw``
               Set the width of the border to be drawn around the text
               using ``bordercolor``. The default value of ``borderw``
               is 0.

               ``bordercolor``
               Set the color to be used for drawing border around text.
               For the syntax of this option, check the
               `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__.

               The default value of ``bordercolor`` is "black".

               ``expansion``
               Select how the ``text`` is expanded. Can be either
               ``none``, ``strftime`` (deprecated) or ``normal``
               (default). See the `Text
               expansion <#drawtext_005fexpansion>`__ section below for
               details.

               ``basetime``
               Set a start time for the count. Value is in microseconds.
               Only applied in the deprecated ``strftime`` expansion
               mode. To emulate in normal expansion mode use the ``pts``
               function, supplying the start time (in seconds) as the
               second argument.

               ``fix_bounds``
               If true, check and fix text coords to avoid clipping.

               ``fontcolor``
               The color to be used for drawing fonts. For the syntax of
               this option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in
               the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__.

               The default value of ``fontcolor`` is "black".

               ``fontcolor_expr``
               String which is expanded the same way as ``text`` to
               obtain dynamic ``fontcolor`` value. By default this
               option has empty value and is not processed. When this
               option is set, it overrides ``fontcolor`` option.

               ``font``
               The font family to be used for drawing text. By default
               Sans.

               ``fontfile``
               The font file to be used for drawing text. The path must
               be included. This parameter is mandatory if the
               fontconfig support is disabled.

               ``alpha``
               Draw the text applying alpha blending. The value can be a
               number between 0.0 and 1.0. The expression accepts the
               same variables ``x, y`` as well. The default value is 1.
               Please see ``fontcolor_expr``.

               ``fontsize``
               The font size to be used for drawing text. The default
               value of ``fontsize`` is 16.

               ``text_shaping``
               If set to 1, attempt to shape the text (for example,
               reverse the order of right-to-left text and join Arabic
               characters) before drawing it. Otherwise, just draw the
               text exactly as given. By default 1 (if supported).

               ``ft_load_flags``
               The flags to be used for loading the fonts.

               The flags map the corresponding flags supported by
               libfreetype, and are a combination of the following
               values:

               ``default``
               ``no_scale``
               ``no_hinting``
               ``render``

               ``vertical_layout``
               ``force_autohint``
               ``crop_bitmap``
               ``pedantic``
               ``ignore_global_advance_width``
               ``no_recurse``
               ``ignore_transform``
               ``monochrome``
               ``linear_design``
               ``no_autohint``
               Default value is "default".

               For more information consult the documentation for the
               FT_LOAD\_\* libfreetype flags.

               ``shadowcolor``
               The color to be used for drawing a shadow behind the
               drawn text. For the syntax of this option, check the
               `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__.

               The default value of ``shadowcolor`` is "black".

               ``boxw``
               Set the width of the box to be drawn around text. The
               default value of ``boxw`` is computed automatically to
               match the text width

               ``boxh``
               Set the height of the box to be drawn around text. The
               default value of ``boxh`` is computed automatically to
               match the text height

               ``shadowx``
               ``shadowy``
               The x and y offsets for the text shadow position with
               respect to the position of the text. They can be either
               positive or negative values. The default value for both
               is "0".

               ``start_number``
               The starting frame number for the n/frame_num variable.
               The default value is "0".

               ``tabsize``
               The size in number of spaces to use for rendering the
               tab. Default value is 4.

               ``timecode``
               Set the initial timecode representation in
               "hh:mm:ss[:;.]ff" format. It can be used with or without
               text parameter. ``timecode_rate`` option must be
               specified.

               ``timecode_rate, rate, r``
               Set the timecode frame rate (timecode only). Value will
               be rounded to nearest integer. Minimum value is "1".
               Drop-frame timecode is supported for frame rates 30 & 60.

               ``tc24hmax``
               If set to 1, the output of the timecode option will wrap
               around at 24 hours. Default is 0 (disabled).

               ``text``
               The text string to be drawn. The text must be a sequence
               of UTF-8 encoded characters. This parameter is mandatory
               if no file is specified with the parameter ``textfile``.

               ``textfile``
               A text file containing text to be drawn. The text must be
               a sequence of UTF-8 encoded characters.

               This parameter is mandatory if no text string is
               specified with the parameter ``text``.

               If both ``text`` and ``textfile`` are specified, an error
               is thrown.

               ``text_source``
               Text source should be set as side_data_detection_bboxes
               if you want to use text data in detection bboxes of side
               data.

               If text source is set, ``text`` and ``textfile`` will be
               ignored and still use text data in detection bboxes of
               side data. So please do not use this parameter if you are
               not sure about the text source.

               ``reload``
               The ``textfile`` will be reloaded at specified frame
               interval. Be sure to update ``textfile`` atomically, or
               it may be read partially, or even fail. Range is 0 to
               INT_MAX. Default is 0.

               ``x``
               ``y``
               The expressions which specify the offsets where text will
               be drawn within the video frame. They are relative to the
               top/left border of the output image.

               The default value of ``x`` and ``y`` is "0".

               See below for the list of accepted constants and
               functions.

               The parameters for ``x`` and ``y`` are expressions
               containing the following constants and functions:

               ``dar``
                  input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (``w`` /
                  ``h``) \* ``sar``

               ``hsub``
               ``vsub``
                  horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For
                  example for the pixel format "yuv422p" ``hsub`` is 2
                  and ``vsub`` is 1.

               ``line_h, lh``
                  the height of each text line

               ``main_h, h, H``
                  the input height

               ``main_w, w, W``
                  the input width

               ``max_glyph_a, ascent``
                  the maximum distance from the baseline to the
                  highest/upper grid coordinate used to place a glyph
                  outline point, for all the rendered glyphs. It is a
                  positive value, due to the grid’s orientation with the
                  Y axis upwards.

               ``max_glyph_d, descent``
                  the maximum distance from the baseline to the lowest
                  grid coordinate used to place a glyph outline point,
                  for all the rendered glyphs. This is a negative value,
                  due to the grid’s orientation, with the Y axis
                  upwards.

               ``max_glyph_h``
                  maximum glyph height, that is the maximum height for
                  all the glyphs contained in the rendered text, it is
                  equivalent to ``ascent`` - ``descent``.

               ``max_glyph_w``
                  maximum glyph width, that is the maximum width for all
                  the glyphs contained in the rendered text

               ``font_a``
                  the ascent size defined in the font metrics

               ``font_d``
                  the descent size defined in the font metrics

               ``top_a``
                  the maximum ascender of the glyphs of the first text
                  line

               ``bottom_d``
                  the maximum descender of the glyphs of the last text
                  line

               ``n``
                  the number of input frame, starting from 0

               ``rand(min, max)``
                  return a random number included between ``min`` and
                  ``max``

               ``sar``
                  The input sample aspect ratio.

               ``t``
                  timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input
                  timestamp is unknown

               ``text_h, th``
                  the height of the rendered text

               ``text_w, tw``
                  the width of the rendered text

               ``x``
               ``y``
                  the x and y offset coordinates where the text is
                  drawn.

                  These parameters allow the ``x`` and ``y`` expressions
                  to refer to each other, so you can for example specify
                  ``y=x/dar``.

               ``pict_type``
                  A one character description of the current frame’s
                  picture type.

               ``pkt_pos``
                  The current packet’s position in the input file or
                  stream (in bytes, from the start of the input). A
                  value of -1 indicates this info is not available.

               ``duration``
                  The current packet’s duration, in seconds.

               ``pkt_size``
                  The current packet’s size (in bytes).

                  :class: subsection

               If ``expansion`` is set to ``strftime``, the filter
               recognizes sequences accepted by the ``strftime`` C
               function in the provided text and expands them
               accordingly. Check the documentation of ``strftime``.
               This feature is deprecated in favor of ``normal``
               expansion with the ``gmtime`` or ``localtime`` expansion
               functions.

               If ``expansion`` is set to ``none``, the text is printed
               verbatim.

               If ``expansion`` is set to ``normal`` (which is the
               default), the following expansion mechanism is used.

               The backslash character ‘\ ``\``\ ’, followed by any
               character, always expands to the second character.

               Sequences of the form ``%{...}`` are expanded. The text
               between the braces is a function name, possibly followed
               by arguments separated by ’:’. If the arguments contain
               special characters or delimiters (’:’ or ’}’), they
               should be escaped.

               Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value
               for the ``text`` option in the filter argument string and
               as the filter argument in the filtergraph description,
               and possibly also for the shell, that makes up to four
               levels of escaping; using a text file with the
               ``textfile`` option avoids these problems.

               The following functions are available:

               ``expr, e``
                  The expression evaluation result.

                  It must take one argument specifying the expression to
                  be evaluated, which accepts the same constants and
                  functions as the ``x`` and ``y`` values. Note that not
                  all constants should be used, for example the text
                  size is not known when evaluating the expression, so
                  the constants ``text_w`` and ``text_h`` will have an
                  undefined value.

               ``expr_int_format, eif``
                  Evaluate the expression’s value and output as
                  formatted integer.

                  The first argument is the expression to be evaluated,
                  just as for the ``expr`` function. The second argument
                  specifies the output format. Allowed values are
                  ‘\ ``x``\ ’, ‘\ ``X``\ ’, ‘\ ``d``\ ’ and ‘\ ``u``\ ’.
                  They are treated exactly as in the ``printf``
                  function. The third parameter is optional and sets the
                  number of positions taken by the output. It can be
                  used to add padding with zeros from the left.

               ``gmtime``
                  The time at which the filter is running, expressed in
                  UTC. It can accept an argument: a ``strftime`` C
                  function format string. The format string is extended
                  to support the variable ``%[1-6]N`` which prints
                  fractions of the second with optionally specified
                  number of digits.

               ``localtime``
                  The time at which the filter is running, expressed in
                  the local time zone. It can accept an argument: a
                  ``strftime`` C function format string. The format
                  string is extended to support the variable ``%[1-6]N``
                  which prints fractions of the second with optionally
                  specified number of digits.

               ``metadata``
                  Frame metadata. Takes one or two arguments.

                  The first argument is mandatory and specifies the
                  metadata key.

                  The second argument is optional and specifies a
                  default value, used when the metadata key is not found
                  or empty.

                  Available metadata can be identified by inspecting
                  entries starting with TAG included within each frame
                  section printed by running ``ffprobe -show_frames``.

                  String metadata generated in filters leading to the
                  drawtext filter are also available.

               ``n, frame_num``
                  The frame number, starting from 0.

               ``pict_type``
                  A one character description of the current picture
                  type.

               ``pts``
                  The timestamp of the current frame. It can take up to
                  three arguments.

                  The first argument is the format of the timestamp; it
                  defaults to ``flt`` for seconds as a decimal number
                  with microsecond accuracy; ``hms`` stands for a
                  formatted ``[-]HH:MM:SS.mmm`` timestamp with
                  millisecond accuracy. ``gmtime`` stands for the
                  timestamp of the frame formatted as UTC time;
                  ``localtime`` stands for the timestamp of the frame
                  formatted as local time zone time.

                  The second argument is an offset added to the
                  timestamp.

                  If the format is set to ``hms``, a third argument
                  ``24HH`` may be supplied to present the hour part of
                  the formatted timestamp in 24h format (00-23).

                  If the format is set to ``localtime`` or ``gmtime``, a
                  third argument may be supplied: a ``strftime`` C
                  function format string. By default,
                  ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`` format will be used.

               This filter supports altering parameters via commands:

               ``reinit``
                  Alter existing filter parameters.

                  Syntax for the argument is the same as for filter
                  invocation, e.g.

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        fontsize=56:fontcolor=green:text='Hello World'

                  Full filter invocation with sendcmd would look like
                  this:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        sendcmd=c='56.0 drawtext reinit fontsize=56\:fontcolor=green\:text=Hello\\ World'

                  If the entire argument can’t be parsed or applied as
                  valid values then the filter will continue with its
                  existing parameters.

               -  Plot special ``lavf.image2dec.source_basename``
                  metadata onto each frame if such metadata exists.
                  Otherwise, plot the string "NA". Note that image2
                  demuxer must have option ``-export_path_metadata 1``
                  for the special metadata fields to be available for

               :class: section

            Detect and draw edges. The filter uses the Canny Edge
            Detection algorithm.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``low``
            ``high``
               Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny
               thresholding algorithm.

               The high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels,
               which are then connected through 8-connectivity with the
               "weak" edge pixels selected by the low threshold.

               ``low`` and ``high`` threshold values must be chosen in
               the range [0,1], and ``low`` should be lesser or equal to
               ``high``.

               Default value for ``low`` is ``20/255``, and default
               value for ``high`` is ``50/255``.

            ``mode``
               Define the drawing mode.

               ‘\ ``wires``\ ’
                  Draw white/gray wires on black background.

               ‘\ ``colormix``\ ’
                  Mix the colors to create a paint/cartoon effect.

               ‘\ ``canny``\ ’
                  Apply Canny edge detector on all selected planes.

               Default value is ``wires``.

            ``planes``
               Select planes for filtering. By default all available
               planes are filtered.

            Apply a posterize effect using the ELBG (Enhanced LBG)
            algorithm.

            For each input image, the filter will compute the optimal
            mapping from the input to the output given the codebook
            length, that is the number of distinct output colors.

            This filter accepts the following options.

            ``codebook_length, l``
               Set codebook length. The value must be a positive
               integer, and represents the number of distinct output
               colors. Default value is 256.

            ``nb_steps, n``
               Set the maximum number of iterations to apply for
               computing the optimal mapping. The higher the value the
               better the result and the higher the computation time.
               Default value is 1.

            ``seed, s``
               Set a random seed, must be an integer included between 0
               and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly set to
               -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a
               best effort basis.

            ``pal8``
               Set pal8 output pixel format. This option does not work
               with codebook length greater than 256. Default is
               disabled.

            ``use_alpha``
               Include alpha values in the quantization calculation.
               Allows creating palettized output images (e.g. PNG8) with
               multiple alpha smooth blending.

            Set brightness, contrast, saturation and approximate gamma
            adjustment.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``contrast``
               Set the contrast expression. The value must be a float
               value in range ``-1000.0`` to ``1000.0``. The default
               value is "1".

            ``brightness``
               Set the brightness expression. The value must be a float
               value in range ``-1.0`` to ``1.0``. The default value is
               "0".

            ``saturation``
               Set the saturation expression. The value must be a float
               in range ``0.0`` to ``3.0``. The default value is "1".

            ``gamma``
               Set the gamma expression. The value must be a float in
               range ``0.1`` to ``10.0``. The default value is "1".

            ``gamma_r``
               Set the gamma expression for red. The value must be a
               float in range ``0.1`` to ``10.0``. The default value is
               "1".

            ``gamma_g``
               Set the gamma expression for green. The value must be a
               float in range ``0.1`` to ``10.0``. The default value is
               "1".

            ``gamma_b``
               Set the gamma expression for blue. The value must be a
               float in range ``0.1`` to ``10.0``. The default value is
               "1".

            ``gamma_weight``
               Set the gamma weight expression. It can be used to reduce
               the effect of a high gamma value on bright image areas,
               e.g. keep them from getting overamplified and just plain
               white. The value must be a float in range ``0.0`` to
               ``1.0``. A value of ``0.0`` turns the gamma correction
               all the way down while ``1.0`` leaves it at its full
               strength. Default is "1".

            ``eval``
               Set when the expressions for brightness, contrast,
               saturation and gamma expressions are evaluated.

            This filter pass cropped input frames to 2nd output. From
            there it can be filtered with other video filters. After
            filter receives frame from 2nd input, that frame is combined
            on top of original frame from 1st input and passed to 1st
            output.

            The typical usage is filter only part of frame.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``x``
            ``y``
               Set the top left crop position.

            ``hint``
               Set file containing hints: absolute/relative frame
               numbers.

               There must be one line for each frame in a clip. Each
               line must contain two numbers separated by the comma,
               optionally followed by ``-`` or ``+``. Numbers supplied
               on each line of file can not be out of [N-1,N+1] where N
               is current frame number for ``absolute`` mode or out of
               [-1, 1] range for ``relative`` mode. First number tells
               from which frame to pick up top field and second number

               :class: section

            Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to
            reconstruct the progressive frames from a telecined stream.
            The filter does not drop duplicated frames, so to achieve a
            complete inverse telecine ``fieldmatch`` needs to be
            followed by a decimation filter such as
            `decimate <#decimate>`__ in the filtergraph.

            The separation of the field matching and the decimation is
            notably motivated by the possibility of inserting a
            de-interlacing filter fallback between the two. If the
            source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content,
            ``fieldmatch`` will not be able to match fields for the
            interlaced parts. But these remaining combed frames will be
            marked as interlaced, and thus can be de-interlaced by a
            later filter such as `yadif <#yadif>`__ before decimation.

            In addition to the various configuration options,
            ``fieldmatch`` can take an optional second stream, activated
            through the ``ppsrc`` option. If enabled, the frames
            reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from
            this second stream. This allows the first input to be
            pre-processed in order to help the various algorithms of the
            filter, while keeping the output lossless (assuming the
            fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware
            denoiser, or brightness/contrast adjustments can help.

            Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM
            (AviSynth project) and VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth project). The
            later is a light clone of TFM from which ``fieldmatch`` is
            based on. While the semantic and usage are very close, some
            behaviour and options names can differ.

            The `decimate <#decimate>`__ filter currently only works for
            constant frame rate input. If your input has mixed telecined
            (30fps) and progressive content with a lower framerate like
            24fps use the following filterchain to produce the necessary
            cfr stream: ``dejudder,fps=30000/1001,fieldmatch,decimate``.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``order``
               Specify the assumed field order of the input stream.
               Available values are:

               ‘\ ``auto``\ ’
                  Auto detect parity (use FFmpeg’s internal parity
                  value).

               ‘\ ``bff``\ ’
                  Assume bottom field first.

               ‘\ ``tff``\ ’
                  Assume top field first.

               Note that it is sometimes recommended not to trust the
               parity announced by the stream.

               Default value is ``auto``.

            ``mode``
               Set the matching mode or strategy to use. ``pc`` mode is
               the safest in the sense that it won’t risk creating
               jerkiness due to duplicate frames when possible, but if
               there are bad edits or blended fields it will end up
               outputting combed frames when a good match might actually
               exist. On the other hand, ``pcn_ub`` mode is the most
               risky in terms of creating jerkiness, but will almost
               always find a good frame if there is one. The other
               values are all somewhere in between ``pc`` and ``pcn_ub``
               in terms of risking jerkiness and creating duplicate
               frames versus finding good matches in sections with bad
               edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc.

               More details about p/c/n/u/b are available in `p/c/n/u/b
               meaning <#p_002fc_002fn_002fu_002fb-meaning>`__ section.

               Available values are:

               ‘\ ``pc``\ ’
                  2-way matching (p/c)

               ‘\ ``pc_n``\ ’
                  2-way matching, and trying 3rd match if still combed
                  (p/c + n)

               ‘\ ``pc_u``\ ’
                  2-way matching, and trying 3rd match (same order) if
                  still combed (p/c + u)

               ‘\ ``pc_n_ub``\ ’
                  2-way matching, trying 3rd match if still combed, and
                  trying 4th/5th matches if still combed (p/c + n + u/b)

               ‘\ ``pcn``\ ’
                  3-way matching (p/c/n)

               ‘\ ``pcn_ub``\ ’
                  3-way matching, and trying 4th/5th matches if all 3 of
                  the original matches are detected as combed (p/c/n +
                  u/b)

               The parenthesis at the end indicate the matches that
               would be used for that mode assuming
               ``order``\ =\ ``tff`` (and ``field`` on ``auto`` or
               ``top``).

               In terms of speed ``pc`` mode is by far the fastest and
               ``pcn_ub`` is the slowest.

               Default value is ``pc_n``.

            ``ppsrc``
               Mark the main input stream as a pre-processed input, and
               enable the secondary input stream as the clean source to
               pick the fields from. See the filter introduction for
               more details. It is similar to the ``clip2`` feature from
               VFM/TFM.

               Default value is ``0`` (disabled).

            ``field``
               Set the field to match from. It is recommended to set
               this to the same value as ``order`` unless you experience
               matching failures with that setting. In certain
               circumstances changing the field that is used to match
               from can have a large impact on matching performance.
               Available values are:

               ‘\ ``auto``\ ’
                  Automatic (same value as ``order``).

               ‘\ ``bottom``\ ’
                  Match from the bottom field.

               ‘\ ``top``\ ’
                  Match from the top field.

               Default value is ``auto``.

            ``mchroma``
               Set whether or not chroma is included during the match
               comparisons. In most cases it is recommended to leave
               this enabled. You should set this to ``0`` only if your
               clip has bad chroma problems such as heavy rainbowing or
               other artifacts. Setting this to ``0`` could also be used
               to speed things up at the cost of some accuracy.

               Default value is ``1``.

            ``y0``
            ``y1``
               These define an exclusion band which excludes the lines
               between ``y0`` and ``y1`` from being included in the
               field matching decision. An exclusion band can be used to
               ignore subtitles, a logo, or other things that may
               interfere with the matching. ``y0`` sets the starting
               scan line and ``y1`` sets the ending line; all lines in
               between ``y0`` and ``y1`` (including ``y0`` and ``y1``)
               will be ignored. Setting ``y0`` and ``y1`` to the same
               value will disable the feature. ``y0`` and ``y1``
               defaults to ``0``.

            ``scthresh``
               Set the scene change detection threshold as a percentage
               of maximum change on the luma plane. Good values are in
               the ``[8.0, 14.0]`` range. Scene change detection is only
               relevant in case ``combmatch``\ =\ ``sc``. The range for
               ``scthresh`` is ``[0.0, 100.0]``.

               Default value is ``12.0``.

            ``combmatch``
               When ``combatch`` is not ``none``, ``fieldmatch`` will
               take into account the combed scores of matches when
               deciding what match to use as the final match. Available
               values are:

               ‘\ ``none``\ ’
                  No final matching based on combed scores.

               ‘\ ``sc``\ ’
                  Combed scores are only used when a scene change is
                  detected.

               ‘\ ``full``\ ’
                  Use combed scores all the time.

               Default is ``sc``.

            ``combdbg``
               Force ``fieldmatch`` to calculate the combed metrics for
               certain matches and print them. This setting is known as
               ``micout`` in TFM/VFM vocabulary. Available values are:

               ‘\ ``none``\ ’
                  No forced calculation.

               ‘\ ``pcn``\ ’
                  Force p/c/n calculations.

               ‘\ ``pcnub``\ ’
                  Force p/c/n/u/b calculations.

               Default value is ``none``.

            ``cthresh``
               This is the area combing threshold used for combed frame
               detection. This essentially controls how "strong" or
               "visible" combing must be to be detected. Larger values
               mean combing must be more visible and smaller values mean
               combing can be less visible or strong and still be
               detected. Valid settings are from ``-1`` (every pixel
               will be detected as combed) to ``255`` (no pixel will be
               detected as combed). This is basically a pixel difference
               value. A good range is ``[8, 12]``.

               Default value is ``9``.

            ``chroma``
               Sets whether or not chroma is considered in the combed
               frame decision. Only disable this if your source has
               chroma problems (rainbowing, etc.) that are causing
               problems for the combed frame detection with chroma
               enabled. Actually, using ``chroma``\ =\ ``0`` is usually
               more reliable, except for the case where there is chroma
               only combing in the source.

               Default value is ``0``.

            ``blockx``
            ``blocky``
               Respectively set the x-axis and y-axis size of the window
               used during combed frame detection. This has to do with
               the size of the area in which ``combpel`` pixels are
               required to be detected as combed for a frame to be
               declared combed. See the ``combpel`` parameter
               description for more info. Possible values are any number
               that is a power of 2 starting at 4 and going up to 512.

               Default value is ``16``.

            ``combpel``
               The number of combed pixels inside any of the ``blocky``
               by ``blockx`` size blocks on the frame for the frame to
               be detected as combed. While ``cthresh`` controls how
               "visible" the combing must be, this setting controls "how
               much" combing there must be in any localized area (a
               window defined by the ``blockx`` and ``blocky`` settings)
               on the frame. Minimum value is ``0`` and maximum is
               ``blocky x blockx`` (at which point no frames will ever
               be detected as combed). This setting is known as ``MI``
               in TFM/VFM vocabulary.

               Default value is ``80``.

                  We assume the following telecined stream:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        Top fields:     1 2 2 3 4
                        Bottom fields:  1 2 3 4 4

                  The numbers correspond to the progressive frame the
                  fields relate to. Here, the first two frames are
                  progressive, the 3rd and 4th are combed, and so on.

                  When ``fieldmatch`` is configured to run a matching
                  from bottom (``field``\ =\ ``bottom``) this is how
                  this input stream get transformed:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        Input stream:
                                        T     1 2 2 3 4
                                        B     1 2 3 4 4   <-- matching reference

                        Matches:              c c n n c

                        Output stream:
                                        T     1 2 3 4 4
                                        B     1 2 3 4 4

                  As a result of the field matching, we can see that
                  some frames get duplicated. To perform a complete
                  inverse telecine, you need to rely on a decimation
                  filter after this operation. See for instance the
                  `decimate <#decimate>`__ filter.

                  The same operation now matching from top fields
                  (``field``\ =\ ``top``) looks like this:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        Input stream:
                                        T     1 2 2 3 4   <-- matching reference
                                        B     1 2 3 4 4

                        Matches:              c c p p c

                        Output stream:
                                        T     1 2 2 3 4
                                        B     1 2 2 3 4

                  In these examples, we can see what ``p``, ``c`` and
                  ``n`` mean; basically, they refer to the frame and
                  field of the opposite parity:

                  -  ``p`` matches the field of the opposite parity in
                     the previous frame
                  -  ``c`` matches the field of the opposite parity in
                     the current frame
                  -  ``n`` matches the field of the opposite parity in
                     the next frame

               .. container:: subsubsection-level-extent
                  :name: u_002fb

                  .. rubric:: 30.94.1.2 u/b
                     :name: ub
                     :class: subsubsection

                  The ``u`` and ``b`` matching are a bit special in the
                  sense that they match from the opposite parity flag.
                  In the following examples, we assume that we are
                  currently matching the 2nd frame (Top:2, bottom:2).
                  According to the match, a ’x’ is placed above and
                  below each matched fields.

                  With bottom matching (``field``\ =\ ``bottom``):

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        Match:           c         p           n          b          u

                                         x       x               x        x          x

            Transform the field order of the input video.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``order``
               The output field order. Valid values are ``tff`` for top
               field first or ``bff`` for bottom field first.

            The default value is ‘\ ``tff``\ ’.

            The transformation is done by shifting the picture content
            up or down by one line, and filling the remaining line with
            appropriate picture content. This method is consistent with
            most broadcast field order converters.

            If the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it
            is already flagged as being of the required output field
            order, then this filter does not alter the incoming video.

            It is very useful when converting to or from PAL DV
            material, which is bottom field first.

            For example:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -i in.vob -vf "fieldorder=bff" out.dv

            Buffer input images and send them when they are requested.

            It is mainly useful when auto-inserted by the libavfilter
            framework.

            It does not take parameters.

               :class: section

            Fill borders of the input video, without changing video
            stream dimensions. Sometimes video can have garbage at the
            four edges and you may not want to crop video input to keep
            size multiple of some number.

               :class: section

            Find a rectangular object in the input video.

            The object to search for must be specified as a gray8 image
            specified with the ``object`` option.

            For each possible match, a score is computed. If the score
            reaches the specified threshold, the object is considered
            found.

            If the input video contains multiple instances of the
            object, the filter will find only one of them.

            When an object is found, the following metadata entries are
            set in the matching frame:

            ``lavfi.rect.w``
               width of object

            ``lavfi.rect.h``
               height of object

            ``lavfi.rect.x``
               x position of object

            ``lavfi.rect.y``
               y position of object

            ``lavfi.rect.score``
               match score of the found object

            It accepts the following options:

            ``object``
               Filepath of the object image, needs to be in gray8.

               Detection threshold, expressed as a decimal number in the
               range 0-1.

               A threshold value of 0.01 means only exact matches, a
               threshold of 0.99 means almost everything matches.

               Default value is 0.5.

            ``mipmaps``
               Number of mipmaps, default is 3.

            ``xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax``

            Convert the video to specified constant frame rate by
            duplicating or dropping frames as necessary.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``fps``
               The desired output frame rate. It accepts expressions
               containing the following constants:

               ‘\ ``source_fps``\ ’
                  The input’s frame rate

               ‘\ ``ntsc``\ ’
                  NTSC frame rate of ``30000/1001``

                  NTSC-film frame rate of ``24000/1001``

               The default is ``25``.

            ``start_time``
               Assume the first PTS should be the given value, in
               seconds. This allows for padding/trimming at the start of
               stream. By default, no assumption is made about the first
               frame’s expected PTS, so no padding or trimming is done.
               For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning
               with duplicates of the first frame if a video stream
               starts after the audio stream or to trim any frames with
               a negative PTS.

            ``round``
               Timestamp (PTS) rounding method.

               Possible values are:

               ``zero``
                  round towards 0

               ``inf``
                  round away from 0

               ``down``
                  round towards -infinity

               ``up``
                  round towards +infinity

               ``near``
                  round to nearest

               The default is ``near``.

            ``eof_action``
               Action performed when reading the last frame.

               Possible values are:

               ``round``
                  Use same timestamp rounding method as used for other
                  frames.

               ``pass``
                  Pass through last frame if input duration has not been
                  reached yet.

               The default is ``round``.

            Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat
            string: ``fps``\ [:``start_time``\ [:``round``]].

            Change the frame rate by interpolating new video output
            frames from the source frames.

            This filter is not designed to function correctly with
            interlaced media. If you wish to change the frame rate of
            interlaced media then you are required to deinterlace before
            this filter and re-interlace after this filter.

            A description of the accepted options follows.

            ``fps``
               Specify the output frames per second. This option can
               also be specified as a value alone. The default is
               ``50``.

            ``interp_start``
               Specify the start of a range where the output frame will
               be created as a linear interpolation of two frames. The
               range is [``0``-``255``], the default is ``15``.

            ``interp_end``
               Specify the end of a range where the output frame will be
               created as a linear interpolation of two frames. The
               range is [``0``-``255``], the default is ``240``.

            ``scene``
               Specify the level at which a scene change is detected as
               a value between 0 and 100 to indicate a new scene; a low
               value reflects a low probability for the current frame to
               introduce a new scene, while a higher value means the
               current frame is more likely to be one. The default is
               ``8.2``.

            ``flags``
               Specify flags influencing the filter process.

               Available value for ``flags`` is:

               ``scene_change_detect, scd``
                  Enable scene change detection using the value of the
                  option ``scene``. This flag is enabled by default.

            This filter accepts the following option:

            ``step``
               Select frame after every ``step`` frames. Allowed values
               are positive integers higher than 0. Default value is

               :class: section

            Detect frozen video.

            This filter logs a message and sets frame metadata when it
            detects that the input video has no significant change in
            content during a specified duration. Video freeze detection
            calculates the mean average absolute difference of all the
            components of video frames and compares it to a noise floor.

            The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The
            ``lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_start`` metadata key is set on
            the first frame whose timestamp equals or exceeds the
            detection duration and it contains the timestamp of the
            first frame of the freeze. The
            ``lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_duration`` and
            ``lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_end`` metadata keys are set on
            the first frame after the freeze.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``noise, n``
               Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB"
               is appended to the specified value) or as a difference
               ratio between 0 and 1. Default is -60dB, or 0.001.

            ``duration, d``
               Set freeze duration until notification (default is 2
               seconds).

            Apply a frei0r effect to the input video.

            To enable the compilation of this filter, you need to
            install the frei0r header and configure FFmpeg with
            ``--enable-frei0r``.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``filter_name``
               The name of the frei0r effect to load. If the environment
               variable ``FREI0R_PATH`` is defined, the frei0r effect is
               searched for in each of the directories specified by the
               colon-separated list in ``FREI0R_PATH``. Otherwise, the
               standard frei0r paths are searched, in this order:
               ``HOME/.frei0r-1/lib/``, ``/usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/``,
               ``/usr/lib/frei0r-1/``.

            ``filter_params``
               A ’\|’-separated list of parameters to pass to the frei0r
               effect.

            A frei0r effect parameter can be a boolean (its value is
            either "y" or "n"), a double, a color (specified as
            ``R``/``G``/``B``, where ``R``, ``G``, and ``B`` are
            floating point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive) or a
            color description as specified in the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color"
            section in the ffmpeg-utils
            manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__, a position
            (specified as ``X``/``Y``, where ``X`` and ``Y`` are
            floating point numbers) and/or a string.

            The number and types of parameters depend on the loaded
            effect. If an effect parameter is not specified, the default
            value is set.

            Apply fast and simple postprocessing. It is a faster version
            of `spp <#spp>`__.

            It splits (I)DCT into horizontal/vertical passes. Unlike the
            simple post- processing filter, one of them is performed
            once per block, not per pixel. This allows for much higher
            speed.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``quality``
               Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for
               averaging. It accepts an integer in the range 4-5.
               Default value is ``4``.

            ``qp``
               Force a constant quantization parameter. It accepts an
               integer in range 0-63. If not set, the filter will use
               the QP from the video stream (if available).

            ``strength``
               Set filter strength. It accepts an integer in range -15
               to 32. Lower values mean more details but also more
               artifacts, while higher values make the image smoother
               but also blurrier. Default value is ``0`` − PSNR optimal.

            ``use_bframe_qp``
               Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to
               ``1``. Using this option may cause flicker since the
               B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is ``0`` (not
               enabled).

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``sigma``
               Set horizontal sigma, standard deviation of Gaussian
               blur. Default is ``0.5``.

            ``steps``
               Set number of steps for Gaussian approximation. Default
               is ``1``.

            ``planes``
               Set which planes to filter. By default all planes are
               filtered.

            ``sigmaV``
               Set vertical sigma, if negative it will be same as
               ``sigma``. Default is ``-1``.

            Apply generic equation to each pixel.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``lum_expr, lum``
               Set the luma expression.

            ``cb_expr, cb``
               Set the chrominance blue expression.

            ``cr_expr, cr``
               Set the chrominance red expression.

            ``alpha_expr, a``
               Set the alpha expression.

            ``red_expr, r``
               Set the red expression.

            ``green_expr, g``
               Set the green expression.

            ``blue_expr, b``
               Set the blue expression.

            The colorspace is selected according to the specified
            options. If one of the ``lum_expr``, ``cb_expr``, or
            ``cr_expr`` options is specified, the filter will
            automatically select a YCbCr colorspace. If one of the
            ``red_expr``, ``green_expr``, or ``blue_expr`` options is
            specified, it will select an RGB colorspace.

            If one of the chrominance expression is not defined, it
            falls back on the other one. If no alpha expression is
            specified it will evaluate to opaque value. If none of
            chrominance expressions are specified, they will evaluate to
            the luma expression.

            The expressions can use the following variables and
            functions:

            ``N``
            The sequential number of the filtered frame, starting from
            ``0``.

            ``X``
            ``Y``
            The coordinates of the current sample.

            ``W``
            ``H``
            The width and height of the image.

            ``SW``
            ``SH``
            Width and height scale depending on the currently filtered
            plane. It is the ratio between the corresponding luma plane
            number of pixels and the current plane ones. E.g. for
            YUV4:2:0 the values are ``1,1`` for the luma plane, and
            ``0.5,0.5`` for chroma planes.

            ``T``
            Time of the current frame, expressed in seconds.

            ``p(x, y)``
            Return the value of the pixel at location (``x``,\ ``y``) of
            the current plane.

            ``lum(x, y)``
            Return the value of the pixel at location (``x``,\ ``y``) of
            the luma plane.

            ``cb(x, y)``
            Return the value of the pixel at location (``x``,\ ``y``) of
            the blue-difference chroma plane. Return 0 if there is no
            such plane.

            ``cr(x, y)``
            Return the value of the pixel at location (``x``,\ ``y``) of
            the red-difference chroma plane. Return 0 if there is no
            such plane.

            ``r(x, y)``
            ``g(x, y)``
            ``b(x, y)``
            Return the value of the pixel at location (``x``,\ ``y``) of
            the red/green/blue component. Return 0 if there is no such
            component.

            ``alpha(x, y)``
            Return the value of the pixel at location (``x``,\ ``y``) of
            the alpha plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.

            ``psum(x,y), lumsum(x, y), cbsum(x,y), crsum(x,y), rsum(x,y), gsum(x,y), bsum(x,y), alphasum(x,y)``
            Sum of sample values in the rectangle from (0,0) to (x,y),
            this allows obtaining sums of samples within a rectangle.
            See the functions without the sum postfix.

            ``interpolation``
            Set one of interpolation methods:

            ``nearest, n``
            ``bilinear, b``
            Default is bilinear.

            For functions, if ``x`` and ``y`` are outside the area, the
            value will be automatically clipped to the closer edge.

            Please note that this filter can use multiple threads in
            which case each slice will have its own expression state. If
            you want to use only a single expression state because your
            expressions depend on previous state then you should limit
            the number of filter threads to 1.

            It is designed for playback only. Do not use it prior to
            lossy compression, because compression tends to lose the
            dither and bring back the bands.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``strength``
               The maximum amount by which the filter will change any
               one pixel. This is also the threshold for detecting
               nearly flat regions. Acceptable values range from .51 to
               64; the default value is 1.2. Out-of-range values will be
               clipped to the valid range.

            ``radius``
               The neighborhood to fit the gradient to. A larger radius
               makes for smoother gradients, but also prevents the
               filter from modifying the pixels near detailed regions.
               Acceptable values are 8-32; the default value is 16.
               Out-of-range values will be clipped to the valid range.

            Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat
            string: ``strength``\ [:``radius``]

               instead of calculating Minkowski distance.

            ``sigma``
               The standard deviation of Gaussian blur to be applied on
               the scene. Must be chosen in the range [0,1024.0] and
               default value = 1. floor( ``sigma`` \* break_off_sigma(3)

            Apply a Hald CLUT to a video stream.

            First input is the video stream to process, and second one
            is the Hald CLUT. The Hald CLUT input can be a simple
            picture or a complete video stream.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``clut``
               Set which CLUT video frames will be processed from second
               input stream, can be ``first`` or ``all``. Default is
               ``all``.

            ``shortest``
               Force termination when the shortest input terminates.
               Default is ``0``.

            ``repeatlast``
               Continue applying the last CLUT after the end of the
               stream. A value of ``0`` disable the filter after the
               last frame of the CLUT is reached. Default is ``1``.

            ``haldclut`` also has the same interpolation options as
            `lut3d <#lut3d>`__ (both filters share the same internals).

            This filter also supports the `framesync <#framesync>`__

                  Generate an identity Hald CLUT stream altered with

                        ffmpeg -f lavfi -i haldclutsrc=8 -vf "hue=H=2*PI*t:s=sin(2*PI*t)+1, curves=cross_process" -t 10 -c:v ffv1 clut.nut

                  Note: make sure you use a lossless codec.

                  Then use it with ``haldclut`` to apply it on some
                  random stream:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                  The Hald CLUT will be applied to the 10 first seconds
                  (duration of ``clut.nut``), then the latest picture of
                  that CLUT stream will be applied to the remaining
                  frames of the ``mandelbrot`` stream.

                  A Hald CLUT is supposed to be a squared image of
                  ``Level*Level*Level`` by ``Level*Level*Level`` pixels.
                  For a given Hald CLUT, FFmpeg will select the biggest
                  possible square starting at the top left of the
                  picture. The remaining padding pixels (bottom or
                  right) will be ignored. This area can be used to add a
                  preview of the Hald CLUT.

                  Typically, the following generated Hald CLUT will be
                  supported by the ``haldclut`` filter:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        ffmpeg -f lavfi -i haldclutsrc=8 -vf "
                           pad=iw+320 [padded_clut];
                           smptebars=s=320x256, split [a][b];
                           [padded_clut][a] overlay=W-320:h, curves=color_negative [main];
                           [main][b] overlay=W-320" -frames:v 1 clut.png

                  It contains the original and a preview of the effect
                  of the CLUT: SMPTE color bars are displayed on the
                  right-top, and below the same color bars processed by
                  the color changes.

                  Then, the effect of this Hald CLUT can be visualized
                  with:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

            This filter applies a global color histogram equalization on
            a per-frame basis.

            It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range
            of pixel intensities. The filter redistributes the pixel
            intensities to equalize their distribution across the
            intensity range. It may be viewed as an "automatically
            adjusting contrast filter". This filter is useful only for
            correcting degraded or poorly captured source video.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``strength``
               Determine the amount of equalization to be applied. As
               the strength is reduced, the distribution of pixel
               intensities more-and-more approaches that of the input
               frame. The value must be a float number in the range
               [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.

            ``intensity``
               Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale
               the output values appropriately. The strength should be
               set as desired and then the intensity can be limited if
               needed to avoid washing-out. The value must be a float
               number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.

            ``antibanding``
               Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will
               randomly vary the luminance of output pixels by a small
               amount to avoid banding of the histogram. Possible values
               are ``none``, ``weak`` or ``strong``. It defaults to
               ``none``.

               :class: section

            Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the
            input video.

            The computed histogram is a representation of the color
            component distribution in an image.

            Standard histogram displays the color components
            distribution in an image. Displays color graph for each
            color component. Shows distribution of the Y, U, V, A or R,
            G, B components, depending on input format, in the current
            frame. Below each graph a color component scale meter is
            shown.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``level_height``
            Set height of level. Default value is ``200``. Allowed range
            is [50, 2048].

            ``scale_height``
            Set height of color scale. Default value is ``12``. Allowed
            range is [0, 40].

            ``display_mode``
            Set display mode. It accepts the following values:

            ‘\ ``stack``\ ’
               Per color component graphs are placed below each other.

            ‘\ ``parade``\ ’
               Per color component graphs are placed side by side.

            ‘\ ``overlay``\ ’
               Presents information identical to that in the ``parade``,
               except that the graphs representing color components are
               superimposed directly over one another.

            Default is ``stack``.

            ``levels_mode``
            Set mode. Can be either ``linear``, or ``logarithmic``.
            Default is ``linear``.

            ``components``
            Set what color components to display. Default is ``7``.

            ``fgopacity``
            Set foreground opacity. Default is ``0.7``.

            ``bgopacity``
            Set background opacity. Default is ``0.5``.

            ``colors_mode``
            Set colors mode. It accepts the following values:

            ‘\ ``whiteonblack``\ ’
            ‘\ ``blackonwhite``\ ’
            ‘\ ``whiteongray``\ ’

            This is a high precision/quality 3d denoise filter. It aims
            to reduce image noise, producing smooth images and making
            still images really still. It should enhance
            compressibility.

            It accepts the following optional parameters:

            ``luma_spatial``
               A non-negative floating point number which specifies
               spatial luma strength. It defaults to 4.0.

            ``chroma_spatial``
               A non-negative floating point number which specifies

               3.0\*\ ``luma_spatial``/4.0.

            ``luma_tmp``
               A floating point number which specifies luma temporal

            Download hardware frames to system memory.

            The input must be in hardware frames, and the output a
            non-hardware format. Not all formats will be supported on
            the output - it may be necessary to insert an additional
            ``format`` filter immediately following in the graph to get
            the output in a supported format.

               :class: section

            Map hardware frames to system memory or to another device.

            This filter has several different modes of operation; which
            one is used depends on the input and output formats:

            -  Hardware frame input, normal frame output

               Map the input frames to system memory and pass them to
               the output. If the original hardware frame is later
               required (for example, after overlaying something else on
               part of it), the ``hwmap`` filter can be used again in
               the next mode to retrieve it.

            -  Normal frame input, hardware frame output

               If the input is actually a software-mapped hardware
               frame, then unmap it - that is, return the original
               hardware frame.

               Otherwise, a device must be provided. Create new hardware
               surfaces on that device for the output, then map them
               back to the software format at the input and give those
               frames to the preceding filter. This will then act like
               the ``hwupload`` filter, but may be able to avoid an
               additional copy when the input is already in a compatible
               format.

            -  Hardware frame input and output

               A device must be supplied for the output, either directly
               or with the ``derive_device`` option. The input and
               output devices must be of different types and compatible
               - the exact meaning of this is system-dependent, but
               typically it means that they must refer to the same
               underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the
               same graphics card).

               If the input frames were originally created on the output
               device, then unmap to retrieve the original frames.

               Otherwise, map the frames to the output device - create
               new hardware frames on the output corresponding to the
               frames on the input.

            The following additional parameters are accepted:

            ``mode``
               Set the frame mapping mode. Some combination of:

               ``read``
                  The mapped frame should be readable.

               ``write``
                  The mapped frame should be writeable.

               ``overwrite``
                  The mapping will always overwrite the entire frame.

                  This may improve performance in some cases, as the
                  original contents of the frame need not be loaded.

               ``direct``
                  The mapping must not involve any copying.

                  Indirect mappings to copies of frames are created in
                  some cases where either direct mapping is not possible
                  or it would have unexpected properties. Setting this
                  flag ensures that the mapping is direct and will fail
                  if that is not possible.

               Defaults to ``read+write`` if not specified.

            ``derive_device``\ ``type``
               Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation,
               instead derive a new device of type ``type`` from the
               device the input frames exist on.

            ``reverse``
               In a hardware to hardware mapping, map in reverse -
               create frames in the sink and map them back to the
               source. This may be necessary in some cases where a
               mapping in one direction is required but only the
               opposite direction is supported by the devices being
               used.

               This option is dangerous - it may break the preceding
               filter in undefined ways if there are any additional
               constraints on that filter’s output. Do not use it
               without fully understanding the implications of its use.

            Upload system memory frames to hardware surfaces.

            The device to upload to must be supplied when the filter is

            with the ``-filter_hw_device`` option or with the
            ``derive_device`` option. The input and output devices must
            be of different types and compatible - the exact meaning of
            this is system-dependent, but typically it means that they
            must refer to the same underlying hardware context (for
            example, refer to the same graphics card).

            options, output colors can be changed to be gray or not.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``hue``
               Set the hue value which will be used in color difference
               calculation. Allowed range is from -360 to 360. Default
               value is 0.

            ``sat``
               Set the saturation value which will be used in color
               difference calculation. Allowed range is from -1 to 1.
               Default value is 0.

            ``val``
               Set the value which will be used in color difference
               calculation. Allowed range is from -1 to 1. Default value
               is 0.

            ``similarity``
               Set similarity percentage with the key color. Allowed
               range is from 0 to 1. Default value is 0.01.

               0.00001 matches only the exact key color, while 1.0
               matches everything.

            ``blend``
               Blend percentage. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Default
               value is 0.

               0.0 makes pixels either fully gray, or not gray at all.

               Higher values result in more gray pixels, with a higher
               gray pixel the more similar the pixels color is to the
               key color.

            in options and ones measured in video stream. Depending on
            options, output colors can be changed to transparent by
            adding alpha channel.

               transparent at all.

               Higher values result in semi-transparent pixels, with a
               higher transparency the more similar the pixels color is
               to the key color.

            Detect the colorspace from an embedded ICC profile (if
            present), and update the frame’s tags accordingly.

            This filter accepts the following options:

            ``force``
               If true, the frame’s existing colorspace tags will always
               be overridden by values detected from an ICC profile.
               Otherwise, they will only be assigned if they contain
               ``unknown``. Enabled by default.

            This filter accepts the following options:

            ``color_primaries``
            ``color_trc``
               Configure the colorspace that the ICC profile will be
               generated for. The default value of ``auto`` infers the
               value from the input frame’s metadata, defaulting to
               BT.709/sRGB as appropriate.

               See the `setparams <#setparams>`__ filter for a list of
               possible values, but note that ``unknown`` are not valid
               values for this filter.

            ``force``
               If true, an ICC profile will be generated even if it
               would overwrite an already existing ICC profile. Disabled
               by default.

               :class: section

            Obtain the identity score between two input videos.

            This filter takes two input videos.

            Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel
            format for this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes
            that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are
            compared one by one.

            The obtained per component, average, min and max identity
            score is printed through the logging system.

            The filter stores the calculated identity scores of each
            frame in frame metadata.

            This filter also supports the `framesync <#framesync>`__
            options.

            In the below example the input file ``main.mpg`` being
            processed is compared with the reference file ``ref.mpg``.

            Detect video interlacing type.

            This filter tries to detect if the input frames are
            interlaced, progressive, top or bottom field first. It will
            also try to detect fields that are repeated between adjacent
            frames (a sign of telecine).

            Single frame detection considers only immediately adjacent
            frames when classifying each frame. Multiple frame detection
            incorporates the classification history of previous frames.

            The filter will log these metadata values:

            ``single.current_frame``
               Detected type of current frame using single-frame
               detection. One of: “tff” (top field first), “bff” (bottom
               field first), “progressive”, or “undetermined”

            ``single.tff``
               Cumulative number of frames detected as top field first
               using single-frame detection.

            ``multiple.tff``
               Cumulative number of frames detected as top field first
               using multiple-frame detection.

            ``single.bff``
               Cumulative number of frames detected as bottom field
               first using single-frame detection.

            ``multiple.current_frame``
               Detected type of current frame using multiple-frame
               detection. One of: “tff” (top field first), “bff” (bottom
               field first), “progressive”, or “undetermined”

            ``multiple.bff``
               Cumulative number of frames detected as bottom field
               first using multiple-frame detection.

            ``single.progressive``
               Cumulative number of frames detected as progressive using
               single-frame detection.

            ``multiple.progressive``
               Cumulative number of frames detected as progressive using
               multiple-frame detection.

            ``single.undetermined``
               Cumulative number of frames that could not be classified
               using single-frame detection.

            ``multiple.undetermined``
               Cumulative number of frames that could not be classified
               using multiple-frame detection.

            ``repeated.current_frame``
               Which field in the current frame is repeated from the
               last. One of “neither”, “top”, or “bottom”.

            ``repeated.neither``
               Cumulative number of frames with no repeated field.

            ``repeated.top``
               Cumulative number of frames with the top field repeated
               from the previous frame’s top field.

            ``repeated.bottom``
               Cumulative number of frames with the bottom field
               repeated from the previous frame’s bottom field.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``intl_thres``
               Set interlacing threshold.

            ``prog_thres``

            ``half_life``
               Number of frames after which a given frame’s contribution
               to the statistics is halved (i.e., it contributes only
               0.5 to its classification). The default of 0 means that
               all frames seen are given full weight of 1.0 forever.

            ``analyze_interlaced_flag``
               When this is not 0 then idet will use the specified
               number of frames to determine if the interlaced flag is
               accurate, it will not count undetermined frames. If the
               flag is found to be accurate it will be used without any
               further computations, if it is found to be inaccurate it
               will be cleared without any further computations. This
               allows inserting the idet filter as a low computational
               method to clean up the interlaced flag

            Deinterleave or interleave fields.

            This filter allows one to process interlaced images fields
            without deinterlacing them. Deinterleaving splits the input
            frame into 2 fields (so called half pictures). Odd lines are
            moved to the top half of the output image, even lines to the
            bottom half. You can process (filter) them independently and
            then re-interleave them.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``luma_mode, l``
            ``chroma_mode, c``
            ``alpha_mode, a``
               Available values for ``luma_mode``, ``chroma_mode`` and
               ``alpha_mode`` are:

               ‘\ ``interleave, i``\ ’
                  Interleave fields. Reverse the effect of
                  deinterleaving.

               Default value is ``none``.

            It accepts the following optional parameters:

            ``scan``
               This determines whether the interlaced frame is taken
               from the even (tff - default) or odd (bff) lines of the
               progressive frame.

            ``lowpass``
               Vertical lowpass filter to avoid twitter interlacing and
               reduce moire patterns.

               ‘\ ``0, off``\ ’

               ‘\ ``2, complex``\ ’
                  Enable complex filter. This will slightly less reduce
                  twitter and moire but better retain detail and
                  subjective sharpness impression.

               Set the threshold which affects the filter’s tolerance
               when determining if a pixel line must be processed. It
               must be an integer in the range [0,255] and defaults to
               10. A value of 0 will result in applying the process on
               every pixels.

            ``map``
               Paint pixels exceeding the threshold value to white if
               set to 1. Default is 0.

            ``order``
               Set the fields order. Swap fields if set to 1, leave
               fields alone if 0. Default is 0.

            Correct radial lens distortion

            This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as
            can result from the use of wide angle lenses, and thereby
            re-rectify the image. To find the right parameters one can
            use tools available for example as part of opencv or simply
            trial-and-error. To use opencv use the calibration sample
            (under samples/cpp) from the opencv sources and extract the
            k1 and k2 coefficients from the resulting matrix.

            Note that effectively the same filter is available in the
            open-source tools Krita and Digikam from the KDE project.

            In contrast to the `vignette <#vignette>`__ filter, which
            can also be used to compensate lens errors, this filter
            corrects the distortion of the image, whereas
            `vignette <#vignette>`__ corrects the brightness
            distribution, so you may want to use both filters together
            in certain cases, though you will have to take care of
            ordering, i.e. whether vignetting should be applied before
            or after lens correction.

               The filter accepts the following options:

               ``cx``
                  Relative x-coordinate of the focal point of the image,
                  and thereby the center of the distortion. This value
                  has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the
                  image width. Default is 0.5.

               ``cy``
                  Relative y-coordinate of the focal point of the image,
                  and thereby the center of the distortion. This value
                  has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the
                  image height. Default is 0.5.

               ``k1``
                  Coefficient of the quadratic correction term. This
                  value has a range [-1,1]. 0 means no correction.
                  Default is 0.

               ``k2``
                  Coefficient of the double quadratic correction term.
                  This value has a range [-1,1]. 0 means no correction.
                  Default is 0.

               ``i``
                  Set interpolation type. Can be ``nearest`` or
                  ``bilinear``. Default is ``nearest``.

               ``fc``
                  Specify the color of the unmapped pixels. For the
                  syntax of this option, check the
                  `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
                  manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__. Default
                  color is ``black@0``.

               The formula that generates the correction is:

               ``r_src`` = ``r_tgt`` \* (1 + ``k1`` \* (``r_tgt`` /
               ``r_0``)^2 + ``k2`` \* (``r_tgt`` / ``r_0``)^4)

               where ``r_0`` is halve of the image diagonal and
               ``r_src`` and ``r_tgt`` are the distances from the focal
               point in the source and target images, respectively.

            Apply lens correction via the lensfun library
            (http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/).

            The ``lensfun`` filter requires the camera make, camera
            model, and lens model to apply the lens correction. The
            filter will load the lensfun database and query it to find
            the corresponding camera and lens entries in the database.
            As long as these entries can be found with the given
            options, the filter can perform corrections on frames. Note
            that incomplete strings will result in the filter choosing
            the best match with the given options, and the filter will
            output the chosen camera and lens models (logged with level
            "info"). You must provide the make, camera model, and lens
            model as they are required.

            To obtain a list of available makes and models, leave out
            one or both of ``make`` and ``model`` options. The filter
            will send the full list to the log with level ``INFO``. The
            first column is the make and the second column is the model.
            To obtain a list of available lenses, set any values for
            make and model and leave out the ``lens_model`` option. The
            filter will send the full list of lenses in the log with
            level ``INFO``. The ffmpeg tool will exit after the list is
            printed.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``make``
            The make of the camera (for example, "Canon"). This option
            is required.

            ``model``
            The model of the camera (for example, "Canon EOS 100D").
            This option is required.

            ``lens_model``
            The model of the lens (for example, "Canon EF-S 18-55mm
            f/3.5-5.6 IS STM"). This option is required.

            ``db_path``
            The full path to the lens database folder. If not set, the
            filter will attempt to load the database from the install
            path when the library was built. Default is unset.

            ``mode``
            The type of correction to apply. The following values are
            valid options:

            ‘\ ``vignetting``\ ’
               Enables fixing lens vignetting.

            ‘\ ``geometry``\ ’
               Enables fixing lens geometry. This is the default.

            ‘\ ``subpixel``\ ’
               Enables fixing chromatic aberrations.

            ‘\ ``vig_geo``\ ’
               Enables fixing lens vignetting and lens geometry.

            ‘\ ``vig_subpixel``\ ’
               Enables fixing lens vignetting and chromatic aberrations.

            ‘\ ``distortion``\ ’
               Enables fixing both lens geometry and chromatic
               aberrations.

            ‘\ ``all``\ ’
               Enables all possible corrections.

            ``focal_length``
            The focal length of the image/video (zoom; expected constant
            for video). For example, a 18–55mm lens has focal length
            range of [18–55], so a value in that range should be chosen
            when using that lens. Default 18.

            ``aperture``
            The aperture of the image/video (expected constant for
            video). Note that aperture is only used for vignetting
            correction. Default 3.5.

            ``focus_distance``
            The focus distance of the image/video (expected constant for
            video). Note that focus distance is only used for vignetting
            and only slightly affects the vignetting correction process.
            If unknown, leave it at the default value (which is 1000).

            ``scale``
            The scale factor which is applied after transformation.
            After correction the video is no longer necessarily
            rectangular. This parameter controls how much of the
            resulting image is visible. The value 0 means that a value
            will be chosen automatically such that there is little or no
            unmapped area in the output image. 1.0 means that no
            additional scaling is done. Lower values may result in more
            of the corrected image being visible, while higher values
            may avoid unmapped areas in the output.

            ``target_geometry``
            The target geometry of the output image/video. The following
            values are valid options:

            ‘\ ``rectilinear (default)``\ ’
            ‘\ ``fisheye``\ ’
            ‘\ ``panoramic``\ ’
            ‘\ ``equirectangular``\ ’
            ‘\ ``fisheye_orthographic``\ ’
            ‘\ ``fisheye_stereographic``\ ’
            ‘\ ``fisheye_equisolid``\ ’
            ‘\ ``fisheye_thoby``\ ’
            ``reverse``
            Apply the reverse of image correction (instead of correcting

                     :name: output-mode
                     :class: subsubsection

                  These options control the overall output mode. By
                  default, libplacebo will try to preserve the source
                  colorimetry and size as best as it can, but it will
                  apply any embedded film grain, dolby vision metadata
                  or anamorphic SAR present in source frames.

                  ``inputs``
                     Set the number of inputs. This can be used,
                     alongside the ``idx`` variable, to allow
                     placing/blending multiple inputs inside the output
                     frame. This effectively enables functionality
                     similar to `hstack <#hstack>`__,
                     `overlay <#overlay>`__, etc.

                  ``w``
                  ``h``
                     Set the output video dimension expression. Default
                     values are ``iw`` and ``ih``.

                     Allows for the same expressions as the
                     `scale <#scale>`__ filter.

                  ``crop_x``
                  ``crop_y``
                     Set the input crop x/y expressions, default values
                     are ``(iw-cw)/2`` and ``(ih-ch)/2``.

                  ``crop_w``
                  ``crop_h``
                     Set the input crop width/height expressions,
                     default values are ``iw`` and ``ih``.

                  ``pos_x``
                  ``pos_y``
                     Set the output placement x/y expressions, default
                     values are ``(ow-pw)/2`` and ``(oh-ph)/2``.

                  ``pos_w``
                  ``pos_h``
                     Set the output placement width/height expressions,
                     default values are ``ow`` and ``oh``.

                  ``fps``
                     Set the output frame rate. This can be rational,
                     e.g. ``60000/1001``. If set to the special string
                     ``none`` (the default), input timestamps will
                     instead be passed through to the output unmodified.
                     Otherwise, the input video frames will be
                     interpolated as necessary to rescale the video to
                     the specified target framerate, in a manner as
                     determined by the ``frame_mixer`` option.

                  ``format``
                     Set the output format override. If unset (the
                     default), frames will be output in the same format
                     as the respective input frames. Otherwise, format
                     conversion will be performed.

                  ``force_original_aspect_ratio``
                  ``force_divisible_by``
                     Work the same as the identical `scale <#scale>`__
                     filter options.

                  ``normalize_sar``
                     If enabled, output frames will always have a pixel
                     aspect ratio of 1:1. This will introduce additional
                     padding/cropping as necessary. If disabled (the
                     default), any aspect ratio mismatches, including
                     those from e.g. anamorphic video sources, are
                     forwarded to the output pixel aspect ratio.

                  ``pad_crop_ratio``
                     Specifies a ratio (between ``0.0`` and ``1.0``)
                     between padding and cropping when the input aspect
                     ratio does not match the output aspect ratio and
                     ``normalize_sar`` is in effect. The default of
                     ``0.0`` always pads the content with black borders,
                     while a value of ``1.0`` always crops off parts of
                     the content. Intermediate values are possible,
                     leading to a mix of the two approaches.

                  ``fillcolor``
                     Set the color used to fill the output area not
                     covered by the output image, for example as a
                     result of ``normalize_sar``. For the general syntax
                     of this option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color"
                     section in the ffmpeg-utils
                     manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__.
                     Defaults to ``black``.

                  ``corner_rounding``
                     Render frames with rounded corners. The value,
                     given as a float ranging from ``0.0`` to ``1.0``,
                     indicates the relative degree of rounding, from
                     fully square to fully circular. In other words, it
                     gives the radius divided by half the smaller side
                     length. Defaults to ``0.0``.

                  ``extra_opts``
                     Pass extra libplacebo internal configuration
                     options. These can be specified as a list of
                     ``key``\ =\ ``value`` pairs separated by ’:’. The
                     following example shows how to configure a custom
                     filter kernel ("EWA LanczosSharp") and use it to
                     double the input image resolution:

                     .. container:: example

                        .. code:: example-preformatted

                           -vf "libplacebo=w=iw*2:h=ih*2:extra_opts='upscaler=custom\:upscaler_preset=ewa_lanczos\:upscaler_blur=0.9812505644269356'"

                  ``colorspace``
                  ``color_primaries``
                  ``color_trc``
                  ``range``
                     Configure the colorspace that output frames will be
                     delivered in. The default value of ``auto`` outputs
                     frames in the same format as the input frames,
                     leading to no change. For any other value,
                     conversion will be performed.

                     See the `setparams <#setparams>`__ filter for a
                     list of possible values.

                  ``apply_filmgrain``
                     Apply film grain (e.g. AV1 or H.274) if present in
                     source frames, and strip it from the output.
                     Enabled by default.

                  ``apply_dolbyvision``
                     Apply Dolby Vision RPU metadata if present in
                     source frames, and strip it from the output.
                     Enabled by default. Note that Dolby Vision will
                     always output BT.2020+PQ, overriding the usual
                     input frame metadata. These will also be picked as
                     the values of ``auto`` for the respective frame
                     output options.

                  In addition to the expression constants documented for
                  the `scale <#scale>`__ filter, the ``crop_w``,
                  ``crop_h``, ``crop_x``, ``crop_y``, ``pos_w``,
                  ``pos_h``, ``pos_x`` and ``pos_y`` options can also
                  contain the following constants:

                  ``in_idx, idx``
                     The (0-based) numeric index of the currently active
                     input stream.

                  ``crop_w, cw``
                  ``crop_h, ch``
                     The computed values of ``crop_w`` and ``crop_h``.

                  ``pos_w, pw``
                  ``pos_h, ph``
                     The computed values of ``pos_w`` and ``pos_h``.

                  ``in_t, t``
                     The input frame timestamp, in seconds. NAN if input
                     timestamp is unknown.

                  ``out_t, ot``
                     The input frame timestamp, in seconds. NAN if input
                     timestamp is unknown.

                  ``n``
                     The input frame number, starting with 0.

                  The options in this section control how libplacebo
                  performs upscaling and (if necessary) downscaling.
                  Note that libplacebo will always internally operate on
                  4:4:4 content, so any sub-sampled chroma formats such
                  as ``yuv420p`` will necessarily be upsampled and
                  downsampled as part of the rendering process. That
                  means scaling might be in effect even if the source
                  and destination resolution are the same.

                  ``upscaler``
                  ``downscaler``
                     Configure the filter kernel used for upscaling and
                     downscaling. The respective defaults are
                     ``spline36`` and ``mitchell``. For a full list of
                     possible values, pass ``help`` to these options.
                     The most important values are:

                     ‘\ ``none``\ ’
                        Forces the use of built-in GPU texture sampling
                        (typically bilinear). Extremely fast but poor
                        quality, especially when downscaling.

                     ‘\ ``bilinear``\ ’
                        Bilinear interpolation. Can generally be done
                        for free on GPUs, except when doing so would
                        lead to aliasing. Fast and low quality.

                     ‘\ ``nearest``\ ’
                        Nearest-neighbour interpolation. Sharp but
                        highly aliasing.

                     ‘\ ``oversample``\ ’
                        Algorithm that looks visually similar to
                        nearest-neighbour interpolation but tries to
                        preserve pixel aspect ratio. Good for pixel art,
                        since it results in minimal distortion of the
                        artistic appearance.

                     ‘\ ``lanczos``\ ’
                        Standard sinc-sinc interpolation kernel.

                     ‘\ ``spline36``\ ’
                        Cubic spline approximation of lanczos. No
                        difference in performance, but has very slightly
                        less ringing.

                     ‘\ ``ewa_lanczos``\ ’
                        Elliptically weighted average version of
                        lanczos, based on a jinc-sinc kernel. This is
                        also popularly referred to as just "Jinc
                        scaling". Slow but very high quality.

                     ‘\ ``gaussian``\ ’
                        Gaussian kernel. Has certain ideal mathematical
                        properties, but subjectively very blurry.

                     ‘\ ``mitchell``\ ’
                        Cubic BC spline with parameters recommended by
                        Mitchell and Netravali. Very little ringing.

                  ``frame_mixer``
                     Controls the kernel used for mixing frames
                     temporally. The default value is ``none``, which
                     disables frame mixing. For a full list of possible
                     values, pass ``help`` to this option. The most
                     important values are:

                     ‘\ ``none``\ ’
                        Disables frame mixing, giving a result
                        equivalent to "nearest neighbour" semantics.

                     ‘\ ``oversample``\ ’
                        Oversamples the input video to create a "Smooth
                        Motion"-type effect: if an output frame would
                        exactly fall on the transition between two video
                        frames, it is blended according to the relative
                        overlap. This is the recommended option whenever
                        preserving the original subjective appearance is
                        desired.

                     ‘\ ``mitchell_clamp``\ ’
                        Larger filter kernel that smoothly interpolates
                        multiple frames in a manner designed to
                        eliminate ringing and other artefacts as much as
                        possible. This is the recommended option
                        wherever maximum visual smoothness is desired.

                     ‘\ ``linear``\ ’
                        Linear blend/fade between frames. Especially
                        useful for constructing e.g. slideshows.

                  ``lut_entries``
                     Configures the size of scaler LUTs, ranging from
                     ``1`` to ``256``. The default of ``0`` will pick
                     libplacebo’s internal default, typically ``64``.

                  ``antiringing``
                     Enables anti-ringing (for non-EWA filters). The
                     value (between ``0.0`` and ``1.0``) configures the
                     strength of the anti-ringing algorithm. May
                     increase aliasing if set too high. Disabled by
                     default.

                  ``sigmoid``
                     Enable sigmoidal compression during upscaling.
                     Reduces ringing slightly. Enabled by default.

                     :class: subsubsection

                  Libplacebo comes with a built-in debanding filter that
                  is good at counteracting many common sources of
                  banding and blocking. Turning this on is highly
                  recommended whenever quality is desired.

                  ``deband``
                     Enable (fast) debanding algorithm. Disabled by
                     default.

                  ``deband_iterations``
                     Number of deband iterations of the debanding
                     algorithm. Each iteration is performed with
                     progressively increased radius (and diminished
                     threshold). Recommended values are in the range
                     ``1`` to ``4``. Defaults to ``1``.

                  ``deband_threshold``
                     Debanding filter strength. Higher numbers lead to
                     more aggressive debanding. Defaults to ``4.0``.

                  ``deband_radius``
                     Debanding filter radius. A higher radius is better
                     for slow gradients, while a lower radius is better
                     for steep gradients. Defaults to ``16.0``.

                  ``deband_grain``
                     Amount of extra output grain to add. Helps hide
                     imperfections. Defaults to ``6.0``.

                     :name: color-adjustment
                     :class: subsubsection

                  A collection of subjective color controls. Not very
                  rigorous, so the exact effect will vary somewhat
                  depending on the input primaries and colorspace.

                  ``brightness``
                     Brightness boost, between ``-1.0`` and ``1.0``.
                     Defaults to ``0.0``.

                  ``contrast``
                     Contrast gain, between ``0.0`` and ``16.0``.
                     Defaults to ``1.0``.

                  ``saturation``
                     Saturation gain, between ``0.0`` and ``16.0``.
                     Defaults to ``1.0``.

                  ``hue``
                     Hue shift in radians, between ``-3.14`` and
                     ``3.14``. Defaults to ``0.0``. This will rotate the
                     UV subvector, defaulting to BT.709 coefficients for
                     RGB inputs.

                  ``gamma``
                     Gamma adjustment, between ``0.0`` and ``16.0``.
                     Defaults to ``1.0``.

                  ``cones``
                     Cone model to use for color blindness simulation.
                     Accepts any combination of ``l``, ``m`` and ``s``.
                     Here are some examples:

                     ‘\ ``m``\ ’
                        Deuteranomaly / deuteranopia (affecting 3%-4% of
                        the population)

                     ‘\ ``l``\ ’
                        Protanomaly / protanopia (affecting 1%-2% of the
                        population)

                     ‘\ ``l+m``\ ’
                        Monochromacy (very rare)

                     ‘\ ``l+m+s``\ ’
                        Achromatopsy (complete loss of daytime vision,
                        extremely rare)

                  ``cone-strength``
                     Gain factor for the cones specified by ``cones``,
                     between ``0.0`` and ``10.0``. A value of ``1.0``
                     results in no change to color vision. A value of
                     ``0.0`` (the default) simulates complete loss of
                     those cones. Values above ``1.0`` result in
                     exaggerating the differences between cones, which
                     may help compensate for reduced color vision.

                     :class: subsubsection

                  To help deal with sources that only have static HDR10
                  metadata (or no tagging whatsoever), libplacebo uses
                  its own internal frame analysis compute shader to
                  analyze source frames and adapt the tone mapping
                  function in realtime. If this is too slow, or if
                  exactly reproducible frame-perfect results are needed,
                  it’s recommended to turn this feature off.

                  ``peak_detect``
                     Enable HDR peak detection. Ignores static
                     MaxCLL/MaxFALL values in favor of dynamic detection
                     from the input. Note that the detected values do
                     not get written back to the output frames, they
                     merely guide the internal tone mapping process.
                     Enabled by default.

                  ``smoothing_period``
                     Peak detection smoothing period, between ``0.0``
                     and ``1000.0``. Higher values result in peak
                     detection becoming less responsive to changes in
                     the input. Defaults to ``100.0``.

                  ``minimum_peak``
                     Lower bound on the detected peak (relative to SDR
                     white), between ``0.0`` and ``100.0``. Defaults to
                     ``1.0``.

                  ``scene_threshold_low``
                  ``scene_threshold_high``
                     Lower and upper thresholds for scene change
                     detection. Expressed in a logarithmic scale between
                     ``0.0`` and ``100.0``. Default to ``5.5`` and
                     ``10.0``, respectively. Setting either to a
                     negative value disables this functionality.

                  ``percentile``
                     Which percentile of the frame brightness histogram
                     to use as the source peak for tone-mapping.
                     Defaults to ``99.995``, a fairly conservative
                     value. Setting this to ``100.0`` disables frame
                     histogram measurement and instead uses the true
                     peak brightness for tone-mapping.

                  The options in this section control how libplacebo
                  performs tone-mapping and gamut-mapping when dealing
                  with mismatches between wide-gamut or HDR content. In
                  general, libplacebo relies on accurate source tagging
                  and mastering display gamut information to produce the
                  best results.

                  ``gamut_mode``
                     How to handle out-of-gamut colors that can occur as
                     a result of colorimetric gamut mapping.

                     ‘\ ``clip``\ ’
                        Do nothing, simply clip out-of-range colors to
                        the RGB volume. Low quality but extremely fast.

                     ‘\ ``perceptual``\ ’
                        Perceptually soft-clip colors to the gamut
                        volume. This is the default.

                     ‘\ ``relative``\ ’
                        Relative colorimetric hard-clip. Similar to
                        ``perceptual`` but without the soft knee.

                     ‘\ ``saturation``\ ’
                        Saturation mapping, maps primaries directly to
                        primaries in RGB space. Not recommended except
                        for artificial computer graphics for which a
                        bright, saturated display is desired.

                     ‘\ ``absolute``\ ’
                        Absolute colorimetric hard-clip. Performs no
                        adjustment of the white point.

                     ‘\ ``desaturate``\ ’
                        Hard-desaturates out-of-gamut colors towards
                        white, while preserving the luminance. Has a
                        tendency to distort the visual appearance of
                        bright objects.

                     ‘\ ``darken``\ ’
                        Linearly reduces content brightness to preserves
                        saturated details, followed by clipping the
                        remaining out-of-gamut colors.

                     ‘\ ``warn``\ ’
                        Highlight out-of-gamut pixels (by
                        inverting/marking them).

                     ‘\ ``linear``\ ’
                        Linearly reduces chromaticity of the entire
                        image to make it fit within the target color
                        volume. Be careful when using this on BT.2020
                        sources without proper mastering metadata, as
                        doing so will lead to excessive desaturation.

                  ``tonemapping``
                     Tone-mapping algorithm to use. Available values
                     are:

                     ‘\ ``auto``\ ’
                        Automatic selection based on internal
                        heuristics. This is the default.

                     ‘\ ``clip``\ ’
                        Performs no tone-mapping, just clips
                        out-of-range colors. Retains perfect color
                        accuracy for in-range colors but completely
                        destroys out-of-range information. Does not
                        perform any black point adaptation. Not
                        configurable.

                     ‘\ ``st2094-40``\ ’
                        EETF from SMPTE ST 2094-40 Annex B, which
                        applies the Bezier curves from HDR10+ dynamic
                        metadata based on Bezier curves to perform
                        tone-mapping. The OOTF used is adjusted based on
                        the ratio between the targeted and actual
                        display peak luminances.

                     ‘\ ``st2094-10``\ ’
                        EETF from SMPTE ST 2094-10 Annex B.2, which
                        takes into account the input signal average
                        luminance in addition to the maximum/minimum.
                        The configurable contrast parameter influences
                        the slope of the linear output segment,
                        defaulting to ``1.0`` for no increase/decrease
                        in contrast. Note that this does not currently
                        include the subjective gain/offset/gamma
                        controls defined in Annex B.3.

                        EETF from the ITU-R Report BT.2390, a hermite
                        spline roll-off with linear segment. The knee
                        point offset is configurable. Note that this
                        parameter defaults to ``1.0``, rather than the
                        value of ``0.5`` from the ITU-R spec.

                     ‘\ ``bt.2446a``\ ’
                        EETF from ITU-R Report BT.2446, method A.
                        Designed for well-mastered HDR sources. Can be
                        used for both forward and inverse tone mapping.
                        Not configurable.

                     ‘\ ``spline``\ ’
                        Simple spline consisting of two polynomials,
                        joined by a single pivot point. The parameter
                        gives the pivot point (in PQ space), defaulting
                        to ``0.30``. Can be used for both forward and
                        inverse tone mapping.

                     ‘\ ``reinhard``\ ’
                        Simple non-linear, global tone mapping
                        algorithm. The parameter specifies the local
                        contrast coefficient at the display peak.
                        Essentially, a parameter of ``0.5`` implies that
                        the reference white will be about half as bright
                        as when clipping. Defaults to ``0.5``, which
                        results in the simplest formulation of this
                        function.

                     ‘\ ``mobius``\ ’
                        Generalization of the reinhard tone mapping
                        algorithm to support an additional linear slope
                        near black. The tone mapping parameter indicates
                        the trade-off between the linear section and the
                        non-linear section. Essentially, for a given
                        parameter ``x``, every color value below ``x``
                        will be mapped linearly, while higher values get
                        non-linearly tone-mapped. Values near ``1.0``
                        make this curve behave like ``clip``, while
                        values near ``0.0`` make this curve behave like
                        ``reinhard``. The default value is ``0.3``,
                        which provides a good balance between
                        colorimetric accuracy and preserving
                        out-of-gamut details.

                     ‘\ ``hable``\ ’
                        Piece-wise, filmic tone-mapping algorithm
                        developed by John Hable for use in Uncharted 2,
                        inspired by a similar tone-mapping algorithm
                        used by Kodak. Popularized by its use in video
                        games with HDR rendering. Preserves both dark
                        and bright details very well, but comes with the
                        drawback of changing the average brightness
                        quite significantly. This is sort of similar to
                        ``reinhard`` with parameter ``0.24``.

                     ‘\ ``gamma``\ ’
                        Fits a gamma (power) function to transfer
                        between the source and target color spaces,
                        effectively resulting in a perceptual hard-knee
                        joining two roughly linear sections. This
                        preserves details at all scales fairly
                        accurately, but can result in an image with a
                        muted or dull appearance. The parameter is used
                        as the cutoff point, defaulting to ``0.5``.

                     ‘\ ``linear``\ ’
                        Linearly stretches the input range to the output
                        range, in PQ space. This will preserve all
                        details accurately, but results in a
                        significantly different average brightness. Can
                        be used for inverse tone-mapping in addition to
                        regular tone-mapping. The parameter can be used
                        as an additional linear gain coefficient
                        (defaulting to ``1.0``).

                  ``tonemapping_param``
                     For tunable tone mapping functions, this parameter
                     can be used to fine-tune the curve behavior. Refer
                     to the documentation of ``tonemapping``. The
                     default value of ``0.0`` is replaced by the curve’s
                     preferred default setting.

                  ``inverse_tonemapping``
                     If enabled, this filter will also attempt
                     stretching SDR signals to fill HDR output color
                     volumes. Disabled by default.

                  ``tonemapping_lut_size``
                     Size of the tone-mapping LUT, between ``2`` and
                     ``1024``. Defaults to ``256``. Note that this
                     figure is squared when combined with
                     ``peak_detect``.

                  ``contrast_recovery``
                     Contrast recovery strength. If set to a value above
                     ``0.0``, the source image will be divided into
                     high-frequency and low-frequency components, and a
                     portion of the high-frequency image is added back
                     onto the tone-mapped output. May cause excessive
                     ringing artifacts for some HDR sources, but can
                     improve the subjective sharpness and detail left
                     over in the image after tone-mapping. Defaults to
                     ``0.30``.

                  ``contrast_smoothness``
                     Contrast recovery lowpass kernel size. Defaults to
                     ``3.5``. Increasing or decreasing this will affect
                     the visual appearance substantially. Has no effect
                     when ``contrast_recovery`` is disabled.

                  By default, libplacebo will dither whenever necessary,
                  which includes rendering to any integer format below
                  16-bit precision. It’s recommended to always leave
                  this on, since not doing so may result in visible
                  banding in the output, even if the ``debanding``
                  filter is enabled. If maximum performance is needed,
                  use ``ordered_fixed`` instead of disabling dithering.

                  ``dithering``
                     Dithering method to use. Accepts the following
                     values:

                     ‘\ ``none``\ ’
                        Disables dithering completely. May result in
                        visible banding.

                     ‘\ ``blue``\ ’
                        Dither with pseudo-blue noise. This is the
                        default.

                        Faster ordered dither with a fixed size of
                        ``6``. Texture-less.

                     ‘\ ``white``\ ’
                        Dither with white noise. Texture-less.

                  ``dither_lut_size``
                     Dither LUT size, as log base2 between ``1`` and
                     ``8``. Defaults to ``6``, corresponding to a LUT
                     size of ``64x64``.

                  ``dither_temporal``
                     Enables temporal dithering. Disabled by default.

                  libplacebo supports a number of custom shaders based
                  on the mpv .hook GLSL syntax. A collection of such
                  shaders can be found here:

               A ‘\|‘ delimited list of vmaf models. Each model can be
               configured with a number of parameters. Default value:
               ``"version=vmaf_v0.6.1"``

            ``feature``
               A ‘\|‘ delimited list of features. Each feature can be
               configured with a number of parameters.

            ``log_path``
               Set the file path to be used to store log files.

            ``log_fmt``
               Set the format of the log file (xml, json, csv, or sub).

            ``n_threads``
               Set number of threads to be used when initializing
               libvmaf. Default value: ``0``, no threads.

            This is the CUDA variant of the `libvmaf <#libvmaf>`__
            filter. It only accepts CUDA frames.

            It requires Netflix’s vmaf library (libvmaf) as a
            pre-requisite. After installing the library it can be
            enabled using:
            ``./configure --enable-nonfree --enable-ffnvcodec --enable-libvmaf``.

            Apply limited difference filter using second and optionally
            third video stream.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``threshold``
               Set the threshold to use when allowing certain
               differences between video streams. Any absolute
               difference value lower or exact than this threshold will
               pick pixel components from first video stream.

            ``elasticity``
               Set the elasticity of soft thresholding when processing
               video streams. This value multiplied with first one sets
               second threshold. Any absolute difference value greater
               or exact than second threshold will pick pixel components
               from second video stream. For values between those two
               threshold linear interpolation between first and second
               video stream will be used.

            ``reference``
               Enable the reference (third) video stream processing. By
               default is disabled. If set, this video stream will be
               used for calculating absolute difference with first video
               stream.

            ``planes``
               Specify which planes will be processed. Defaults to all
               available.

            input value to an output value, and apply it to the input
            video.

            ``lutyuv`` applies a lookup table to a YUV input video,
            ``lutrgb`` to an RGB input video.

            These filters accept the following parameters:

            Each of them specifies the expression to use for computing
            the lookup table for the corresponding pixel component
            values.

            The exact component associated to each of the ``c*`` options
            depends on the format in input.

            The ``lut`` filter requires either YUV or RGB pixel formats
            in input, ``lutrgb`` requires RGB pixel formats in input,
            and ``lutyuv`` requires YUV.

            The expressions can contain the following constants and
            functions:

            ``w``
            ``h``
               The input width and height.

            ``val``
               The input value for the pixel component.

            ``clipval``
               The input value, clipped to the ``minval``-``maxval``
               range.

            ``maxval``
               The maximum value for the pixel component.

            ``minval``
               The minimum value for the pixel component.

            ``negval``
               The negated value for the pixel component value, clipped
               to the ``minval``-``maxval`` range; it corresponds to the
               expression "maxval-clipval+minval".

            ``clip(val)``
               The computed value in ``val``, clipped to the
               ``minval``-``maxval`` range.

            ``gammaval(gamma)``
               The computed gamma correction value of the pixel
               component value, clipped to the ``minval``-``maxval``
               range. It corresponds to the expression
               "pow((clipval-minval)/(maxval-minval)\\,\ ``gamma``)*(maxval-minval)+minval"

            All expressions default to "clipval".

            The ``lut2`` filter takes two input streams and outputs one
            stream.

            The ``tlut2`` (time lut2) filter takes two consecutive
            frames from one single stream.

            This filter accepts the following parameters:

            ``c0``
               set first pixel component expression

            ``c1``
               set second pixel component expression

            ``c2``
               set third pixel component expression

            ``c3``
               set fourth pixel component expression, corresponds to the
               alpha component

            ``d``
               set output bit depth, only available for ``lut2`` filter.
               By default is 0, which means bit depth is automatically
               picked from first input format.

            The ``lut2`` filter also supports the
            `framesync <#framesync>`__ options.

            Each of them specifies the expression to use for computing
            the lookup table for the corresponding pixel component
            values.

            The exact component associated to each of the ``c*`` options
            depends on the format in inputs.

            The expressions can contain the following constants:

            ``w``
            ``h``
               The input width and height.

            ``x``
               The first input value for the pixel component.

            ``y``
               The second input value for the pixel component.

            ``bdx``
               The first input video bit depth.

            ``bdy``
               The second input video bit depth.

            All expressions default to "x".

            This filter accepts the following options:

            ``low``
               Set low threshold. Any pixel component lower or exact
               than this value will be set to 0.

            ``high``
               Set high threshold. Any pixel component higher than this
               value will be set to max value allowed for current pixel
               format.

            ``planes``
               Set planes to filter, by default all available planes are
               filtered.

            ``fill``
               Fill all frame pixels with this value.

            ``sum``
               Set max average pixel value for frame. If sum of all
               pixel components is higher that this average, output
               frame will be completely filled with value set by
               ``fill`` option. Typically useful for scene changes when

            ``qp``
               Set per-block quantization parameter (QP) used by the
               internal encoder.

               Higher values should result in a smoother motion vector
               field but less optimal individual vectors. Default value
               is 1.

            transforms, erode and dilate with arbitrary structures set
            in second input stream.

            Unlike naive implementation and much slower performance in
            `erosion <#erosion>`__ and `dilation <#dilation>`__ filters,
            when speed is critical ``morpho`` filter should be used
            instead.

            A description of accepted options follows,

            ``mode``
            Set morphological transform to apply, can be:

            ‘\ ``erode``\ ’
            ‘\ ``dilate``\ ’
            ‘\ ``open``\ ’
            ‘\ ``close``\ ’
            ‘\ ``gradient``\ ’
            ‘\ ``tophat``\ ’
            ‘\ ``blackhat``\ ’
            Default is ``erode``.

            ``planes``
            Set planes to filter, by default all planes except alpha are
            filtered.

            ``structure``
            Set which structure video frames will be processed from
            second input stream, can be ``first`` or ``all``. Default is
            ``all``.

            The ``morpho`` filter also supports the
            `framesync <#framesync>`__ options.

            Drop frames that do not differ greatly from the previous
            frame in order to reduce frame rate.

            The main use of this filter is for very-low-bitrate encoding
            (e.g. streaming over dialup modem), but it could in theory
            be used for fixing movies that were inverse-telecined
            incorrectly.

            A description of the accepted options follows.

            ``max``
               Set the maximum number of consecutive frames which can be
               dropped (if positive), or the minimum interval between
               dropped frames (if negative). If the value is 0, the
               frame is dropped disregarding the number of previous
               sequentially dropped frames.

               Default value is 0.

            ``keep``
               Set the maximum number of consecutive similar frames to
               ignore before to start dropping them. If the value is 0,
               the frame is dropped disregarding the number of previous
               sequentially similar frames.

               Default value is 0.

            ``hi``
            ``lo``
            ``frac``
               Set the dropping threshold values.

               Values for ``hi`` and ``lo`` are for 8x8 pixel blocks and
               represent actual pixel value differences, so a threshold
               of 64 corresponds to 1 unit of difference for each pixel,
               or the same spread out differently over the block.

               A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 blocks
               differ by more than a threshold of ``hi``, and if no more
               than ``frac`` blocks (1 meaning the whole image) differ
               by more than a threshold of ``lo``.

               Default value for ``hi`` is 64*12, default value for
               ``lo`` is 64*5, and default value for ``frac`` is 0.33.

            Obtain the MSAD (Mean Sum of Absolute Differences) between
            two input videos.

            This filter takes two input videos.

            Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel
            format for this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes
            that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are
            compared one by one.

            The obtained per component, average, min and max MSAD is
            printed through the logging system.

            The filter stores the calculated MSAD of each frame in frame
            metadata.

            This filter also supports the `framesync <#framesync>`__
            options.

            Denoise frames using Non-Local Means algorithm.

            Each pixel is adjusted by looking for other pixels with
            similar contexts. This context similarity is defined by
            comparing their surrounding patches of size ``p``\ x\ ``p``.
            Patches are searched in an area of ``r``\ x\ ``r`` around
            the pixel.

            Note that the research area defines centers for patches,
            which means some patches will be made of pixels outside that
            research area.

            The filter accepts the following options.

            ``s``
               Set denoising strength. Default is 1.0. Must be in range
               [1.0, 30.0].

            ``p``
               Set patch size. Default is 7. Must be odd number in range
               [0, 99].

            ``pc``
               Same as ``p`` but for chroma planes.

               The default value is ``0`` and means automatic.

            ``r``
               Set research size. Default is 15. Must be odd number in
               range [0, 99].

            ``nsize``
            Set size of local neighborhood around each pixel, used by
            the predictor neural network.

            ``nns``
            Set the number of neurons in predictor neural network. Can
            be one of the following:

            ‘\ ``n16``\ ’
            ‘\ ``n32``\ ’

            ‘\ ``n256``\ ’
            ``qual``
            Controls the number of different neural network predictions
            that are blended together to compute the final output value.

               weights trained to minimize squared error

            ``pscrn``
            Controls whether or not the prescreener neural network is
            used to decide which pixels should be processed by the
            predictor neural network and which can be handled by simple
            cubic interpolation. The prescreener is trained to know
            whether cubic interpolation will be sufficient for a pixel
            or whether it should be predicted by the predictor nn. The
            computational complexity of the prescreener nn is much less
            than that of the predictor nn. Since most pixels can be
            handled by cubic interpolation, using the prescreener
            generally results in much faster processing. The prescreener
            is pretty accurate, so the difference between using it and
            not using it is almost always unnoticeable.

            Can be one of the following:

            ‘\ ``none``\ ’
            ‘\ ``original``\ ’
            ‘\ ``new``\ ’
            ‘\ ``new2``\ ’
            ‘\ ``new3``\ ’
            Default is ``new``.

               :class: section

            Normalize RGB video (aka histogram stretching, contrast
            stretching). See:
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization\_(image_processing)

            For each channel of each frame, the filter computes the
            input range and maps it linearly to the user-specified
            output range. The output range defaults to the full dynamic
            range from pure black to pure white.

            Temporal smoothing can be used on the input range to reduce
            flickering (rapid changes in brightness) caused when small
            dark or bright objects enter or leave the scene. This is
            similar to the auto-exposure (automatic gain control) on a
            video camera, and, like a video camera, it may cause a
            period of over- or under-exposure of the video.

            The R,G,B channels can be normalized independently, which
            may cause some color shifting, or linked together as a
            single channel, which prevents color shifting. Linked
            normalization preserves hue. Independent normalization does
            not, so it can be used to remove some color casts.
            Independent and linked normalization can be combined in any
            ratio.

            The normalize filter accepts the following options:

            ``blackpt``
            ``whitept``
               Colors which define the output range. The minimum input
               value is mapped to the ``blackpt``. The maximum input
               value is mapped to the ``whitept``. The defaults are
               black and white respectively. Specifying white for
               ``blackpt`` and black for ``whitept`` will give
               color-inverted, normalized video. Shades of grey can be
               used to reduce the dynamic range (contrast). Specifying
               saturated colors here can create some interesting
               effects.

            ``smoothing``
               The number of previous frames to use for temporal
               smoothing. The input range of each channel is smoothed
               using a rolling average over the current frame and the
               ``smoothing`` previous frames. The default is 0 (no
               temporal smoothing).

            ``independence``
               Controls the ratio of independent (color shifting)
               channel normalization to linked (color preserving)
               normalization. 0.0 is fully linked, 1.0 is fully
               independent. Defaults to 1.0 (fully independent).

            ``strength``
               Overall strength of the filter. 1.0 is full strength. 0.0
               is a rather expensive no-op. Defaults to 1.0 (full
               strength).

            Optical Character Recognition

            This filter uses Tesseract for optical character
            recognition. To enable compilation of this filter, you need
            to configure FFmpeg with ``--enable-libtesseract``.

            It accepts the following options:

            ``datapath``
               Set datapath to tesseract data. Default is to use
               whatever was set at installation.

            ``language``
               Set language, default is "eng".

            ``whitelist``
               Set character whitelist.

            ``blacklist``
               Set character blacklist.

            The filter exports recognized text as the frame metadata
            ``lavfi.ocr.text``. The filter exports confidence of
            recognized words as the frame metadata
            ``lavfi.ocr.confidence``.

            To enable this filter, install the libopencv library and
            headers and configure FFmpeg with ``--enable-libopencv``.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``filter_name``
               The name of the libopencv filter to apply.

            ``filter_params``
               The parameters to pass to the libopencv filter. If not
               specified, the default values are assumed.

            Refer to the official libopencv documentation for more
            precise information:
            http://docs.opencv.org/master/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html

            Several libopencv filters are supported; see the following
            subsections.

            -  `dilate <#dilate-1>`__

               :name: dilate-1

               .. rubric:: 30.181.1 dilate
                  :name: dilate
                  :class: subsection

               Dilate an image by using a specific structuring element.
               It corresponds to the libopencv function ``cvDilate``.

               It accepts the parameters:
               ``struct_el``\ \|\ ``nb_iterations``.

               ``struct_el`` represents a structuring element, and has
               the syntax:
               ``cols``\ x\ ``rows``\ +\ ``anchor_x``\ x\ ``anchor_y``/``shape``

               ``cols`` and ``rows`` represent the number of columns and
               rows of the structuring element, ``anchor_x`` and
               ``anchor_y`` the anchor point, and ``shape`` the shape
               for the structuring element. ``shape`` must be "rect",
               "cross", "ellipse", or "custom".

               If the value for ``shape`` is "custom", it must be
               followed by a string of the form "=\ ``filename``". The
               file with name ``filename`` is assumed to represent a
               binary image, with each printable character corresponding
               to a bright pixel. When a custom ``shape`` is used,
               ``cols`` and ``rows`` are ignored, the number or columns
               and rows of the read file are assumed instead.

               The default value for ``struct_el`` is "3x3+0x0/rect".

               ``nb_iterations`` specifies the number of times the
               transform is applied to the image, and defaults to 1.

               Some examples:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     # Use the default values
                     ocv=dilate

                     # Dilate using a structuring element with a 5x5 cross, iterating two times
                     ocv=filter_name=dilate:filter_params=5x5+2x2/cross|2

                     # Read the shape from the file diamond.shape, iterating two times.
                     # The file diamond.shape may contain a pattern of characters like this
                     #   *
                     #  ***
                     # *****
                     #  ***
                     #   *
                     # The specified columns and rows are ignored
                     # but the anchor point coordinates are not
                     ocv=dilate:0x0+2x2/custom=diamond.shape|2

               Erode an image by using a specific structuring element.
               It corresponds to the libopencv function ``cvErode``.

               It accepts the parameters:
               ``struct_el``:``nb_iterations``, with the same syntax and
               semantics as the `dilate <#dilate>`__ filter.

               :name: smooth

               .. rubric:: 30.181.3 smooth
                  :class: subsection

               Smooth the input video.

               The filter takes the following parameters:
               ``type``\ \|\ ``param1``\ \|\ ``param2``\ \|\ ``param3``\ \|\ ``param4``.

               ``type`` is the type of smooth filter to apply, and must
               be one of the following values: "blur", "blur_no_scale",
               "median", "gaussian", or "bilateral". The default value
               is "gaussian".

               The meaning of ``param1``, ``param2``, ``param3``, and
               ``param4`` depends on the smooth type. ``param1`` and
               ``param2`` accept integer positive values or 0.
               ``param3`` and ``param4`` accept floating point values.

               The default value for ``param1`` is 3. The default value
               for the other parameters is 0.

               These parameters correspond to the parameters assigned to
               the libopencv function ``cvSmooth``.

               Default value is ‘\ ``yuv420``\ ’.

            ``repeatlast``
               See `framesync <#framesync>`__.

            ``alpha``
               Set format of alpha of the overlaid video, it can be
               ``straight`` or ``premultiplied``. Default is
               ``straight``.

            The ``x``, and ``y`` expressions can contain the following
            parameters.

            ``main_w, W``
            ``main_h, H``
               The main input width and height.

            ``overlay_w, w``
            ``overlay_h, h``
               The overlay input width and height.

            ``x``
            ``y``
               The computed values for ``x`` and ``y``. They are
               evaluated for each new frame.

            ``hsub``
            ``vsub``
               horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values of the
               output format. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p"
               ``hsub`` is 2 and ``vsub`` is 1.

            ``n``
               the number of input frame, starting from 0

            ``pos``
               the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if
               unknown; deprecated, do not use

            ``t``
               The timestamp, expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if the
               input timestamp is unknown.

            This filter also supports the `framesync <#framesync>`__
            options.

            Note that the ``n``, ``t`` variables are available only when
            evaluation is done *per frame*, and will evaluate to NAN
            when ``eval`` is set to ‘\ ``init``\ ’.

            Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in
            timestamp order, hence, if their initial timestamps differ,
            it is a good idea to pass the two inputs through a
            ``setpts=PTS-STARTPTS`` filter to have them begin in the
            same zero timestamp, as the example for the ``movie`` filter
            does.

            You can chain together more overlays but you should test the
            efficiency of such approach.

               -  Add a transparent color layer on top of the main
                  video; ``WxH`` must specify the size of the main input
                  to the overlay filter:

            Overlay one video on top of another.

            This is the CUDA variant of the `overlay <#overlay>`__
            filter. It only accepts CUDA frames. The underlying input
            pixel formats have to match.

            It takes two inputs and has one output. The first input is
            the "main" video on which the second input is overlaid.

            It accepts the following parameters:

               ``y``
                  The computed values for ``x`` and ``y``. They are
                  evaluated for each new frame.

               ``n``
                  The ordinal index of the main input frame, starting
                  from 0.

               ``pos``
                  The byte offset position in the file of the main input
                  frame, NAN if unknown. Deprecated, do not use.

               ``t``
                  The timestamp of the main input frame, expressed in
                  seconds, NAN if unknown.

               Default value is "0" for both expressions.

            ``eval``
               Set when the expressions for ``x`` and ``y`` are
               evaluated.

               It accepts the following values:

               ``init``
                  Evaluate expressions once during filter initialization
                  or when a command is processed.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``depth``
               Set depth.

               Larger depth values will denoise lower frequency
               components more, but slow down filtering.

               Must be an int in the range 8-16, default is ``8``.

            ``luma_strength, ls``
               Set luma strength.

               Must be a double value in the range 0-1000, default is
               ``1.0``.

            ``chroma_strength, cs``
               Set chroma strength.

               :name: pad
               :class: section

            Add paddings to the input image, and place the original
            input at the provided ``x``, ``y`` coordinates.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``width, w``
            ``height, h``
               Specify an expression for the size of the output image
               with the paddings added. If the value for ``width`` or
               ``height`` is 0, the corresponding input size is used for
               the output.

               The ``width`` expression can reference the value set by
               the ``height`` expression, and vice versa.

               The default value of ``width`` and ``height`` is 0.

            ``x``
            ``y``
               Specify the offsets to place the input image at within
               the padded area, with respect to the top/left border of
               the output image.

               The ``x`` expression can reference the value set by the
               ``y`` expression, and vice versa.

               The default value of ``x`` and ``y`` is 0.

               If ``x`` or ``y`` evaluate to a negative number, they’ll
               be changed so the input image is centered on the padded
               area.

            ``color``
               Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of
               this option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in
               the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__.

               The default value of ``color`` is "black".

            ``eval``
               Specify when to evaluate ``width``, ``height``, ``x`` and
               ``y`` expression.

               It accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``init``\ ’
                  Only evaluate expressions once during the filter
                  initialization or when a command is processed.

               ‘\ ``frame``\ ’
                  Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame.

               Default value is ‘\ ``init``\ ’.

            ``aspect``
               Pad to aspect instead to a resolution.

            The value for the ``width``, ``height``, ``x``, and ``y``
            options are expressions containing the following constants:

            ``in_w``
            ``in_h``
               The input video width and height.

            ``out_w``
            ``out_h``
               The output width and height (the size of the padded
               area), as specified by the ``width`` and ``height``
               expressions.

               The x and y offsets as specified by the ``x`` and ``y``
               expressions, or NAN if not yet specified.

            ``hsub``
            ``vsub``
               The horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For

               -  Add paddings with the color "violet" to the input
                  video. The output video size is 640x480, and the
                  top-left corner of the input video is placed at column
                  0, row 40

                  The example above is equivalent to the following
                  command:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        pad=width=640:height=480:x=0:y=40:color=violet

               -  Pad the input to get an output with dimensions
                  increased by 3/2, and put the input video at the
                  center of the padded area:

                  to the maximum value between the input width and
                  height, and put the input video at the center of the

                        pad="max(iw\,ih):ow:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

               -  Pad the input to get a final w/h ratio of 16:9:

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        pad="ih*16/9:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

               -  In case of anamorphic video, in order to set the
                  output display aspect correctly, it is necessary to
                  use ``sar`` in the expression, according to the
                  relation:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        (ih * X / ih) * sar = output_dar
                        X = output_dar / sar

                  Thus the previous example needs to be modified to:

            Generate one palette for a whole video stream.

            It accepts the following options:

            ``max_colors``
               Set the maximum number of colors to quantize in the
               palette. Note: the palette will still contain 256 colors;
               the unused palette entries will be black.

            ``reserve_transparent``
               Create a palette of 255 colors maximum and reserve the
               last one for transparency. Reserving the transparency
               color is useful for GIF optimization. If not set, the
               maximum of colors in the palette will be 256. You
               probably want to disable this option for a standalone
               image. Set by default.

            ``transparency_color``
               Set the color that will be used as background for
               transparency.

            ``stats_mode``
               Set statistics mode.

               It accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``full``\ ’
                  Compute full frame histograms.

               ‘\ ``diff``\ ’
                  Compute histograms only for the part that differs from
                  previous frame. This might be relevant to give more
                  importance to the moving part of your input if the
                  background is static.

               ‘\ ``single``\ ’
                  Compute new histogram for each frame.

               Default value is ``full``.

            The filter also exports the frame metadata
            ``lavfi.color_quant_ratio`` (``nb_color_in / nb_color_out``)
            which you can use to evaluate the degree of color
            quantization of the palette. This information is also
            visible at ``info`` logging level.

            It accepts the following options:

            ``dither``
               Select dithering mode. Available algorithms are:

               ‘\ ``bayer``\ ’
                  Ordered 8x8 bayer dithering (deterministic)

               ‘\ ``heckbert``\ ’
                  Dithering as defined by Paul Heckbert in 1982 (simple
                  error diffusion). Note: this dithering is sometimes
                  considered "wrong" and is included as a reference.

               ‘\ ``floyd_steinberg``\ ’
                  Floyd and Steingberg dithering (error diffusion)

                  (error diffusion)

               ‘\ ``none``\ ’
                  Disable dithering.

               Default is ``sierra2_4a``.

            ``bayer_scale``
               When ``bayer`` dithering is selected, this option defines
               the scale of the pattern (how much the crosshatch pattern
               is visible). A low value means more visible pattern for
               less banding, and higher value means less visible pattern
               at the cost of more banding.

               The option must be an integer value in the range [0,5].
               Default is ``2``.

            ``diff_mode``
               If set, define the zone to process

               ‘\ ``rectangle``\ ’
                  Only the changing rectangle will be reprocessed. This
                  is similar to GIF cropping/offsetting compression
                  mechanism. This option can be useful for speed if only
                  a part of the image is changing, and has use cases
                  such as limiting the scope of the error diffusal
                  ``dither`` to the rectangle that bounds the moving
                  scene (it leads to more deterministic output if the
                  scene doesn’t change much, and as a result less moving
                  noise and better GIF compression).

               Default is ``none``.

            ``new``
               Take new palette for each output frame.

            ``alpha_threshold``
               Sets the alpha threshold for transparency. Alpha values
               above this threshold will be treated as completely
               opaque, and values below this threshold will be treated
               as completely transparent.

               The option must be an integer value in the range [0,255].
               Default is ``128``.

            ``0:0:W:0:0:H:W:H`` with which perspective will remain
            unchanged. If the ``sense`` option is set to ``source``,
            then the specified points will be sent to the corners of the
            destination. If the ``sense`` option is set to
            ``destination``, then the corners of the source will be sent
            to the specified coordinates.

            The expressions can use the following variables:

            ``W``
            ``H``
               the width and height of video frame.

            ‘\ ``cubic``\ ’
            Default value is ‘\ ``linear``\ ’.

            ``sense``
            Set interpretation of coordinate options.

            It accepts the following values:

               Send point in the source specified by the given
               coordinates to the corners of the destination.

            ‘\ ``1, destination``\ ’
               Send the corners of the source to the point in the

            Delay interlaced video by one field time so that the field
            order changes.

            The intended use is to fix PAL movies that have been
            captured with the opposite field order to the film-to-video

               It accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``t``\ ’
                  Capture field order top-first, transfer bottom-first.
                  Filter will delay the bottom field.

               ‘\ ``b``\ ’
                  Capture field order bottom-first, transfer top-first.
                  Filter will delay the top field.

               ‘\ ``p``\ ’
                  Capture and transfer with the same field order. This
                  mode only exists for the documentation of the other
                  options to refer to, but if you actually select it,
                  the filter will faithfully do nothing.

               ‘\ ``a``\ ’
                  Capture field order determined automatically by field
                  flags, transfer opposite. Filter selects among
                  ‘\ ``t``\ ’ and ‘\ ``b``\ ’ modes on a frame by frame
                  basis using field flags. If no field information is
                  available, then this works just like ‘\ ``u``\ ’.

               ‘\ ``u``\ ’
                  Capture unknown or varying, transfer opposite. Filter
                  selects among ‘\ ``t``\ ’ and ‘\ ``b``\ ’ on a frame
                  by frame basis by analyzing the images and selecting
                  the alternative that produces best match between the

                  analysis.

               ‘\ ``B``\ ’
                  Capture bottom-first, transfer unknown or varying.
                  Filter selects among ‘\ ``b``\ ’ and ‘\ ``p``\ ’ using
                  image analysis.

               ‘\ ``A``\ ’

                  and ‘\ ``p``\ ’ using field flags and image analysis.
                  If no field information is available, then this works
                  just like ‘\ ``U``\ ’. This is the default mode.

               ‘\ ``U``\ ’
                  Both capture and transfer unknown or varying. Filter
                  selects among ‘\ ``t``\ ’, ‘\ ``b``\ ’ and ‘\ ``p``\ ’
                  using image analysis only.

            Enable the specified chain of postprocessing subfilters
            using libpostproc. This library should be automatically
            selected with a GPL build (``--enable-gpl``). Subfilters
            must be separated by ’/’ and can be disabled by prepending a
            ’-’. Each subfilter and some options have a short and a long
            name that can be used interchangeably, i.e. dr/dering are
            the same.

            The filters accept the following options:

            ``subfilters``
               Set postprocessing subfilters string.

            All subfilters share common options to determine their
            scope:

            ``a/autoq``
               Honor the quality commands for this subfilter.

            ``c/chrom``
               Do chrominance filtering, too (default).

            ``y/nochrom``
               Do luma filtering only (no chrominance).

            ``n/noluma``
               Do chrominance filtering only (no luma).

            These options can be appended after the subfilter name,
            separated by a ’\|’.

            Available subfilters are:

            ``hb/hdeblock[|difference[|flatness]]``
               Horizontal deblocking filter

               ``difference``
                  Difference factor where higher values mean more
                  deblocking (default: ``32``).

               ``flatness``
                  Flatness threshold where lower values mean more
                  deblocking (default: ``39``).

            ``vb/vdeblock[|difference[|flatness]]``
               Vertical deblocking filter

               ``difference``
                  Difference factor where higher values mean more
                  deblocking (default: ``32``).

               ``flatness``
                  Flatness threshold where lower values mean more
                  deblocking (default: ``39``).

            ``ha/hadeblock[|difference[|flatness]]``
               Accurate horizontal deblocking filter

               ``difference``
                  Difference factor where higher values mean more
                  deblocking (default: ``32``).

               ``flatness``
                  Flatness threshold where lower values mean more
                  deblocking (default: ``39``).

            ``va/vadeblock[|difference[|flatness]]``
               Accurate vertical deblocking filter

               ``difference``
                  Difference factor where higher values mean more
                  deblocking (default: ``32``).

               ``flatness``
                  Flatness threshold where lower values mean more
                  deblocking (default: ``39``).

            The horizontal and vertical deblocking filters share the
            difference and flatness values so you cannot set different
            horizontal and vertical thresholds.

            Obtain the average, maximum and minimum PSNR (Peak Signal to
            Noise Ratio) between two input videos.

            This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input
            is considered the "main" source and is passed unchanged to
            the output. The second input is used as a "reference" video
            for computing the PSNR.

            Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel
            format for this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes
            that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are
            compared one by one.

            The obtained average PSNR is printed through the logging
            system.

            The filter stores the accumulated MSE (mean squared error)
            of each frame, and at the end of the processing it is
            averaged across all frames equally, and the following
            formula is applied to obtain the PSNR:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  PSNR = 10*log10(MAX^2/MSE)

            Where MAX is the average of the maximum values of each
            component of the image.

            The description of the accepted parameters follows.

            ``stats_file, f``
               If specified the filter will use the named file to save
               the PSNR of each individual frame. When filename equals
               "-" the data is sent to standard output.

            ``stats_version``
               Specifies which version of the stats file format to use.
               Details of each format are written below. Default value
               is 1.

            ``stats_add_max``
               Determines whether the max value is output to the stats
               log. Default value is 0. Requires stats_version >= 2. If
               this is set and stats_version < 2, the filter will return
               an error.

            This filter also supports the `framesync <#framesync>`__
            options.

            The file printed if ``stats_file`` is selected, contains a
            sequence of key/value pairs of the form ``key``:``value``
            for each compared couple of frames.

            If a ``stats_version`` greater than 1 is specified, a header
            line precedes the list of per-frame-pair stats, with key
            value pairs following the frame format with the following
            parameters:

            ``psnr_log_version``
               The version of the log file format. Will match
               ``stats_version``.

            ``fields``
               A comma separated list of the per-frame-pair parameters
               included in the log.

            A description of each shown per-frame-pair parameter
            follows:

            ``n``
               sequential number of the input frame, starting from 1

            ``mse_avg``
               Mean Square Error pixel-by-pixel average difference of
               the compared frames, averaged over all the image
               components.

            ``mse_y, mse_u, mse_v, mse_r, mse_g, mse_b, mse_a``
               Mean Square Error pixel-by-pixel average difference of
               the compared frames for the component specified by the
               suffix.

            ``psnr_y, psnr_u, psnr_v, psnr_r, psnr_g, psnr_b, psnr_a``
               Peak Signal to Noise ratio of the compared frames for the
               component specified by the suffix.

            ``max_avg, max_y, max_u, max_v``
               Maximum allowed value for each channel, and average over
               all channels.

               :class: section

            Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of
            handling mixed hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive,
            and 30000/1001 fps progressive content.

            The pullup filter is designed to take advantage of future
            context in making its decisions. This filter is stateless in
            the sense that it does not lock onto a pattern to follow,
            but it instead looks forward to the following fields in
            order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.

            To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps
            filter after pullup, use ``fps=24000/1001`` if the input
            frame rate is 29.97fps, ``fps=24`` for 30fps and the (rare)
            telecined 25fps input.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``jl``
            ``jr``
            ``jt``
            ``jb``
               These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the
               left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively.
               Left and right are in units of 8 pixels, while top and
               bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8 pixels
               on each side.

            ``sb``
               Set the strict breaks. Setting this option to 1 will
               reduce the chances of filter generating an occasional
               mismatched frame, but it may also cause an excessive
               number of frames to be dropped during high motion
               sequences. Conversely, setting it to -1 will make filter
               match fields more easily. This may help processing of
               video where there is slight blurring between the fields,
               but may also cause there to be interlaced frames in the
               output. Default value is ``0``.

            ``mp``
               Set the metric plane to use. It accepts the following
               values:

               ‘\ ``l``\ ’
                  Use luma plane.

               ‘\ ``u``\ ’
                  Use chroma blue plane.

               ‘\ ``v``\ ’
                  Use chroma red plane.

               This option may be set to use chroma plane instead of the
               default luma plane for doing filter’s computations. This
               may improve accuracy on very clean source material, but
               more likely will decrease accuracy, especially if there
               is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale video.
               The main purpose of setting ``mp`` to a chroma plane is
               to reduce CPU load and make pullup usable in realtime on
               slow machines.

            For best results (without duplicated frames in the output
            file) it is necessary to change the output frame rate. For
            example, to inverse telecine NTSC input:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

            Change video quantization parameters (QP).

            The filter accepts the following option:

            ``qp``
               Set expression for quantization parameter.

            The expression is evaluated through the eval API and can
            contain, among others, the following constants:

            ``known``
               1 if index is not 129, 0 otherwise.

            ``qp``

               :class: section

            Suppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine
            which pixels comprise the logo. It works by filling in the
            pixels that comprise the logo with neighboring pixels.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``filename, f``
               Set the filter bitmap file, which can be any image format
               supported by libavformat. The width and height of the
               image file must match those of the video stream being
               processed.

            Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are
            not considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are
            considered part of the logo. If you use white (255) for the
            logo and black (0) for the rest, you will be safe. For
            making the filter bitmap, it is recommended to take a screen
            capture of a black frame with the logo visible, and then
            using a threshold filter followed by the erode filter once
            or twice.

            If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember
            that if logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will
            be much reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo
            does not hurt as much, but it will increase the amount of
            blurring needed to cover over the image and will destroy
            more information than necessary, and extra pixels will slow
            things down on a large logo.

            Rotate video by an arbitrary angle expressed in radians.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            A description of the optional parameters follows.

            ``angle, a``
               Set an expression for the angle by which to rotate the
               input video clockwise, expressed as a number of radians.
               A negative value will result in a counter-clockwise
               rotation. By default it is set to "0".

               This expression is evaluated for each frame.

            ``out_w, ow``
               Set the output width expression, default value is "iw".
               This expression is evaluated just once during
               configuration.

            ``out_h, oh``
               Set the output height expression, default value is "ih".
               This expression is evaluated just once during
               configuration.

            ``bilinear``
               Enable bilinear interpolation if set to 1, a value of 0
               disables it. Default value is 1.

            ``fillcolor, c``
               Set the color used to fill the output area not covered by
               the rotated image. For the general syntax of this option,
               check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the
               ffmpeg-utils manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__.
               If the special value "none" is selected then no
               background is printed (useful for example if the
               background is never shown).

               Default value is "black".

            The expressions for the angle and the output size can
            contain the following constants and functions:

            ``n``
               sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0. It
               is always NAN before the first frame is filtered.

            ``t``
               time in seconds of the input frame, it is set to 0 when
               the filter is configured. It is always NAN before the
               first frame is filtered.

            ``hsub``
            ``vsub``
               horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For
               example for the pixel format "yuv422p" ``hsub`` is 2 and
               ``vsub`` is 1.

            ``in_w, iw``
            ``in_h, ih``
               the input video width and height

            ``out_w, ow``
            ``out_h, oh``
               the output width and height, that is the size of the
               padded area as specified by the ``width`` and ``height``
               expressions

            ``rotw(a)``
            ``roth(a)``
               the minimal width/height required for completely
               containing the input video rotated by ``a`` radians.

               These are only available when computing the ``out_w`` and
               ``out_h`` expressions.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``luma_radius, lr``
               Set luma blur filter strength, must be a value in range
               0.1-4.0, default value is 1.0. A greater value will
               result in a more blurred image, and in slower processing.

            ``luma_pre_filter_radius, lpfr``
               Set luma pre-filter radius, must be a value in the
               0.1-2.0 range, default value is 1.0.

            ``luma_strength, ls``
               Set luma maximum difference between pixels to still be
               considered, must be a value in the 0.1-100.0 range,
               default value is 1.0.

            ``chroma_radius, cr``
               Set chroma blur filter strength, must be a value in range
               -0.9-4.0. A greater value will result in a more blurred
               image, and in slower processing.

            ``chroma_pre_filter_radius, cpfr``
               Set chroma pre-filter radius, must be a value in the
               -0.9-2.0 range.

            ``chroma_strength, cs``

            Scale (resize) the input video, using the libswscale
            library.

            The scale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to
            be the same of the input, by changing the output sample
            aspect ratio.

            If the input image format is different from the format
            requested by the next filter, the scale filter will convert
            the input to the requested format.

               The filter accepts the following options, or any of the
               options supported by the libswscale scaler.

               See `(ffmpeg-scaler)the ffmpeg-scaler
               manual <ffmpeg-scaler.html#scaler_005foptions>`__ for the
               complete list of scaler options.

               ``width, w``
               ``height, h``
                  Set the output video dimension expression. Default
                  value is the input dimension.

                  If the ``width`` or ``w`` value is 0, the input width
                  is used for the output. If the ``height`` or ``h``
                  value is 0, the input height is used for the output.

                  If one and only one of the values is -n with n >= 1,
                  the scale filter will use a value that maintains the
                  aspect ratio of the input image, calculated from the
                  other specified dimension. After that it will,
                  however, make sure that the calculated dimension is
                  divisible by n and adjust the value if necessary.

                  If both values are -n with n >= 1, the behavior will
                  be identical to both values being set to 0 as
                  previously detailed.

                  See below for the list of accepted constants for use
                  in the dimension expression.

               ``eval``
                  Specify when to evaluate ``width`` and ``height``
                  expression. It accepts the following values:

                  ‘\ ``init``\ ’
                     Only evaluate expressions once during the filter
                     initialization or when a command is processed.

                  ‘\ ``frame``\ ’
                     Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame.

                  Default value is ‘\ ``init``\ ’.

               ``interl``
                  Set the interlacing mode. It accepts the following
                  values:

                  ‘\ ``1``\ ’
                     Force interlaced aware scaling.

                  ‘\ ``0``\ ’
                     Do not apply interlaced scaling.

                  ‘\ ``-1``\ ’
                     Select interlaced aware scaling depending on
                     whether the source frames are flagged as interlaced
                     or not.

                  Default value is ‘\ ``0``\ ’.

               ``flags``
                  Set libswscale scaling flags. See `(ffmpeg-scaler)the
                  ffmpeg-scaler
                  manual <ffmpeg-scaler.html#sws_005fflags>`__ for the
                  complete list of values. If not explicitly specified
                  the filter applies the default flags.

               ``param0, param1``
                  Set libswscale input parameters for scaling algorithms
                  that need them. See `(ffmpeg-scaler)the ffmpeg-scaler
                  manual <ffmpeg-scaler.html#sws_005fparams>`__ for the
                  complete documentation. If not explicitly specified
                  the filter applies empty parameters.

               ``size, s``
                  Set the video size. For the syntax of this option,
                  check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the
                  ffmpeg-utils
                  manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax>`__.

               ``in_color_matrix``
               ``out_color_matrix``
                  Set in/output YCbCr color space type.

                  This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as
                  well as allows forcing a specific value used for the
                  output and encoder.

                  If not specified, the color space type depends on the
                  pixel format.

                  Possible values:

                  ‘\ ``auto``\ ’
                     Choose automatically.

                  ‘\ ``bt709``\ ’

                     Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation
                     BT.709.

                  ‘\ ``fcc``\ ’
                     Set color space conforming to the United States
                     Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Code of
                     Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47 (2003) 73.682

                  ‘\ ``bt470``\ ’

                     Set color space conforming to:

                     -  ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R)
                        Recommendation BT.601

                  ‘\ ``smpte240m``\ ’
                     Set color space conforming to SMPTE ST 240:1999.

                  ‘\ ``bt2020``\ ’
                     Set color space conforming to ITU-R BT.2020
                     non-constant luminance system.

               ``in_range``
               ``out_range``
                  Set in/output YCbCr sample range.

                  This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as
                  well as allows forcing a specific value used for the
                  output and encoder. If not specified, the range
                  depends on the pixel format. Possible values:

                  ‘\ ``auto/unknown``\ ’
                     Choose automatically.

                  ‘\ ``jpeg/full/pc``\ ’
                     Set full range (0-255 in case of 8-bit luma).

                  ‘\ ``mpeg/limited/tv``\ ’
                     Set "MPEG" range (16-235 in case of 8-bit luma).

               ``force_original_aspect_ratio``
                  Enable decreasing or increasing output video width or
                  height if necessary to keep the original aspect ratio.
                  Possible values:

                  ‘\ ``disable``\ ’
                     Scale the video as specified and disable this
                     feature.

                  ‘\ ``decrease``\ ’
                     The output video dimensions will automatically be
                     decreased if needed.

                  ‘\ ``increase``\ ’
                     The output video dimensions will automatically be
                     increased if needed.

                  One useful instance of this option is that when you
                  know a specific device’s maximum allowed resolution,
                  you can use this to limit the output video to that,
                  while retaining the aspect ratio. For example, device
                  A allows 1280x720 playback, and your video is
                  1920x800. Using this option (set it to decrease) and
                  specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the
                  output 1280x533.

                  Please note that this is a different thing than
                  specifying -1 for ``w`` or ``h``, you still need to
                  specify the output resolution for this option to work.

               ``force_divisible_by``
                  Ensures that both the output dimensions, width and
                  height, are divisible by the given integer when used
                  together with ``force_original_aspect_ratio``. This
                  works similar to using ``-n`` in the ``w`` and ``h``
                  options.

                  This option respects the value set for
                  ``force_original_aspect_ratio``, increasing or
                  decreasing the resolution accordingly. The video’s
                  aspect ratio may be slightly modified.

                  This option can be handy if you need to have a video
                  fit within or exceed a defined resolution using
                  ``force_original_aspect_ratio`` but also have encoder
                  restrictions on width or height divisibility.

               The values of the ``w`` and ``h`` options are expressions
               containing the following constants:

               ``in_w``
               ``in_h``
                  The input width and height

               ``iw``
               ``ih``
                  These are the same as ``in_w`` and ``in_h``.

               ``out_w``
               ``out_h``
                  The output (scaled) width and height

               ``ow``
               ``oh``
                  These are the same as ``out_w`` and ``out_h``

               ``a``
                  The same as ``iw`` / ``ih``

               ``sar``
                  input sample aspect ratio

               ``dar``
                  The input display aspect ratio. Calculated from
                  ``(iw / ih) * sar``.

               ``hsub``
               ``vsub``
                  horizontal and vertical input chroma subsample values.
                  For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" ``hsub`` is
                  2 and ``vsub`` is 1.

               ``ohsub``
               ``ovsub``
                  horizontal and vertical output chroma subsample
                  values. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p"
                  ``hsub`` is 2 and ``vsub`` is 1.

               ``n``
                  The (sequential) number of the input frame, starting
                  from 0. Only available with ``eval=frame``.

               ``t``
                  The presentation timestamp of the input frame,
                  expressed as a number of seconds. Only available with
                  ``eval=frame``.

               ``pos``
                  The position (byte offset) of the frame in the input
                  stream, or NaN if this information is unavailable
                  and/or meaningless (for example in case of synthetic
                  video). Only available with ``eval=frame``.

                        scale=ih*PHI:ih

               -  Increase the height, and set the width to 3/2 of the

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        scale=w=3/2*oh:h=3/5*ih

               -  Increase the size, making the size a multiple of the
                  chroma subsample values:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

               ``width, w``
               ``height, h``
                  Set the output video dimension expression. The command
                  accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

                  If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept

            Scale (resize) and convert (pixel format) the input video,
            using accelerated CUDA kernels. Setting the output width and
            height works in the same way as for the `scale <#scale>`__
            filter.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``w``
            ``h``
               Set the output video dimension expression. Default value
               is the input dimension.

               Allows for the same expressions as the `scale <#scale>`__
               filter.

            ``interp_algo``
               Sets the algorithm used for scaling:

               ``nearest``
                  Nearest neighbour

                  Used by default if input parameters match the desired
                  output.

               ``bilinear``
                  Bilinear

               ``bicubic``
                  Bicubic

                  This is the default.

               ``lanczos``
                  Lanczos

            ``format``
               Controls the output pixel format. By default, or if none
               is specified, the input pixel format is used.

               The filter does not support converting between YUV and
               RGB pixel formats.

            ``passthrough``
               If set to 0, every frame is processed, even if no
               conversion is neccesary. This mode can be useful to use
               the filter as a buffer for a downstream frame-consumer
               that exhausts the limited decoder frame pool.

               If set to 1, frames are passed through as-is if they
               match the desired output parameters. This is the default
               behaviour.

            ``param``
               Algorithm-Specific parameter.

               Affects the curves of the bicubic algorithm.

            ``force_original_aspect_ratio``
            ``force_divisible_by``
               Work the same as the identical `scale <#scale>`__ filter
               options.

                  frames into newly allocated ones. This can be useful
                  to deal with a filter and encode chain that otherwise
                  exhausts the decoders frame pool.

            Use the NVIDIA Performance Primitives (libnpp) to perform
            scaling and/or pixel format conversion on CUDA video frames.
            Setting the output width and height works in the same way as
            for the ``scale`` filter.

            The following additional options are accepted:

            ``format``
            The pixel format of the output CUDA frames. If set to the
            string "same" (the default), the input format will be kept.
            Note that automatic format negotiation and conversion is not
            yet supported for hardware frames

            ``interp_algo``
            The interpolation algorithm used for resizing. One of the
            following:

            ``nn``
            Nearest neighbour.

            ``linear``
            ``cubic``
            ``cubic2p_bspline``
            2-parameter cubic (B=1, C=0)

            ``cubic2p_catmullrom``
            2-parameter cubic (B=0, C=1/2)

            ``cubic2p_b05c03``
            2-parameter cubic (B=1/2, C=3/10)

            ``super``
            Supersampling

            ``lanczos``
            ``force_original_aspect_ratio``
            Enable decreasing or increasing output video width or height
            if necessary to keep the original aspect ratio. Possible
            values:

            ‘\ ``disable``\ ’
               Scale the video as specified and disable this feature.

            ‘\ ``decrease``\ ’
               The output video dimensions will automatically be
               decreased if needed.

            ‘\ ``increase``\ ’
               The output video dimensions will automatically be
               increased if needed.

            One useful instance of this option is that when you know a
            specific device’s maximum allowed resolution, you can use
            this to limit the output video to that, while retaining the
            aspect ratio. For example, device A allows 1280x720
            playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set
            it to decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line
            makes the output 1280x533.

            Please note that this is a different thing than specifying
            -1 for ``w`` or ``h``, you still need to specify the output
            resolution for this option to work.

            ``force_divisible_by``
            Ensures that both the output dimensions, width and height,
            are divisible by the given integer when used together with
            ``force_original_aspect_ratio``. This works similar to using
            ``-n`` in the ``w`` and ``h`` options.

            This option respects the value set for
            ``force_original_aspect_ratio``, increasing or decreasing
            the resolution accordingly. The video’s aspect ratio may be
            slightly modified.

            This option can be handy if you need to have a video fit
            within or exceed a defined resolution using
            ``force_original_aspect_ratio`` but also have encoder
            restrictions on width or height divisibility.

            ``eval``
            Specify when to evaluate ``width`` and ``height``
            expression. It accepts the following values:

            ‘\ ``init``\ ’
               Only evaluate expressions once during the filter
               initialization or when a command is processed.

            ‘\ ``frame``\ ’
               Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame.

            The values of the ``w`` and ``h`` options are expressions
            containing the following constants:

            ``in_w``
            ``in_h``
               The input width and height

            ``iw``
            ``ih``
               These are the same as ``in_w`` and ``in_h``.

            ``out_w``
            ``out_h``
               The output (scaled) width and height

            ``ow``
            ``oh``
               These are the same as ``out_w`` and ``out_h``

            ``a``
               The same as ``iw`` / ``ih``

            ``sar``
               input sample aspect ratio

            ``dar``
               The input display aspect ratio. Calculated from
               ``(iw / ih) * sar``.

            ``n``
               The (sequential) number of the input frame, starting from
               0. Only available with ``eval=frame``.

            ``t``
               The presentation timestamp of the input frame, expressed
               as a number of seconds. Only available with
               ``eval=frame``.

            ``pos``
               The position (byte offset) of the frame in the input
               stream, or NaN if this information is unavailable and/or
               meaningless (for example in case of synthetic video).
               Only available with ``eval=frame``. Deprecated, do not

            The ``setdar`` filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the
            filter output video.

            This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka Pixel)
            Aspect Ratio, according to the following equation:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  DAR = HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION / VERTICAL_RESOLUTION * SAR

            Keep in mind that the ``setdar`` filter does not modify the
            pixel dimensions of the video frame. Also, the display
            aspect ratio set by this filter may be changed by later
            filters in the filterchain, e.g. in case of scaling or if
            another "setdar" or a "setsar" filter is applied.

            The ``setsar`` filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect
            Ratio for the filter output video.

            Note that as a consequence of the application of this
            filter, the output display aspect ratio will change
            according to the equation above.

            Keep in mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the
            ``setsar`` filter may be changed by later filters in the
            filterchain, e.g. if another "setsar" or a "setdar" filter
            is applied.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``r, ratio, dar (``\ ``setdar``\ ``only), sar (``\ ``setsar``\ ``only)``
               Set the aspect ratio used by the filter.

               The parameter can be a floating point number string, or
               an expression. If the parameter is not specified, the
               value "0" is assumed, meaning that the same input value
               is used.

            ``max``
               Set the maximum integer value to use for expressing
               numerator and denominator when reducing the expressed
               aspect ratio to a rational. Default value is ``100``.

            The parameter ``sar`` is an expression containing the
            following constants:

            ``w, h``
               The input width and height.

            ``a``
               Same as ``w`` / ``h``.

            ``sar``
               The input sample aspect ratio.

            ``dar``
               The input display aspect ratio. It is the same as (``w``
               / ``h``) \* ``sar``.

            ``hsub, vsub``
               Horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For
               example, for the pixel format "yuv422p" ``hsub`` is 2 and
               ``vsub`` is 1.

            the output frames. It does not change the input frame, but
            only sets the corresponding property, which affects how the
            frame is treated by following filters (e.g. ``fieldorder``
            or ``yadif``).

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``mode``
               Available values are:

               ‘\ ``auto``\ ’

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``stat``
            ``out``
               ``stat`` specify an additional form of image analysis.
               ``out`` output video with the specified type of pixel
               highlighted.

               Both options accept the following values:

               ‘\ ``tout``\ ’
                  Identify ``temporal outliers`` pixels. A
                  ``temporal outlier`` is a pixel unlike the neighboring
                  pixels of the same field. Examples of temporal
                  outliers include the results of video dropouts, head
                  clogs, or tape tracking issues.

               ‘\ ``vrep``\ ’
                  Identify ``vertical line repetition``. Vertical line
                  repetition includes similar rows of pixels within a
                  frame. In born-digital video vertical line repetition
                  is common, but this pattern is uncommon in video
                  digitized from an analog source. When it occurs in
                  video that results from the digitization of an analog
                  source it can indicate concealment from a dropout
                  compensator.

               ‘\ ``brng``\ ’
                  Identify pixels that fall outside of legal broadcast
                  range.

            ``color, c``
               Set the highlight color for the ``out`` option. The
               default color is yellow.

            Calculates the MPEG-7 Video Signature. The filter can handle
            more than one input. In this case the matching between the
            inputs can be calculated additionally. The filter always
            passes through the first input. The signature of each stream
            can be written into a file.

            It accepts the following options:

            ``detectmode``
               Enable or disable the matching process.

               Available values are:

               ‘\ ``off``\ ’
                  Disable the calculation of a matching (default).

               ‘\ ``full``\ ’
                  Calculate the matching for the whole video and output
                  whether the whole video matches or only parts.

               ‘\ ``fast``\ ’
                  Calculate only until a matching is found or the video
                  ends. Should be faster in some cases.

            ``nb_inputs``
               Set the number of inputs. The option value must be a non
               negative integer. Default value is 1.

            ``filename``
               Set the path to which the output is written. If there is
               more than one input, the path must be a prototype, i.e.
               must contain %d or %0nd (where n is a positive integer),
               that will be replaced with the input number. If no
               filename is specified, no output will be written. This is
               the default.

            ``format``
               Choose the output format.

               Available values are:

               ‘\ ``binary``\ ’
                  Use the specified binary representation (default).

               ‘\ ``xml``\ ’
                  Use the specified xml representation.

            ``th_d``
               Set threshold to detect one word as similar. The option
               value must be an integer greater than zero. The default
               value is 9000.

            ``th_dc``
               Set threshold to detect all words as similar. The option
               value must be an integer greater than zero. The default
               value is 60000.

            ``th_xh``
               Set threshold to detect frames as similar. The option
               value must be an integer greater than zero. The default
               value is 116.

            ``th_di``
               Set the minimum length of a sequence in frames to
               recognize it as matching sequence. The option value must
               be a non negative integer value. The default value is 0.

            ``th_it``
               Set the minimum relation, that matching frames to all
               frames must have. The option value must be a double value
               between 0 and 1. The default value is 0.5.

               number in the range [-1.0,1.0] that configures the
               blurring. A value included in [0.0,1.0] will blur the
               image whereas a value included in [-1.0,0.0] will sharpen
               the image. Default value is 1.0.

            ``luma_threshold, lt``
               Set the luma threshold used as a coefficient to determine
               whether a pixel should be blurred or not. The option
               value must be an integer in the range [-30,30]. A value
               of 0 will filter all the image, a value included in

            Apply a simple postprocessing filter that compresses and
            decompresses the image at several (or - in the case of
            ``quality`` level ``6`` - all) shifts and average the
            results.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``quality``
               Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for
               averaging. It accepts an integer in the range 0-6. If set
               to ``0``, the filter will have no effect. A value of
               ``6`` means the higher quality. For each increment of
               that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately
               2. Default value is ``3``.

            ``qp``
               Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the
               filter will use the QP from the video stream (if
               available).

            ``mode``
               Set thresholding mode. Available modes are:

               ‘\ ``hard``\ ’
                  Set hard thresholding (default).

               ‘\ ``soft``\ ’
                  Set soft thresholding (better de-ringing effect, but
                  likely blurrier).

            ``use_bframe_qp``
               Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to
               ``1``. Using this option may cause flicker since the
               B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is ``0`` (not
               enabled).

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``dnn_backend``
               Specify which DNN backend to use for model loading and
               execution. This option accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``tensorflow``\ ’
                  TensorFlow backend. To enable this backend you need to
                  install the TensorFlow for C library (see
                  https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c) and
                  configure FFmpeg with ``--enable-libtensorflow``

            ``model``
               Set path to model file specifying network architecture
               and its parameters. Note that different backends use
               different file formats. TensorFlow, OpenVINO backend can
               load files for only its format.

            ``scale_factor``
               Set scale factor for SRCNN model. Allowed values are
               ``2``, ``3`` and ``4``. Default value is ``2``. Scale
               factor is necessary for SRCNN model, because it accepts
               input upscaled using bicubic upscaling with proper scale
               factor.

            Obtain the SSIM (Structural SImilarity Metric) between two
            input videos.

            This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input
            is considered the "main" source and is passed unchanged to
            the output. The second input is used as a "reference" video
            for computing the SSIM.

            Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel
            format for this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes
            that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are
            compared one by one.

            The filter stores the calculated SSIM of each frame.

            The description of the accepted parameters follows.

            ``stats_file, f``
               If specified the filter will use the named file to save
               the SSIM of each individual frame. When filename equals
               "-" the data is sent to standard output.

            The file printed if ``stats_file`` is selected, contains a
            sequence of key/value pairs of the form ``key``:``value``
            for each compared couple of frames.

            A description of each shown parameter follows:

            ``n``
               sequential number of the input frame, starting from 1

            ``Y, U, V, R, G, B``
               SSIM of the compared frames for the component specified
               by the suffix.

            ``All``
               SSIM of the compared frames for the whole frame.

            ``dB``
               Same as above but in dB representation.

            This filter also supports the `framesync <#framesync>`__
            options.

                        [main][ref] ssim="stats_file=stats.log" [out]

                  On this example the input file being processed is
                  compared with the reference file ``ref_movie.mpg``.
                  The SSIM of each individual frame is stored in
                  ``stats.log``.

            Draw subtitles on top of input video using the libass
            library.

            To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure
            FFmpeg with ``--enable-libass``. This filter also requires a
            build with libavcodec and libavformat to convert the passed
            subtitles file to ASS (Advanced Substation Alpha) subtitles
            format.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``filename, f``
               Set the filename of the subtitle file to read. It must be
               specified.

            ``original_size``
               Specify the size of the original video, the video for
               which the ASS file was composed. For the syntax of this
               option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in
               the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax>`__. Due to a
               misdesign in ASS aspect ratio arithmetic, this is
               necessary to correctly scale the fonts if the aspect
               ratio has been changed.

            ``fontsdir``
               Set a directory path containing fonts that can be used by
               the filter. These fonts will be used in addition to
               whatever the font provider uses.

            ``alpha``
               Process alpha channel, by default alpha channel is
               untouched.

            ``charenc``
               Set subtitles input character encoding. ``subtitles``
               filter only. Only useful if not UTF-8.

            ``stream_index, si``
               Set subtitles stream index. ``subtitles`` filter only.

            ``force_style``
               Override default style or script info parameters of the
               subtitles. It accepts a string containing ASS style
               format ``KEY=VALUE`` couples separated by ",".

            ``wrap_unicode``
               Break lines according to the Unicode Line Breaking
               Algorithm. Availability requires at least libass release
               0.17.0 (or LIBASS_VERSION 0x01600010), *and* libass must
               have been built with libunibreak.

               The option is enabled by default except for native ASS.

            If the first key is not specified, it is assumed that the
            first value specifies the ``filename``.

            For example, to render the file ``sub.srt`` on top of the
            input video, use the command:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  subtitles=sub.srt

            which is equivalent to:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  subtitles=filename=sub.srt

            To render the default subtitles stream from file
            ``video.mkv``, use:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  subtitles=video.mkv

            To render the second subtitles stream from that file, use:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  subtitles=video.mkv:si=1

            To make the subtitles stream from ``sub.srt`` appear in 80%
            transparent blue ``DejaVu Serif``, use:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  subtitles=sub.srt:force_style='Fontname=DejaVu Serif,PrimaryColour=&HCCFF0000'

            Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the
            input video across time.

            Unlike `histogram <#histogram>`__ video filter which only
            shows histogram of single input frame at certain time, this
            filter shows also past histograms of number of frames
            defined by ``width`` option.

            The computed histogram is a representation of the color
            component distribution in an image.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``width, w``
               Set width of single color component output. Default value
               is ``0``. Value of ``0`` means width will be picked from
               input video. This also set number of passed histograms to
               keep. Allowed range is [0, 8192].

            ``display_mode, d``
               Set display mode. It accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``stack``\ ’
                  Per color component graphs are placed below each
                  other.

               ‘\ ``parade``\ ’
                  Per color component graphs are placed side by side.

               ‘\ ``overlay``\ ’
                  Presents information identical to that in the
                  ``parade``, except that the graphs representing color
                  components are superimposed directly over one another.

               Default is ``stack``.

            ``levels_mode, m``
               Set mode. Can be either ``linear``, or ``logarithmic``.
               Default is ``linear``.

            ``components, c``
               Set what color components to display. Default is ``7``.

            ``bgopacity, b``
               Set background opacity. Default is ``0.9``.

            ``envelope, e``
               Show envelope. Default is disabled.

            ``ecolor, ec``

               Available values for slide is:

               ‘\ ``frame``\ ’
                  Draw new frame when right border is reached.

               :class: section

            Apply threshold effect to video stream.

            This filter needs four video streams to perform
            thresholding. First stream is stream we are filtering.
            Second stream is holding threshold values, third stream is
            holding min values, and last, fourth stream is holding max
            values.

            The filter accepts the following option:

            ``planes``
               Set which planes will be processed, unprocessed planes
               will be copied. By default value 0xf, all planes will be
               processed.

            For example if first stream pixel’s component value is less
            then threshold value of pixel component from 2nd threshold
            stream, third stream value will picked, otherwise fourth
            stream pixel component value will be picked.

            Select the most representative frame in a given sequence of
            consecutive frames.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``n``
               Set the frames batch size to analyze; in a set of ``n``
               frames, the filter will pick one of them, and then handle
               the next batch of ``n`` frames until the end. Default is
               ``100``.

            ``log``
               Set the log level to display picked frame stats. Default
               is ``info``.

            Since the filter keeps track of the whole frames sequence, a
            bigger ``n`` value will result in a higher memory usage, so
            a high value is not recommended.

            Tile several successive frames together.

            The `untile <#untile>`__ filter can do the reverse.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``layout``
               Set the grid size in the form ``COLUMNSxROWS``. Range is
               upto UINT_MAX cells. Default is ``6x5``.

            ``nb_frames``
               Set the maximum number of frames to render in the given
               area. It must be less than or equal to ``w``\ x\ ``h``.
               The default value is ``0``, meaning all the area will be
               used.

            ``margin``
               Set the outer border margin in pixels. Range is 0 to
               1024. Default is ``0``.

            ``padding``
               Set the inner border thickness (i.e. the number of pixels
               between frames). For more advanced padding options (such
               as having different values for the edges), refer to the
               pad video filter. Range is 0 to 1024. Default is ``0``.

            ``color``
               Specify the color of the unused area. For the syntax of
               this option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in
               the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__. The default
               value of ``color`` is "black".

            ``overlap``
               Set the number of frames to overlap when tiling several
               successive frames together. The value must be between
               ``0`` and ``nb_frames - 1``. Default is ``0``.

            ``init_padding``
               Set the number of frames to initially be empty before
               displaying first output frame. This controls how soon
               will one get first output frame. The value must be
               between ``0`` and ``nb_frames - 1``. Default is ``0``.

               -  Produce 8x8 PNG tiles of all keyframes

            Frames are counted starting from 1, so the first input frame
            is considered odd.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``mode``
               Specify the mode of the interlacing. This option can also
               be specified as a value alone. See below for a list of
               values for this option.

               Available values are:

               ‘\ ``merge, 0``\ ’
                  Move odd frames into the upper field, even into the
                  lower field, generating a double height frame at half
                  frame rate.

                  Double frame rate with unchanged height. Frames are
                  inserted each containing the second temporal field
                  from the previous input frame and the first temporal
                  field from the next input frame. This mode relies on
                  the top_field_first flag. Useful for interlaced video
                  displays with no field synchronisation.

               Numeric values are deprecated but are accepted for
               backward compatibility reasons.

               Default mode is ``merge``.

            ``flags``
               Specify flags influencing the filter process.

               Available value for ``flags`` is:

               ``low_pass_filter, vlpf``
                  Enable linear vertical low-pass filtering in the
                  filter. Vertical low-pass filtering is required when
                  creating an interlaced destination from a progressive
                  source which contains high-frequency vertical detail.
                  Filtering will reduce interlace ’twitter’ and Moire
                  patterning.

               ``complex_filter, cvlpf``
                  Enable complex vertical low-pass filtering. This will
                  slightly less reduce interlace ’twitter’ and Moire
                  patterning but better retain detail and subjective
                  sharpness impression.

               ``bypass_il``
                  Bypass already interlaced frames, only adjust the
                  frame rate.

               Vertical low-pass filtering and bypassing already
               interlaced frames can only be enabled for ``mode``
               ``interleave_top`` and ``interleave_bottom``.

            frames.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``radius``
               Set radius of median filter. Default is 1. Allowed range
               is from 1 to 127.

            ``planes``
               Set which planes to filter. Default value is ``15``, by
               which all planes are processed.

            ``percentile``
               Set median percentile. Default value is ``0.5``. Default
               value of ``0.5`` will pick always median values, while
               ``0`` will pick minimum values, and ``1`` maximum values.

            Apply Temporal Midway Video Equalization effect.

            Midway Video Equalization adjusts a sequence of video frames
            to have the same histograms, while maintaining their
            dynamics as much as possible. It’s useful for e.g. matching
            exposures from a video frames sequence.

            This filter accepts the following option:

            ``radius``
               Set filtering radius. Default is ``5``. Allowed range is
               from 1 to 127.

            ``sigma``
               Set filtering sigma. Default is ``0.5``. This controls
               strength of filtering. Setting this option to 0
               effectively does nothing.

            ``planes``
               Set which planes to process. Default is ``15``, which is
               all available planes.

            Mix successive video frames.

            A description of the accepted options follows.

            ``frames``
               The number of successive frames to mix. If unspecified,
               it defaults to 3.

            ``weights``
               Specify weight of each input video frame. Each weight is
               separated by space. If number of weights is smaller than
               number of ``frames`` last specified weight will be used
               for all remaining unset weights.

            ``scale``
               Specify scale, if it is set it will be multiplied with
               sum of each weight multiplied with pixel values to give
               final destination pixel value. By default ``scale`` is
               auto scaled to sum of weights.

            ``planes``
               Set which planes to filter. Default is all. Allowed range
               is from 0 to 15.

            Tone map colors from different dynamic ranges.

            This filter expects data in single precision floating point,
            as it needs to operate on (and can output) out-of-range
            values. Another filter, such as `zscale <#zscale>`__, is
            needed to convert the resulting frame to a usable format.

            The tonemapping algorithms implemented only work on linear
            light, so input data should be linearized beforehand (and
            possibly correctly tagged).

               The filter accepts the following options.

               ``tonemap``
                  Set the tone map algorithm to use.

                  Possible values are:

                  ``none``
                     Do not apply any tone map, only desaturate
                     overbright pixels.

                  ``clip``
                     Hard-clip any out-of-range values. Use it for
                     perfect color accuracy for in-range values, while
                     distorting out-of-range values.

                  ``linear``
                     Stretch the entire reference gamut to a linear
                     multiple of the display.

                  ``gamma``
                     Fit a logarithmic transfer between the tone curves.

                  ``reinhard``
                     Preserve overall image brightness with a simple
                     curve, using nonlinear contrast, which results in
                     flattening details and degrading color accuracy.

                  ``hable``
                     Preserve both dark and bright details better than
                     ``reinhard``, at the cost of slightly darkening
                     everything. Use it when detail preservation is more
                     important than color and brightness accuracy.

                  ``mobius``
                     Smoothly map out-of-range values, while retaining
                     contrast and colors for in-range material as much
                     as possible. Use it when color accuracy is more
                     important than detail preservation.

                  Default is none.

               ``param``
                  Tune the tone mapping algorithm.

                  This affects the following algorithms:

                  ``none``
                     Ignored.

                  ``linear``
                     Specifies the scale factor to use while stretching.
                     Default to 1.0.

                  ``gamma``
                     Specifies the exponent of the function. Default to
                     1.8.

                  ``clip``
                     Specify an extra linear coefficient to multiply
                     into the signal before clipping. Default to 1.0.

                  ``reinhard``
                     Specify the local contrast coefficient at the
                     display peak. Default to 0.5, which means that
                     in-gamut values will be about half as bright as
                     when clipping.

                  ``hable``
                     Ignored.

                  ``mobius``
                     Specify the transition point from linear to mobius
                     transform. Every value below this point is
                     guaranteed to be mapped 1:1. The higher the value,
                     the more accurate the result will be, at the cost
                     of losing bright details. Default to 0.3, which due
                     to the steep initial slope still preserves in-range
                     colors fairly accurately.

               ``desat``
                  Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this
                  level of brightness. The higher the parameter, the
                  more color information will be preserved. This setting
                  helps prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for
                  super-highlights, by (smoothly) turning into white
                  instead. This makes images feel more natural, at the
                  cost of reducing information about out-of-range
                  colors.

                  The default of 2.0 is somewhat conservative and will
                  mostly just apply to skies or directly sunlit
                  surfaces. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.

                  This option works only if the input frame has a
                  supported color tag.

               ``peak``
                  Override signal/nominal/reference peak with this
                  value. Useful when the embedded peak information in
                  display metadata is not reliable or when tone mapping
                  from a lower range to a higher range.

               :class: section

            Temporarily pad video frames.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``start``
               Specify number of delay frames before input video stream.
               Default is 0.

            ``stop``

            ``start_mode``
               Set kind of frames added to beginning of stream. Can be
               either ``add`` or ``clone``. With ``add`` frames of
               solid-color are added. With ``clone`` frames are clones
               of first frame. Default is ``add``.

            ``stop_mode``
               Set kind of frames added to end of stream. Can be either
               ``add`` or ``clone``. With ``add`` frames of solid-color
               are added. With ``clone`` frames are clones of last
               frame. Default is ``add``.

            ``start_duration, stop_duration``
               Specify the duration of the start/stop delay. See

               the accepted syntax. These options override ``start`` and
               ``stop``. Default is 0.

            ``color``
               Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of
               this option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in

               For values between 4-7, the transposition is only done if
               the input video geometry is portrait and not landscape.
               These values are deprecated, the ``passthrough`` option
               should be used instead.

               Numerical values are deprecated, and should be dropped in
               favor of symbolic constants.

            ``passthrough``
               Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry
               matches the one specified by the specified value. It
               accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``none``\ ’
                  Always apply transposition.

               ‘\ ``portrait``\ ’
                  Preserve portrait geometry (when ``height`` >=
                  ``width``).

               ‘\ ``landscape``\ ’
                  Preserve landscape geometry (when ``width`` >=
                  ``height``).

               Default value is ``none``.

            For example to rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and preserve
            portrait layout:

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  transpose=dir=1:passthrough=portrait

            The command above can also be specified as:

            .. container:: example

               :class: section

            Transpose rows with columns in the input video and
            optionally flip it. For more in depth examples see the
            `transpose <#transpose>`__ video filter, which shares mostly
            the same options.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``dir``
               Specify the transposition direction.

               Can assume the following values:

               ‘\ ``cclock_flip``\ ’
                  Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and vertically
                  flip. (default)

               ‘\ ``clock``\ ’
                  Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.

               ‘\ ``cclock``\ ’

               ‘\ ``clock_flip``\ ’
                  Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip.

            ``passthrough``
               Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry
               matches the one specified by the specified value. It
               accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``none``\ ’
                  Always apply transposition. (default)

               ‘\ ``portrait``\ ’
                  Preserve portrait geometry (when ``height`` >=
                  ``width``).

               ‘\ ``landscape``\ ’
                  Preserve landscape geometry (when ``width`` >=
                  ``height``).

         .. container:: section-level-extent
            :name: trim

            .. rubric:: 30.264 trim
               :class: section

            Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous
            subpart of the input.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``start``
               Specify the time of the start of the kept section, i.e.
               the frame with the timestamp ``start`` will be the first
               frame in the output.

            ``end``
               Specify the time of the first frame that will be dropped,
               i.e. the frame immediately preceding the one with the
               timestamp ``end`` will be the last frame in the output.

            ``start_pts``
               This is the same as ``start``, except this option sets
               the start timestamp in timebase units instead of seconds.

            ``end_pts``
               This is the same as ``end``, except this option sets the
               end timestamp in timebase units instead of seconds.

            ``duration``
               The maximum duration of the output in seconds.

            ``start_frame``
               The number of the first frame that should be passed to
               the output.

            ``end_frame``
               The number of the first frame that should be dropped.

            ``start``, ``end``, and ``duration`` are expressed as time
            duration specifications; see `(ffmpeg-utils)the Time
            duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1)
            manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax>`__ for the
            accepted syntax.

            Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and
            the ``duration`` option look at the frame timestamp, while
            the \_frame variants simply count the frames that pass
            through the filter. Also note that this filter does not
            modify the timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps
            to start at zero, insert a setpts filter after the trim
            filter.

            If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries
            to be greedy and keep all the frames that match at least one
            of the specified constraints. To keep only the part that
            matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple trim
            filters.

            The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is
            possible to set e.g. just the end values to keep everything
            before the specified time.

            Examples:

            -  Drop everything except the second minute of input:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=60:120

            -  Keep only the first second:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=duration=1

         .. container:: section-level-extent

            .. rubric:: 30.265 unpremultiply
               :class: section

            Apply alpha unpremultiply effect to input video stream using
            first plane of second stream as alpha.

            Both streams must have same dimensions and same pixel
            format.

            The filter accepts the following option:

            ``planes``
               Set which planes will be processed, unprocessed planes
               will be copied. By default value 0xf, all planes will be
               processed.

               If the format has 1 or 2 components, then luma is bit 0.
               If the format has 3 or 4 components: for RGB formats bit
               0 is green, bit 1 is blue and bit 2 is red; for YUV
               formats bit 0 is luma, bit 1 is chroma-U and bit 2 is
               chroma-V. If present, the alpha channel is always the
               last bit.

            ``inplace``
               Do not require 2nd input for processing, instead use
               alpha plane from input stream.

            Sharpen or blur the input video.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``luma_msize_x, lx``
               Set the luma matrix horizontal size. It must be an odd
               integer between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.

            ``luma_msize_y, ly``
               Set the luma matrix vertical size. It must be an odd
               integer between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.

            ``luma_amount, la``
               Set the luma effect strength. It must be a floating point
               number, reasonable values lay between -1.5 and 1.5.

               Negative values will blur the input video, while positive
               values will sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the
               effect.

               Default value is 1.0.

            ``chroma_msize_x, cx``
               Set the chroma matrix horizontal size. It must be an odd
               integer between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.

            ``chroma_msize_y, cy``
               Set the chroma matrix vertical size. It must be an odd
               integer between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.

            ``chroma_amount, ca``
               Set the chroma effect strength. It must be a floating
               point number, reasonable values lay between -1.5 and 1.5.

               Negative values will blur the input video, while positive
               values will sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the
               effect.

               Default value is 0.0.

            ``alpha_msize_x, ax``
               Set the alpha matrix horizontal size. It must be an odd
               integer between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.

            ``alpha_msize_y, ay``
               Set the alpha matrix vertical size. It must be an odd
               integer between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.

            ``alpha_amount, aa``
               Set the alpha effect strength. It must be a floating
               point number, reasonable values lay between -1.5 and 1.5.

               Negative values will blur the input video, while positive
               values will sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the
               effect.

               Default value is 0.0.

            All parameters are optional and default to the equivalent of
            the string ’5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0’.

            Decompose a video made of tiled images into the individual
            images.

            The frame rate of the output video is the frame rate of the

               Set the grid size (i.e. the number of lines and columns).

            Apply ultra slow/simple postprocessing filter that
            compresses and decompresses the image at several (or - in
            the case of ``quality`` level ``8`` - all) shifts and
            average the results.

            The way this differs from the behavior of spp is that uspp
            actually encodes & decodes each case with libavcodec Snow,
            whereas spp uses a simplified intra only 8x8 DCT similar to
            MJPEG.

            This filter is only available in ffmpeg version 4.4 or
            earlier.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``quality``
               Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for
               averaging. It accepts an integer in the range 0-8. If set
               to ``0``, the filter will have no effect. A value of
               ``8`` means the higher quality. For each increment of
               that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately
               2. Default value is ``3``.

            ``qp``
               Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the
               filter will use the QP from the video stream (if
               available).

            ``codec``
               Use specified codec instead of snow.

            ``output``
               Set format of the input/output video.

               Available formats:

                     ‘\ ``0.01``\ ’
                        1% of face is padding. For example, with
                        1920x1280 resolution face size would be 640x640
                        and padding would be 3 pixels from each side.
                        (640 \* 0.01 = 6 pixels)

                     Default value is **‘\ ``0``\ ’**. Maximum value is

                     Values in pixels.

                     Default value is **‘\ ``0``\ ’**. If greater than
                     zero it overrides other padding options.

               :class: section

            Apply a wavelet based denoiser.

            It transforms each frame from the video input into the
            wavelet domain, using Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau 9/7. Then it
            applies some filtering to the obtained coefficients. It does
            an inverse wavelet transform after. Due to wavelet
            properties, it should give a nice smoothed result, and
            reduced noise, without blurring picture features.

            This filter accepts the following options:

            ``threshold``
               The filtering strength. The higher, the more filtered the
               video will be. Hard thresholding can use a higher
               threshold than soft thresholding before the video looks
               overfiltered. Default value is 2.

            ``method``
               The filtering method the filter will use.

               It accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``hard``\ ’
                  All values under the threshold will be zeroed.

               ‘\ ``soft``\ ’
                  All values under the threshold will be zeroed. All
                  values above will be reduced by the threshold.

               ‘\ ``garrote``\ ’
                  Scales or nullifies coefficients - intermediary
                  between (more) soft and (less) hard thresholding.

               Default is garrote.

            ``nsteps``
               Number of times, the wavelet will decompose the picture.
               Picture can’t be decomposed beyond a particular point
               (typically, 8 for a 640x480 frame - as 2^9 = 512 > 480).
               Valid values are integers between 1 and 32. Default value
               is 6.

            ``percent``
               Partial of full denoising (limited coefficients
               shrinking), from 0 to 100. Default value is 85.

            ``planes``
               A list of the planes to process. By default all planes
               are processed.

            ``type``
               The threshold type the filter will use.

               It accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``universal``\ ’
                  Threshold used is same for all decompositions.

               ‘\ ``bayes``\ ’
                  Threshold used depends also on each decomposition
                  coefficients.

               Default is universal.

            Display 2 color component values in the two dimensional
            graph (which is called a vectorscope).

            This filter accepts the following options:

            ``mode, m``
            Set vectorscope mode.

            It accepts the following values:

            ‘\ ``gray``\ ’
            ‘\ ``tint``\ ’
               Gray values are displayed on graph, higher brightness
               means more pixels have same component color value on
               location in graph. This is the default mode.

            ‘\ ``color``\ ’
               Gray values are displayed on graph. Surrounding pixels
               values which are not present in video frame are drawn in
               gradient of 2 color components which are set by option
               ``x`` and ``y``. The 3rd color component is static.

            ‘\ ``color2``\ ’
               Actual color components values present in video frame are
               displayed on graph.

            ‘\ ``color3``\ ’
               Similar as color2 but higher frequency of same values
               ``x`` and ``y`` on graph increases value of another color
               component, which is luminance by default values of ``x``
               and ``y``.

            ‘\ ``color4``\ ’
               Actual colors present in video frame are displayed on
               graph. If two different colors map to same position on
               graph then color with higher value of component not
               present in graph is picked.

            ‘\ ``color5``\ ’
               Gray values are displayed on graph. Similar to ``color``
               but with 3rd color component picked from radial gradient.

            ``x``
            Set which color component will be represented on X-axis.
            Default is ``1``.

            ``y``
            Set which color component will be represented on Y-axis.
            Default is ``2``.

            ``intensity, i``
            Set intensity, used by modes: gray, color, color3 and color5
            for increasing brightness of color component which
            represents frequency of (X, Y) location in graph.

            ``envelope, e``

            ‘\ ``none``\ ’
               No envelope, this is default.

            ‘\ ``instant``\ ’
               Instant envelope, even darkest single pixel will be
               clearly highlighted.

            ‘\ ``peak``\ ’
               Hold maximum and minimum values presented in graph over
               time. This way you can still spot out of range values
               without constantly looking at vectorscope.

            ‘\ ``peak+instant``\ ’
               Peak and instant envelope combined together.

            ``graticule, g``
            Set what kind of graticule to draw.

            ‘\ ``none``\ ’
            ‘\ ``green``\ ’

               Draw graticule for white point.

            ‘\ ``black``\ ’
               Draw graticule for black point.

               Draw color points short names.

            ``bgopacity, b``
            Set background opacity.

            ``lthreshold, l``
            Set low threshold for color component not represented on X
            or Y axis. Values lower than this value will be ignored.
            Default is 0. Note this value is multiplied with actual max
            possible value one pixel component can have. So for 8-bit
            input and low threshold value of 0.1 actual threshold is 0.1
            \* 255 = 25.

            ``hthreshold, h``
            Set high threshold for color component not represented on X
            or Y axis. Values higher than this value will be ignored.
            Default is 1. Note this value is multiplied with actual max
            possible value one pixel component can have. So for 8-bit
            input and high threshold value of 0.9 actual threshold is
            0.9 \* 255 = 230.

            ``colorspace, c``
            Set what kind of colorspace to use when drawing graticule.

            ‘\ ``auto``\ ’
            ‘\ ``601``\ ’
            ‘\ ``709``\ ’
            Default is auto.

            ``tint0, t0``
            ``tint1, t1``
            Set color tint for gray/tint vectorscope mode. By default
            both options are zero. This means no tint, and output will
            remain gray.

               It accepts an integer in the range 1-10, a value of 1
               means little shakiness, a value of 10 means strong
               shakiness. Default value is 5.

            ``accuracy``
               Set the accuracy of the detection process. It must be a
               value in the range 1-15. A value of 1 means low accuracy,
               a value of 15 means high accuracy. Default value is 15.

            ``stepsize``
               Set stepsize of the search process. The region around
               minimum is scanned with 1 pixel resolution. Default value
               is 6.

            ``mincontrast``
               Set minimum contrast. Below this value a local
               measurement field is discarded. Must be a floating point
               value in the range 0-1. Default value is 0.3.

            ``tripod``
               Set reference frame number for tripod mode.

               If enabled, the motion of the frames is compared to a
               reference frame in the filtered stream, identified by the
               specified number. The idea is to compensate all movements
               in a more-or-less static scene and keep the camera view
               absolutely still.

               If set to 0, it is disabled. The frames are counted
               starting from 1.

            ``show``
               Show fields and transforms in the resulting frames. It
               accepts an integer in the range 0-2. Default value is 0,
               which disables any visualization.

            ``fileformat``
               Format for the transforms data file to be written.
               Acceptable values are

               ‘\ ``ascii``\ ’
                  Human-readable plain text

               ‘\ ``binary``\ ’
                  Binary format, roughly 40% smaller than ``ascii``.

            Video stabilization/deshaking: pass 2 of 2, see
            `vidstabdetect <#vidstabdetect>`__ for pass 1.

            Read a file with transform information for each frame and
            apply/compensate them. Together with the
            `vidstabdetect <#vidstabdetect>`__ filter this can be used
            to deshake videos. See also
            http://public.hronopik.de/vid.stab. It is important to also
            use the `unsharp <#unsharp>`__ filter, see below.

            To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure
            FFmpeg with ``--enable-libvidstab``.

               ``input``
                  Set path to the file used to read the transforms.
                  Default value is ``transforms.trf``.

               ``smoothing``
                  Set the number of frames (value*2 + 1) used for
                  lowpass filtering the camera movements. Default value
                  is 10.

                  For example a number of 10 means that 21 frames are
                  used (10 in the past and 10 in the future) to smoothen
                  the motion in the video. A larger value leads to a
                  smoother video, but limits the acceleration of the
                  camera (pan/tilt movements). 0 is a special case where
                  a static camera is simulated.

               ``optalgo``
                  Set the camera path optimization algorithm.

                  Accepted values are:

                     averaging on transformations

               ``maxshift``
                  Set maximal number of pixels to translate frames.
                  Default value is -1, meaning no limit.

               ``maxangle``
                  Set maximal angle in radians (degree*PI/180) to rotate
                  frames. Default value is -1, meaning no limit.

               ``crop``
                  Specify how to deal with borders that may be visible
                  due to movement compensation.

                  ‘\ ``keep``\ ’
                     keep image information from previous frame
                     (default)

                  ‘\ ``black``\ ’
                     fill the border black

               ``invert``
                  Invert transforms if set to 1. Default value is 0.

               ``relative``
                  Consider transforms as relative to previous frame if
                  set to 1, absolute if set to 0. Default value is 0.

               ``zoom``
                  Set percentage to zoom. A positive value will result
                  in a zoom-in effect, a negative value in a zoom-out
                  effect. Default value is 0 (no zoom).

               ``optzoom``
                  Set optimal zooming to avoid borders.

                  Accepted values are:

                  ‘\ ``0``\ ’
                     disabled

                  ‘\ ``1``\ ’
                     optimal static zoom value is determined (only very
                     strong movements will lead to visible borders)
                     (default)

                  ‘\ ``2``\ ’
                     optimal adaptive zoom value is determined (no
                     borders will be visible), see ``zoomspeed``

                  Note that the value given at zoom is added to the one
                  calculated here.

               ``zoomspeed``
                  Set percent to zoom maximally each frame (enabled when
                  ``optzoom`` is set to 2). Range is from 0 to 5,
                  default value is 0.25.

               ``interpol``
                  Specify type of interpolation.

                  Available values are:

                  ‘\ ``bicubic``\ ’
                     cubic in both directions (slow)

               ``tripod``
                  Enable virtual tripod mode if set to 1, which is
                  equivalent to ``relative=0:smoothing=0``. Default
                  value is 0.

                  Use also ``tripod`` option of
                  `vidstabdetect <#vidstabdetect>`__.

               ``debug``
                  Increase log verbosity if set to 1. Also the detected
                  global motions are written to the temporary file
                  ``global_motions.trf``. Default value is 0.

                        ffmpeg -i inp.mpeg -vf vidstabtransform,unsharp=5:5:0.8:3:3:0.4 inp_stabilized.mpeg

                  Note the use of the `unsharp <#unsharp>`__ filter
                  which is always recommended.

               -  Zoom in a bit more and load transform data from a
                  given file:

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        vidstabtransform=zoom=5:input="mytransforms.trf"

               -  Smoothen the video even more:

            Flip the input video vertically.

            For example, to vertically flip a video with ``ffmpeg``:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "vflip" out.avi

            Detect variable frame rate video.

            This filter tries to detect if the input is variable or
            constant frame rate.

            At end it will output number of frames detected as having
            variable delta pts, and ones with constant delta pts. If
            there was frames with variable delta, than it will also show
            min, max and average delta encountered.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``intensity``
               Set strength of boost if positive value or strength of
               alter if negative value. Default is 0. Allowed range is
               from -2 to 2.

            ``rbal``
               Set the red balance. Default is 1. Allowed range is from
               -10 to 10.

            ``gbal``
               Set the green balance. Default is 1. Allowed range is
               from -10 to 10.

            ``bbal``
               Set the blue balance. Default is 1. Allowed range is from
               -10 to 10.

            ``rlum``
               Set the red luma coefficient.

            ``glum``
               Set the green luma coefficient.

            ``blum``
               Set the blue luma coefficient.

            ``alternate``
               If ``intensity`` is negative and this is set to 1, colors
               will change, otherwise colors will be less saturated,
               more towards gray.

            Obtain the average VIF (Visual Information Fidelity) between
            two input videos.

            This filter takes two input videos.

            Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel
            format for this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes
            that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are
            compared one by one.

            The obtained average VIF score is printed through the
            logging system.

            The filter stores the calculated VIF score of each frame.

            This filter also supports the `framesync <#framesync>`__
            options.

            In the below example the input file ``main.mpg`` being
            processed is compared with the reference file ``ref.mpg``.

            Make or reverse a natural vignetting effect.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``angle, a``
               Set lens angle expression as a number of radians.

               The value is clipped in the ``[0,PI/2]`` range.

               Default value: ``"PI/5"``

            ``x0``
            ``y0``
               Set center coordinates expressions. Respectively
               ``"w/2"`` and ``"h/2"`` by default.

            ``mode``
               Set forward/backward mode.

               Available modes are:

               ‘\ ``forward``\ ’
                  The larger the distance from the central point, the
                  darker the image becomes.

               ‘\ ``backward``\ ’
                  The larger the distance from the central point, the
                  brighter the image becomes. This can be used to
                  reverse a vignette effect, though there is no
                  automatic detection to extract the lens ``angle`` and
                  other settings (yet). It can also be used to create a
                  burning effect.

               Default value is ‘\ ``forward``\ ’.

            ``eval``
               Set evaluation mode for the expressions (``angle``,
               ``x0``, ``y0``).

               It accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``init``\ ’
                  Evaluate expressions only once during the filter
                  initialization.

               ‘\ ``frame``\ ’
                  Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame. This is
                  way slower than the ‘\ ``init``\ ’ mode since it
                  requires all the scalers to be re-computed, but it
                  allows advanced dynamic expressions.

               Default value is ‘\ ``init``\ ’.

            ``dither``
               Set dithering to reduce the circular banding effects.
               Default is ``1`` (enabled).

            ``aspect``
               Set vignette aspect. This setting allows one to adjust
               the shape of the vignette. Setting this value to the SAR
               of the input will make a rectangular vignetting following
               the dimensions of the video.

               Default is ``1/1``.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``stats_file``
               If specified, the filter will use the named file to save
               the motion score of each frame with respect to the
               previous frame. When filename equals "-" the data is sent
               to standard output.

               :class: section

            Deinterlace the input video ("w3fdif" stands for "Weston 3
            Field Deinterlacing Filter").

            Based on the process described by Martin Weston for BBC R&D,
            and implemented based on the de-interlace algorithm written
            by Jim Easterbrook for BBC R&D, the Weston 3 field
            deinterlacing filter uses filter coefficients calculated by
            BBC R&D.

            This filter uses field-dominance information in frame to
            decide which of each pair of fields to place first in the
            output. If it gets it wrong use `setfield <#setfield>`__
            filter before ``w3fdif`` filter.

            There are two sets of filter coefficients, so called
            "simple" and "complex". Which set of filter coefficients is
            used can be set by passing an optional parameter:

            ``filter``
               Set the interlacing filter coefficients. Accepts one of
               the following values:

               ‘\ ``simple``\ ’
                  Simple filter coefficient set.

               ‘\ ``complex``\ ’
                  More-complex filter coefficient set.

               Default value is ‘\ ``complex``\ ’.

            ``mode``
               The interlacing mode to adopt. It accepts one of the
               following values:

               ``frame``
                  Output one frame for each frame.

               ``field``
                  Output one frame for each field.

               The default value is ``field``.

            ``parity``
               The picture field parity assumed for the input interlaced
               video. It accepts one of the following values:

               ``tff``
                  Assume the top field is first.

               ``bff``
                  Assume the bottom field is first.

               ``auto``
                  Enable automatic detection of field parity.

               The default value is ``auto``. If the interlacing is
               unknown or the decoder does not export this information,
               top field first will be assumed.

            ``deint``
               Specify which frames to deinterlace. Accepts one of the
               following values:

               ‘\ ``all``\ ’
                  Deinterlace all frames,

               ‘\ ``interlaced``\ ’
                  Only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced.

               Default value is ‘\ ``all``\ ’.

            .. rubric:: 30.283 waveform
               :class: section

            Video waveform monitor.

            The waveform monitor plots color component intensity. By
            default luma only. Each column of the waveform corresponds
            to a column of pixels in the source video.

            It accepts the following options:

            ``mode, m``
            Can be either ``row``, or ``column``. Default is ``column``.
            In row mode, the graph on the left side represents color
            component value 0 and the right side represents value = 255.
            In column mode, the top side represents color component
            value = 0 and bottom side represents value = 255.

            ``intensity, i``
            Set intensity. Smaller values are useful to find out how
            many values of the same luminance are distributed across
            input rows/columns. Default value is ``0.04``. Allowed range
            is [0, 1].

            ``mirror, r``
            Set mirroring mode. ``0`` means unmirrored, ``1`` means
            mirrored. In mirrored mode, higher values will be
            represented on the left side for ``row`` mode and at the top
            for ``column`` mode. Default is ``1`` (mirrored).

            ``display, d``
            Set display mode. It accepts the following values:

            ‘\ ``overlay``\ ’
               Presents information identical to that in the ``parade``,
               except that the graphs representing color components are
               superimposed directly over one another.

               This display mode makes it easier to spot relative
               differences or similarities in overlapping areas of the
               color components that are supposed to be identical, such
               as neutral whites, grays, or blacks.

            ‘\ ``stack``\ ’
               Display separate graph for the color components side by
               side in ``row`` mode or one below the other in ``column``
               mode.

            ‘\ ``parade``\ ’
               Display separate graph for the color components side by
               side in ``column`` mode or one below the other in ``row``
               mode.

               Using this display mode makes it easy to spot color casts
               in the highlights and shadows of an image, by comparing
               the contours of the top and the bottom graphs of each
               waveform. Since whites, grays, and blacks are
               characterized by exactly equal amounts of red, green, and
               blue, neutral areas of the picture should display three
               waveforms of roughly equal width/height. If not, the
               correction is easy to perform by making level adjustments
               the three waveforms.

            Default is ``stack``.

            ``components, c``
            Set which color components to display. Default is 1, which
            means only luma or red color component if input is in RGB
            colorspace. If is set for example to 7 it will display all 3
            (if) available color components.

            ``envelope, e``

            ‘\ ``none``\ ’
               No envelope, this is default.

            ‘\ ``instant``\ ’
               Instant envelope, minimum and maximum values presented in
               graph will be easily visible even with small ``step``
               value.

            ‘\ ``peak``\ ’
               Hold minimum and maximum values presented in graph across
               time. This way you can still spot out of range values
               without constantly looking at waveforms.

            ‘\ ``peak+instant``\ ’
               Peak and instant envelope combined together.

            ``filter, f``

            ‘\ ``lowpass``\ ’
               No filtering, this is default.

            ‘\ ``flat``\ ’
               Luma and chroma combined together.

            ‘\ ``aflat``\ ’
               Similar as above, but shows difference between blue and
               red chroma.

            ‘\ ``xflat``\ ’
               Similar as above, but use different colors.

            ‘\ ``yflat``\ ’
               Similar as above, but again with different colors.

            ‘\ ``chroma``\ ’
               Displays only chroma.

            ‘\ ``color``\ ’
               Displays actual color value on waveform.

            ‘\ ``acolor``\ ’
               Similar as above, but with luma showing frequency of
               chroma values.

            ``graticule, g``
            Set which graticule to display.

            ‘\ ``none``\ ’
               Do not display graticule.

            ‘\ ``green``\ ’
               Display green graticule showing legal broadcast ranges.

            ‘\ ``invert``\ ’
               Display invert graticule showing legal broadcast ranges.

            ``opacity, o``
            Set graticule opacity.

            ``flags, fl``
            Set graticule flags.

            ‘\ ``numbers``\ ’
               Draw numbers above lines. By default enabled.

            ‘\ ``dots``\ ’
               Draw dots instead of lines.

            ``scale, s``
            Set scale used for displaying graticule.

            ‘\ ``digital``\ ’
            ‘\ ``millivolts``\ ’
            ‘\ ``ire``\ ’
            Default is digital.

            ``bgopacity, b``
            Set background opacity.

            ``tint0, t0``
            ``tint1, t1``
            Set tint for output. Only used with lowpass filter and when
            display is not overlay and input pixel formats are not RGB.

            ``fitmode, fm``
            Set sample aspect ratio of video output frames. Can be used
            to configure waveform so it is not streched too much in one
            of directions.

            ‘\ ``none``\ ’
               Set sample aspect ration to 1/1.

               :class: section

            Apply normalized cross-correlation between first and second
            input video stream.

            Second input video stream dimensions must be lower than
            first input video stream.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``planes``
               Set which planes to process.

            ``secondary``
               Set which secondary video frames will be processed from
               second input video stream, can be ``first`` or ``all``.
               Default is ``all``.

            The ``xcorrelate`` filter also supports the
            `framesync <#framesync>`__ options.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``inputs``
               Set number of inputs. Default is 3. Allowed range is from
               3 to 255. If number of inputs is even number, than result
               will be mean value between two median values.

               which all planes are processed.

            ``percentile``
               Set median percentile. Default value is ``0.5``. Default
               value of ``0.5`` will pick always median values, while

            Stack video inputs into custom layout.

            All streams must be of same pixel format.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``inputs``
               Set number of input streams. Default is 2.

            ``layout``
               Specify layout of inputs. This option requires the
               desired layout configuration to be explicitly set by the
               user. This sets position of each video input in output.
               Each input is separated by ’\|’. The first number
               represents the column, and the second number represents
               the row. Numbers start at 0 and are separated by ’\_’.
               Optionally one can use wX and hX, where X is video input
               from which to take width or height. Multiple values can
               be used when separated by ’+’. In such case values are
               summed together.

               Note that if inputs are of different sizes gaps may
               appear, as not all of the output video frame will be
               filled. Similarly, videos can overlap each other if their
               position doesn’t leave enough space for the full frame of
               adjoining videos.

               For 2 inputs, a default layout of ``0_0|w0_0``
               (equivalent to ``grid=2x1``) is set. In all other cases,
               a layout or a grid must be set by the user. Either
               ``grid`` or ``layout`` can be specified at a time.
               Specifying both will result in an error.

            ``grid``
               Specify a fixed size grid of inputs. This option is used
               to create a fixed size grid of the input streams. Set the
               grid size in the form ``COLUMNSxROWS``. There must be
               ``ROWS * COLUMNS`` input streams and they will be
               arranged as a grid with ``ROWS`` rows and ``COLUMNS``
               columns. When using this option, each input stream within
               a row must have the same height and all the rows must
               have the same width.

               If ``grid`` is set, then ``inputs`` option is ignored and
               is implicitly set to ``ROWS * COLUMNS``.

               For 2 inputs, a default grid of ``2x1`` (equivalent to
               ``layout=0_0|w0_0``) is set. In all other cases, a layout
               or a grid must be set by the user. Either ``grid`` or
               ``layout`` can be specified at a time. Specifying both
               will result in an error.

            ``shortest``
               If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the
               shortest input terminates. Default value is 0.

            ``fill``
               If set to valid color, all unused pixels will be filled
               with that color. By default fill is set to none, so it is
               disabled.

            ``parity``
               The picture field parity assumed for the input interlaced
               video. It accepts one of the following values:

               ``0, tff``

                  Enable automatic detection of field parity.

               The default value is ``auto``. If the interlacing is
               unknown or the decoder does not export this information,
               top field first will be assumed.

            Scale (resize) the input video, using the z.lib library:
            https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg. To enable compilation of
            this filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with
            ``--enable-libzimg``.

            The zscale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to
            be the same as the input, by changing the output sample
            aspect ratio.

            If the input image format is different from the format
            requested by the next filter, the zscale filter will convert
            the input to the requested format.

               The filter accepts the following options.

               ``width, w``
               ``height, h``
               Set the output video dimension expression. Default value
               is the input dimension.

               If the ``width`` or ``w`` value is 0, the input width is
               used for the output. If the ``height`` or ``h`` value is
               0, the input height is used for the output.

               If one and only one of the values is -n with n >= 1, the
               zscale filter will use a value that maintains the aspect
               ratio of the input image, calculated from the other
               specified dimension. After that it will, however, make
               sure that the calculated dimension is divisible by n and
               adjust the value if necessary.

               If both values are -n with n >= 1, the behavior will be
               identical to both values being set to 0 as previously
               detailed.

            :class: chapter

         Below is a description of the currently available OpenCL video
         filters.

         To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure
         FFmpeg with ``--enable-opencl``.

         Running OpenCL filters requires you to initialize a hardware
         device and to pass that device to all filters in any filter
         graph.

         ``-init_hw_device opencl[=``\ ``name``\ ``][:``\ ``device``\ ``[,``\ ``key=value``\ ``...]]``
            Initialise a new hardware device of type ``opencl`` called
            ``name``, using the given device parameters.

         ``-filter_hw_device``\ ``name``
            Pass the hardware device called ``name`` to all filters in
            any filter graph.

         For more detailed information see
         https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Advanced-Video-options

            and running avgblur_opencl filter with default parameters on

         Since OpenCL filters are not able to access frame data in
         normal memory, all frame data needs to be
         uploaded(`hwupload <#hwupload>`__) to hardware surfaces
         connected to the appropriate device before being used and then
         downloaded(`hwdownload <#hwdownload>`__) back to normal memory.
         Note that `hwupload <#hwupload>`__ will upload to a surface
         with the same layout as the software frame, so it may be
         necessary to add a `format <#format>`__ filter immediately
         before to get the input into the right format and
         `hwdownload <#hwdownload>`__ does not support all formats on
         the output - it may be necessary to insert an additional
         `format <#format>`__ filter immediately following in the graph
         to get the output in a supported format.

               Set an expression for the box radius in pixels used for
               blurring the corresponding input plane.

               The radius value must be a non-negative number, and must
               not be greater than the value of the expression
               ``min(w,h)/2`` for the luma and alpha planes, and of
               ``min(cw,ch)/2`` for the chroma planes.

               Default value for ``luma_radius`` is "2". If not
               specified, ``chroma_radius`` and ``alpha_radius`` default
               to the corresponding value set for ``luma_radius``.

               The expressions can contain the following constants:

               ``w``
               ``h``
                  The input width and height in pixels.

               ``cw``
               ``ch``
                  The input chroma image width and height in pixels.

               ``hsub``
               ``vsub``
                  The horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values.
                  For example, for the pixel format "yuv422p", ``hsub``
                  is 2 and ``vsub`` is 1.

            ``luma_power, lp``
            ``chroma_power, cp``
            ``alpha_power, ap``
               Specify how many times the boxblur filter is applied to
               the corresponding plane.

               Default value for ``luma_power`` is 2. If not specified,
               ``chroma_power`` and ``alpha_power`` default to the
               corresponding value set for ``luma_power``.

               A value of 0 will disable the effect.

               image, the radius does not extend beyond the image
               boundaries, and so out-of-range coordinates are not used

            Feature-point based video stabilization filter.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``tripod``
               Simulates a tripod by preventing any camera movement
               whatsoever from the original frame. Defaults to ``0``.

            ``debug``
               Whether or not additional debug info should be displayed,
               both in the processed output and in the console.

               Note that in order to see console debug output you will
               also need to pass ``-v verbose`` to ffmpeg.

               Viewing point matches in the output video is only
               supported for RGB input.

               Defaults to ``0``.

            ``adaptive_crop``
               Whether or not to do a tiny bit of cropping at the
               borders to cut down on the amount of mirrored pixels.

               Defaults to ``1``.

            ``refine_features``
               Whether or not feature points should be refined at a
               sub-pixel level.

               This can be turned off for a slight performance gain at
               the cost of precision.

               Defaults to ``1``.

            ``smooth_strength``
               The strength of the smoothing applied to the camera path
               from ``0.0`` to ``1.0``.

               ``1.0`` is the maximum smoothing strength while values
               less than that result in less smoothing.

               ``0.0`` causes the filter to adaptively choose a
               smoothing strength on a per-frame basis.

               Defaults to ``0.0``.

            ``smooth_window_multiplier``
               Controls the size of the smoothing window (the number of
               frames buffered to determine motion information from).

               The size of the smoothing window is determined by
               multiplying the framerate of the video by this number.

               Acceptable values range from ``0.1`` to ``10.0``.

               Larger values increase the amount of motion data
               available for determining how to smooth the camera path,
               potentially improving smoothness, but also increase
               latency and memory usage.

               Defaults to ``2.0``.

               The default value of ``x`` and ``y`` is 0.

               If ``x`` or ``y`` evaluate to a negative number, they’ll
               be changed so the input image is centered on the padded
               area.

            ``out_w``
            ``out_h``
               The output width and height (the size of the padded
               area), as specified by the ``width`` and ``height``
               expressions.

            Filter video using an OpenCL program.

            ``source``
               OpenCL program source file.

            ``kernel``
               Kernel name in program.

            ``inputs``
               Number of inputs to the filter. Defaults to 1.

            ``size, s``
               Size of output frames. Defaults to the same as the first
               input.

            The ``program_opencl`` filter also supports the
            `framesync <#framesync>`__ options.

            The program source file must contain a kernel function with
            the given name, which will be run once for each plane of the
            output. Each run on a plane gets enqueued as a separate 2D
            global NDRange with one work-item for each pixel to be
            generated. The global ID offset for each work-item is
            therefore the coordinates of a pixel in the destination
            image.

            The kernel function needs to take the following arguments:

            -  Destination image, ``__write_only image2d_t``.

               This image will become the output; the kernel should
               write all of it.

            -  Frame index, ``unsigned int``.

               This is a counter starting from zero and increasing by
               one for each frame.

            -  Source images, ``__read_only image2d_t``.

               These are the most recent images on each input. The
               kernel may read from them to generate the output, but
               they can’t be written to.

            Example programs:

            -  Copy the input to the output (output must be the same
               size as the input).

                                     __read_only  image2d_t source)

                      float4 value = read_imagef(source, sampler, location);

            -  Apply a simple transformation, rotating the input by an
               amount increasing with the index counter. Pixel values
               are linearly interpolated by the sampler, and the output
               need not have the same dimensions as the input.

            Perform HDR(PQ/HLG) to SDR conversion with tone-mapping.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``tonemap``
            Specify the tone-mapping operator to be used. Same as
            tonemap option in `tonemap <#tonemap>`__.

            ``param``
            Tune the tone mapping algorithm. same as param option in
            `tonemap <#tonemap>`__.

            ``desat``
            Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this level of
            brightness. The higher the parameter, the more color
            information will be preserved. This setting helps prevent
            unnaturally blown-out colors for super-highlights, by
            (smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images
            feel more natural, at the cost of reducing information about
            out-of-range colors.

            The default value is 0.5, and the algorithm here is a little
            different from the cpu version tonemap currently. A setting
            of 0.0 disables this option.

            ``threshold``
            The tonemapping algorithm parameters is fine-tuned per each
            scene. And a threshold is used to detect whether the scene
            has changed or not. If the distance between the current
            frame average brightness and the current running average
            exceeds a threshold value, we would re-calculate scene
            average and peak brightness. The default value is 0.2.

            ``format``
            Specify the output pixel format.

            Currently supported formats are:

            ``p010``
            ``nv12``
            ``range, r``
            Set the output color range.

            ``tv/mpeg``
            ``pc/jpeg``
            Default is same as input.

            ``primaries, p``
            Set the output color primaries.

            Possible values are:

            ``bt709``
            ``bt2020``

            Cross fade two videos with custom transition effect by using
            OpenCL.

            It accepts the following options:

            ``transition``
               Set one of possible transition effects.

               ``custom``
                  Select custom transition effect, the actual transition
                  description will be picked from source and kernel
                  options.

               ``slidedown``
                  Default transition is fade.

            ``source``
               OpenCL program source file for custom transition.

            ``kernel``
               Set name of kernel to use for custom transition from
               program source file.

            ``duration``
               Set duration of video transition.

            ``offset``
               Set time of start of transition relative to first video.

            The program source file must contain a kernel function with
            the given name, which will be run once for each plane of the
            output. Each run on a plane gets enqueued as a separate 2D
            global NDRange with one work-item for each pixel to be
            generated. The global ID offset for each work-item is
            therefore the coordinates of a pixel in the destination
            image.

            The kernel function needs to take the following arguments:

            -  Destination image, ``__write_only image2d_t``.

               This image will become the output; the kernel should
               write all of it.

            -  First Source image, ``__read_only image2d_t``. Second
               Source image, ``__read_only image2d_t``.

               These are the most recent images on each input. The
               kernel may read from them to generate the output, but
               they can’t be written to.

            -  Transition progress, ``float``. This value is always
               between 0 and 1 inclusive.

            Example programs:

            -  Apply dots curtain transition effect:

               .. code:: verbatim

                  __kernel void blend_images(__write_only image2d_t dst,
                                             __read_only  image2d_t src1,

                                             float progress)

         VAAPI Video filters are usually used with VAAPI decoder and
         VAAPI encoder. Below is a description of VAAPI video filters.

         To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure
         FFmpeg with ``--enable-vaapi``.

         To use vaapi filters, you need to setup the vaapi device
         correctly. For more information, please read
         https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Hardware/VAAPI

            Overlay one video on the top of another.

            It takes two inputs and has one output. The first input is
            the "main" video on which the second input is overlaid.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``x``
            ``y``
               Set expressions for the x and y coordinates of the
               overlaid video on the main video.

               Default value is "0" for both expressions.

            ``w``
            ``h``
               Set expressions for the width and height the overlaid
               video on the main video.

               Default values are ’overlay_iw’ for ’w’ and
               ’overlay_ih*w/overlay_iw’ for ’h’.

               The expressions can contain the following parameters:

               ``main_w, W``
               ``main_h, H``
                  The main input width and height.

               ``overlay_iw``
               ``overlay_ih``
                  The overlay input width and height.

               ``overlay_w, w``
               ``overlay_h, h``
                  The overlay output width and height.

            ``alpha``
               Set transparency of overlaid video. Allowed range is 0.0
               to 1.0. Higher value means lower transparency. Default
               value is ``1.0``.

         To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure
         FFmpeg with ``--enable-vulkan`` and either
         ``--enable-libglslang`` or ``--enable-libshaderc``.

         Running Vulkan filters requires you to initialize a hardware
         device and to pass that device to all filters in any filter
         graph.

         ``-init_hw_device vulkan[=``\ ``name``\ ``][:``\ ``device``\ ``[,``\ ``key=value``\ ``...]]``
            Initialise a new hardware device of type ``vulkan`` called
            ``name``, using the given device parameters and options in
            ``key=value``. The following options are supported:

            ``debug``
               Switches validation layers on if set to 1.

            ``linear_images``
               Allocates linear images. Does not apply to decoding.

            ``disable_multiplane``
               Disables multiplane images. Does not apply to decoding.

         ``-filter_hw_device``\ ``name``
            Pass the hardware device called ``name`` to all filters in
            any filter graph.

                  -init_hw_device vulkan=vk:0 -filter_hw_device vk -i INPUT -vf "hwupload,nlmeans_vulkan,hwdownload" OUTPUT

         As Vulkan filters are not able to access frame data in normal
         memory, all frame data needs to be uploaded
         (`hwupload <#hwupload>`__) to hardware surfaces connected to
         the appropriate device before being used and then downloaded
         (`hwdownload <#hwdownload>`__) back to normal memory. Note that
         `hwupload <#hwupload>`__ will upload to a frame with the same
         layout as the software frame, so it may be necessary to add a
         `format <#format>`__ filter immediately before to get the input
         into the right format and `hwdownload <#hwdownload>`__ does not
         support all formats on the output - it is usually necessary to
         insert an additional `format <#format>`__ filter immediately
         following in the graph to get the output in a supported format.

            Apply an average blur filter, implemented on the GPU using
            Vulkan.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``sizeX``
               Set horizontal radius size. Range is ``[1, 32]`` and
               default value is ``3``.

            ``sizeY``
               Set vertical radius size. Range is ``[1, 32]`` and
               default value is ``3``.

            ``planes``
               Set which planes to filter. Default value is ``0xf``, by
               which all planes are processed.

               :class: section

            Blend two Vulkan frames into each other.

            The ``blend`` filter takes two input streams and outputs one
            stream, the first input is the "top" layer and second input
            is "bottom" layer. By default, the output terminates when
            the longest input terminates.

            A description of the accepted options follows.

            ``c0_mode``
            ``c1_mode``
            ``c2_mode``
            ``c3_mode``
            ``all_mode``
            Set blend mode for specific pixel component or all pixel
            components in case of ``all_mode``. Default value is
            ``normal``.

            Available values for component modes are:

            ‘\ ``normal``\ ’
            ‘\ ``multiply``\ ’

            Deinterlacer using `bwdif <#bwdif>`__, the "Bob Weaver
            Deinterlacing Filter" algorithm, implemented on the GPU
            using Vulkan.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``mode``
               The interlacing mode to adopt. It accepts one of the
               following values:

               ``0, send_frame``
                  Output one frame for each frame.

               ``1, send_field``
                  Output one frame for each field.

               The default value is ``send_field``.

            ``parity``
               The picture field parity assumed for the input interlaced
               video. It accepts one of the following values:

               ``0, tff``
                  Assume the top field is first.

               ``1, bff``
                  Assume the bottom field is first.

               ``-1, auto``
                  Enable automatic detection of field parity.

               The default value is ``auto``. If the interlacing is
               unknown or the decoder does not export this information,
               top field first will be assumed.

            ``deint``
               Specify which frames to deinterlace. Accepts one of the
               following values:

               ``0, all``
                  Deinterlace all frames.

               ``1, interlaced``
                  Only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced.

               The default value is ``all``.

            Apply an effect that emulates chromatic aberration. Works
            best with RGB inputs, but provides a similar effect with
            YCbCr inputs too.

            ``dist_x``
               Horizontal displacement multiplier. Each chroma pixel’s
               position will be multiplied by this amount, starting from
               the center of the image. Default is ``0``.

            ``dist_y``
               Similarly, this sets the vertical displacement
               multiplier. Default is ``0``.

            Video source that creates a Vulkan frame of a solid color.
            Useful for benchmarking, or overlaying.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``color``
               The color to use. Either a name, or a hexadecimal value.
               The default value is ``black``.

            ``size``
               The size of the output frame. Default value is
               ``1920x1080``.

            ``rate``
               The framerate to output at. Default value is ``60``
               frames per second.

            ``duration``
               The video duration. Default value is ``-0.000001``.

            ``sar``
               The video signal aspect ratio. Default value is ``1/1``.

            ``format``
               The pixel format of the output Vulkan frames. Default
               value is ``yuv444p``.

            ``out_range``
               Set the output YCbCr sample range.

               This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as
               well as allows forcing a specific value used for the
               output and encoder. If not specified, the range depends
               on the pixel format. Possible values:

               ‘\ ``auto/unknown``\ ’
                  Choose automatically.

               ‘\ ``jpeg/full/pc``\ ’
                  Set full range (0-255 in case of 8-bit luma).

               ‘\ ``mpeg/limited/tv``\ ’
                  Set "MPEG" range (16-235 in case of 8-bit luma).

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``sigma``
               Set horizontal sigma, standard deviation of Gaussian
               blur. Default is ``0.5``.

            ``sigmaV``
               Set vertical sigma, if negative it will be same as

            ``planes``
               Set which planes to filter. By default all planes are
               filtered.

            ``size``
               Set the kernel size along the horizontal axis. Default is
               ``19``.

            ``sizeV``
               Set the kernel size along the vertical axis. Default is
               ``0``, which sets to use the same value as ``size``.

            Denoise frames using Non-Local Means algorithm, implemented
            on the GPU using Vulkan. Supports more pixel formats than
            `nlmeans <#nlmeans>`__ or
            `nlmeans_opencl <#nlmeans_005fopencl>`__, including alpha
            channel support.

            The filter accepts the following options.

            ``s``
               Set denoising strength for all components. Default is
               1.0. Must be in range [1.0, 100.0].

               Set parallelism. Default is 36. Must be a number in the
               range [1, 168]. Larger values may speed up processing, at
               the cost of more VRAM. Lower values will slow it down,
               reducing VRAM usage. Only supported on GPUs with atomic

            Overlay one video on top of another.

            It takes two inputs and has one output. The first input is
            the "main" video on which the second input is overlaid. This
            filter requires all inputs to use the same pixel format. So,
            format conversion may be needed.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``x``
               Set the x coordinate of the overlaid video on the main
               video. Default value is ``0``.

            ``y``

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``dir``
               Specify the transposition direction.

               Can assume the following values:

                  Flip the input video vertically.

            ``passthrough``
               Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry
               matches the one specified by the specified value. It
               accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``none``\ ’
                  Always apply transposition. (default)

               ‘\ ``portrait``\ ’
                  Preserve portrait geometry (when ``height`` >=

         Below is a description of the currently available QSV video
         filters.

         To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure
         FFmpeg with ``--enable-libmfx`` or ``--enable-libvpl``.

         To use QSV filters, you need to setup the QSV device correctly.

            .. rubric:: 35.1 buffer
               :class: section

            Buffer video frames, and make them available to the filter
            chain.

            This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in
            particular through the interface defined in
            ``libavfilter/buffersrc.h``.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``video_size``
               Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video
               frames. For the syntax of this option, check the
               `(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax>`__.

            ``width``
               The input video width.

            ``height``
               The input video height.

            ``pix_fmt``
               A string representing the pixel format of the buffered
               video frames. It may be a number corresponding to a pixel
               format, or a pixel format name.

            ``time_base``
               Specify the timebase assumed by the timestamps of the
               buffered frames.

            ``frame_rate``
               Specify the frame rate expected for the video stream.

            ``pixel_aspect, sar``
               The sample (pixel) aspect ratio of the input video.

            ``hw_frames_ctx``
               When using a hardware pixel format, this should be a
               reference to an AVHWFramesContext describing input
               frames.

            For example:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  buffer=width=320:height=240:pix_fmt=yuv410p:time_base=1/24:sar=1

            will instruct the source to accept video frames with size
            320x240 and with format "yuv410p", assuming 1/24 as the
            timestamps timebase and square pixels (1:1 sample aspect
            ratio). Since the pixel format with name "yuv410p"
            corresponds to the number 6 (check the enum AVPixelFormat
            definition in ``libavutil/pixfmt.h``), this example
            corresponds to:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  buffer=size=320x240:pixfmt=6:time_base=1/24:pixel_aspect=1/1

            Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat
            string, but this syntax is deprecated:

            ``width``:``height``:``pix_fmt``:``time_base.num``:``time_base.den``:``pixel_aspect.num``:``pixel_aspect.den``

            .. rubric:: 35.2 cellauto
               :class: section

            Create a pattern generated by an elementary cellular
            automaton.

            The initial state of the cellular automaton can be defined
            through the ``filename`` and ``pattern`` options. If such
            options are not specified an initial state is created
            randomly.

            At each new frame a new row in the video is filled with the
            result of the cellular automaton next generation. The
            behavior when the whole frame is filled is defined by the
            ``scroll`` option.

            This source accepts the following options:

            ``filename, f``
               Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the
               starting row, from the specified file. In the file, each
               non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, a
               newline will terminate the row, and further characters in
               the file will be ignored.

            ``pattern, p``
               Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the
               starting row, from the specified string.

               Each non-whitespace character in the string is considered
               an alive cell, a newline will terminate the row, and
               further characters in the string will be ignored.

            ``rate, r``
               Set the video rate, that is the number of frames
               generated per second. Default is 25.

            ``random_fill_ratio, ratio``
               Set the random fill ratio for the initial cellular
               automaton row. It is a floating point number value
               ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.

               This option is ignored when a file or a pattern is
               specified.

            ``random_seed, seed``
               Set the seed for filling randomly the initial row, must
               be an integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not
               specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will
               try to use a good random seed on a best effort basis.

            ``rule``
               Set the cellular automaton rule, it is a number ranging
               from 0 to 255. Default value is 110.

            ``size, s``
               Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this
               option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in
               the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax>`__.

               If ``filename`` or ``pattern`` is specified, the size is
               set by default to the width of the specified initial
               state row, and the height is set to ``width`` \* PHI.

               If ``size`` is set, it must contain the width of the
               specified pattern string, and the specified pattern will
               be centered in the larger row.

               If a filename or a pattern string is not specified, the
               size value defaults to "320x518" (used for a randomly
               generated initial state).

            ``scroll``
               If set to 1, scroll the output upward when all the rows
               in the output have been already filled. If set to 0, the
               new generated row will be written over the top row just
               after the bottom row is filled. Defaults to 1.

            ``start_full, full``
               If set to 1, completely fill the output with generated
               rows before outputting the first frame. This is the
               default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.

            ``stitch``
               If set to 1, stitch the left and right row edges
               together. This is the default behavior, for disabling set
               the value to 0.

               ffmpeg-utils(1)
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax>`__ for
               the accepted syntax.

               If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative,
               the video is supposed to be generated forever.

            Additionally, all options of the `coreimage <#coreimage>`__
            video filter are accepted. A complete filterchain can be
            used for further processing of the generated input without
            CPU-HOST transfer. See `coreimage <#coreimage>`__
            documentation and examples for details.

            Captures the Windows Desktop via Desktop Duplication API.

            The filter exclusively returns D3D11 Hardware Frames, for
            on-gpu encoding or processing. So an explicit
            `hwdownload <#hwdownload>`__ is needed for any kind of
            software processing.

            It accepts the following options:

            ``output_idx``
               DXGI Output Index to capture.

               Usually corresponds to the index Windows has given the
               screen minus one, so it’s starting at 0.

               Defaults to output 0.

            ``draw_mouse``
               Whether to draw the mouse cursor.

               Defaults to true.

               Only affects hardware cursors. If a game or application
               renders its own cursor, it’ll always be captured.

            ``framerate``
               Framerate at which the desktop will be captured.

               Defaults to 30 FPS.

            ``video_size``
               Specify the size of the captured video.

               Defaults to the full size of the screen.

               Cropped from the bottom/right if smaller than screen
               size.

            ``offset_x``
               Horizontal offset of the captured video.

            ``offset_y``
               Vertical offset of the captured video.

            ``output_fmt``
               Desired filter output format. Defaults to 8 Bit BGRA.

               It accepts the following values:

               ‘\ ``auto``\ ’
                  Passes all supported output formats to DDA and returns
                  what DDA decides to use.

               ‘\ ``8bit``\ ’
               ‘\ ``bgra``\ ’
                  8 Bit formats always work, and DDA will convert to
                  them if neccesary.

               ‘\ ``10bit``\ ’
               ‘\ ``x2bgr10``\ ’
                  Filter initialization will fail if 10 bit format is
                  requested but unavailable.

               filter. Also demonstrates downloading the frame and
               encoding with libx264. Explicit output format
               specification is required in this case:

               If you want to capture only a subsection of the desktop,
               this can be achieved by specifying a smaller size and its
               offsets into the screen:

            This source accepts the following parameters:

            ``size``
               The size of the video to generate. For the syntax of this
               option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in
               the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax>`__.

            ``framerate``
               The framerate of the generated video. It may be a string
               of the form ``num``/``den`` or a frame rate abbreviation.

            ``filter_name``
               The name to the frei0r source to load. For more
               information regarding frei0r and how to set the
               parameters, read the `frei0r <#frei0r>`__ section in the
               video filters documentation.

            ``filter_params``
               A ’\|’-separated list of parameters to pass to the frei0r
               source.

               :class: section

            Generate a life pattern.

            This source is based on a generalization of John Conway’s
            life game.

            The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel
            represents a cell which can be in one of two possible
            states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight
            neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally,
            vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

            At each interaction the grid evolves according to the
            adopted rule, which specifies the number of neighbor alive
            cells which will make a cell stay alive or born. The
            ``rule`` option allows one to specify the rule to adopt.

            This source accepts the following options:

            ``filename, f``
               Set the file from which to read the initial grid state.
               In the file, each non-whitespace character is considered
               an alive cell, and newline is used to delimit the end of
               each row.

               If this option is not specified, the initial grid is
               generated randomly.

            ``rate, r``
               Set the video rate, that is the number of frames
               generated per second. Default is 25.

            ``random_fill_ratio, ratio``
               Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It
               is a floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1,
               defaults to 1/PHI. It is ignored when a file is
               specified.

            ``random_seed, seed``
               Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be
               an integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not
               specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will
               try to use a good random seed on a best effort basis.

            ``rule``
               Set the life rule.

               A rule can be specified with a code of the kind
               "S\ ``NS``/B\ ``NB``", where ``NS`` and ``NB`` are
               sequences of numbers in the range 0-8, ``NS`` specifies
               the number of alive neighbor cells which make a live cell
               stay alive, and ``NB`` the number of alive neighbor cells
               which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to "born").
               "s" and "b" can be used in place of "S" and "B",
               respectively.

               Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18-bits
               integer. The 9 high order bits are used to encode the
               next cell state if it is alive for each number of
               neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify the rule
               for "borning" new cells. Higher order bits encode for an
               higher number of neighbor cells. For example the number
               6153 = ``(12<<9)+9`` specifies a stay alive rule of 12
               and a born rule of 9, which corresponds to "S23/B03".

               Default value is "S23/B3", which is the original Conway’s
               game of life rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2
               or 3 neighbor alive cells, and will born a new cell if
               there are three alive cells around a dead cell.

            ``size, s``
               Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this
               option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in
               the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax>`__.

               If ``filename`` is specified, the size is set by default
               to the same size of the input file. If ``size`` is set,
               it must contain the size specified in the input file, and
               the initial grid defined in that file is centered in the
               larger resulting area.

               If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults
               to "320x240" (used for a randomly generated initial
               grid).

            ``stitch``
               If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges
               together, and the top and bottom edges also. Defaults to
               1.

            ``mold``
               Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from
               ``death_color`` to ``mold_color`` with a step of
               ``mold``. ``mold`` can have a value from 0 to 255.

            ``life_color``
               Set the color of living (or new born) cells.

            ``death_color``
               Set the color of dead cells. If ``mold`` is set, this is
               the first color used to represent a dead cell.

            ``mold_color``
               Set mold color, for definitely dead and moldy cells.

               For the syntax of these 3 color options, check the
               `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__.

            The ``allrgb`` source returns frames of size 4096x4096 of
            all rgb colors.

            The ``allyuv`` source returns frames of size 4096x4096 of
            all yuv colors.

            The ``color`` source provides an uniformly colored input.

            The ``colorchart`` source provides a colors checker chart.

            The ``colorspectrum`` source provides a color spectrum
            input.

            The ``haldclutsrc`` source provides an identity Hald CLUT.
            See also `haldclut <#haldclut>`__ filter.

            The ``nullsrc`` source returns unprocessed video frames. It
            is mainly useful to be employed in analysis / debugging
            tools, or as the source for filters which ignore the input
            data.

            The ``pal75bars`` source generates a color bars pattern,
            based on EBU PAL recommendations with 75% color levels.

            The ``pal100bars`` source generates a color bars pattern,
            based on EBU PAL recommendations with 100% color levels.

            The ``rgbtestsrc`` source generates an RGB test pattern
            useful for detecting RGB vs BGR issues. You should see a
            red, green and blue stripe from top to bottom.

            The ``smptebars`` source generates a color bars pattern,
            based on the SMPTE Engineering Guideline EG 1-1990.

            The ``smptehdbars`` source generates a color bars pattern,
            based on the SMPTE RP 219-2002.

            The ``testsrc`` source generates a test video pattern,
            showing a color pattern, a scrolling gradient and a
            timestamp. This is mainly intended for testing purposes.

            The ``testsrc2`` source is similar to testsrc, but supports
            more pixel formats instead of just ``rgb24``. This allows
            using it as an input for other tests without requiring a
            format conversion.

            The ``yuvtestsrc`` source generates an YUV test pattern. You
            should see a y, cb and cr stripe from top to bottom.

            The sources accept the following parameters:

            ``level``
            Specify the level of the Hald CLUT, only available in the
            ``haldclutsrc`` source. A level of ``N`` generates a picture
            of ``N*N*N`` by ``N*N*N`` pixels to be used as identity
            matrix for 3D lookup tables. Each component is coded on a
            ``1/(N*N)`` scale.

            ``color, c``
            Specify the color of the source, only available in the
            ``color`` source. For the syntax of this option, check the
            `(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
            manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax>`__.

            ``size, s``
            Specify the size of the sourced video. For the syntax of
            this option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section
            in the ffmpeg-utils
            manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax>`__. The default
            value is ``320x240``.

            This option is not available with the ``allrgb``,
            ``allyuv``, and ``haldclutsrc`` filters.

            ``rate, r``
            Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number
            of frames generated per second. It has to be a string in the
            format ``frame_rate_num``/``frame_rate_den``, an integer
            number, a floating point number or a valid video frame rate
            abbreviation. The default value is "25".

            ``duration, d``
            Set the duration of the sourced video. See
            `(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the
            ffmpeg-utils(1)
            manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax>`__ for the
            accepted syntax.

            If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the
            video is supposed to be generated forever.

            Since the frame rate is used as time base, all frames
            including the last one will have their full duration. If the
            specified duration is not a multiple of the frame duration,
            it will be rounded up.

            ``sar``
            Set the sample aspect ratio of the sourced video.

            ``alpha``
            Specify the alpha (opacity) of the background, only
            available in the ``testsrc2`` source. The value must be
            between 0 (fully transparent) and 255 (fully opaque, the
            default).

            ``decimals, n``
            Set the number of decimals to show in the timestamp, only
            available in the ``testsrc`` source.

            The displayed timestamp value will correspond to the
            original timestamp value multiplied by the power of 10 of
            the specified value. Default value is 0.

            ``type``
            Set the type of the color spectrum, only available in the
            ``colorspectrum`` source. Can be one of the following:

            ‘\ ``black``\ ’
            ‘\ ``white``\ ’
            ‘\ ``all``\ ’
            ``patch_size``
            Set patch size of single color patch, only available in the
            ``colorchart`` source. Default is ``64x64``.

            ``preset``
            Set colorchecker colors preset, only available in the
            ``colorchart`` source.

            Available values are:

            ‘\ ``reference``\ ’
            ‘\ ``skintones``\ ’
            Default value is ``reference``.

            Buffer video frames, and make them available to the end of
            the filter graph.

            This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in
            particular through the interface defined in
            ``libavfilter/buffersink.h`` or the options system.

            It accepts a pointer to an AVBufferSinkContext structure,
            which defines the incoming buffers’ formats, to be passed as
            the opaque parameter to ``avfilter_init_filter`` for
            initialization.

            channel layout. Phase value is in range ``[-1, 1]`` where
            ``-1`` means left and right channels are completely out of
            phase and ``1`` means channels are in phase.

            The filter accepts the following options, all related to its
            video output:

            ``rate, r``
               Set the output frame rate. Default value is ``25``.

            ``size, s``
               Set the video size for the output. For the syntax of this
               option, check the `(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in
               the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax>`__. Default
               value is ``800x400``.

               ``2``, ``7`` and ``1``. Allowed range is ``[0, 255]``.

            ``mpc``
               Set color which will be used for drawing median phase. If
               color is ``none`` which is default, no median phase value
               will be drawn.

            ``video``
               Enable video output. Default is enabled.

            audio vector scope.

            The filter is used to measure the difference between
            channels of stereo audio stream. A monaural signal,
            consisting of identical left and right signal, results in
            straight vertical line. Any stereo separation is visible as
            a deviation from this line, creating a Lissajous figure. If
            the straight (or deviation from it) but horizontal line
            appears this indicates that the left and right channels are
            out of phase.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``mode, m``
               Set the vectorscope mode.

            ``zoom``
               Set the zoom factor. Default value is ``1``. Allowed
               range is ``[0, 10]``. Values lower than ``1`` will auto
               adjust zoom factor to maximal possible value.

            Concatenate audio and video streams, joining them together
            one after the other.

            The filter works on segments of synchronized video and audio
            streams. All segments must have the same number of streams
            of each type, and that will also be the number of streams at
            output.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``n``
               Set the number of segments. Default is 2.

            ``v``
               Set the number of output video streams, that is also the
               number of video streams in each segment. Default is 1.

            ``a``
               Set the number of output audio streams, that is also the
               number of audio streams in each segment. Default is 0.

            ``unsafe``
               Activate unsafe mode: do not fail if segments have a
               different format.

            The filter has ``v``\ +\ ``a`` outputs: first ``v`` video
            outputs, then ``a`` audio outputs.

            There are ``n``\ x(``v``\ +\ ``a``) inputs: first the inputs
            for the first segment, in the same order as the outputs,
            then the inputs for the second segment, etc.

            Related streams do not always have exactly the same
            duration, for various reasons including codec frame size or
            sloppy authoring. For that reason, related synchronized
            streams (e.g. a video and its audio track) should be
            concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the
            duration of the longest stream in each segment (except the
            last one), and if necessary pad shorter audio streams with
            silence.

            For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start
            at timestamp 0.

            All corresponding streams must have the same parameters in
            all segments; the filtering system will automatically select
            a common pixel format for video streams, and a common sample
            format, sample rate and channel layout for audio streams,
            but other settings, such as resolution, must be converted
            explicitly by the user.

            Different frame rates are acceptable but will result in
            variable frame rate at output; be sure to configure the
            output file to handle it.

            EBU R128 scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream
            and analyzes its loudness level. By default, it logs a
            message at a frequency of 10Hz with the Momentary loudness
            (identified by ``M``), Short-term loudness (``S``),
            Integrated loudness (``I``) and Loudness Range (``LRA``).

            The filter can only analyze streams which have sample format
            is double-precision floating point. The input stream will be
            converted to this specification, if needed. Users may need
            to insert aformat and/or aresample filters after this filter
            to obtain the original parameters.

            The filter also has a video output (see the ``video``
            option) with a real time graph to observe the loudness
            evolution. The graphic contains the logged message mentioned
            above, so it is not printed anymore when this option is set,
            unless the verbose logging is set. The main graphing area
            contains the short-term loudness (3 seconds of analysis),
            and the gauge on the right is for the momentary loudness
            (400 milliseconds), but can optionally be configured to
            instead display short-term loudness (see ``gauge``).

            The green area marks a +/- 1LU target range around the
            target loudness (-23LUFS by default, unless modified through
            ``target``).

               Activate the video output. The audio stream is passed
               unchanged whether this option is set or no. The video
               stream will be the first output stream if activated.
               Default is ``0``.

            ``size``
               Set the video size. This option is for video only. For
               the syntax of this option, check the
               `(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils
               manual <ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax>`__. Default
               and minimum resolution is ``640x480``.

            ``meter``
               Set the EBU scale meter. Default is ``9``. Common values
               are ``9`` and ``18``, respectively for EBU scale meter +9
               and EBU scale meter +18. Any other integer value between
               this range is allowed.

            ``metadata``
               Set metadata injection. If set to ``1``, the audio input
               will be segmented into 100ms output frames, each of them
               containing various loudness information in metadata. All
               the metadata keys are prefixed with ``lavfi.r128.``.

               Default is ``0``.

            ``framelog``
               Force the frame logging level.

               Available values are:

               ‘\ ``quiet``\ ’
                  logging disabled

               ‘\ ``info``\ ’
                  information logging level

               ‘\ ``verbose``\ ’
                  verbose logging level

               By default, the logging level is set to ``info``. If the
               ``video`` or the ``metadata`` options are set, it
               switches to ``verbose``.

            ``peak``
               Set peak mode(s).

               Available modes can be cumulated (the option is a
               ``flag`` type). Possible values are:

               ‘\ ``none``\ ’
                  Disable any peak mode (default).

               ‘\ ``sample``\ ’
                  Enable sample-peak mode.

                  Simple peak mode looking for the higher sample value.
                  It logs a message for sample-peak (identified by
                  ``SPK``).

               ‘\ ``true``\ ’
                  Enable true-peak mode.

                  If enabled, the peak lookup is done on an over-sampled
                  version of the input stream for better peak accuracy.
                  It logs a message for true-peak. (identified by
                  ``TPK``) and true-peak per frame (identified by
                  ``FTPK``). This mode requires a build with
                  ``libswresample``.

            ``dualmono``
               Treat mono input files as "dual mono". If a mono file is
               intended for playback on a stereo system, its EBU R128
               measurement will be perceptually incorrect. If set to
               ``true``, this option will compensate for this effect.
               Multi-channel input files are not affected by this
               option.

            ``panlaw``
               Set a specific pan law to be used for the measurement of
               dual mono files. This parameter is optional, and has a
               default value of -3.01dB.

            ``target``
               Set a specific target level (in LUFS) used as relative
               zero in the visualization. This parameter is optional and
               has a default value of -23LUFS as specified by EBU R128.
               However, material published online may prefer a level of
               -16LUFS (e.g. for use with podcasts or video platforms).

            ``gauge``
               Set the value displayed by the gauge. Valid values are
               ``momentary`` and s ``shortterm``. By default the
               momentary value will be used, but in certain scenarios it
               may be more useful to observe the short term value
               instead (e.g. live mixing).

            ``scale``
               Sets the display scale for the loudness. Valid parameters
               are ``absolute`` (in LUFS) or ``relative`` (LU) relative
               to the target. This only affects the video output, not
               the summary or continuous log output.

            ``integrated``
               Read-only exported value for measured integrated
               loudness, in LUFS.

            ``range``
               Read-only exported value for measured loudness range, in
               LU.

            ``lra_low``
               Read-only exported value for measured LRA low, in LUFS.

            ``lra_high``
               Read-only exported value for measured LRA high, in LUFS.

            ``sample_peak``
               Read-only exported value for measured sample peak, in
               dBFS.

            ``true_peak``
               Read-only exported value for measured true peak, in dBFS.

               :class: section

            Temporally interleave frames from several inputs.

            ``interleave`` works with video inputs, ``ainterleave`` with
            audio.

            These filters read frames from several inputs and send the
            oldest queued frame to the output.

            Input streams must have well defined, monotonically
            increasing frame timestamp values.

            In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need
            to enqueue at least one frame for each input, so they cannot
            work in case one input is not yet terminated and will not
            receive incoming frames.

            For example consider the case when one input is a ``select``
            filter which always drops input frames. The ``interleave``
            filter will keep reading from that input, but it will never
            be able to send new frames to output until the input sends
            an end-of-stream signal.

            Also, depending on inputs synchronization, the filters will
            drop frames in case one input receives more frames than the
            other ones, and the queue is already filled.

            These filters accept the following options:

            ``nb_inputs, n``
               Set the number of different inputs, it is 2 by default.

            ``duration``
               How to determine the end-of-stream.

               ``longest``
                  The duration of the longest input. (default)

               ``shortest``
                  The duration of the shortest input.

               ``first``
                  The duration of the first input.

            This filter accepts the following options:

            ``mode``
               Set mode of operation of the filter.

               Can be one of the following:

               ‘\ ``select``\ ’
                  If both ``value`` and ``key`` is set, select frames
                  which have such metadata. If only ``key`` is set,
                  select every frame that has such key in metadata.

               ‘\ ``add``\ ’
                  Add new metadata ``key`` and ``value``. If key is
                  already available do nothing.

               ‘\ ``modify``\ ’
                  Modify value of already present key.

               ‘\ ``delete``\ ’
                  If ``value`` is set, delete only keys that have such
                  value. Otherwise, delete key. If ``key`` is not set,
                  delete all metadata values in the frame.

               ‘\ ``print``\ ’
                  Print key and its value if metadata was found. If
                  ``key`` is not set print all metadata values available
                  in frame.

            ``key``
               Set key used with all modes. Must be set for all modes
               except ``print`` and ``delete``.

            ``value``
               Set metadata value which will be used. This option is
               mandatory for ``modify`` and ``add`` mode.

            ``function``
               Which function to use when comparing metadata value and
               ``value``.

               Can be one of following:

               ‘\ ``same_str``\ ’
                  Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if
                  metadata value is same as ``value``.

               ‘\ ``starts_with``\ ’
                  Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if
                  metadata value starts with the ``value`` option
                  string.

               ‘\ ``less``\ ’
                  Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if
                  metadata value is less than ``value``.

               ‘\ ``equal``\ ’
                  Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if
                  ``value`` is equal with metadata value.

               ‘\ ``greater``\ ’
                  Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if
                  metadata value is greater than ``value``.

               ‘\ ``expr``\ ’
                  Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if
                  expression from option ``expr`` evaluates to true.

               ‘\ ``ends_with``\ ’
                  Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if
                  metadata value ends with the ``value`` option string.

            ``expr``
               Set expression which is used when ``function`` is set to
               ``expr``. The expression is evaluated through the eval
               API and can contain the following constants:

               ``VALUE1, FRAMEVAL``
                  Float representation of ``value`` from metadata key.

               ``VALUE2, USERVAL``
                  Float representation of ``value`` as supplied by user
                  in ``value`` option.

            ``file``
               If specified in ``print`` mode, output is written to the
               named file. Instead of plain filename any writable url
               can be specified. Filename “-” is a shorthand for
               standard output. If ``file`` option is not set, output is
               written to the log with AV_LOG_INFO loglevel.

            ``direct``
               Reduces buffering in print mode when output is written to
               a URL set using ``file``.

            These filters are mainly aimed at developers to test direct

                  Do nothing. This is the default.

               ‘\ ``ro``\ ’

               ‘\ ``rw``\ ’
                  Set all the output frames directly writable.

               ‘\ ``toggle``\ ’
                  Make the frame read-only if writable, and writable if
                  read-only.

               ‘\ ``random``\ ’
                  Set each output frame read-only or writable randomly.

            ``seed``
               Set the seed for the ``random`` mode, must be an integer
               included between ``0`` and ``UINT32_MAX``. If not
               specified, or if explicitly set to ``-1``, the filter
               will try to use a good random seed on a best effort
               basis.

            Note: in case of auto-inserted filter between the permission
            filter and the following one, the permission might not be

            `format <#format>`__ or `aformat <#aformat>`__ filter before
            the perms/aperms filter can avoid this problem.

            Slow down filtering to match real time approximately.

            These filters will pause the filtering for a variable amount
            of time to match the output rate with the input timestamps.
            They are similar to the ``re`` option to ``ffmpeg``.

            They accept the following options:

            ``limit``
               Time limit for the pauses. Any pause longer than that
               will be considered a timestamp discontinuity and reset
               the timer. Default is 2 seconds.

            ``speed``
               Speed factor for processing. The value must be a float
               larger than zero. Values larger than 1.0 will result in
               faster than realtime processing, smaller will slow
               processing down. The ``limit`` is automatically adapted
               accordingly. Default is 1.0.

               A processing speed faster than what is possible without
               these filters cannot be achieved.

            Split single input stream into multiple streams.

            This filter does opposite of concat filters.

            ``segment`` works on video frames, ``asegment`` on audio
            samples.

            This filter accepts the following options:

            ``timestamps``
               Timestamps of output segments separated by ’\|’. The
               first segment will run from the beginning of the input
               stream. The last segment will run until the end of the
               input stream

            ``frames, samples``
               Exact frame/sample count to split the segments.

            In all cases, prefixing an each segment with ’+’ will make
            it relative to the previous segment.

            Select frames to pass in output.

            This filter accepts the following options:

            ``expr, e``
               Set expression, which is evaluated for each input frame.

               If the expression is evaluated to zero, the frame is
               discarded.

               If the evaluation result is negative or NaN, the frame is
               sent to the first output; otherwise it is sent to the
               output with index ``ceil(val)-1``, assuming that the
               input index starts from 0.

               For example a value of ``1.2`` corresponds to the output
               with index ``ceil(1.2)-1 = 2-1 = 1``, that is the second
               output.

            ``outputs, n``
               Set the number of outputs. The output to which to send
               the selected frame is based on the result of the
               evaluation. Default value is 1.

            The expression can contain the following constants:

            ``n``
            The (sequential) number of the filtered frame, starting from
            0.

            ``selected_n``
            The (sequential) number of the selected frame, starting from
            0.

            ``prev_selected_n``
            The sequential number of the last selected frame. It’s NAN
            if undefined.

            ``TB``
            The timebase of the input timestamps.

            ``pts``
            The PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the filtered frame,
            expressed in ``TB`` units. It’s NAN if undefined.

            ``t``
            The PTS of the filtered frame, expressed in seconds. It’s
            NAN if undefined.

            ``prev_pts``
            The PTS of the previously filtered frame. It’s NAN if
            undefined.

            ``prev_selected_pts``
            The PTS of the last previously filtered frame. It’s NAN if
            undefined.

            ``prev_selected_t``
            The PTS of the last previously selected frame, expressed in
            seconds. It’s NAN if undefined.

            ``start_pts``
            The first PTS in the stream which is not NAN. It remains NAN
            if not found.

            ``start_t``
            The first PTS, in seconds, in the stream which is not NAN.
            It remains NAN if not found.

            ``pict_type``\ *``(video only)``*
            The type of the filtered frame. It can assume one of the
            following values:

            ``I``
            ``P``
            ``B``
            ``S``
            ``SI``
            ``SP``
            ``BI``
            ``interlace_type``\ *``(video only)``*
            The frame interlace type. It can assume one of the following
            values:

            ``PROGRESSIVE``
               The frame is progressive (not interlaced).

            ``TOPFIRST``
               The frame is top-field-first.

            ``BOTTOMFIRST``
               The frame is bottom-field-first.

            ``consumed_sample_n``\ *``(audio only)``*
            the number of selected samples before the current frame

            ``samples_n``\ *``(audio only)``*
            the number of samples in the current frame

            ``sample_rate``\ *``(audio only)``*
            the input sample rate

            ``key``
            This is 1 if the filtered frame is a key-frame, 0 otherwise.

            ``pos``
            the position in the file of the filtered frame, -1 if the
            information is not available (e.g. for synthetic video);
            deprecated, do not use

            ``scene``\ *``(video only)``*
            value between 0 and 1 to indicate a new scene; a low value
            reflects a low probability for the current frame to
            introduce a new scene, while a higher value means the
            current frame is more likely to be one (see the example
            below)

            ``concatdec_select``
            The concat demuxer can select only part of a concat input
            file by setting an inpoint and an outpoint, but the output
            packets may not be entirely contained in the selected
            interval. By using this variable, it is possible to skip
            frames generated by the concat demuxer which are not exactly
            contained in the selected interval.

            This works by comparing the frame pts against the
            ``lavf.concat.start_time`` and the ``lavf.concat.duration``
            packet metadata values which are also present in the decoded
            frames.

            The ``concatdec_select`` variable is -1 if the frame pts is
            at least start_time and either the duration metadata is
            missing or the frame pts is less than start_time + duration,
            0 otherwise, and NaN if the start_time metadata is missing.

            That basically means that an input frame is selected if its
            pts is within the interval set by the concat demuxer.

            The default value of the select expression is "1".

                  :class: subsection

               A commands description consists of a sequence of interval
               specifications, comprising a list of commands to be
               executed when a particular event related to that interval
               occurs. The occurring event is typically the current
               frame time entering or leaving a given time interval.

               An interval is specified by the following syntax:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     START[-END] COMMANDS;

               The time interval is specified by the ``START`` and
               ``END`` times. ``END`` is optional and defaults to the
               maximum time.

               The current frame time is considered within the specified
               interval if it is included in the interval [``START``,
               ``END``), that is when the time is greater or equal to
               ``START`` and is lesser than ``END``.

               ``COMMANDS`` consists of a sequence of one or more
               command specifications, separated by ",", relating to
               that interval. The syntax of a command specification is
               given by:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     [FLAGS] TARGET COMMAND ARG

               ``FLAGS`` is optional and specifies the type of events
               relating to the time interval which enable sending the
               specified command, and must be a non-null sequence of
               identifier flags separated by "+" or "\|" and enclosed
               between "[" and "]".

               The following flags are recognized:

               ``enter``
                  The command is sent when the current frame timestamp
                  enters the specified interval. In other words, the
                  command is sent when the previous frame timestamp was
                  not in the given interval, and the current is.

               ``leave``
                  The command is sent when the current frame timestamp
                  leaves the specified interval. In other words, the
                  command is sent when the previous frame timestamp was
                  in the given interval, and the current is not.

               ``expr``
                  The command ``ARG`` is interpreted as expression and
                  result of expression is passed as ``ARG``.

                  The expression is evaluated through the eval API and

            ``bar_v, volume2``
               Specify the bargraph volume expression. It can contain
               variables:

               ``sono_v``
                  the ``sono_v`` evaluated expression

               ``frequency, freq, f``

               Default value is ``sono_v``.

            ``sono_g, gamma``
               Specify the sonogram gamma. Lower gamma makes the
               spectrum more contrast, higher gamma makes the spectrum
               having more range. Default value is ``3``. Acceptable
               range is ``[1, 7]``.

            ``bar_g, gamma2``
               Specify the bargraph gamma. Default value is ``1``.
               Acceptable range is ``[1, 7]``.

            ``bar_t``
               Specify the bargraph transparency level. Lower value
               makes the bargraph sharper. Default value is ``1``.

               is trade-off between accuracy in time domain and
               frequency domain. If timeclamp is lower, event in time
               domain is represented more accurately (such as fast bass
               drum), otherwise event in frequency domain is represented
               more accurately (such as bass guitar). Acceptable range
               is ``[0.002, 1]``. Default value is ``0.17``.

            ``attack``
               Set attack time in seconds. The default is ``0``
               (disabled). Otherwise, it limits future samples by
               applying asymmetric windowing in time domain, useful when
               low latency is required. Accepted range is ``[0, 1]``.

            ``basefreq``
               Specify the transform base frequency. Default value is
               ``20.01523126408007475``, which is frequency 50 cents
               below E0. Acceptable range is ``[10, 100000]``.

            ``endfreq``
               Specify the transform end frequency. Default value is
               ``20495.59681441799654``, which is frequency 50 cents
               above D#10. Acceptable range is ``[10, 100000]``.

            ``coeffclamp``
               This option is deprecated and ignored.

            ``tlength``
               Specify the transform length in time domain. Use this
               option to control accuracy trade-off between time domain
               and frequency domain at every frequency sample. It can
               contain variables:

               ``frequency, freq, f``
                  the frequency where it is evaluated

               ``timeclamp, tc``
                  the value of ``timeclamp`` option.

               Default value is ``384*tc/(384+tc*f)``.

            ``count``
               Specify the transform count for every video frame.
               Default value is ``6``. Acceptable range is ``[1, 30]``.

            ``fcount``
               Specify the transform count for every single pixel.
               Default value is ``0``, which makes it computed
               automatically. Acceptable range is ``[0, 10]``.

            ``fontfile``
               Specify font file for use with freetype to draw the axis.
               If not specified, use embedded font. Note that drawing
               with font file or embedded font is not implemented with
               custom ``basefreq`` and ``endfreq``, use ``axisfile``
               option instead.

            ``font``
               Specify fontconfig pattern. This has lower priority than
               ``fontfile``. The ``:`` in the pattern may be replaced by
               ``|`` to avoid unnecessary escaping.

            ``fontcolor``
               Specify font color expression. This is arithmetic
               expression that should return integer value 0xRRGGBB. It
               can contain variables:

               ``frequency, freq, f``
                  the frequency where it is evaluated

               ``timeclamp, tc``
                  the value of ``timeclamp`` option

               and functions:

               ``midi(f)``
                  midi number of frequency f, some midi numbers: E0(16),
                  C1(24), C2(36), A4(69)

               ``r(x), g(x), b(x)``
                  red, green, and blue value of intensity x.

               Default value is
               ``st(0, (midi(f)-59.5)/12); st(1, if(between(ld(0),0,1), 0.5-0.5*cos(2*PI*ld(0)), 0)); r(1-ld(1)) + b(ld(1))``.

            ``axisfile``
               Specify image file to draw the axis. This option override
               ``fontfile`` and ``fontcolor`` option.

            ``axis, text``
               Enable/disable drawing text to the axis. If it is set to
               ``0``, drawing to the axis is disabled, ignoring
               ``fontfile`` and ``axisfile`` option. Default value is
               ``1``.

            ``csp``

            synthesize sound from other spectrograms too. But in such
            case results are going to be poor if the phase data is not
            available, because in such cases phase data need to be
            recreated, usually it’s just recreated from random noise.
            For best results use gray only output (``channel`` color
            mode in `showspectrum <#showspectrum>`__ filter) and ``log``
            scale for magnitude video and ``lin`` scale for phase video.
            To produce phase, for 2nd video, use ``data`` option. Inputs
            videos should generally use ``fullframe`` slide mode as that
            saves resources needed for decoding video.

            The filter accepts the following options:

            ``sample_rate``
               Specify sample rate of output audio, the sample rate of
               audio from which spectrum was generated may differ.

            ``channels``
               Set number of channels represented in input video
               spectrums.

            ``scale``
               Set scale which was used when generating magnitude input
               spectrum. Can be ``lin`` or ``log``. Default is ``log``.

            ``slide``
               Set slide which was used when generating inputs
               spectrums. Can be ``replace``, ``scroll``, ``fullframe``
               or ``rscroll``. Default is ``fullframe``.

            ``win_func``
               Set window function used for resynthesis.

            ``overlap``
               Set window overlap. In range ``[0, 1]``. Default is
               ``1``, which means optimal overlap for selected window
               function will be picked.

            ``orientation``
               Set orientation of input videos. Can be ``vertical`` or
               ``horizontal``. Default is ``vertical``.

            Receive commands sent through a libzmq client, and forward
            them to filters in the filtergraph.

            ``zmq`` and ``azmq`` work as a pass-through filters. ``zmq``
            must be inserted between two video filters, ``azmq`` between
            two audio filters. Both are capable to send messages to any
            filter type.

            To enable these filters you need to install the libzmq
            library and headers and configure FFmpeg with
            ``--enable-libzmq``.

            For more information about libzmq see:
            http://www.zeromq.org/

            The ``zmq`` and ``azmq`` filters work as a libzmq server,
            which receives messages sent through a network interface
            defined by the ``bind_address`` (or the abbreviation
            "``b``") option. Default value of this option is
            ``tcp://localhost:5555``. You may want to alter this value
            to your needs, but do not forget to escape any ’:’ signs
            (see `filtergraph escaping <#filtergraph-escaping>`__).

            The received message must be in the form:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  TARGET COMMAND [ARG]

            ``TARGET`` specifies the target of the command, usually the
            name of the filter class or a specific filter instance name.
            The default filter instance name uses the pattern
            ‘\ ``Parsed_<filter_name>_<index>``\ ’, but you can override
            this by using the ‘\ ``filter_name@id``\ ’ syntax (see
            `Filtergraph syntax <#Filtergraph-syntax>`__).

            ``COMMAND`` specifies the name of the command for the target
            filter.

            ``ARG`` is optional and specifies the optional argument list
            for the given ``COMMAND``.

            Upon reception, the message is processed and the
            corresponding command is injected into the filtergraph.
            Depending on the result, the filter will send a reply to the
            client, adopting the format:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ERROR_CODE ERROR_REASON
                  MESSAGE

            ``MESSAGE`` is optional.

               Look at ``tools/zmqsend`` for an example of a zmq client
               which can be used to send commands processed by these
               filters.

               Consider the following filtergraph generated by
               ``ffplay``. In this example the last overlay filter has
               an instance name. All other filters will have default
               instance names.

               .. container:: example

               To change the color of the left side of the video, the

                     echo Parsed_color_0 c yellow | tools/zmqsend

            Read audio and/or video stream(s) from a movie container.

            It accepts the following parameters:

            ``filename``
               The name of the resource to read (not necessarily a file;
               it can also be a device or a stream accessed through some
               protocol).

            ``format_name, f``
               Specifies the format assumed for the movie to read, and
               can be either the name of a container or an input device.
               If not specified, the format is guessed from
               ``movie_name`` or by probing.

            ``seek_point, sp``
               Specifies the seek point in seconds. The frames will be
               output starting from this seek point. The parameter is
               evaluated with ``av_strtod``, so the numerical value may
               be suffixed by an IS postfix. The default value is "0".

            ``streams, s``
               Specifies the streams to read. Several streams can be
               specified, separated by "+". The source will then have as
               many outputs, in the same order. The syntax is explained
               in the `(ffmpeg)"Stream specifiers" section in the ffmpeg
               manual <ffmpeg.html#Stream-specifiers>`__. Two special
               names, "dv" and "da" specify respectively the default
               (best suited) video and audio stream. Default is "dv", or
               "da" if the filter is called as "amovie".

            ``stream_index, si``
               Specifies the index of the video stream to read. If the
               value is -1, the most suitable video stream will be
               automatically selected. The default value is "-1".
               Deprecated. If the filter is called "amovie", it will
               select audio instead of video.

            ``loop``
               Specifies how many times to read the stream in sequence.
               If the value is 0, the stream will be looped infinitely.
               Default value is "1".

               Note that when the movie is looped the source timestamps
               are not changed, so it will generate non monotonically
               increasing timestamps.

            ``discontinuity``
               Specifies the time difference between frames above which
               the point is considered a timestamp discontinuity which
               is removed by adjusting the later timestamps.

            ``dec_threads``
               Specifies the number of threads for decoding

            ``format_opts``
               Specify format options for the opened file. Format
               options can be specified as a list of
               ``key``\ =\ ``value`` pairs separated by ’:’. The
               following example shows how to add protocol_whitelist and
               protocol_blacklist options:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     ffplay -f lavfi

            FFmpeg can make use of the AOM library for AV1 decoding and
            encoding.

            Go to http://aomedia.org/ and follow the instructions for
            installing the library. Then pass ``--enable-libaom`` to
            configure to enable it.

               :class: section

            FFmpeg can use the AMD Advanced Media Framework library for
            accelerated H.264 and HEVC(only windows) encoding on
            hardware with Video Coding Engine (VCE).

            To enable support you must obtain the AMF framework header
            files(version 1.4.9+) from
            https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AMF.git.

            Create an ``AMF/`` directory in the system include path.
            Copy the contents of ``AMF/amf/public/include/`` into that
            directory. Then configure FFmpeg with ``--enable-amf``.

            Initialization of amf encoder occurs in this order: 1)
            trying to initialize through dx11(only windows) 2) trying to
            initialize through dx9(only windows) 3) trying to initialize
            through vulkan

            To use h.264(AMD VCE) encoder on linux amdgru-pro version
            19.20+ and amf-amdgpu-pro package(amdgru-pro contains, but
            does not install automatically) are required.

            This driver can be installed using amdgpu-pro-install script
            in official amd driver archive.

               :name: avisynth
               :class: section

            FFmpeg can read AviSynth scripts as input. To enable
            support, pass ``--enable-avisynth`` to configure after
            installing the headers provided by
            `AviSynth+ <https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus>`__.
            AviSynth+ can be configured to install only the headers by
            either passing ``-DHEADERS_ONLY:bool=on`` to the normal
            CMake-based build system, or by using the supplied
            ``GNUmakefile``.

            For Windows, supported AviSynth variants are `AviSynth 2.6
            RC1 or higher <http://avisynth.nl>`__ for 32-bit builds and
            `AviSynth+ r1718 or
            higher <http://avisynth.nl/index.php/AviSynth+>`__ for
            32-bit and 64-bit builds.

            For Linux, macOS, and BSD, the only supported AviSynth
            variant is
            `AviSynth+ <https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus>`__,
            starting with version 3.5.

            .. container:: info

               In 2016, AviSynth+ added support for building with GCC.
               However, due to the eccentricities of Windows’ calling
               conventions, 32-bit GCC builds of AviSynth+ are not
               compatible with typical 32-bit builds of FFmpeg.

               By default, FFmpeg assumes compatibility with 32-bit MSVC
               builds of AviSynth+ since that is the most widely-used
               and entrenched build configuration. Users can override
               this and enable support for 32-bit GCC builds of
               AviSynth+ by passing ``-DAVSC_WIN32_GCC32`` to
               ``--extra-cflags`` when configuring FFmpeg.

               64-bit builds of FFmpeg are not affected, and can use
               either MSVC or GCC builds of AviSynth+ without any
               special flags.

            .. container:: info

               AviSynth(+) is loaded dynamically. Distributors can build
               FFmpeg with ``--enable-avisynth``, and the binaries will
               work regardless of the end user having AviSynth
               installed. If/when an end user would like to use AviSynth
               scripts, then they can install AviSynth(+) and FFmpeg
               will be able to find and use it to open scripts.

               :class: section

            FFmpeg can make use of the codec2 library for codec2
            decoding and encoding. There is currently no native decoder,
            so libcodec2 must be used for decoding.

            Go to http://freedv.org/, download "Codec 2 source archive".
            Build and install using CMake. Debian users can install the
            libcodec2-dev package instead. Once libcodec2 is installed
            you can pass ``--enable-libcodec2`` to configure to enable
            it.

            The easiest way to use codec2 is with .c2 files, since they
            contain the mode information required for decoding. To
            encode such a file, use a .c2 file extension and give the
            libcodec2 encoder the -mode option:
            ``ffmpeg -i input.wav -mode 700C output.c2``. Playback is as
            simple as ``ffplay output.c2``. For a list of supported
            modes, run ``ffmpeg -h encoder=libcodec2``. Raw codec2 files
            are also supported. To make sense of them the mode in use
            needs to be specified as a format option:
            ``ffmpeg -f codec2raw -mode 1300 -i input.raw output.wav``.

            For decoding, this library is much more limited than the
            built-in decoder in libavcodec; currently, this library
            lacks support for decoding B-frames and some other main/high
            profile features. (It currently only supports constrained
            baseline profile and CABAC.) Using it is mostly useful for
            testing and for taking advantage of Cisco’s patent portfolio
            license (http://www.openh264.org/BINARY_LICENSE.txt).

            Vapoursynth is detected via ``pkg-config``. Versions 42 or
            greater supported. See http://www.vapoursynth.com/.

            Due to security concerns, Vapoursynth scripts will not be
            autodetected so the input format has to be forced. For ff\*
            CLI tools, add ``-f vapoursynth`` before the input
            ``-i yourscript.vpy``.

            ``X`` means that the feature in that column (encoding /
            decoding) is supported.

            ``E`` means that support is provided through an external
            library.

            ``I`` means that an integer-only version is available, too
            (ensures high performance on systems without hardware
            floating point support).
