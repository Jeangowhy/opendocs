Haskell is a deep language, and we think that learning it is a
hugely rewarding experience. We will focus on three elements as we
explain why. The first is *novelty*: we invite you to think about
programming from a different and valuable perspective. The second
is *power*: we'll show you how to create software that is short,
fast, and safe. Lastly, we offer you a lot of *fun*: the pleasure
of applying beautiful programming techniques to solve real
problems.

.. container:: sect2

   .. rubric:: Novelty
      :name: id528233
      :class: title

Haskell is most likely quite different from any language you've
ever used before. Compared to the usual set of concepts in a
programmer's mental toolbox, functional programming offers us a
profoundly different way to think about software.

In Haskell, we de-emphasise code that modifies data. Instead,
we focus on functions that take immutable values as input and
produce new values as output. Given the same inputs, these
functions always return the same results. This is a core idea
behind functional programming.

Along with not modifying data, our Haskell functions usually
don't talk to the external world; we call these functions
*pure*. We make a strong distinction between pure code and the
parts of our programs that read or write files, communicate
over network connections, or make robot arms move. This makes
it easier to organize, reason about, and test our programs.

We abandon some ideas that might seem fundamental, such as
having a ``for`` loop built into the language. We have other,
more flexible, ways to perform repetitive tasks.

Even the way in which we evaluate expressions is different in
Haskell. We defer every computation until its result is
actually needed: Haskell is a *lazy* language. Laziness is not
merely a matter of moving work around: it profoundly affects
how we write programs.

.. container:: sect2

   .. rubric:: Power
      :name: id563635
      :class: title

Throughout this book, we will show you how Haskell's 
alternatives to the features of traditional languages are
powerful, flexible, and lead to reliable code. Haskell is
positively crammed full of cutting edge ideas about how to
create great software.

Since pure code has no dealings with the outside world, and the
data it works with is never modified, the kinds of nasty
surprise in which one piece of code invisibly corrupts data
used by another are very rare. Whatever context we use a pure
function in, it will behave consistently.

Pure code is easier to test than code that deals with the
outside world. When a function only responds to its visible
inputs, we can easily state properties of its behavior that
should always be true. We can automatically test that those
properties hold for a huge body of random inputs, and when our
tests pass, we move on. We still use traditional techniques to
test code that must interact with files, networks, or exotic
hardware. Since there is much less of this impure code than we
would find in a traditional language, we gain much more
assurance that our software is solid.

Lazy evaluation has some spooky effects. Let's say we want to
find the *k* least-valued elements of an unsorted list. In a
traditional language, the obvious approach would be to sort the
list and take the first *k* elements, but this is expensive.
For efficiency, we would instead write a special function that
takes these values in one pass, and it would have to perform
some moderately complex book-keeping. In Haskell, the
sort-then-take approach actually performs well: laziness
ensures that the list will only be sorted enough to find the
*k* minimal elements.

Better yet, our Haskell code that operates so efficiently is
tiny, and uses standard library functions.

.. code:: haskell
   :class: screen

   -- file: ch00/KMinima.hs
   -- lines beginning with "--" are comments.

   minima k xs = take k (sort xs)

It can take a while to develop an intuitive feel for when lazy
evaluation is important, but when we exploit it, the resulting
code is often clean, brief, and efficient.

As the above example shows, an important aspect of Haskell's
power lies in the compactness of the code we write. Compared to
working in popular traditional languages, when we develop in
Haskell we often write much less code, in substantially less
time, and with fewer bugs.

.. container:: sect2

   .. rubric:: Enjoyment
      :name: id529125
      :class: title

We believe that it is easy to pick up the basics of Haskell
programming, and that you will be able to successfully write
small programs within a matter of hours or days.

Since effective programming in Haskell differs greatly from
other languages, you should expect that mastering both the
language itself and functional programming techniques will
require plenty of thought and practice.

Harking back to our own days of getting started with Haskell,
the good news is that the fun begins early: it's simply an
entertaining challenge to dig into a new language, in which so
many commonplace ideas are different or missing, and to figure
out how to write simple programs.

For us, the initial pleasure lasted as our experience grew and
our understanding deepened. In other languages, it's difficult
to see any connection between science and the nuts-and-bolts of
programming. In Haskell, we have imported some ideas from
abstract mathematics and put them to work. Even better, we find
that not only are these ideas easy to pick up, they have a
practical payoff in helping us to write more compact, reusable
code.

Furthermore, we won't be putting any “brick walls” in your way:
there are no especially difficult or gruesome techniques in
this book that you must master in order to be able to program
effectively.

That being said, Haskell is a rigorous language: it will make
you perform more of your thinking up front. It can take a
little while to adjust to debugging much of your code before
you ever run it, in response to the compiler telling you that
something about your program does not make sense. Even with
years of experience, we remain astonished and pleased by how
often our Haskell programs simply work on the first try, once
we fix those compilation errors.

   .. rubric:: What to expect from this book
      :name: id529185
      :class: title

We started this project because a growing number of people are
using Haskell to solve everyday problems. Because Haskell has its
roots in academia, few of the Haskell books that currently exist
focus on the problems and techniques of everyday programming that
we're interested in.

With this book, we want to show you how to use functional
programming and Haskell to solve realistic problems. This is a
hands-on book: every chapter contains dozens of code samples, and
many contain complete applications. Here are a few examples of the
libraries, techniques and tools that we'll show you how to
develop.

.. container:: itemizedlist

   -  Create an application that downloads podcast episodes from
      the Internet, and stores its history in an SQL database.

   -  Test your code in an intuitive and powerful way. Describe
      properties that ought to be true, then let the QuickCheck
      library generate test cases automatically.

   -  Take a grainy phone camera snapshot of a barcode, and turn
      it into an identifier that you can use to query a library or
      bookseller's web site.

   -  Write code that thrives on the web. Exchange data with
      servers and clients written in other languages using JSON
      notation. Develop a concurrent link checker.

.. container:: sect2

   .. rubric:: A little bit about you
      :name: id528412
      :class: title

What will you need to know before reading this book? We expect
that you already know how to program, but if you've never used
a functional language, that's fine.

No matter what your level of experience is, we have tried to
anticipate your needs: we go out of our way to explain new and
potentially tricky ideas in depth, usually with examples and
images to drive our points home.

As a new Haskell programmer, you'll inevitably start out 
writing quite a bit of code by hand for which you could have
used a library function or programming technique, had you just
known of its existence. We've packed this book with information
to help you to come up to speed as quickly as possible.

Of course, there will always be a few bumps along the road. If
you start out anticipating an occasional surprise or difficulty
along with the fun stuff, you will have the best experience.
Any rough patches you might hit won't last long.

As you become a more seasoned Haskell programmer, the way that
you write code will change. Indeed, over the course of this
book, the way that we present code will evolve, as we move from
the basics of the language to increasingly powerful and
productive features and techniques.

.. container:: sect1

   .. rubric:: What to expect from Haskell
      :name: id528460
      :class: title

Haskell is a general purpose programming language. It was designed
without any application niche in mind. Although it takes a strong
stand on how programs should be written, it does not favour one
problem domain over others.

While at its core, the language encourages a pure, lazy style of
functional programming, this is the *default*, not the only
option. Haskell also supports the more traditional models of
procedural code and strict evaluation. Additionally, although the
focus of the language is squarely on writing statically typed
programs, it is possible (though rarely seen) to write Haskell
code in a dynamically typed manner.

.. container:: sect2

   .. rubric:: Compared to traditional static languages
      :name: id528487
      :class: title

Languages that use simple static type systems have been the
mainstay of the programming world for decades. Haskell is
statically typed, but its notion of what types are for, and
what we can do with them, is much more flexible and powerful
than traditional languages. Types make a major contribution to
the brevity, clarity, and efficiency of Haskell programs.

Although powerful, Haskell's type system is often also 
unobtrusive. If we omit explicit type information, a Haskell
compiler will automatically infer the type of an expression or
function. Compared to traditional static languages, to which we
must spoon-feed large amounts of type information, the
combination of power and inference in Haskell's type system
significantly reduces the clutter and redundancy of our code.

Several of Haskell's other features combine to further increase
the amount of work we can fit into a screenful of text. This
brings improvements in development time and agility: we can
create reliable code quickly, and easily refactor it in
response to changing requirements.

Sometimes, Haskell programs may run more slowly than similar
programs written in C or C++. For most of the code we write,
Haskell's large advantages in productivity and reliability
outweigh any small performance disadvantage.

Multicore processors are now ubiquitous, but they remain 
notoriously difficult to program using traditional techniques.
Haskell provides unique technologies to make multicore
programming more tractable. It supports parallel programming,
software transactional memory for reliable concurrency, and
scales to hundreds of thousands of concurrent threads.

.. container:: sect2

   .. rubric:: Compared to modern dynamic languages
      :name: id572991
      :class: title

Over the past decade, dynamically typed, interpreted languages
have become increasingly popular. They offer substantial
benefits in developer productivity. Although this often comes
at the cost of a huge performance hit, for many programming
tasks productivity trumps performance, or performance isn't a
significant factor in any case.

Brevity is one area in which Haskell and dynamically typed
languages perform similarly: in each case, we write much less
code to solve a problem than in a traditional language.
Programs are often around the same size in dynamically typed
languages and Haskell.

When we consider runtime performance, Haskell almost always has
a huge advantage. Code compiled by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
(GHC) is typically between 20 and 60 times faster than code run
through a dynamic language's interpreter. GHC also provides an
interpreter, so you can run scripts without compiling them.

Another big difference between dynamically typed languages and
Haskell lies in their philosophies around types. A major reason
for the popularity of dynamically typed languages is that only
rarely do we need to explicitly mention types. Through
automatic type inference, Haskell offers the same advantage.

Beyond this surface similarity, the differences run deep. In a
dynamically typed language, we can create constructs that are
difficult to express in a statically typed language. However,
the same is true in reverse: with a type system as powerful as
Haskell's, we can structure a program in a way that would be
unmanageable or infeasible in a dynamically typed language.

It's important to recognise that each of these approaches
involves tradeoffs. Very briefly put, the Haskell perspective
emphasises safety, while the dynamically typed outlook favours
flexibility. If someone had already discovered one way of
thinking about types that was always best, we imagine that
everyone would know about it by now.

Of course, we have our own opinions about which tradeoffs are

in dynamically typed languages. We love working with them; we
still use them every day; but usually, we prefer Haskell.

For practical work, almost as important as a language itself is
the ecosystem of libraries and tools around it. Haskell has a
strong showing in this area.

The most widely used compiler, GHC, has been actively developed
for over 15 years, and provides a mature and stable set of
features.

.. container:: itemizedlist

   -  Compiles to efficient native code on all major modern
      operating systems and CPU architectures

   -  Easy deployment of compiled binaries, unencumbered by
      licensing restrictions

   -  Code coverage analysis

   -  Detailed profiling of performance and memory usage

   -  Thorough documentation

   -  Massively scalable support for concurrent and multicore
      programming

   -  Interactive interpreter and debugger

The development of Haskell is rooted in mathematics and computer
science research.

.. container:: sect2

   .. rubric:: Prehistory
      :name: id573413
      :class: title

A few decades before modern computers were invented, the 
mathematician Alonzo Church developed a language called the
lambda calculus. He intended it as a tool for investigating the
foundations of mathematics. The first person to realize the
practical connection between programming and the lambda
calculus was John McCarthy, who created Lisp in 1958.

During the 1960s, computer scientists began to recognise and
study the importance of the lambda calculus. Peter Landin and
Christopher Strachey developed ideas about the foundations of
programming languages: how to reason about what they do
(operational semantics) and how to understand what they mean
(denotational semantics).

In the early 1970s, Robin Milner created a more rigorous 
functional programming language named ML. While ML was
developed to help with automated proofs of mathematical
theorems, it gained a following for more general computing
tasks.

The 1970s saw the emergence of lazy evaluation as a novel
strategy. David Turner developed SASL and KRC, while Rod
Burstall and John Darlington developed NPL and Hope. NPL, KRC
and ML influenced the development of several more languages in
the 1980s, including Lazy ML, Clean, and Miranda.

.. container:: sect2

   .. rubric:: Early antiquity
      :name: id573451
      :class: title

By the late 1980s, the efforts of researchers working on lazy
functional languages were scattered across more than a dozen
languages. Concerned by this diffusion of effort, a number of
researchers decided to form a committee to design a common
language. After three years of work, the committee published
the Haskell 1.0 specification in 1990. It named the language
after Haskell Curry, an influential logician.

Many people are rightfully suspicious of “design by committee”,
but the work of the Haskell committee is a beautiful example of
the best work a committee can do. They produced an elegant,
considered language design, and succeeded in unifying the
fractured efforts of their research community. Of the thicket
of lazy functional languages that existed in 1990, only Haskell
is still actively used.

Since its publication in 1990, the Haskell language standard
has seen five revisions, most recently in 1998. A number of
Haskell implementations have been written, and several are
still actively developed.

During the 1990s, Haskell served two main purposes. On one
side, it gave language researchers a stable language in which
to experiment with making lazy functional programs run
efficiently. Other researchers explored how to construct
programs using lazy functional techniques. Still others used it
as a teaching language.

.. container:: sect2

   .. rubric:: The modern era
      :name: id573493
      :class: title

While these basic explorations of the 1990s proceeded, Haskell
remained firmly an academic affair. The informal slogan of
those inside the community was to “avoid success at all costs”.
Few outsiders had heard of the language at all. Indeed,
functional programming as a field was quite obscure.

During this time, the mainstream programming world experimented
with relatively small tweaks: from programming in C, to C++, to
Java. Meanwhile, on the fringes, programmers were beginning to
tinker with new, more dynamic languages. Guido van Rossum
designed Python; Larry Wall created Perl; and Yukihiro
Matsumoto developed Ruby.

As these newer languages began to seep into wider use, they
spread some crucial ideas. The first was that programmers are
not merely capable of working in expressive languages; in fact,
they flourish. The second was in part a byproduct of the rapid
growth in raw computing power of that era: it's often smart to
sacrifice some execution performance in exchange for a big
increase in programmer productivity. Finally, several of these
languages borrowed from functional programming.

Over the past half a decade, Haskell has successfully escaped
from academia, buoyed in part by the visibility of Python,
Ruby, and even Javascript. The language now has a vibrant and
fast-growing culture of open source and commercial users, and
researchers continue to use it to push the boundaries of
performance and expressiveness.

As you work with Haskell, you're sure to have questions and want
more information about things. Here are some Internet resources
where you can look up information and interact with other Haskell
programmers.

.. container:: sect2

   .. rubric:: Reference material
      :name: whyfp.resources.reference
      :class: title

.. container:: itemizedlist

   -  `The Haskell Hierarchical Libraries reference <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/index.html>`__
      provides the documentation for the standard library that
      comes with your compiler. This is one of the most
      valuable online assets for Haskell programmers.

   -  For questions about language syntax and features, the
      `Haskell 98 Report <http://haskell.org/onlinereport/>`__
      describes the Haskell 98 language standard.

   -  Various extensions to the language have become
      commonplace since the Haskell 98 Report was released. The
      `GHC Users's Guide <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/index.html>`__
      contains detailed documentation on the extensions
      supported by GHC, as well as some GHC-specific features.

   -  `Hoogle <http://haskell.org/hoogle/>`__ and
      `Hayoo <http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html>`__
      are Haskell API search engines. They can search for
      functions by name or by type.

If you're looking for a Haskell library to use for a particular
task, or an application written in Haskell, check out the
following resources.

.. container:: itemizedlist

   -  The Haskell community maintains a central repository of
      open source Haskell libraries and applications. It's
      called `Hackage <http://hackage.haskell.org/>`__, and it
      lets you search for software to download, or browse its
      collection by category.

   -  The `Haskell Wiki <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Applications_and_libraries>`__
      contains a section dedicated to information about
      particular Haskell libraries.

.. container:: sect2

   .. rubric:: The Haskell community
      :name: whyfp.resources.community

Haskell programmers, to ask questions, learn what other people
are talking about, and simply do some social networking with
your peers.

.. container:: itemizedlist

   -  The first stop on your search for community resources
      should be the `Haskell web site <http://www.haskell.org/>`__. 
      This page contains the most current links to various communities and
      information, as well as a huge and actively maintained
      wiki.

   -  Haskellers use a number of 
      `mailing lists <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Mailing_lists>`__
      for topical discussions. Of these, the most generally
      interesting is named ``haskell-cafe``. It has a relaxed,
      friendly atmosphere, where professionals and academics
      rub shoulders with casual hackers and beginners.

   -  For real-time chat, the 
      `Haskell IRC channel <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel>`__,
      named ``#haskell``, is large and lively. Like
      ``haskell-cafe``, the atmosphere stays friendly and
      helpful in spite of the huge number of concurrent users.

   -  There are many local user groups, meetups, academic
      workshops, and the like; here is a list of the known 
      `user groups and workshops <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/User_groups>`__.

   -  The `Haskell Weekly News <http://sequence.complete.org/>`__ is a
      very-nearly-weekly summary of activities in the Haskell
      community. You can find pointers to interesting mailing
      list discussions, new software releases, and the like.

   -  The `Haskell Communities and Activities Report <http://haskell.org/communities/>`__ 
      collects information about people that use Haskell, and what they
      are doing with it. It has been running for years, so it
      provides a good way to peer into Haskell's past.

I had a great deal of fun working with John and Don. Their
independence, good nature, and formidable talent made the
writing process remarkably smooth.

Simon Peyton Jones took a chance on a college student who
emailed him out of the blue in early 1994. Interning for him
over that summer remains a highlight of my professional life.
With his generosity, boundless energy, and drive to
collaborate, he inspires the whole Haskell community.

My children, Cian and Ruairi, always stood ready to help me to
unwind with wonderful, madcap little-boy games.

Finally, of course, I owe a great debt to my wife, Shannon, for
her love, wisdom, and support during the long gestation of this
book.

project. The depth of their Haskell knowledge and experience is
amazing. I enjoyed finally being able to have the three of us
sit down in the same room -- over a year after we started
writing.

My 2-year-old Jacob, who decided that it would be fun to use a
keyboard too, and is always eager to have me take a break from
the computer and help him make some fun typing noises on a
50-year-old Underwood typewriter.

Most importantly, I wouldn't have ever been involved in this
project without the love, support, and encouragement from my
wife, Terah.

   As you read the early chapters of this book, keep in mind that we
   will sometimes introduce ideas in restricted, simplified form.
   Haskell is a deep language, and presenting every aspect of a given
   subject all at once is likely to prove overwhelming. As we build a
   solid foundation in Haskell, we will expand upon these initial
   explanations.

Your Haskell environment
------------------------


      Haskell is a language with many implementations, of which two are
      in wide use. Hugs is an interpreter that is primarily used for
      teaching. For real applications, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
      (GHC) is much more popular. Compared to Hugs, GHC is more suited
      to “real work”: it compiles to native code, supports parallel
      execution, and provides useful performance analysis and debugging
      tools. For these reasons, GHC is the Haskell implementation that
      we will be using throughout this book.

      GHC has three main components.

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  **ghc** is an optimizing compiler that generates fast native code.

         -  **ghci** is an interactive interpreter and debugger.

         -  **runghc** is a program for running Haskell programs as
            scripts, without needing to compile them first.

      .. Note:: How we refer to the components of GHC

         When we discuss the GHC system as a whole, we will
         refer to it as GHC. If we are talking about a specific
         command, we will mention **ghc**, **ghci**, or
         **runghc** by name.

      In this book, we assume that you're using at least version 6.8.2
      of GHC, which was released in 2007. Many of our examples will work
      unmodified with older versions. However, we *recommend* using the
      newest version available for your platform. If you're using
      Windows or Mac OS X, you can get started easily and quickly using
      a prebuilt installer. To obtain a copy of GHC for these platforms,
      visit `the GHC download page <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html>`__, 
      and look for the list of binary packages and installers.

      Many Linux distributors, and providers of BSD and other Unix
      variants, make custom binary packages of GHC available. Because
      these are built specifically for each environment, they are much
      easier to install and use than the generic binary packages that
      are available from the GHC download page. You can find a list of
      distributions that custom-build GHC at the GHC 
      `distribution packages <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/distribution_packages.html>`__
      page.

      For more detailed information about how to install GHC on a
      variety of popular platforms, we've provided some instructions in
      `Appendix A, Installing GHC and Haskell libraries <installing-ghc-and-haskell-libraries.html>`__.

                  :name: starting.ghci
                  :class: title

Getting started with ghci, the interpreter
------------------------------------------


      The interactive interpreter for GHC is a program named **ghci**.
      It lets us enter and evaluate Haskell expressions, explore
      modules, and debug our code. If you are familiar with Python or
      Ruby, **ghci** is somewhat similar to ``python`` and ``irb``, the
      interactive Python and Ruby interpreters.

      .. Note:: The ghci command has a narrow focus

         We typically cannot copy some code out of a Haskell
         source file and paste it into **ghci**. This does not
         have a significant effect on debugging pieces of code,
         but it can initially be surprising if you are used to,
         say, the interactive Python interpreter.

      On Unix-like systems, we run **ghci** as a command in a shell
      window. On Windows, it's available via the Start Menu. For
      example, if you installed using the GHC installer on Windows XP,
      you should go to “All Programs”, then “GHC”; you will then see
      **ghci** in the list. (See the section called `“Windows” <installing-ghc-and-haskell-libraries.html#install.win>`__
      for a screenshot.)

      When we run **ghci**, it displays a startup banner, followed by a
      ``Prelude>`` prompt. Here, we're showing version 6.8.3 on a Linux
      box.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         $ ghci
         GHCi, version 6.8.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
         Loading package base ... linking ... done.
         Prelude>

      The word ``Prelude`` in the prompt indicates that ``Prelude``, a
      standard library of useful functions, is loaded and ready to use.
      When we load other modules or source files, they will show up in
      the prompt, too.

      .. Tip:: Getting help
         :class: tip

         If you enter ``:?`` at the **ghci** prompt, it will
          print a long help message.

      The ``Prelude`` module is sometimes referred to as “the standard
      prelude”, because its contents are defined by the Haskell 98
      standard. Usually, it's simply shortened to “the prelude”.

      .. Note:: About the ghci prompt

         The prompt displayed by **ghci** changes frequently
         depending on what modules we have loaded. It can often
         grow long enough to leave little visual room on a
         single line for our input.

         For brevity and consistency, we have replaced
         **ghci**'s default prompts throughout this book with
         the prompt string ``ghci>``.

         If you want to do this youself, use **ghci**'s
         ``:set prompt`` directive, as follows.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            Prelude> :set prompt "ghci> "
            ghci>

      The prelude is always implicitly available; we don't need to take
      any actions to use the types, values, or functions it defines. To
      use definitions from other modules, we must load them into
      **ghci**, using the **:module** command.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :module + Data.Ratio

      We can now use the functionality of the ``Data.Ratio`` module,
      which lets us work with rational numbers (fractions).

Basic interaction: using ghci as a calculator
---------------------------------------------


      In addition to providing a convenient interface for testing code
      fragments, **ghci** can function as a readily accessible desktop
      calculator. We can easily express any calculator operation in
      **ghci** and, as an added bonus, we can add more complex
      operations as we become more familiar with Haskell. Even using the
      interpreter in this simple way can help us to become more
      comfortable with how Haskell works.

                     :class: title

Simple arithmetic
-----------------


         We can immediately start entering expressions, to see what
         **ghci** will do with them. Basic arithmetic works similarly to
         languages like C and Python: we write expressions in *infix*
         form, where an operator appears between its operands.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 2 + 2
            4
            ghci> 31337 * 101
            3165037
            ghci> 7.0 / 2.0
            3.5

         The infix style of writing an expression is just a convenience:
         we can also write an expression in *prefix* form, where the
         operator precedes its arguments. To do this, we must enclose
         the operator in parentheses.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 2 + 2
            4
            ghci> (+) 2 2
            4

         As the expressions above imply, Haskell has a notion of
         integers and floating point numbers. Integers can be
         arbitrarily large. Here, ``(^)`` provides integer
         exponentiation.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 313 ^ 15

                     :name: starting.calc.neg
                     :class: title

An arithmetic quirk: writing negative numbers
---------------------------------------------


         Haskell presents us with one peculiarity in how we must write
         numbers: it's often necessary to enclose a negative number in
         parentheses. This affects us as soon as we move beyond the
         simplest expressions.

         We'll start by writing a negative number.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> -3
            -3

         The ``-`` above is a unary operator. In other words, we didn't
         write the single number “-3”; we wrote the number “3”, and
         applied the operator ``-`` to it. The ``-`` operator is
         Haskell's only unary operator, and we cannot mix it with infix
         operators.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 2 + -3

            <interactive>:1:0:
                precedence parsing error
                    cannot mix `(+)' [infixl 6] and prefix `-' [infixl 6] in the same infix expression

         If we want to use the unary minus near an infix operator, we
         must wrap the expression it applies to in parentheses.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 2 + (-3)
            -1
            ghci> 3 + (-(13 * 37))
            -478

         This avoids a parsing ambiguity. When we apply a function in
         Haskell, we write the name of the function, followed by its
         argument, for example ``f 3``. If we did not need to wrap a
         negative number in parentheses, we would have two profoundly
         different ways to read ``f-3``: it could be either “apply the
         function ``f`` to the number ``-3``”, or “subtract the number
         ``3`` from the variable ``f``”.

         *Most* of the time, we can omit white space (“blank” characters
         such as space and tab) from expressions, and Haskell will parse
         them as we intended. But not always. Here is an expression that
         works:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 2*3
            6

         And here is one that seems similar to the problematic negative
         number example above, but results in a different error message.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 2*-3

            <interactive>:1:1: Not in scope: `*-'

         Here, the Haskell implementation is reading ``*-`` as a single
         operator. Haskell lets us define new operators (a subject that
         we will return to later), but we haven't defined ``*-``. Once
         again, a few parentheses get us and **ghci** looking at the
         expression in the same way.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 2*(-3)
            -6

         Compared to other languages, this unusual treatment of negative
         numbers might seem annoying, but it represents a reasoned
         trade-off. Haskell lets us define new operators at any time.
         This is not some kind of esoteric language feature; we will see
         quite a few user-defined operators in the chapters ahead. The
         language designers chose to accept a slightly cumbersome syntax
         for negative numbers in exchange for this expressive power.

                     :name: starting.calc.comparison
                     :class: title

Boolean logic, operators, and value comparisons
-----------------------------------------------


         The values of Boolean logic in Haskell are ``True`` and
         ``False``. The capitalization of these names is important. The
         language uses C-influenced operators for working with Boolean
         values: ``(&&)`` is logical “and”, and ``(||)`` is logical
         “or”.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> True && False
            False
            ghci> False || True
            True

         While some programming languages treat the number zero as
         synonymous with ``False``, Haskell does not, nor does it
         consider a non-zero value to be ``True``.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> True && 1

            <interactive>:1:8:
                No instance for (Num Bool)
                  arising from the literal `1' at <interactive>:1:8
                Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num Bool)
                In the second argument of `(&&)', namely `1'
                In the expression: True && 1
                In the definition of `it': it = True && 1

         Once again, we are faced with a substantial-looking error
         message. In brief, it tells us that the Boolean type, Bool, is
         not a member of the family of numeric types, ``Num``. The error
         message is rather long because **ghci** is pointing out the
         location of the problem, and hinting at a possible change we
         could make that might fix the problem.

         Here is a more detailed breakdown of the error message.

         .. container:: itemizedlist

            -  “ ``No instance for (Num Bool)`` ” tells us that
               **ghci** is trying to treat the numeric value 1 as having
               a Bool type, but it cannot.

            -  “ :literal:`arising from the literal \`1'` ” indicates
               that it was our use of the number ``1`` that caused the
               problem.

            -  “ :literal:`In the definition of \`it'` ” refers to a
               **ghci** short cut that we will revisit in a few pages.

         .. Tip:: Remain fearless in the face of error messages
            :class: tip

            We have an important point to make here, which we
            will repeat throughout the early sections of this
            book. If you run into problems or error messages
            that you do not yet understand, *don't panic*.
            Early on, all you have to do is figure out enough
            to make progress on a problem. As you acquire
            experience, you will find it easier to understand
            parts of error messages that initially seem
            obscure.

            The numerous error messages have a purpose: they
            actually help us in writing correct code, by making
            us perform some amount of debugging “up front”,
            before we ever run a program. If you are coming
            from a background of working with more permissive
            languages, this way of working may come as
            something of a shock. Bear with us.

         Most of Haskell's comparison operators are similar to those
         used in C and the many languages it has influenced.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 1 == 1
            True
            ghci> 2 < 3
            True
            ghci> 4 >= 3.99
            True

         One operator that differs from its C counterpart is “is not
         equal to”. In C, this is written as ``!=``. In Haskell, we
         write ``(/=)``, which resembles the ≠ notation used in
         mathematics.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 2 /= 3
            True

         Also, where C-like languages often use ``!`` for logical
         negation, Haskell uses the ``not`` function.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> not True
            False

                  .. rubric:: Operator precedence and associativity
                     :name: starting.calc.precedence
                     :class: title

Operator precedence and associativity
-------------------------------------


         Like written algebra and other programming languages that use
         infix operators, Haskell has a notion of operator precedence.
         We can use parentheses to explicitly group parts of an
         expression, and precedence allows us to omit a few parentheses.
         For example, the multiplication operator has a higher
         precedence than the addition operator, so Haskell treats the
         following two expressions as equivalent.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 1 + (4 * 4)
            17
            ghci> 1 + 4 * 4
            17

         Haskell assigns numeric precedence values to operators, with 1
         being the lowest precedence and 9 the highest. A
         higher-precedence operator is applied before a lower-precedence
         operator. We can use **ghci** to inspect the precedence levels
         of individual operators, using its **:info** command.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :info (+)
            class (Eq a, Show a) => Num a where
              (+) :: a -> a -> a
              ...
                -- Defined in GHC.Num
            infixl 6 +
            ghci> :info (*)
            class (Eq a, Show a) => Num a where
              ...
              (*) :: a -> a -> a
              ...
                -- Defined in GHC.Num
            infixl 7 *

         The information we seek is in the line “ ``infixl 6 +`` ”,
         which indicates that the ``(+)`` operator has a precedence of
         6. (We will explain the other output in a later chapter.) The
         “ ``infixl 7 *`` ” tells us that the ``(*)`` operator has a
         precedence of 7. Since ``(*)`` has a higher precedence than
         ``(+)``, we can now see why ``1 + 4 * 4`` is evaluated as
         ``1 + (4 * 4)``, and not ``(1 + 4) * 4``.

         Haskell also defines *associativity* of operators. This
         determines whether an expression containing multiple uses of an
         operator is evaluated from left to right, or right to left. The
         ``(+)`` and ``(*)`` operators are left associative, which is
         represented as ``infixl`` in the **ghci** output above. A right
         associative operator is displayed with ``infixr``.

         .. code:: haskell

            (^) :: (Num a, Integral b) => a -> b -> a  -- Defined in GHC.Real
            infixr 8 ^

         The combination of precedence and associativity rules are
         usually referred to as *fixity* rules.

                     :class: title

Undefined values, and introducing variables
-------------------------------------------


         Haskell's prelude, the standard library we mentioned earlier,
         defines at least one well-known mathematical constant for us.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> pi
            3.141592653589793

         But its coverage of mathematical constants is not
         comprehensive, as we can quickly see. Let us look for Euler's
         number, ``e``.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> e

            <interactive>:1:0: Not in scope: `e'

         Oh well. We have to define it ourselves.

         .. Note:: Don't worry about the error message

            If the above “not in scope” error message seems a
            little daunting, do not worry. All it means is that
            there is no variable defined with the name ``e``.

         Using **ghci**'s ``let`` construct, we can make a temporary
         definition of ``e`` ourselves.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> let e = exp 1

         This is an application of the exponential function, ``exp``,
         and our first example of applying a function in Haskell. While
         languages like Python require parentheses around the arguments
         to a function, Haskell does not.

         With ``e`` defined, we can now use it in arithmetic
         expressions. The ``(^)`` exponentiation operator that we
         introduced earlier can only raise a number to an integer power.
         To use a floating point number as the exponent, we use the
         ``(**)`` exponentiation operator.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> (e ** pi) - pi
            19.99909997918947

         .. WARNING:: This syntax is ghci-specific

            The syntax for ``let`` that **ghci** accepts is not
            the same as we would use at the “top level” of a
            normal Haskell program. We will see the normal
            syntax in the section called `“Introducing local variables” <#deftypes.locals>`__.

                     :class: title

Dealing with precedence and associativity rules
-----------------------------------------------


         It is sometimes better to leave at least some parentheses in
         place, even when Haskell allows us to omit them. Their presence
         can help future readers (including ourselves) to understand
         what we intended.

         Even more importantly, complex expressions that rely completely
         on operator precedence are notorious sources of bugs. A
         compiler and a human can easily end up with different notions
         of what even a short, parenthesis-free expression is supposed
         to do.

         There is no need to remember all of the precedence and
         associativity rules numbers: it is simpler to add parentheses
         if you are unsure.

Command line editing in ghci
----------------------------


      On most systems, **ghci** has some amount of command line editing
      ability. In case you are not familiar with command line editing,
      it's a huge time saver. The basics are common to both Unix-like
      and Windows systems. Pressing the **up** arrow key on your
      keyboard recalls the last line of input you entered; pressing
      **up** repeatedly cycles through earlier lines of input. You can
      use the **left** and **right** arrow keys to move around inside a
      line of input. On Unix (but not Windows, unfortunately), the
      **tab** key completes partially entered identifiers.

      .. Tip:: Where to look for more information
         :class: tip

         We've barely scratched the surface of command line
         editing here. Since you can work more effectively if
         you're more familiar with the capabilities of your
         command line editing system, you might find it useful
         to do some further reading.

         On Unix-like systems, **ghci** uses the 
         `GNU readline library <http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html#Documentation>`__,
         which is powerful and customisable. On Windows,
         **ghci**'s command line editing capabilities are provided by the
         `**doskey** command <http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/doskey.mspx>`__.

                  :name: starting.list
                  :class: title

Lists
-----


      A list is surrounded by square brackets; the elements are
      separated by commas.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> [1, 2, 3]
         [1,2,3]

      .. Note:: Commas are separators, not terminators

         Some languages permit the last element in a list to be
         followed by an optional trailing comma before a
         closing bracket, but Haskell doesn't allow this. If
         you leave in a trailing comma (e.g. ``[1,2,]``),
         you'll get a parse error.

      A list can be of any length. The empty list is written ``[]``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> []
         []
         ghci> ["foo", "bar", "baz", "quux", "fnord", "xyzzy"]
         ["foo","bar","baz","quux","fnord","xyzzy"]

      All elements of a list must be of the same type. Here, we violate
      this rule: our list starts with two Bool values, but ends with a
      string.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> [True, False, "testing"]

         <interactive>:1:14:
             Couldn't match expected type `Bool' against inferred type `[Char]'
               Expected type: Bool
               Inferred type: [Char]
             In the expression: "testing"
             In the expression: [True, False, "testing"]

      Once again, **ghci**'s error message is verbose, but it's simply
      telling us that there is no way to turn the string into a Boolean
      value, so the list expression isn't properly typed.

      If we write a series of elements using *enumeration notation*,
      Haskell will fill in the contents of the list for us.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> [1..10]
         [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

      Here, the ``..`` characters denote an *enumeration*. We can only
      use this notation for types whose elements we can enumerate. It
      makes no sense for text strings, for instance: there is not any
      sensible, general way to enumerate ``["foo".."quux"]``.

      By the way, notice that the above use of range notation gives us a
      *closed interval*; the list contains both endpoints.

      When we write an enumeration, we can optionally specify the size
      of the step to use by providing the first two elements, followed
      by the value at which to stop generating the enumeration.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> [1.0,1.25..2.0]
         [1.0,1.25,1.5,1.75,2.0]
         ghci> [1,4..15]
         [1,4,7,10,13]
         ghci> [10,9..1]
         [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]

      In the latter case above, the list is quite sensibly missing the
      end point of the enumeration, because it isn't an element of the
      series we defined.

      We can omit the end point of an enumeration. If a type doesn't
      have a natural “upper bound”, this will produce values
      indefinitely. For example, if you type ``[1..]`` at the **ghci**
      prompt, you'll have to interrupt or kill **ghci** to stop it from
      printing an infinite succession of ever-larger numbers. If you are
      tempted to do this, type **C** to halt the enumeration. We will
      find later on that infinite lists are often useful in Haskell.

      .. WARNING:: Beware enumerating floating point numbers

         Here's a non-intuitive bit of behaviour.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> [1.0..1.8]
            [1.0,2.0]

         Behind the scenes, to avoid floating point roundoff
         problems, the Haskell implementation enumerates from
         ``1.0`` to ``1.8+0.5``.

         Using enumeration notation over floating point numbers
         can pack more than a few surprises, so if you use it
         at all, be careful. Floating point behavior is quirky
         in all programming languages; there is nothing unique
         to Haskell here.

                     :class: title

Operators on lists
------------------


         There are two ubiquitous operators for working with lists. We
         concatenate two lists using the ``(++)`` operator.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> [3,1,3] ++ [3,7]
            [3,1,3,3,7]
            ghci> [] ++ [False,True] ++ [True]
            [False,True,True]

         More basic is the ``(:)`` operator, which adds an element to
         the front of a list. This is pronounced “cons” (short for
         “construct”).

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 1 : [2,3]
            [1,2,3]
            ghci> 1 : []
            [1]

         You might be tempted to try writing ``[1,2]:3`` to add an
         element to the end of a list, but **ghci** will reject this
         with an error message, because the first argument of ``(:)``
         must be an element, and the second must be a list.

                  :class: title

Strings and characters
----------------------


      If you know a language like Perl or C, you'll find Haskell's
      notations for strings familiar.

      A text string is surrounded by double quotes.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> "This is a string."
         "This is a string."

      As in many languages, we can represent hard-to-see characters by
      “escaping” them. Haskell's escape characters and escaping rules
      follow the widely used conventions established by the C language.
      For example, ``'\n'`` denotes a newline character, and ``'\t'`` is
      a tab character. For complete details, see `Appendix B,
      Characters, strings, and escaping
      rules <characters-strings-and-escaping-rules.html>`__.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> putStrLn "Here's a newline -->\n<-- See?"
         Here's a newline -->
         <-- See?

      The ``putStrLn`` function prints a string.

      Haskell makes a distinction between single characters and text
      strings. A single character is enclosed in single quotes.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> 'a'
         'a'

      In fact, a text string is simply a list of individual characters.
      Here's a painful way to write a short string, which **ghci** gives
      back to us in a more familiar form.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> let a = ['l', 'o', 't', 's', ' ', 'o', 'f', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'k']
         ghci> a
         "lots of work"
         ghci> a == "lots of work"
         True

      The empty string is written ``""``, and is a synonym for ``[]``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> "" == []
         True

      Since a string is a list of characters, we can use the regular
      list operators to construct new strings.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> 'a':"bc"
         "abc"
         ghci> "foo" ++ "bar"
         "foobar"

                  :name: starting.types
                  :class: title

First steps with types
----------------------


      While we've talked a little about types already, our interactions
      with **ghci** have so far been free of much type-related thinking.
      We haven't told **ghci** what types we've been using, and it's
      mostly been willing to accept our input.

      Haskell requires type names to start with an uppercase letter, and
      variable names must start with a lowercase letter. Bear this in
      mind as you read on; it makes it much easier to follow the names.

      The first thing we can do to start exploring the world of types is
      to get **ghci** to tell us more about what it's doing. **ghci**
      has a command, **:set**, that lets us change a few of its default
      behaviours. We can tell it to print more type information as
      follows.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :set +t
         ghci> 'c'
         'c'
         it :: Char
         ghci> "foo"
         "foo"
         it :: [Char]

      What the ``+t`` does is tell **ghci** to print the type of an
      expression after the expression. That cryptic ``it`` in the output
      can be very useful: it's actually the name of a special variable,
      in which **ghci** stores the result of the last expression we
      evaluated. (This isn't a Haskell language feature; it's specific
      to **ghci** alone.) Let's break down the meaning of the last line
      of **ghci** output.

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  It's telling us about the special variable ``it``.

         -  We can read text of the form ``x :: y`` as meaning “the
            expression ``x`` has the type ``y``”.

         -  Here, the expression “it” has the type [Char]. (The name
            String is often used instead of [Char]. It is simply a
            synonym for [Char].)

      .. Tip:: The joy of “it”
         :class: tip

         That ``it`` variable is a handy **ghci** shortcut. It
         lets us use the result of the expression we just
         evaluated in a new expression.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> "foo"
            "foo"
            it :: [Char]
            ghci> it ++ "bar"
            "foobar"
            it :: [Char]

         When evaluating an expression, **ghci** won't change
         the value of ``it`` if the evaluation fails. This lets
         you write potentially bogus expressions with something
         of a safety net.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> it
            "foobar"
            it :: [Char]
            ghci> it ++ 3

            <interactive>:1:6:
                  No instance for (Num [Char])
                  arising from the literal `3' at <interactive>:1:6
                  Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num [Char])
                  In the second argument of `(++)', namely `3'
                  In the expression: it ++ 3
                  In the definition of `it': it = it ++ 3
            ghci> it
            "foobar"
            it :: [Char]
            ghci> it ++ "baz"
            "foobarbaz"
            it :: [Char]

         When we couple ``it`` with liberal use of the arrow
         keys to recall and edit the last expression we typed,
         we gain a decent way to experiment interactively: the
         cost of mistakes is very low. Take advantage of the
         opportunity to make cheap, plentiful mistakes when
         you're exploring the language!

      Here are a few more of Haskell's names for types, from expressions
      of the sort we've already seen.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> 7 ^ 80
         40536215597144386832065866109016673800875222251012083746192454448001
         it :: Integer

      Haskell's integer type is named Integer. The size of an Integer
      value is bounded only by your system's memory capacity.

      Rational numbers don't look quite the same as integers. To
      construct a rational number, we use the ``(%)`` operator. The
      numerator is on the left, the denominator on the right.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :m +Data.Ratio
         ghci> 11 % 29
         11%29
         it :: Ratio Integer

      For convenience, **ghci** lets us abbreviate many commands, so we
      can write **:m** instead of **:module** to load a module.

      Notice *two* words on the right hand side of the ``::`` above. We
      can read this as a “Ratio of Integer”. We might guess that a Ratio
      must have values of type Integer as both numerator and
      denominator. Sure enough, if we try to construct a Ratio where the
      numerator and denominator are of different types, or of the same
      non-integral type, **ghci** complains.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> 3.14 % 8

         <interactive>:1:0:
             Ambiguous type variable `t' in the constraints:
               `Integral t' arising from a use of `%' at <interactive>:1:0-7
               `Fractional t'
                 arising from the literal `3.14' at <interactive>:1:0-3
             Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
         ghci> 1.2 % 3.4

         <interactive>:1:0:
             Ambiguous type variable `t' in the constraints:
               `Integral t' arising from a use of `%' at <interactive>:1:0-8
               `Fractional t'
                 arising from the literal `3.4' at <interactive>:1:6-8
             Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)

      Although it is initially useful to have **``:set +t``** giving us
      type information for every expression we enter, this is a facility
      we will quickly outgrow. After a while, we will often know what
      type we expect an expression to have. We can turn off the extra
      type information at any time, using the **:unset** command.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :unset +t
         ghci> 2
         2

      Even with this facility turned off, we can still get that type
      information easily when we need it, using another **ghci**
      command.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type 'a'
         'a' :: Char
         ghci> "foo"
         "foo"
         ghci> :type it
         it :: [Char]

      The **:type** command will print type information for any
      expression we give it (including ``it``, as we see above). It
      won't actually evaluate the expression; it only checks its type
      and prints that.

      Why are the types reported for these two expressions different?

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> 3 + 2
         5
         ghci> :type it
         it :: Integer
         ghci> :type 3 + 2
         3 + 2 :: (Num t) => t

      Haskell has several numeric types. For example, a literal number
      such as ``1`` could, depending on the context in which it appears,
      be an integer or a floating point value. When we force **ghci** to
      evaluate the expression ``3 + 2``, it has to choose a type so that
      it can print the value, and it defaults to Integer. In the second
      case, we ask **ghci** to print the type of the expression without
      actually evaluating it, so it does not have to be so specific. It
      answers, in effect, “its type is numeric”. We will see more of
      this style of type annotation in `Chapter 6, Using Typeclasses <using-typeclasses.html>`__.

A simple program
----------------


      Let's take a small leap ahead, and write a small program that
      counts the number of lines in its input. Don't expect to
      understand this yet; it's just fun to get our hands dirty. In a
      text editor, enter the following code into a file, and save it as
      ``WC.hs``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         -- file: ch01/WC.hs
         -- lines beginning with "--" are comments.

         main = interact wordCount
             where wordCount input = show (length (lines input)) ++ "\n"

      Find or create a text file; let's call it
      ``quux.txt`` :sup:`[` `1 <#ftn.id577349>`__ :sup:`]`.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         $ cat quux.txt
         Teignmouth, England
         Paris, France
         Ulm, Germany
         Auxerre, France
         Brunswick, Germany
         Beaumont-en-Auge, France
         Ryazan, Russia

      From a shell or command prompt, run the following command.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         $ runghc WC < quux.txt
         7

      We have successfully written a simple program that interacts with
      the real world! In the chapters that follow, we will successively
      fill the gaps in our understanding until we can write programs of
      our own.

Why care about types?
---------------------


      Every expression and function in Haskell has a *type*. For
      example, the value ``True`` has the type Bool, while the value
      ``"foo"`` has the type String. The type of a value indicates that
      it shares certain properties with other values of the same type.
      For example, we can add numbers, and we can concatenate lists;
      these are properties of those types. We say an expression “has
      type ``X``”, or “is of type ``X``”.

      Before we launch into a deeper discussion of Haskell's type
      system, let's talk about why we should care about types at all:
      what are they even *for*? At the lowest level, a computer is
      concerned with bytes, with barely any additional structure. What a
      type system gives us is *abstraction*. A type adds meaning to
      plain bytes: it lets us say “these bytes are text”, “those bytes
      are an airline reservation”, and so on. Usually, a type system
      goes beyond this to prevent us from accidentally mixing types up:
      for example, a type system usually won't let us treat a hotel
      reservation as a car rental receipt.

      The benefit of introducing abstraction is that it lets us forget
      or ignore low-level details. If I know that a value in my program
      is a string, I don't have to know the intimate details of how
      strings are implemented: I can just assume that my string is going
      to behave like all the other strings I've worked with. 

      What makes type systems interesting is that they're not all equal.
      In fact, different type systems are often not even concerned with
      the same kinds of problems. A programming language's type system
      deeply colours the way we think, and write code, in that language.

      Haskell's type system allows us to think at a very abstract level:
      it permits us to write concise, powerful programs.

Haskell's type system
---------------------


      There are three interesting aspects to types in Haskell: they are
      *strong*, they are *static*, and they can be automatically
      *inferred*. Let's talk in more detail about each of these ideas.
      When possible, we'll present similarities between concepts from
      Haskell's type system and related ideas in other languages. We'll
      also touch on the respective strengths and weaknesses of each of
      these properties.

                     :class: title

Strong types
------------


         When we say that Haskell has a *strong* type system, we mean
         that the type system guarantees that a program cannot contain
         certain kinds of errors. These errors come from trying to write
         expressions that don't make sense, such as using an integer as
         a function. For instance, if a function expects to work with
         integers, and we pass it a string, a Haskell compiler will
         reject this.

         We call an expression that obeys a language's type rules *well
         typed*. An expression that disobeys the type rules is *ill
         typed*, and will cause a *type error*.

         Another aspect of Haskell's view of strong typing is that it
         will not automatically coerce values from one type to another.
         (Coercion is also known as casting or conversion.) For example,
         a C compiler will automatically and silently coerce a value of
         type int into a float on our behalf if a function expects a
         parameter of type float, but a Haskell compiler will raise a
         compilation error in a similar situation. We must explicitly
         coerce types by applying coercion functions.

         Strong typing does occasionally make it more difficult to write
         certain kinds of code. For example, a classic way to write
         low-level code in the C language is to be given a byte array,
         and cast it to treat the bytes as if they're really a
         complicated data structure. This is very efficient, since it
         doesn't require us to copy the bytes around. Haskell's type
         system does not allow this sort of coercion. In order to get
         the same structured view of the data, we would need to do some
         copying, which would cost a little in performance.

         The huge benefit of strong typing is that it catches real bugs
         in our code before they can cause problems. For example, in a
         strongly typed language, we can't accidentally use a string
         where an integer is expected.

         .. Note:: Weaker and stronger types

            It is useful to be aware that many language
            communities have their own definitions of a “strong
            type”. Nevertheless, we will speak briefly and in
            broad terms about the notion of strength in type
            systems.

            In academic computer science, the meanings of
            “strong” and “weak” have a narrowly technical
            meaning: strength refers to *how permissive* a type
            system is. A weaker type system treats more
            expressions as valid than a stronger type system.

            For example, in Perl, the expression ``"foo" + 2``
            evaluates to the number 2, but the expression
            ``"13foo" + 2`` evaluates to the number 15. Haskell
            rejects both expressions as invalid, because the
            ``(+)`` operator requires both of its operands to
            be numeric. Because Perl's type system is more
            permissive than Haskell's, we say that it is weaker
            under this narrow technical interpretation.

            The fireworks around type systems have their roots
            in ordinary English, where people attach notions of
            *value* to the words “weak” and “strong”: we
            usually think of strength as better than weakness.
            Many more programmers speak plain English than
            academic jargon, and quite often academics *really
            are* throwing brickbats at whatever type system
            doesn't suit their fancy. The result is often that
            popular Internet pastime, a flame war.

Static types
------------


         Having a *static* type system means that the compiler knows the
         type of every value and expression at compile time, before any
         code is executed. A Haskell compiler or interpreter will detect
         when we try to use expressions whose types don't match, and
         reject our code with an error message before we run it.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> True && "false"

            <interactive>:1:8:
                Couldn't match expected type `Bool' against inferred type `[Char]'
                In the second argument of `(&&)', namely `"false"'
                In the expression: True && "false"
                In the definition of `it': it = True && "false"

         This error message is of a kind we've seen before. The compiler
         has inferred that the type of the expression ``"false"`` is
         [Char]. The ``(&&)`` operator requires each of its operands to
         be of type Bool, and its left operand indeed has this type.
         Since the actual type of ``"false"`` does not match the
         required type, the compiler rejects this expression as ill
         typed.

         Static typing can occasionally make it difficult to write some
         useful kinds of code. In languages like Python, “duck typing”
         is common, where an object acts enough like another to be used
         as a substitute for it :sup:`[` `2 <#ftn.id578004>`__ :sup:`]`. Fortunately,
         Haskell's system of *typeclasses*, which we will cover in
         `Chapter 6, Using Typeclasses <using-typeclasses.html>`__,
         provides almost all of the benefits of dynamic typing, in a
         safe and convenient form. Haskell has some support for
         programming with truly dynamic types, though it is not quite as
         easy as in a language that wholeheartedly embraces the notion.

         Haskell's combination of strong and static typing makes it
         impossible for type errors to occur at runtime. While this
         means that we need to do a little more thinking “up front”, it
         also eliminates many simple errors that can otherwise be
         devilishly hard to find. It's a truism within the Haskell
         community that once code compiles, it's more likely to work
         correctly than in other languages. (Perhaps a more realistic
         way of putting this is that Haskell code often has fewer
         trivial bugs.)

         Programs written in dynamically typed languages require large
         suites of tests to give some assurance that simple type errors
         cannot occur. Test suites cannot offer complete coverage: some
         common tasks, such as refactoring a program to make it more
         modular, can introduce new type errors that a test suite may
         not expose.

         In Haskell, the compiler proves the absence of type errors for
         us: a Haskell program that compiles will not suffer from type
         errors when it runs. Refactoring is usually a matter of moving
         code around, then recompiling and tidying up a few times until
         the compiler gives us the “all clear”.

         A helpful analogy to understand the value of static typing is
         to look at it as putting pieces into a jigsaw puzzle. In
         Haskell, if a piece has the wrong shape, it simply won't fit.
         In a dynamically typed language, all the pieces are 1x1 squares
         and always fit, so you have to constantly examine the resulting
         picture and check (through testing) whether it's correct.

Type inference
--------------


         Finally, a Haskell compiler can automatically deduce the types
         of almost :sup:`[` `3 <#ftn.id578076>`__ :sup:`]` all
         expressions in a program. This process is known as *type
         inference*. Haskell allows us to explicitly declare the type of
         any value, but the presence of type inference means that this
         is almost always optional, not something we are required to do.

                  :class: title

What to expect from the type system
-----------------------------------


      Our exploration of the major capabilities and benefits of
      Haskell's type system will span a number of chapters. Early on,
      you may find Haskell's types to be a chore to deal with.

      For example, instead of simply writing some code and running it to
      see if it works as you might expect in Python or Ruby, you'll
      first need to make sure that your program passes the scrutiny of
      the type checker. Why stick with the learning curve?

      While strong, static typing makes Haskell safe, type inference
      makes it concise. The result is potent: we end up with a language
      that's both safer than popular statically typed languages, and
      often more expressive than dynamically typed languages. This is a
      strong claim to make, and we will back it up with evidence
      throughout the book.

      Fixing type errors may initially feel like more work than if you
      were using a dynamic language. It might help to look at this as
      moving much of your debugging *up front*. The compiler shows you
      many of the logical flaws in your code, instead of leaving you to
      stumble across problems at runtime.

      Furthermore, because Haskell can infer the types of your
      expressions and functions, you gain the benefits of static typing
      *without* the added burden of “finger typing” imposed by less
      powerful statically typed languages. In other languages, the type
      system serves the needs of the compiler. In Haskell, it serves
      *you*. The tradeoff is that you have to learn to work within the
      framework it provides.

      We will introduce new uses of Haskell's types throughout this
      book, to help us to write and test practical code. As a result,
      the complete picture of why the type system is worthwhile will
      emerge gradually. While each step should justify itself, the whole
      will end up greater than the sum of its parts.

                  :class: title

Some common basic types
-----------------------


      In the section called `“First steps with types” <getting-started.html#starting.types>`__, 
      we introduced a
      few types. Here are several more of the most common base types.

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  A Char value represents a Unicode character.

         -  A Bool value represents a value in Boolean logic. The
            possible values of type Bool are ``True`` and ``False``.

         -  The Int type is used for signed, fixed-width integer values.
            The exact range of values representable as Int depends on
            the system's longest “native” integer: on a 32-bit machine,
            an Int is usually 32 bits wide, while on a 64-bit machine,
            it is usually 64 bits wide. The Haskell standard only
            guarantees that an Int is wider than 28 bits. (There exist
            numeric types that are exactly 8, 16, and so on bits wide,
            in signed and unsigned flavours; we'll get to those later.)

         -  An Integer value is a signed integer of unbounded size.
            Integers are not used as often as Ints, because they are
            more expensive both in performance and space consumption. On
            the other hand, Integer computations do not silently
            overflow, so they give more reliably correct answers.

         -  Values of type Double are used for floating point numbers. A
            Double value is typically 64 bits wide, and uses the
            system's native floating point representation. (A narrower
            type, Float, also exists, but its use is discouraged;
            Haskell compiler writers concentrate more on making Double
            efficient, so Float is much slower.)

      We have already briefly seen Haskell's notation for types in 
      the section called `“First steps with types” <getting-started.html#starting.types>`__. 
      When we write a
      type explicitly, we use the notation ``expression ::`` ``MyType``
      to say that ``expression`` has the type MyType. If we omit the
      ``::`` and the type that follows, a Haskell compiler will infer
      the type of the expression.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type 'a'
         'a' :: Char
         ghci> 'a' :: Char
         'a'
         ghci> [1,2,3] :: Int

         <interactive>:1:0:
             Couldn't match expected type `Int' against inferred type `[a]'
             In the expression: [1, 2, 3] :: Int
             In the definition of `it': it = [1, 2, 3] :: Int

      The combination of ``::`` and the type after it is called a *type
      signature*.

                  :class: title

Function application
--------------------


      Now that we've had our fill of data types for a while, let's turn
      our attention to *working* with some of the types we've seen,
      using functions.

      To apply a function in Haskell, we write the name of the function
      followed by its arguments.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> odd 3
         True
         ghci> odd 6
         False

      We don't use parentheses or commas to group or separate the
      arguments to a function; merely writing the name of the function,
      followed by each argument in turn, is enough. As an example, let's
      apply the ``compare`` function, which takes two arguments.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> compare 2 3
         LT
         ghci> compare 3 3
         EQ
         ghci> compare 3 2
         GT

      If you're used to function call syntax in other languages, this
      notation can take a little getting used to, but it's simple and
      uniform.

      Function application has higher precedence than using operators,
      so the following two expressions have the same meaning.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> (compare 2 3) == LT
         True
         ghci> compare 2 3 == LT
         True

      The above parentheses don't do any harm, but they add some visual
      noise. Sometimes, however, we *must* use parentheses to indicate
      how we want a complicated expression to be parsed.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> compare (sqrt 3) (sqrt 6)
         LT

      This applies ``compare`` to the results of applying ``sqrt 3`` and
      ``sqrt 6``, respectively. If we omit the parentheses, it looks
      like we are trying to pass four arguments to ``compare``, instead
      of the two it accepts.

               .. rubric:: Useful composite data types: lists and tuples
                  :name: funcstypes.composite
                  :class: title

Useful composite data types: lists and tuples
---------------------------------------------


      A composite data type is constructed from other types. The most
      common composite data types in Haskell are lists and tuples.

      We've already seen the list type mentioned in 
      the section called `“Strings and characters” <getting-started.html#starting.string>`__, 
      where we found that Haskell represents a text string as a list of Char
      values, and that the type “list of Char” is written [Char].

      The ``head`` function returns the first element of a list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> head [1,2,3,4]
         1
         ghci> head ['a','b','c']
         'a'

      Its counterpart, ``tail``, returns all *but* the head of a list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> tail [1,2,3,4]
         [2,3,4]
         ghci> tail [2,3,4]
         [3,4]
         ghci> tail [True,False]
         [False]
         ghci> tail "list"
         "ist"
         ghci> tail []
         *** Exception: Prelude.tail: empty list

      As you can see, we can apply ``head`` and ``tail`` to lists of
      different types. Applying ``head`` to a [Char] value returns a
      Char value, while applying it to a [Bool] value returns a Bool
      value. The ``head`` function doesn't care what type of list it
      deals with.

      Because the values in a list can have any type, we call the list
      type *polymorphic* :sup:`[` `4 <#ftn.id578737>`__ :sup:`]`.
      When we want to write a polymorphic type, we use a *type
      variable*, which must begin with a lowercase letter. A type
      variable is a placeholder, where eventually we'll substitute a
      real type.

      We can write the type “list of ``a``” by enclosing the type
      variable in square brackets: [a]. This amounts to saying “I don't
      care what type I have; I can make a list with it”.

      .. Note:: Distinguishing type names and type variables

         We can now see why a type name must start with an
         uppercase letter: this makes it distinct from a type
         variable, which must start with a lowercase letter.

      When we talk about a list with values of a specific type, we
      substitute that type for our type variable. So, for example, the
      type [Int] is a list of values of type Int, because we substituted
      Int for ``a``. Similarly, the type [MyPersonalType] is a list of
      values of type MyPersonalType. We can perform this substitution
      recursively, too: [[Int]] is a list of values of type [Int], i.e.
      a list of lists of Int.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type [[True],[False,False]]
         [[True],[False,False]] :: [[Bool]]

      The type of this expression is a list of lists of Bool.

      .. Note:: Lists are special

         Lists are the “bread and butter” of Haskell
         collections. In an imperative language, we might
         perform a task many items by iterating through a loop.
         This is something that we often do in Haskell by
         traversing a list, either by recursing or using a
         function that recurses for us. Lists are the easiest
         stepping stone into the idea that we can use data to
         structure our program and its control flow. We'll be
         spending a lot more time discussing lists in
         `Chapter 4, Functional programming <functional-programming.html>`__.

      A tuple is a fixed-size collection of values, where each value can
      have a different type. This distinguishes them from a list, which
      can have any length, but whose elements must all have the same
      type.

      To help to understand the difference, let's say we want to track
      two pieces of information about a book. It has a year of
      publication, which is a number, and a title, which is a string. We
      can't keep both of these pieces of information in a list, because
      they have different types. Instead, we use a tuple.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> (1964, "Labyrinths")
         (1964,"Labyrinths")

      We write a tuple by enclosing its elements in parentheses and
      separating them with commas. We use the same notation for writing
      its type.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type (True, "hello")
         (True, "hello") :: (Bool, [Char])
         ghci> (4, ['a', 'm'], (16, True))
         (4,"am",(16,True))

      There's a special type, (), that acts as a tuple of zero elements.
      This type has only one value, also written ``()``. Both the type
      and the value are usually pronounced “unit”. If you are familiar
      with C, () is somewhat similar to void.

      Haskell doesn't have a notion of a one-element tuple. Tuples are
      often referred to using the number of elements as a prefix. A
      2-tuple has two elements, and is usually called a *pair*. A
      “3-tuple” (sometimes called a *triple*) has three elements; a
      5-tuple has five; and so on. In practice, working with tuples that
      contain more than a handful of elements makes code unwieldy, so
      tuples of more than a few elements are rarely used.

      A tuple's type represents the number, positions, and types of its
      elements. This means that tuples containing different numbers or
      types of elements have distinct types, as do tuples whose types
      appear in different orders.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type (False, 'a')
         (False, 'a') :: (Bool, Char)
         ghci> :type ('a', False)
         ('a', False) :: (Char, Bool)

      In this example, the expression ``(False, 'a')`` has the type
      (Bool, Char), which is distinct from the type of ``('a', False)``.
      Even though the number of elements and their types are the same,
      these two types are distinct because the positions of the element
      types are different.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type (False, 'a', 'b')
         (False, 'a', 'b') :: (Bool, Char, Char)

      This type, (Bool, Char, Char), is distinct from (Bool, Char)
      because it contains three elements, not two.

      We often use tuples to return multiple values from a function. We
      can also use them any time we need a fixed-size collection of
      values, if the circumstances don't require a custom container
      type.

                  :class: title

Functions over lists and tuples
-------------------------------


      Our discussion of lists and tuples mentioned how we can construct
      them, but little about how we do anything with them afterwards. We
      have only been introduced to two list functions so far, ``head``
      and ``tail``.

      A related pair of list functions, ``take`` and ``drop``, take two
      arguments. Given a number ``n`` and a list, ``take`` returns the
      first ``n`` elements of the list, while ``drop`` returns all *but*
      the first ``n`` elements of the list. (As these functions take two
      arguments, notice that we separate each function and its arguments
      using white space.)

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> take 2 [1,2,3,4,5]
         [1,2]
         ghci> drop 3 [1,2,3,4,5]
         [4,5]

      For tuples, the ``fst`` and ``snd`` functions return the first and
      second element of a pair, respectively.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> fst (1,'a')
         1
         ghci> snd (1,'a')
         'a'

      If your background is in any of a number of other languages, each
      of these may look like an application of a function to two
      arguments. Under Haskell's convention for function application,
      each one is an application of a function to a single pair.

      .. Note:: Haskell tuples aren't immutable lists

         If you are coming from the Python world, you'll
         probably be used to lists and tuples being almost
         interchangeable. Although the elements of a Python
         tuple are immutable, it can be indexed and iterated
         over using the same methods as a list. This isn't the
         case in Haskell, so don't try to carry that idea with
         you into unfamiliar linguistic territory.

         As an illustration, take a look at the type signatures
         of ``fst`` and ``snd``: they're defined *only* for
         pairs, and can't be used with tuples of other sizes.
         Haskell's type system makes it tricky to write a
         generalised “get the second element from any tuple, no
         matter how wide” function.

                     :class: title

Passing an expression to a function
-----------------------------------


         In Haskell, function application is left associative. This is
         best illustrated by example: the expression ``a b c d`` is
         equivalent to ``(((a b) c) d)``. If we want to use one
         expression as an argument to another, we have to use explicit
         parentheses to tell the parser what we really mean. Here's an
         example.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> head (drop 4 "azerty")
            't'

         We can read this as “pass the expression ``drop 4 "azerty"`` as
         the argument to ``head``”. If we were to leave out the
         parentheses, the offending expression would be similar to
         passing three arguments to ``head``. Compilation would fail
         with a type error, as ``head`` requires a single argument, a
         list.

                  :class: title

Function types and purity
-------------------------


      Let's take a look at a function's type.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type lines
         lines :: String -> [String]

      We can read the ``->`` above as “to”, which loosely translates to
      “returns”. The signature as a whole thus reads as “ ``lines`` has
      the type String to list-of-String ”. Let's try applying the
      function.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> lines "the quick\nbrown fox\njumps"
         ["the quick","brown fox","jumps"]

      The ``lines`` function splits a string on line boundaries. Notice
      that its type signature gave us a hint as to what the function
      might actually do: it takes one String, and returns many. This is
      an incredibly valuable property of types in a functional language.

      A *side effect* introduces a dependency between the global state
      of the system and the behaviour of a function. For example, let's
      step away from Haskell for a moment and think about an imperative
      programming language. Consider a function that reads and returns
      the value of a global variable. If some other code can modify that
      global variable, then the result of a particular application of
      our function depends on the current value of the global variable.
      The function has a side effect, even though it never modifies the
      variable itself.

      Side effects are essentially invisible inputs to, or outputs from,
      functions. In Haskell, the default is for functions to *not* have
      side effects: the result of a function depends only on the inputs
      that we explicitly provide. We call these functions *pure*;
      functions with side effects are *impure*.

      If a function has side effects, we can tell by reading its type
      signature: the type of the function's result will begin with IO.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type readFile
         readFile :: FilePath -> IO String

      Haskell's type system prevents us from accidentally mixing pure
      and impure code.

                  :class: title

Haskell source files, and writing simple functions
--------------------------------------------------


      Now that we know how to apply functions, it's time we turned our
      attention to writing them. While we can write functions in
      **ghci**, it's not a good environment for this. It only accepts a
      highly restricted subset of Haskell: most importantly, the syntax
      it uses for defining functions is not the same as we use in a
      Haskell source file :sup:`[` `5 <#ftn.id579534>`__ :sup:`]`.
      Instead, we'll finally break down and create a source file.

      Haskell source files are usually identified with a suffix of
      ``.hs``. Here's a simple function definition: open up a file named
      ``add.hs``, and add these contents to it.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/add.hs
         add a b = a + b

      On the left hand side of the ``=`` is the name of the function,
      followed by the arguments to the function. On the right hand side
      is the body of the function. With our source file saved, we can
      load it into **ghci**, and use our new ``add`` function straight
      away. (The prompt that **ghci** displays will change after you
      load your file.)

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :load add.hs
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( add.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: Main.
         ghci> add 1 2
         3

      .. Note:: What if ghci cannot find your source file?

         When you run **ghci** it may not be able to find your
         source file. It will search for source files in
         whatever directory it was run. If this is not the
         directory that your source file is actually in, you
         can use **ghci**'s ``:cd`` command to change its
         working directory.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :cd /tmp

         Alternatively, you can provide the path to your
         Haskell source file as the argument to ``:load``. This
         path can be either absolute or relative to **ghci**'s
         current directory.

      When we apply ``add`` to the values ``1`` and ``2``, the variables
      ``a`` and ``b`` on the left hand side of our definition are given
      (or “bound to”) the values ``1`` and ``2``, so the result is the
      expression ``1 + 2``.

      Haskell doesn't have a **return** keyword, as a function is a
      single expression, not a sequence of statements. The value of the
      expression is the result of the function. (Haskell does have a
      function called ``return``, but we won't discuss it for a while;
      it has a different meaning than in imperative languages.)

      When you see an ``=`` symbol in Haskell code, it represents
      “meaning”: the name on the left is defined to be the expression on
      the right.

                     :class: title

Just what is a variable, anyway?
--------------------------------


         In Haskell, a variable provides a way to give a name to an
         expression. Once a variable is *bound to* (i.e. associated
         with) a particular expression, its value does not change: we
         can always use the name of the variable instead of writing out
         the expression, and get the same result either way.

         If you're used to imperative programming languages, you're
         likely to think of a variable as a way of identifying a *memory
         location* (or some equivalent) that can hold different values
         at different times. In an imperative language we can change a
         variable's value at any time, so that examining the memory
         location repeatedly can potentially give different results each
         time.

         The critical difference between these two notions of a variable
         is that in Haskell, once we've bound a variable to an
         expression, we know that we can always substitute it for that
         expression, because it will not change. In an imperative
         language, this notion of substitutability does not hold.

         For example, if we run the following tiny Python script, it
         will print the number 11.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            x = 10
            x = 11
            # value of x is now 11
            print x

         In contrast, trying the equivalent in Haskell results in an
         error.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch02/Assign.hs
            x = 10
            x = 11

         We cannot assign a value to ``x`` twice.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :load Assign

                     :class: title

Conditional evaluation
----------------------


         Like many other languages, Haskell has an ``if`` expression.
         Let's see it in action, then we'll explain what's going on. As
         an example, we'll write our own version of the standard
         ``drop`` function. Before we begin, let's probe a little into
         how ``drop`` behaves, so we can replicate its behaviour.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> drop 2 "foobar"
            "obar"
            ghci> drop 4 "foobar"
            "ar"
            ghci> drop 4 [1,2]
            []
            ghci> drop 0 [1,2]
            [1,2]
            ghci> drop 7 []
            []
            ghci> drop (-2) "foo"
            "foo"

         From the above, it seems that ``drop`` returns the original
         list if the number to remove is less than or equal to zero.
         Otherwise, it removes elements until either it runs out or
         reaches the given number. Here's a ``myDrop`` function that has
         the same behaviour, and uses Haskell's ``if`` expression to
         decide what to do. The ``null`` function below checks whether a
         list is empty.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch02/myDrop.hs
            myDrop n xs = if n <= 0 || null xs
                          then xs
                          else myDrop (n - 1) (tail xs)

         In Haskell, indentation is important: it *continues* an
         existing definition, instead of starting a new one. Don't omit
         the indentation!

         You might wonder where the variable name ``xs`` comes from in
         the Haskell function. This is a common naming pattern for
         lists: you can read the ``s`` as a suffix, so the name is
         essentially “plural of ``x``”.

         Let's save our Haskell function in a file named ``myDrop.hs``,
         then load it into **ghci**.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :load myDrop.hs
            [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( myDrop.hs, interpreted )
            Ok, modules loaded: Main.
            ghci> myDrop 2 "foobar"
            "obar"
            ghci> myDrop 4 "foobar"
            "ar"
            ghci> myDrop 4 [1,2]
            []
            ghci> myDrop 0 [1,2]
            [1,2]
            ghci> myDrop 7 []
            []
            ghci> myDrop (-2) "foo"
            "foo"

         Now that we've seen ``myDrop`` in action, let's return to the
         source code and look at all the novelties we've introduced.

         First of all, we have introduced ``--``, the beginning of a
         single-line comment. This comment extends to the end of the
         line.

         Next is the ``if`` keyword itself. It introduces an expression
         that has three components.

         .. container:: itemizedlist

            -  An expression of type Bool, immediately following the
               ``if``. We refer to this as a *predicate*.

            -  A ``then`` keyword, followed by another expression. This
               expression will be used as the value of the ``if``
               expression if the predicate evaluates to ``True``.

            -  An ``else`` keyword, followed by another expression. This
               expression will be used as the value of the ``if``
               expression if the predicate evaluates to ``False``.

         We'll refer to the expressions after the ``then`` and ``else``
         keywords as “branches”. The branches must have the same types;
         the ``if`` expression will also have this type. An expression
         such as ``if True then 1 else "foo"`` has different types for
         its branches, so it is ill typed and will be rejected by a
         compiler or interpreter.

         Recall that Haskell is an expression-oriented language. In an
         imperative language, it can make sense to omit the ``else``
         branch from an ``if``, because we're working with *statements*,
         not expressions. However, when we're working with expressions,
         an ``if`` that was missing an ``else`` wouldn't have a result
         or type if the predicate evaluated to ``False``, so it would be
         nonsensical.

         Our predicate contains a few more novelties. The ``null``
         function indicates whether a list is empty, while the ``(||)``
         operator performs a logical “or” of its Bool-typed arguments.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type null
            null :: [a] -> Bool
            ghci> :type (||)
            (||) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool

         .. Tip:: Operators are not special
            :class: tip

            Notice that we were able to find the type of
            ``(||)`` by wrapping it in parentheses. The
            ``(||)`` operator isn't “built into” the language:
            it's an ordinary function.

            The ``(||)`` operator “short circuits”: if its left
            operand evaluates to ``True``, it doesn't evaluate
            its right operand. In most languages, short-circuit
            evaluation requires special support, but not in
            Haskell. We'll see why shortly.

         Next, our function applies itself recursively. This is our
         first example of recursion, which we'll talk about in some
         detail shortly.

         Finally, our ``if`` expression spans several lines. We align
         the ``then`` and ``else`` branches under the ``if`` for
         neatness. So long as we use some indentation, the exact amount
         is not important. If we wish, we can write the entire
         expression on a single line.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch02/myDrop.hs
            myDropX n xs = if n <= 0 || null xs then xs else myDropX (n - 1) (tail xs)

         The length of this version makes it more difficult to read. We
         will usually break an ``if`` expression across several lines to
         keep the predicate and each of the branches easier to follow.

         For comparison, here is a Python equivalent of the Haskell
         ``myDrop``. The two are structured similarly: each decrements a
         counter while removing an element from the head of the list.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            def myDrop(n, elts):
                while n > 0 and elts:
                    n = n - 1
                    elts = elts[1:]
                return elts

Understanding evaluation by example
-----------------------------------


      In our description of ``myDrop``, we have so far focused on
      surface features. We need to go deeper, and develop a useful
      mental model of how function application works. To do this, we'll
      first work through a few simple examples, until we can walk
      through the evaluation of the expression ``myDrop 2 "abcd"``.

      We've talked several times about substituting an expression for a
      variable, and we'll make use of this capability here. Our
      procedure will involve rewriting expressions over and over,
      substituting expressions for variables until we reach a final
      result. This would be a good time to fetch a pencil and paper, so
      that you can follow our descriptions by trying them yourself.

Lazy evaluation
---------------


         We will begin by looking at the definition of a simple,
         nonrecursive function.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch02/RoundToEven.hs
            isOdd n = mod n 2 == 1

         Here, ``mod`` is the standard modulo function. The first big
         step to understanding how evaluation works in Haskell is
         figuring out what the result of evaluating the expression
         ``isOdd (1 + 2)`` is.

         Before we explain how evaluation proceeds in Haskell, let us
         recap the sort of evaluation strategy used by more familiar
         languages. First, evaluate the subexpression ``1 + 2``, to give
         ``3``. Then apply the ``odd`` function with ``n`` bound to
         ``3``. Finally, evaluate ``mod 3 2`` to give ``1``, and
         ``1 == 1`` to give ``True``.

         In a language that uses *strict* evaluation, the arguments to a
         function are evaluated before the function is applied. Haskell
         chooses another path: *non-strict* evaluation.

         In Haskell, the subexpression ``1 + 2`` is *not* reduced to the
         value ``3``. Instead, we create a “promise” that when the value
         of the expression ``isOdd (1 + 2)`` is needed, we'll be able to
         compute it. The record that we use to track an unevaluated
         expression is referred to as a *thunk*. This is *all* that
         happens: we create a thunk, and defer the actual evaluation
         until it's really needed. If the result of this expression is
         never subsequently used, we will not compute its value at all.

         Non-strict evaluation is often referred to as *lazy
         evaluation* :sup:`[` `6 <#ftn.id580576>`__ :sup:`]`.

A more involved example
-----------------------


         Let us now look at the evaluation of the expression
         ``myDrop 2 "abcd"``, where we use ``print`` to ensure that it
         will be evaluated.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> print (myDrop 2 "abcd")
            "cd"

         Our first step is to attempt to apply ``print``, which needs
         its argument to be evaluated. To do that, we apply the function
         ``myDrop`` to the values ``2`` and ``"abcd"``. We bind the
         variable ``n`` to the value ``2``, and ``xs`` to ``"abcd"``. If
         we substitute these values into ``myDrop``'s predicate, we get
         the following expression.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type  2 <= 0 || null "abcd"
            2 <= 0 || null "abcd" :: Bool

         We then evaluate enough of the predicate to find out what its
         value is. This requires that we evaluate the ``(||)``
         expression. To determine its value, the ``(||)`` operator needs
         to examine the value of its left operand first.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> 2 <= 0
            False

         Substituting that value into the ``(||)`` expression leads to
         the following expression.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type  False || null "abcd"
            False || null "abcd" :: Bool

         If the left operand had evaluated to ``True``, ``(||)`` would
         not need to evaluate its right operand, since it could not
         affect the result of the expression. Since it evaluates to
         ``False``, ``(||)`` must evaluate the right operand.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> null "abcd"
            False

         We now substitute this value back into the ``(||)`` expression.
         Since both operands evaluate to ``False``, the ``(||)``
         expression does too, and thus the predicate evaluates to
         ``False``.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> False || False
            False

         This causes the ``if`` expression's ``else`` branch to be
         evaluated. This branch contains a recursive application of
         ``myDrop``.

         .. Note:: Short circuiting for free

            Many languages need to treat the logical-or operator
            specially so that it short circuits if its left
            operand evaluates to ``True``. In Haskell, ``(||)``
            is an ordinary function: non-strict evaluation
            builds this capability into the language.

            In Haskell, we can easily define a new function
            that short circuits.

            .. code:: haskell
               :class: programlisting

               -- file: ch02/shortCircuit.hs
               newOr a b = if a then a else b

            If we write an expression like
            ``newOr True (length [1..] > 0)``, it will not
            evaluate its second argument. (This is just as
            well: that expression tries to compute the length
            of an infinite list. If it were evaluated, it would
            hang **ghci**, looping infinitely until we killed
            it.)

            Were we to write a comparable function in, say,
            Python, strict evaluation would bite us: both
            arguments would be evaluated before being passed to
            ``newOr``, and we would not be able to avoid the
            infinite loop on the second argument.

                     :class: title

Recursion
---------


         When we apply ``myDrop`` recursively, ``n`` is bound to the
         thunk ``2 - 1``, and ``xs`` to ``tail "abcd"``.

         We're now evaluating ``myDrop`` from the beginning again. We
         substitute the new values of ``n`` and ``xs`` into the
         predicate.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type (2 - 1) <= 0 || null (tail "abcd")
            (2 - 1) <= 0 || null (tail "abcd") :: Bool

         Here's a condensed version of the evaluation of the left
         operand.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type (2 - 1) <= 0
            (2 - 1) <= 0 :: Bool
            ghci> 2 - 1
            1
            ghci> 1 <= 0
            False

         As we should now expect, we didn't evaluate the expression
         ``2 - 1`` until we needed its value. We also evaluate the right
         operand lazily, deferring ``tail "abcd"`` until we need its
         value.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type null (tail "abcd")
            null (tail "abcd") :: Bool
            ghci> tail "abcd"
            "bcd"
            ghci> null "bcd"
            False

         The predicate again evaluates to ``False``, causing the
         ``else`` branch to be evaluated once more.

         Because we've had to evaluate the expressions for ``n`` and
         ``xs`` to evaluate the predicate, we now know that in this
         application of ``myDrop``, ``n`` has the value ``1`` and ``xs``
         has the value ``"bcd"``.

                     :name: id581112
                     :class: title

Ending the recursion
--------------------


         In the next recursive application of ``myDrop``, we bind ``n``
         to ``1 - 1`` and ``xs`` to ``tail "bcd"``.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type (1 - 1) <= 0 || null (tail "bcd")
            (1 - 1) <= 0 || null (tail "bcd") :: Bool

         Once again, ``(||)`` needs to evaluate its left operand first.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type (1 - 1) <= 0
            (1 - 1) <= 0 :: Bool
            ghci> 1 - 1
            0
            ghci> 0 <= 0
            True

         Finally, this expression has evaluated to ``True``!

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> True || null (tail "bcd")
            True

         Because the right operand cannot affect the result of ``(||)``,
         it is not evaluated, and the result of the predicate is
         ``True``. This causes us to evaluate the ``then`` branch.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type tail "bcd"
            tail "bcd" :: [Char]

                     :class: title

Returning from the recursion
----------------------------


         Remember, we're now inside our second recursive application of
         ``myDrop``. This application evaluates to ``tail "bcd"``. We
         return from the application of the function, substituting this
         expression for ``myDrop (1 - 1) (tail "bcd")``, to become the
         result of this application.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> myDrop (1 - 1) (tail "bcd") == tail "bcd"
            True

         We then return from the first recursive application,
         substituting the result of the second recursive application for
         ``myDrop (2 - 1) (tail "abcd")``, to become the result of this
         application.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> myDrop (2 - 1) (tail "abcd") == tail "bcd"
            True

         Finally, we return from our original application, substituting
         the result of the first recursive application.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> myDrop 2 "abcd" == tail "bcd"
            True

         Notice that as we return from each successive recursive
         application, none of them needs to evaluate the expression
         ``tail "bcd"``: the final result of evaluating the original
         expression is a *thunk*. The thunk is only finally evaluated
         when **ghci** needs to print it.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> myDrop 2 "abcd"
            "cd"
            ghci> tail "bcd"
            "cd"

What have we learned?
---------------------


         We have established several important points here.

         .. container:: itemizedlist

            -  It makes sense to use substitution and rewriting to
               understand the evaluation of a Haskell expression.

            -  Laziness leads us to defer evaluation until we need a
               value, and to evaluate just enough of an expression to
               establish its value.

            -  The result of applying a function may be a thunk (a
               deferred expression).

                  :name: funcstypes.polymorphism
                  :class: title

Polymorphism in Haskell
-----------------------


      When we introduced lists, we mentioned that the list type is
      polymorphic. We'll talk about Haskell's polymorphism in more
      detail here.

      If we want to fetch the last element of a list, we use the
      ``last`` function. The value that it returns must have the same
      type as the elements of the list, but ``last`` operates in the
      same way no matter what type those elements actually are.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> last [1,2,3,4,5]
         5
         ghci> last "baz"
         'z'

      To capture this idea, its type signature contains a *type
      variable*.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type last
         last :: [a] -> a

      Here, ``a`` is the type variable. We can read the signature as
      “takes a list, all of whose elements have some type ``a``, and
      returns a value of the same type ``a``”.

      .. Tip:: Identifying a type variable
         :class: tip

         Type variables always start with a lowercase letter.
         You can always tell a type variable from a normal
         variable by context, because the languages of types
         and functions are separate: type variables live in
         type signatures, and regular variables live in normal
         expressions.

         It's common Haskell practice to keep the names of type
         variables very short. One letter is overwhelmingly
         common; longer names show up infrequently. Type
         signatures are usually brief; we gain more in
         readability by keeping names short than we would by
         making them descriptive.

      When a function has type variables in its signature, indicating
      that some of its arguments can be of any type, we call the
      function polymorphic.

      When we want to apply ``last`` to, say, a list of Char, the
      compiler substitutes Char for each ``a`` throughout the type
      signature, which gives us the type of ``last`` with an input of
      [Char] as [Char] -> Char.

      This kind of polymorphism is called *parametric* polymorphism. The
      choice of naming is easy to understand by analogy: just as a
      function can have parameters that we can later bind to real
      values, a Haskell type can have parameters that we can later bind
      to other types.

      .. Tip:: A little nomenclature
         :class: tip

         If a type contains type parameters, we say that it is a
         parameterised type, or a polymorphic type. If a
         function or value's type contains type parameters, we
         call it polymorphic.

      When we see a parameterised type, we've already noted that the
      code doesn't care what the actual type is. However, we can make a
      stronger statement: *it has no way to find out what the real type
      is*, or to manipulate a value of that type. It can't create a
      value; neither can it inspect one. All it can do is treat it as a
      fully abstract “black box”. We'll cover one reason that this is
      important soon.

      Parametric polymorphism is the most visible kind of polymorphism
      that Haskell supports. Haskell's parametric polymorphism directly
      influenced the design of the generic facilities of the Java and C#
      languages. A parameterised type in Haskell is similar to a type
      variable in Java generics. C++ templates also bear a resemblance
      to parametric polymorphism.

      To make it clearer how Haskell's polymorphism differs from other
      languages, here are a few forms of polymorphism that are common in
      other languages, but not present in Haskell.

      In mainstream object oriented languages, *subtype* polymorphism is
      more widespread than parametric polymorphism. The subclassing
      mechanisms of C++ and Java give them subtype polymorphism. A base
      class defines a set of behaviours that its subclasses can modify
      and extend. Since Haskell isn't an object oriented language, it
      doesn't provide subtype polymorphism.

      Also common is *coercion* polymorphism, which allows a value of
      one type to be implicitly converted into a value of another type.
      Many languages provide some form of coercion polymorphism: one
      example is automatic conversion between integers and floating
      point numbers. Haskell deliberately avoids even this kind of
      simple automatic coercion.

      This is not the whole story of polymorphism in Haskell: we'll
      return to the subject in `Chapter 6, Using
      Typeclasses <using-typeclasses.html>`__.

                     :class: title

Reasoning about polymorphic functions
-------------------------------------


         In the section called `“Function types and
         purity” <#funcstypes.sigs>`__, we
         talked about figuring out the behaviour of a function based on
         its type signature. We can apply the same kind of reasoning to
         polymorphic functions. Let's look again at ``fst``.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type fst
            fst :: (a, b) -> a

         First of all, notice that its argument contains two type
         variables, ``a`` and ``b``, signifying that the elements of the
         tuple can be of different types.

         The result type of ``fst`` is ``a``. We've already mentioned
         that parametric polymorphism makes the real type inaccessible:
         ``fst`` doesn't have enough information to construct a value of
         type ``a``, nor can it turn an ``a`` into a ``b``. So the
         *only* possible valid behaviour (omitting infinite loops or
         crashes) it can have is to return the first element of the
         pair.

Further reading
---------------


            There is a deep mathematical sense in which any
            non-pathological function of type (a,b) -> a must do exactly
            what ``fst`` does. Moreover, this line of reasoning extends
            to more complicated polymorphic functions. The paper
            [`Wadler89 <bibliography.html#bib.wadler89>`__] covers this
            procedure in depth.

            *It's been suggested that we should create a “theory box”
            for discussions of the deep stuff, and references to
            academic papers.*

The type of a function of more than one argument
------------------------------------------------


      So far, we haven't looked much at signatures for functions that
      take more than one argument. We've already used a few such
      functions; let's look at the signature of one, ``take``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type take
         take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]

      It's pretty clear that there's something going on with an Int and
      some lists, but why are there two ``->`` symbols in the signature?
      Haskell groups this chain of arrows from right to left; that is,
      ``->`` is right-associative. If we introduce parentheses, we can
      make it clearer how this type signature is interpreted.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch02/Take.hs
         take :: Int -> ([a] -> [a])

      From this, it looks like we ought to read the type signature as a
      function that takes one argument, an Int, and returns another
      function. That other function also takes one argument, a list, and
      returns a list of the same type as its result.

      This is correct, but it's not easy to see what its consequences
      might be. We'll return to this topic in 
      the section called `“Partial function application and currying” <#fp.partialapp>`__, 
      once we've spent a bit of time writing functions. For now, we can treat
      the type following the last ``->`` as being the function's return
      type, and the preceding types to be those of the function's
      arguments.

      We can now write a type signature for the ``myDrop`` function that
      we defined earlier.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch02/myDrop.hs
         myDrop :: Int -> [a] -> [a]

                  Haskell provides a standard function, last :: [a] -> a, 
                  that returns the last element of a list. From reading the 
                  type alone, what are the possible valid behaviours 
                  (omitting crashes and infinite loops) that this function 
                  could have? What are a few things that this function clearly cannot do?

                  :class: title

Why the fuss over purity?
-------------------------


      Few programming languages go as far as Haskell in insisting that
      purity should be the default. This choice has profound and
      valuable consequences.

      Because the result of applying a pure function can only depend on
      its arguments, we can often get a strong hint of what a pure
      function does by simply reading its name and understanding its
      type signature. As an example, let's look at ``not``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :name: code block id
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type not
         not :: Bool -> Bool

      Even if we didn't know the name of this function, its signature
      alone limits the possible valid behaviours it could have.

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  Ignore its argument, and always return either ``True`` or
            ``False``.

         -  Return its argument unmodified.

         -  Negate its argument.

      We also know that this function can *not* do some things: it
      cannot access files; it cannot talk to the network; it cannot tell
      what time it is.

      Purity makes the job of understanding code easier. The behaviour
      of a pure function does not depend on the value of a global
      variable, or the contents of a database, or the state of a network
      connection. Pure code is inherently modular: every function is
      self-contained, and has a well-defined interface.

      A non-obvious consequence of purity being the default is that
      working with *impure* code becomes easier. Haskell encourages a
      style of programming in which we separate code that *must* have
      side effects from code that doesn't need them. In this style,
      impure code tends to be simple, with the “heavy lifting” performed
      in pure code.

      Much of the risk in software lies in talking to the outside world,
      be it coping with bad or missing data, or handling malicious
      attacks. Because Haskell's type system tells us exactly which
      parts of our code have side effects, we can be appropriately on
      our guard. Because our favoured coding style keeps impure code
      isolated and simple, our “attack surface” is small.

Conclusion
----------


      In this chapter, we've had a whirlwind overview of Haskell's type
      system and much of its syntax. We've read about the most common
      types, and discovered how to write simple functions. We've been
      introduced to polymorphism, conditional expressions, purity, and
      about lazy evaluation.

      This all amounts to a lot of information to absorb. In 
      `Chapter 3, Defining Types, Streamlining Functions <defining-types-streamlining-functions.html>`__, 
      we'll build on this basic knowledge to further enhance our understanding
      of Haskell.

Defining a new data type
------------------------


      Although lists and tuples are useful, we'll often want to
      construct new data types of our own. This allows us to add
      structure to the values in our programs. Instead of using an
      anonymous tuple, we can give a collection of related values a name
      and a distinct type. Defining our own types also improves the type
      safety of our code: Haskell will not allow us to accidentally mix
      values of two types that are structurally similar but have
      different names.

      For motivation, we'll consider a few kinds of data that a small
      online bookstore might need to manage. We won't make any attempt
      at complete or realistic data definitions, but at least we're
      tying them to the real world.

      We define a new data type using the ``data`` keyword.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
         data BookInfo = Book Int String [String]
                         deriving (Show)

      The BookInfo after the ``data`` keyword is the name of our new
      type. We call BookInfo a *type constructor*. Once we have defined
      a type, we will use its type constructor to refer to it. As we've
      already mentioned, a type name, and hence a type constructor, must
      start with a capital letter.

      The ``Book`` that follows is the name of the *value constructor*
      (sometimes called a data constructor). We use this to create a
      value of the BookInfo type. A value constructor's name must also
      start with a capital letter.

      After ``Book``, the Int, String, and [String] that follow are the
      *components* of the type. A component serves the same purpose in
      Haskell as a field in a structure or class would in another
      language: it's a “slot” where we keep a value. (We'll often refer
      to components as fields.)

      In this example, the Int represents a book's identifier (e.g. in a
      stock database), String its title, and [String] the names of its
      authors.

      To make the link to a concept we've already seen, the BookInfo
      type contains the same components as a 3-tuple of type (Int,
      String, [String]), but it has a distinct type. We can't
      accidentally (or deliberately) use one in a context where the
      other is expected. For instance, a bookstore is also likely to
      carry magazines.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
         data MagazineInfo = Magazine Int String [String]
                             deriving (Show)

      Even though this MagazineInfo type has the same structure as our
      BookInfo type, Haskell treats the types as distinct because their
      type and value constructors have different names.

      .. Note:: Deriving what?

         We'll explain the full meaning of ``deriving (Show)``
         later, in the section called `“Show” <#typeclasses.wellknown.show>`__.
         For now, it's enough to know that we need to tack this
         onto a type declaration so that **ghci** will
         automatically know how to print a value of this type.

      We can create a new value of type BookInfo by treating ``Book`` as
      a function, and applying it with arguments of types Int, String,
      and [String].

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
         myInfo = Book 9780135072455 "Algebra of Programming"
                  ["Richard Bird", "Oege de Moor"]

      Once we have defined a type, we can experiment with it in
      **ghci**. We begin by using the **:load** command to load our
      source file.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :load BookStore
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( BookStore.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: Main.

      Remember the ``myInfo`` variable we defined in our source file?
      Here it is.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> myInfo
         Book 9780135072455 "Algebra of Programming" ["Richard Bird","Oege de Moor"]
         ghci> :type myInfo
         myInfo :: BookInfo

      We can construct new values interactively in **ghci**, too.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> Book 0 "The Book of Imaginary Beings" ["Jorge Luis Borges"]
         Book 0 "The Book of Imaginary Beings" ["Jorge Luis Borges"]

      The **ghci** command **:type** lets us see what the type of an
      expression is.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type Book 1 "Cosmicomics" ["Italo Calvino"]
         Book 1 "Cosmicomics" ["Italo Calvino"] :: BookInfo

      Remember that if we want to define a new variable inside **ghci**,
      the syntax is slightly different from that of a Haskell source
      file: we need to put a ``let`` in front.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> let cities = Book 173 "Use of Weapons" ["Iain M. Banks"]

      To find out more about a type, we can use some of **ghci**'s
      browsing capabilities. The **:info** command gets **ghci** to tell
      us everything it knows about a name.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :info BookInfo
         data BookInfo = Book Int String [String]
             -- Defined at BookStore.hs:4:5-12
         instance Show BookInfo -- Defined at BookStore.hs:4:5-12

      We can also find out why we use ``Book`` to construct a new value
      of type BookStore.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type Book
         Book :: Int -> String -> [String] -> BookInfo

      We can treat a value constructor as just another function, one
      that happens to create and return a new value of the type we
      desire.

                     :class: title

Naming types and values
-----------------------


         When we introduced the type BookStore, we deliberately chose to
         give the type constructor BookStore a different name from the
         value constructor ``Book``, purely to make it obvious which was
         which.

         However, in Haskell, the names of types and values are
         independent of each other. We only use a type constructor (i.e.
         the type's name) in a type declaration or a type signature. We
         only use a value constructor in actual code. Because these uses
         are distinct, there is no ambiguity if we give a type
         constructor and a value constructor the same name. If we are
         writing a type signature, we must be referring to a type
         constructor. If we are writing an expression, we must be using
         the value constructor.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
            -- We will introduce the CustomerID type shortly.

            data BookReview = BookReview BookInfo CustomerID String

         This definition says that the type named BookReview has a value
         constructor that is also named ``BookReview``.

         Not only is it *legal* for a value constructor to have the same
         name as its type constructor, it's *normal*: you'll see this
         all the time in regular Haskell code.

                  :class: title

Type synonyms
-------------


      We can introduce a *synonym* for an existing type at any time, to
      give a type a more descriptive name. For example, the String in
      our BookReview type doesn't tell us what the string is for, but we
      can clarify this.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
         type CustomerID = Int
         type ReviewBody = String

         data BetterReview = BetterReview BookInfo CustomerID ReviewBody

      The ``type`` keyword introduces a type synonym. The new name is on
      the left of the ``=``, with the existing name on the right. The
      two names identify the same type, so type synonyms are *purely*
      for making code more readable.

      We can also use a type synonym to create a shorter name for a
      verbose type.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
         type BookRecord = (BookInfo, BookReview)

      This states that we can use BookRecord as a synonym for the tuple
      (BookInfo, BookReview). A type synonym only creates a new name
      that refers to an existing
      type :sup:`[` `7 <#ftn.id582956>`__ :sup:`]`. We still use the
      same value constructors to create a value of the type.

Algebraic data types
--------------------


      The familiar Bool is the simplest common example of a category of
      type called an *algebraic data type*. An algebraic data type can
      have more than one value constructor.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/Bool.hs
         data Bool = False | True

      The Bool type has two value constructors, ``True`` and ``False``.
      Each value constructor is separated in the definition by a ``|``
      character, which we can read as “or”: we can construct a Bool that
      has the value ``True``, or the value ``False``. When a type has
      more than one value constructor, they are usually referred to as
      *alternatives* or *cases*. We can use any one of the alternatives
      to create a value of that type.

      .. Note:: A note about naming

         Although the phrase “algebraic data type” is long,
         we're being careful to avoid using the acronym “ADT”.
         That acronym is already widely understood to stand for
         “ *abstract* data type ”. Since Haskell supports
         both algebraic and abstract data types, we'll be
         explicit and avoid the acronym entirely.

      Each of an algebraic data type's value constructors can take zero
      or more arguments. As an example, here's one way we might
      represent billing information.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
         type CardHolder = String
         type CardNumber = String
         type Address = [String]

         data BillingInfo = CreditCard CardNumber CardHolder Address
                          | CashOnDelivery
                          | Invoice CustomerID
                            deriving (Show)

      Here, we're saying that we support three ways to bill our
      customers. If they want to pay by credit card, they must supply a
      card number, the holder's name, and the holder's billing address
      as arguments to the ``CreditCard`` value constructor.
      Alternatively, they can pay the person who delivers their
      shipment. Since we don't need to store any extra information about
      this, we specify no arguments for the ``CashOnDelivery``
      constructor. Finally, we can send an invoice to the specified
      customer, in which case we need their CustomerID as an argument to
      the ``Invoice`` constructor.

      When we use a value constructor to create a value of type
      BillingInfo, we must supply the arguments that it requires.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type CreditCard
         CreditCard :: CardNumber -> CardHolder -> Address -> BillingInfo
         ghci> CreditCard "2901650221064486" "Thomas Gradgrind" ["Dickens", "England"]
         CreditCard "2901650221064486" "Thomas Gradgrind" ["Dickens","England"]
         ghci> :type it
         it :: BillingInfo
         ghci> Invoice

         <interactive>:1:0:
             No instance for (Show (CustomerID -> BillingInfo))
               arising from a use of `print' at <interactive>:1:0-6
             Possible fix:
               add an instance declaration for (Show (CustomerID -> BillingInfo))
             In the expression: print it
             In a 'do' expression: print it
         ghci> :type it
         it :: BillingInfo

      The ``No instance`` error message arose because we did not supply
      an argument to the ``Invoice`` constructor. As a result, we were
      trying to print the ``Invoice`` constructor itself. That
      constructor requires an argument and returns a value, so it is a
      function. We cannot print functions in Haskell, which is
      ultimately why the interpreter complained.

                     :class: title

Tuples, algebraic data types, and when to use each
--------------------------------------------------


         There is some overlap between tuples and user-defined algebraic
         data types. If we wanted to, we could represent our BookInfo
         type from earlier as an (Int, String, [String]) tuple.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> Book 2 "The Wealth of Networks" ["Yochai Benkler"]
            Book 2 "The Wealth of Networks" ["Yochai Benkler"]
            ghci> (2, "The Wealth of Networks", ["Yochai Benkler"])
            (2,"The Wealth of Networks",["Yochai Benkler"])

         Algebraic data types allow us to distinguish between otherwise
         identical pieces of information. Two tuples with elements of
         the same type are structurally identical, so they have the same
         type.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/Distinction.hs
            a = ("Porpoise", "Grey")
            b = ("Table", "Oak")

         Since they have different names, two algebraic data types have
         distinct types, even if they are otherwise structurally
         equivalent.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/Distinction.hs
            data Cetacean = Cetacean String String
            data Furniture = Furniture String String

            c = Cetacean "Porpoise" "Grey"
            d = Furniture "Table" "Oak"

         This lets us bring the type system to bear in writing programs
         with fewer bugs. With the tuples we defined above, we could
         conveivably pass a description of a whale to a function
         expecting a chair, and the type system could not help us. With
         the algebraic data types, there is no such possibility of
         confusion.

         Here is a more subtle example. Consider the following
         representations of a two-dimensional vector.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/AlgebraicVector.hs
            -- x and y coordinates or lengths.
            data Cartesian2D = Cartesian2D Double Double
                               deriving (Eq, Show)

            -- Angle and distance (magnitude).
            data Polar2D = Polar2D Double Double
                           deriving (Eq, Show)

         The Cartesian and polar forms use the same types for their two
         elements. However, the *meanings* of the elements are
         different. Because Cartesian2D and Polar2D are distinct types,
         the type system will not let us accidentally use a Cartesian2D
         value where a Polar2D is expected, or vice versa.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> Cartesian2D (sqrt 2) (sqrt 2) == Polar2D (pi / 4) 2

            <interactive>:1:33:
                Couldn't match expected type `Cartesian2D'
                       against inferred type `Polar2D'
                In the second argument of `(==)', namely `Polar2D (pi / 4) 2'
                In the expression:
                      Cartesian2D (sqrt 2) (sqrt 2) == Polar2D (pi / 4) 2
                In the definition of `it':
                    it = Cartesian2D (sqrt 2) (sqrt 2) == Polar2D (pi / 4) 2

         The ``(==)`` operator requires its arguments to have the same
         type.

         .. Tip:: Comparing for equality

            Notice that in the ``deriving`` clause for our
            vector types, we added another word, ``Eq``. This
            causes the Haskell implementation to generate code
            that lets us compare the values for equality.

         If we used tuples to represent these values, we could quickly
         land ourselves in hot water by mixing the two representations
         inappropriately.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> (1, 2) == (1, 2)
            True

         The type system can't rescue us here: as far as it's concerned,
         we're comparing two (Double, Double) pairs, which is a
         perfectly valid thing to do. Indeed, we cannot tell by
         inspection which of these values is supposed to be polar or
         Cartesian, but ``(1,2)`` has a different meaning in each
         representation.

         There is no hard and fast rule for deciding when it's better to
         use a tuple or a distinct data type, but here's a rule of thumb
         to follow. If you're using compound values widely in your code
         (as almost all non-trivial programs do), adding ``data``
         declarations will benefit you in both type safety and
         readability. For smaller, localised uses, a tuple is usually
         fine.

Analogues to algebraic data types in other languages
-----------------------------------------------------


         Algebraic data types provide a single powerful way to describe
         data types. Other languages often need several different
         features to achieve the same degree of expressiveness. Here are
         some analogues from C and C++, which might make it clearer what
         we can do with algebraic data types, and how they relate to
         concepts that might be more familiar.

                        :class: title

The structure
-------------


            With just one constructor, an algebraic data type is similar
            to a tuple: it groups related values together into a
            compound value. It corresponds to a ``struct`` in C or C++,
            and its components correspond to the fields of a ``struct``.
            Here's a C equivalent of the BookInfo type that we defined
            earlier.

            .. code:: haskell
               :class: programlisting

               struct book_info {
                   int id;
                   char *name;
                   char **authors;
               };

            The main difference between the two is that the fields in
            the Haskell type are anonymous and positional.

            .. code:: haskell
               :class: programlisting

               -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
               data BookInfo = Book Int String [String]
                               deriving (Show)

            By *positional*, we mean that the section number is in the
            first field of the Haskell type, and the title is in the
            second. We refer to them by location, not by name.

            In the section called `“Pattern matching” <#deftypes.pattern>`__,
            we'll see how to access the fields of a BookStore value. In
            the section called `“Record syntax” <#deftypes.record>`__,
            we'll introduce an alternate syntax for defining data types
            that looks a little more C-like.

                        :class: title

The enumeration
---------------


            Algebraic data types also serve where we'd use an ``enum``
            in C or C++, to represent a range of symbolic values. Such
            algebraic data types are sometimes referred to as
            enumeration types. Here's an example from C.

            .. code:: haskell
               :class: programlisting

               enum roygbiv {
                   red,
                   orange,
                   yellow,
                   green,
                   blue,
                   indigo,
                   violet,
               };

            And here's a Haskell equivalent.

            .. code:: haskell
               :class: programlisting

               -- file: ch03/Roygbiv.hs

               data Roygbiv = Red
                            | Orange
                            | Yellow
                            | Green
                            | Blue
                            | Indigo
                            | Violet
                              deriving (Eq, Show)

            We can try these out in **ghci**.

            .. code:: haskell
               :class: screen

               ghci> :type Yellow
               Yellow :: Roygbiv
               ghci> :type Red
               Red :: Roygbiv
               ghci> Red == Yellow
               False
               ghci> Green == Green
               True

            In C, the elements of an ``enum`` are integers. We can use
            an integer in a context where an ``enum`` is expected, and
            vice versa: a C compiler will automatically convert values
            between the two types. This can be a source of nasty bugs.
            In Haskell, this kind of problem does not occur. For
            example, we cannot use a Roygbiv value where an ``Int`` is
            expected.

            .. code:: haskell
               :class: screen

               ghci> take 3 "foobar"
               "foo"
               ghci> take Red "foobar"

               <interactive>:1:5:
                   Couldn't match expected type `Int' against inferred type `Roygbiv'
                   In the first argument of `take', namely `Red'
                   In the expression: take Red "foobar"
                   In the definition of `it': it = take Red "foobar"

                        :class: title

The discriminated union
-----------------------


            If an algebraic data type has multiple alternatives, we can
            think of it as similar to a ``union`` in C or C++. A big
            difference between the two is that a union doesn't tell us
            which alternative is actually present; we have to explicitly
            and manually track which alternative we're using, usually in
            another field of an enclosing struct. This means that unions
            can be sources of nasty bugs, where our notion of which
            alternative we should be using is incorrect.

            .. code:: haskell
               :class: programlisting

               enum shape_type {
                   shape_circle,
                   shape_poly,
               };

               struct circle {
                   struct vector centre;
                   float radius;
               };

               struct poly {
                   size_t num_vertices;
                   struct vector *vertices;
               };

               struct shape 
               {
                   enum shape_type type;
                   union {
                   struct circle circle;
                   struct poly poly;
                   } shape;
               };

            In the example above, the ``union`` can contain valid data
            for either a ``struct circle`` or a ``struct poly``. We have
            to use the ``enum shape_type`` by hand to indicate which
            kind of value is currently stored in the ``union``.

            The Haskell version of this code is both dramatically
            shorter and safer than the C equivalent.

            .. code:: haskell
               :class: programlisting

               -- file: ch03/ShapeUnion.hs
               type Vector = (Double, Double)

               data Shape = Circle Vector Double
                          | Poly [Vector]

            If we create a Shape value using the ``Circle`` constructor,
            the fact that we created a ``Circle`` is stored. When we
            later use a ``Circle``, we can't accidentally treat it as a
            ``Square``. We will see why in the section called `“Pattern
            matching” <#deftypes.pattern>`__

            .. Tip:: A few notes

               From reading the preceding sections, it should
               now be clear that *all* of the data types that
               we define with the ``data`` keyword are
               algebraic data types. Some may have just one
               alternative, while others have several, but
               they're all using the same machinery.

Pattern matching
----------------


      Now that we've seen how to construct values with algebraic data
      types, let's discuss how we work with these values. If we have a
      value of some type, there are two things we would like to be able
      to do.

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  If the type has more than one value constructor, we need to
            be able to tell which value constructor was used to create
            the value.

         -  If the value constructor has data components, we need to be
            able to extract those values.

      Haskell has a simple, but tremendously useful, *pattern matching*
      facility that lets us do both of these things.

      A pattern lets us look inside a value and bind variables to the
      data it contains. Here's an example of pattern matching in action
      on a Bool value: we're going to reproduce the ``not`` function.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/add.hs
         myNot True  = False
         myNot False = True

      It might seem that we have two functions named ``myNot`` here, but
      Haskell lets us define a function as a *series of equations*:
      these two clauses are defining the behavior of the same function
      for different patterns of input. On each line, the patterns are
      the items following the function name, up until the ``=`` sign.

      To understand how pattern matching works, let's step through an
      example, say ``myNot False``.

      When we apply ``myNot``, the Haskell runtime checks the value we
      supply against the value constructor in the first pattern. This
      does not match, so it tries against the second pattern. That match
      succeeds, so it uses the right hand side of that equation as the
      result of the function application.

      Here is a slightly more extended example. This function adds
      together the elements of a list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/add.hs
         sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs
         sumList []     = 0

      Let us step through the evaluation of ``sumList [1,2]``. The list
      notation ``[1,2]`` is shorthand for the expression ``(1:(2:[]))``.
      We begin by trying to match the pattern in the first equation of
      the definition of ``sumList``. In the ``(x:xs)`` pattern, the
      “ ``:`` ” is the familiar list constructor, ``(:)``. We are now
      using it to match against a value, not to construct one. The value
      ``(1:(2:[]))`` was constructed with ``(:)``, so the constructor in
      the value matches the constructor in the pattern. We say that the
      pattern *matches*, or that the match *succeeds*.

      The variables ``x`` and ``xs`` are now “bound to” the
      constructor's arguments, so ``x`` is given the value ``1``, and
      ``xs`` the value ``2:[]``.

      The expression we are now evaluating is ``1 + sumList (2:[])``. We
      must now recursively apply ``sumList`` to the value ``2:[]``. Once
      again, this was constructed using ``(:)``, so the match succeeds.
      In our recursive application of ``sumList``, ``x`` is now bound to
      ``2``, and ``xs`` to ``[]``.

      We are now evaluating ``1 + (2 + sumList [])``. In this recursive
      application of ``sumList``, the value we are matching against is
      ``[]``. The value's constructor does not match the constructor in
      the first pattern, so we skip this equation. Instead, we “fall
      through” to the next pattern, which matches. The right hand side
      of this equation is thus chosen as the result of this application.

      The result of ``sumList [1,2]`` is thus ``1 + (2 + (0))``, or
      ``3``.

      .. Note:: Ordering is important

         As we have already mentioned, a Haskell implementation
         checks patterns for matches in the order in which we
         specify them in our equations. Matching proceeds from
         top to bottom, and stops at the first success.
         Equations below a successful match have no effect.

      As a final note, there already exists a standard function,
      ``sum``, that performs this sum-of-a-list for us. Our ``sumList``
      is purely for illustration.

                     :class: title

Construction and deconstruction
-------------------------------


         Let's step back and take a look at the relationship between
         constructing a value and pattern matching on it.

         We apply a value constructor to build a value. The expression
         ``Book 9 "Close Calls" ["John Long"]`` applies the ``Book``
         constructor to the values ``9``, ``"Close Calls"``, and
         ``["John Long"]`` to produce a new value of type BookInfo.

         When we pattern match against the ``Book`` constructor, we
         *reverse* the construction process. First of all, we check to
         see if the value was created using that constructor. If it was,
         we inspect it to obtain the individual values that we
         originally supplied to the constructor when we created the
         value.

         Let's consider what happens if we match the pattern
         ``(Book id name authors)`` against our example expression.

         .. container:: itemizedlist

            -  The match will succeed, because the constructor in the
               value matches the one in our pattern.

            -  The variable ``id`` will be bound to ``9``.

            -  The variable ``name`` will be bound to ``"Close Calls"``.

            -  The variable ``authors`` will be bound to
               ``["John Long"]``.

         Because pattern matching acts as the inverse of construction,
         it's sometimes referred to as *de* construction.

         .. Note:: Deconstruction doesn't destroy anything

            If you're steeped in object oriented programming
            jargon, don't confuse deconstruction with
            destruction! Matching a pattern has no effect on
            the value we're examining: it just lets us “look
            inside” it.

Further adventures
------------------


         The syntax for pattern matching on a tuple is similar to the
         syntax for constructing a tuple. Here's a function that returns
         the last element of a 3-tuple.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/Tuple.hs
            third (a, b, c) = c

         There's no limit on how “deep” within a value a pattern can
         look. This definition looks both inside a tuple and inside a
         list within that tuple.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/Tuple.hs
            complicated (True, a, x:xs, 5) = (a, xs)

         We can try this out interactively.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :load Tuple.hs
            [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Tuple.hs, interpreted )
            Ok, modules loaded: Main.
            ghci> complicated (True, 1, [1,2,3], 5)
            (1,[2,3])

         Wherever a literal value is present in a pattern (``True`` and
         ``5`` in the tuple pattern above), that value must match
         exactly for the pattern match to succeed. If every pattern
         within a series of equations fails to match, we get a runtime
         error.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> complicated (False, 1, [1,2,3], 5)
            *** Exception: Tuple.hs:10:0-39: Non-exhaustive patterns in function complicated

         For an explanation of this error message, skip forward a little, to
         the section called `“Exhaustive patterns and wild cards” <#deftypes.patterns.nonexhaustive>`__.

         We can pattern match on an algebraic data type using its value
         constructors. Recall the BookInfo type we defined earlier: we
         can extract the values from a BookInfo as follows.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
            bookID      (Book id title authors) = id
            bookTitle   (Book id title authors) = title
            bookAuthors (Book id title authors) = authors

         Let's see it in action.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> bookID (Book 3 "Probability Theory" ["E.T.H. Jaynes"])
            3
            ghci> bookTitle (Book 3 "Probability Theory" ["E.T.H. Jaynes"])
            "Probability Theory"
            ghci> bookAuthors (Book 3 "Probability Theory" ["E.T.H. Jaynes"])
            ["E.T.H. Jaynes"]

         The compiler can infer the types of the accessor functions
         based on the constructor we're using in our pattern.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type bookID
            bookID :: BookInfo -> Int
            ghci> :type bookTitle
            bookTitle :: BookInfo -> String
            ghci> :type bookAuthors
            bookAuthors :: BookInfo -> [String]

         If we use a literal value in a pattern, the corresponding part
         of the value we're matching against must contain an identical
         value. For instance, the pattern ``(3:xs)`` first of all checks
         that a value is a non-empty list, by matching against the
         ``(:)`` constructor. It also ensures that the head of the list
         has the exact value ``3``. If both of these conditions hold,
         the tail of the list will be bound to the variable ``xs``.

                     :class: title

Variable naming in patterns
---------------------------


         As you read functions that match on lists, you'll frequently
         find that the names of the variables inside a pattern resemble
         ``(x:xs)`` or ``(d:ds)``. This is a popular naming convention.
         The idea is that the name ``xs`` has an “ ``s`` ” on the end
         of its name as if it's the “plural” of ``x``, because ``x``
         contains the head of the list, and ``xs`` the remaining
         elements.

                     :name: deftypes.wildcard
                     :class: title

The wild card pattern
---------------------


         We can indicate that we don't care what is present in part of a
         pattern. The notation for this is the underscore character
         “ ``_`` ”, which we call a *wild card*. We use it as follows.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
            nicerID      (Book id _     _      ) = id
            nicerTitle   (Book _  title _      ) = title
            nicerAuthors (Book _  _     authors) = authors

         Here, we have tidier versions of the accessor functions we
         introduced earlier. Now, there's no question about which
         element we're using in each function.

         In a pattern, a wild card acts similarly to a variable, but it
         doesn't bind a new variable. As the examples above indicate, we
         can use more than one wild card in a single pattern.

         Another advantage of wild cards is that a Haskell compiler can
         warn us if we introduce a variable name in a pattern, but do
         not use it in a function's body. Defining a variable, but
         forgetting to use it, can often indicate the presence of a bug,
         so this is a helpful feature. If we use a wild card instead of
         a variable that we do not intend to use, the compiler won't
         complain.

                     :class: title

Exhaustive patterns and wild cards
----------------------------------


         When writing a series of patterns, it's important to cover all
         of a type's constructors. For example, if we're inspecting a
         list, we should have one equation that matches the non-empty
         constructor ``(:)``, and one that matches the empty-list
         constructor ``[]``.

         Let's see what happens if we fail to cover all the cases. Here,
         we deliberately omit a check for the ``[]`` constructor.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/BadPattern.hs
            badExample (x:xs) = x + badExample xs

         If we apply this to a value that it cannot match, we'll get an
         error at runtime: our software has a bug!

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> badExample []
            *** Exception: BadPattern.hs:4:0-36: Non-exhaustive patterns in function badExample

         In this example, no equation in the function's definition
         matches the value ``[]``.

         .. Tip:: Warning about incomplete patterns

            GHC provides a helpful compilation option,
            ``-fwarn-incomplete-patterns``, that will cause it
            to print a warning during compilation if a sequence
            of patterns don't match all of a type's value
            constructors.

         If we need to provide a default behavior in cases where we
         don't care about specific constructors, we can use a wild card
         pattern.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/BadPattern.hs
            goodExample (x:xs) = x + goodExample xs
            goodExample _      = 0

         The wild card above will match the ``[]`` constructor, so
         applying this function does not lead to a crash.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> goodExample []
            0

Record syntax
-------------


      Writing accessor functions for each of a data type's components
      can be repetitive and tedious.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
         nicerID      (Book id _     _      ) = id
         nicerTitle   (Book _  title _      ) = title
         nicerAuthors (Book _  _     authors) = authors

      We call this kind of code *boilerplate*: necessary, but bulky and
      irksome. Haskell programmers don't like boilerplate. Fortunately,
      the language addresses this particular boilerplate problem: we can
      define a data type, and accessors for each of its components,
      simultaneously. (The positions of the commas here is a matter of
      preference. If you like, put them at the end of a line instead of
      the beginning.)

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
         data Customer = Customer {
               customerID      :: CustomerID
             , customerName    :: String
             , customerAddress :: Address
             } deriving (Show)

      This is almost exactly identical in meaning to the following, more
      familiar form.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/AltCustomer.hs
         data Customer = Customer Int String [String]
                         deriving (Show)

         customerID :: Customer -> Int
         customerID (Customer id _ _) = id

         customerName :: Customer -> String
         customerName (Customer _ name _) = name

         customerAddress :: Customer -> [String]
         customerAddress (Customer _ _ address) = address

      For each of the fields that we name in our type definition,
      Haskell creates an accessor function of that name.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type customerID
         customerID :: Customer -> CustomerID

      We can still use the usual application syntax to create a value of
      this type.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
         customer1 = Customer 271828 "J.R. Hacker"
                     ["255 Syntax Ct",
                      "Milpitas, CA 95134",
                      "USA"]

      Record syntax adds a more verbose notation for creating a value.
      This can sometimes make code more readable.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/BookStore.hs
         customer2 = Customer {
                       customerID = 271828
                     , customerAddress = ["1048576 Disk Drive",
                                          "Milpitas, CA 95134",
                                          "USA"]
                     , customerName = "Jane Q. Citizen"
                     }

      If we use this form, we can vary the order in which we list
      fields. Here, we have moved the name and address fields from their
      positions in the declaration of the type.

      When we define a type using record syntax, it also changes the way
      the type's values are printed.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> customer1
         Customer {customerID = 271828, customerName = "J.R. Hacker", customerAddress = ["255 Syntax Ct","Milpitas, CA 95134","USA"]}

      For comparison, let's look at a BookInfo value; we defined this
      type without record syntax.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> cities
         Book 173 "Use of Weapons" ["Iain M. Banks"]

      The accessor functions that we get “for free” when we use record
      syntax really are normal Haskell functions.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type customerName
         customerName :: Customer -> String
         ghci> customerName customer1
         "J.R. Hacker"

      The standard ``System.Time`` module makes good use of record
      syntax. Here's a type defined in that module:

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         data CalendarTime = CalendarTime {
           ctYear                      :: Int,
           ctMonth                     :: Month,
           ctDay, ctHour, ctMin, ctSec :: Int,
           ctPicosec                   :: Integer,
           ctWDay                      :: Day,
           ctYDay                      :: Int,
           ctTZName                    :: String,
           ctTZ                        :: Int,
           ctIsDST                     :: Bool
         }
             

      In the absence of record syntax, it would be painful to extract
      specific fields from a type like this. The notation makes it
      easier to work with large structures.

Parameterised types
-------------------


      We've repeatedly mentioned that the list type is polymorphic: the
      elements of a list can be of any type. We can also add
      polymorphism to our own types. To do this, we introduce type
      variables into a type declaration. The Prelude defines a type
      named Maybe: we can use this to represent a value that could be
      either present or missing, e.g. a field in a database row that
      could be null.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/Nullable.hs
         data Maybe a = Just a
                      | Nothing

      Here, the variable ``a`` is not a regular variable: it's a type
      variable. It indicates that the Maybe type takes another type as
      its parameter. This lets us use Maybe on values of any type.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/Nullable.hs
         someBool = Just True

         someString = Just "something"

      As usual, we can experiment with this type in **ghci**.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> Just 1.5
         Just 1.5
         ghci> Nothing
         Nothing
         ghci> :type Just "invisible bike"
         Just "invisible bike" :: Maybe [Char]

      Maybe is a polymorphic, or generic, type. We give the Maybe type
      constructor a parameter to create a specific type, such as Maybe
      Int or Maybe [Bool]. As we might expect, these types are distinct.

      We can nest uses of parameterised types inside each other, but
      when we do, we may need to use parentheses to tell the Haskell
      compiler how to parse our expression.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/Nullable.hs
         wrapped = Just (Just "wrapped")

      To once again extend an analogy to more familiar languages,
      parameterised types bear some resemblance to templates in C++, and
      to generics in Java. Just be aware that this is a shallow analogy.
      Templates and generics were added to their respective languages
      long after the languages were initially defined, and have an
      awkward feel. Haskell's parameterised types are simpler and easier
      to use, as the language was designed with them from the beginning.

                  :class: title

Recursive types
---------------


      The familiar list type is *recursive*: it's defined in terms of
      itself. To understand this, let's create our own list-like type.
      We'll use ``Cons`` in place of the ``(:)`` constructor, and
      ``Nil`` in place of ``[]``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/ListADT.hs
         data List a = Cons a (List a)
                     | Nil
                       deriving (Show)

      Because List a appears on both the left and the right of the ``=``
      sign, the type's definition refers to itself. If we want to use
      the ``Cons`` constructor to create a new value, we must supply one
      value of type ``a``, and another of type ``List a``. Let's see
      where this leads us in practice.

      The simplest value of type List a that we can create is ``Nil``.
      Save the type definition in a file, then load it into **ghci**.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> Nil
         Nil

      Because ``Nil`` has a List type, we can use it as a parameter to
      ``Cons``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> Cons 0 Nil
         Cons 0 Nil

      And because ``Cons 0 Nil`` has the type List a, we can use this as
      a parameter to ``Cons``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> Cons 1 it
         Cons 1 (Cons 0 Nil)
         ghci> Cons 2 it
         Cons 2 (Cons 1 (Cons 0 Nil))
         ghci> Cons 3 it
         Cons 3 (Cons 2 (Cons 1 (Cons 0 Nil)))

      We could continue in this fashion indefinitely, creating ever
      longer ``Cons`` chains, each with a single ``Nil`` at the end.

      .. Tip:: Is List an acceptable list?

         We can easily prove to ourselves that our List a type
         has the same shape as the built-in list type [a]. To
         do this, we write a function that takes any value of
         type [a], and produces a value of type List a.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/ListADT.hs
            fromList (x:xs) = Cons x (fromList xs)
            fromList []     = Nil

         By inspection, this clearly substitutes a ``Cons`` for
         every ``(:)``, and a ``Nil`` for each ``[]``. This
         covers both of the built-in list type's constructors.
         The two types are *isomorphic*; they have the same
         shape.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> fromList "durian"
            Cons 'd' (Cons 'u' (Cons 'r' (Cons 'i' (Cons 'a' (Cons 'n' Nil)))))
            ghci> fromList [Just True, Nothing, Just False]
            Cons (Just True) (Cons Nothing (Cons (Just False) Nil))

      For a third example of what a recursive type is, here is a
      definition of a binary tree type.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/Tree.hs
         data Tree a = Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
                     | Empty
                       deriving (Show)

      A binary tree is either a node with two children, which are
      themselves binary trees, or an empty value.

      This time, let's search for insight by comparing our definition
      with one from a more familiar language. Here's a similar class
      definition in Java.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         class Tree<A>
         {
             A value;
             Tree<A> left;
             Tree<A> right;

             public Tree(A v, Tree<A> l, Tree<A> r)
             {
             value = v;
             left = l;
             right = r;
             }
         }

      The one significant difference is that Java lets us use the
      special value ``null`` anywhere to indicate “nothing”, so we can
      use ``null`` to indicate that a node is missing a left or right
      child. Here's a small function that constructs a tree with two
      leaves (a leaf, by convention, has no children).

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         class Example 
         {
             static Tree<String> simpleTree()
             {
             return new Tree<String>(
                     "parent",
                 new Tree<String>("left leaf", null, null),
                 new Tree<String>("right leaf", null, null));
             }
         }

      In Haskell, we don't have an equivalent of ``null``. We could use
      the Maybe type to provide a similar effect, but that bloats the
      pattern matching. Instead, we've decided to use a no-argument
      ``Empty`` constructor. Where the Java example provides ``null`` to
      the Tree constructor, we supply ``Empty`` in Haskell.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/Tree.hs
         simpleTree = Node "parent" (Node "left child" Empty Empty)
                                    (Node "right child" Empty Empty)

                  :class: title

Reporting errors
----------------


      Haskell provides a standard function, ``error :: String -> a``,
      that we can call when something has gone terribly wrong in our
      code. We give it a string parameter, which is the error message to
      display. Its type signature looks peculiar: how can it produce a
      value of any type ``a`` given only a string?

      It has a result type of ``a`` so that we can call it anywhere and
      it will always have the right type. However, it does not return a
      value like a normal function: instead, it *immediately aborts
      evaluation*, and prints the error message we give it.

      The ``mySecond`` function returns the second element of its input
      list, but fails if its input list isn't long enough.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/MySecond.hs
         mySecond :: [a] -> a

         mySecond xs = if null (tail xs)
                       then error "list too short"
                       else head (tail xs)

      As usual, we can see how this works in practice in **ghci**.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> mySecond "xi"
         'i'
         ghci> mySecond [2]
         *** Exception: list too short
         ghci> head (mySecond [[9]])
         *** Exception: list too short

      Notice the third case above, where we try to use the result of the
      call to ``mySecond`` as the argument to another function.
      Evaluation still terminates and drops us back to the **ghci**
      prompt. This is the major weakness of using ``error``: it doesn't
      let our caller distinguish between a recoverable error and a
      problem so severe that it really should terminate our program.

      As we have already seen, a pattern matching failure causes a
      similar unrecoverable error.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> mySecond []
         *** Exception: Prelude.tail: empty list

                     :class: title

A more controlled approach
--------------------------


         We can use the Maybe type to represent the possibility of an
         error.

         If we want to indicate that an operation has failed, we can use
         the ``Nothing`` constructor. Otherwise, we wrap our value with
         the ``Just`` constructor.

         Let's see how our ``mySecond`` function changes if we return a
         Maybe value instead of calling ``error``.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/MySecond.hs
            safeSecond :: [a] -> Maybe a

            safeSecond [] = Nothing
            safeSecond xs = if null (tail xs)
                            then Nothing
                            else Just (head (tail xs))

         If the list we're passed is too short, we return ``Nothing`` to
         our caller. This lets them decide what to do, where a call to
         ``error`` would force a crash.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> safeSecond []
            Nothing
            ghci> safeSecond [1]
            Nothing
            ghci> safeSecond [1,2]
            Just 2
            ghci> safeSecond [1,2,3]
            Just 2

         To return to an earlier topic, we can further improve the
         readability of this function with pattern matching.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/MySecond.hs
            tidySecond :: [a] -> Maybe a

            tidySecond (_:x:_) = Just x
            tidySecond _       = Nothing

         The first pattern only matches if the list is at least two
         elements long (it contains two list constructors), and it binds
         the variable ``x`` to the list's second element. The second
         pattern is matched if the first fails.

                  :class: title

Introducing local variables
---------------------------


      Within the body of a function, we can introduce new local
      variables whenever we need them, using a ``let`` expression. Here
      is a simple function that determines whether we should lend some
      money to a customer. We meet a money reserve of at least 100, we
      return our new balance after subtracting the amount we have
      loaned.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/Lending.hs
         lend amount balance = let reserve    = 100
                                   newBalance = balance - amount
                               in if balance < reserve
                                  then Nothing
                                  else Just newBalance

      The keywords to look out for here are ``let``, which starts a
      block of variable declarations, and ``in``, which ends it. Each
      line introduces a new variable. The name is on the left of the
      ``=``, and the expression to which it is bound is on the right.

      .. Note:: Special notes

         Let us re-emphasise our wording: a name in a ``let``
         block is bound to an *expression*, not to a *value*.
         Because Haskell is a lazy language, the expression
         associated with a name won't actually be evaluated
         until it's needed. In the above example, we will not
         compute the value of ``newBalance`` if we do not meet
         our reserve.

         When we define a variable in a ``let`` block, we refer
         to it as a *``let``-bound* variable. This simply means
         what it says: we have bound the variable in a ``let``
         block.

         Also, our use of white space here is important. We'll
         talk in more detail about the layout rules in 
         the section called `“The offside rule and white space in an expression” <#deftypes.offside>`__.

      We can use the names of a variable in a ``let`` block both within
      the block of declarations and in the expression that follows the
      ``in`` keyword.

      In general, we'll refer to the places within our code where we can
      use a name as the name's *scope*. If we can use a name, it's *in
      scope*, otherwise it's *out of scope*. If a name is visible
      throughout a source file, we say it's at the *top level*.

Shadowing
---------


         We can “nest” multiple ``let`` blocks inside each other in an
         expression.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/NestedLets.hs
            foo = let a = 1
                  in let b = 2
                     in a + b

         It's perfectly legal, but not exactly wise, to repeat a
         variable name in a nested ``let`` expression.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/NestedLets.hs
            bar = let x = 1
                  in ((let x = "foo" in x), x)

         Here, the inner ``x`` is hiding, or *shadowing*, the outer
         ``x``. It has the same name, but a different type and value.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> bar
            ("foo",1)

         We can also shadow a function's parameters, leading to even
         stranger results. What is the type of this function?

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/NestedLets.hs
            quux a = let a = "foo"
                     in a ++ "eek!"

         Because the function's argument ``a`` is never used in the body
         of the function, due to being shadowed by the ``let``-bound
         ``a``, the argument can have any type at all.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type quux
            quux :: t -> [Char]

         .. Tip:: Compiler warnings are your friends

            Shadowing can obviously lead to confusion and nasty
            bugs, so GHC has a helpful
            ``-fwarn-name-shadowing`` option. When enabled, GHC
            will print a warning message any time we shadow a
            name.

The where clause
----------------


         We can use another mechanism to introduce local variables: the
         ``where`` clause. The definitions in a ``where`` clause apply
         to the code that *precedes* it. Here's a similar function to
         ``lend``, using ``where`` instead of ``let``.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/Lending.hs
            lend2 amount balance = if amount < reserve * 0.5
                                   then Just newBalance
                                   else Nothing
                where reserve    = 100
                      newBalance = balance - amount

         While a ``where`` clause may initially seem weird, it offers a
         wonderful aid to readability. It lets us direct our reader's
         focus to the important details of an expression, with the
         supporting definitions following afterwards. After a while, you
         may find yourself missing ``where`` clauses in languages that
         lack them.

         As with ``let`` expressions, white space is significant in
         ``where`` clauses. We will talk more about the layout rules shortly, in
         the section called 
         `“The offside rule and white space in an expression” <#deftypes.offside>`__.

                     :class: title

Local functions, global variables
---------------------------------


         You'll have noticed that Haskell's syntax for defining a
         variable looks very similar to its syntax for defining a
         function. This symmetry is preserved in ``let`` and ``where``
         blocks: we can define local *functions* just as easily as local
         *variables*.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/LocalFunction.hs
            pluralise :: String -> [Int] -> [String]
            pluralise word counts = map plural counts
                where plural 0 = "no " ++ word ++ "s"
                      plural 1 = "one " ++ word
                      plural n = show n ++ " " ++ word ++ "s"

         We have defined a local function, ``plural``, that consists of
         several equations. Local functions can freely use variables
         from the scopes that enclose them: here, we use ``word`` from
         the definition of the outer function ``pluralise``. In the
         definition of ``pluralise``, the ``map`` function (which we'll
         be revisiting in the next chapter) applies the local function
         ``plural`` to every element of the ``counts`` list.

         We can also define variables, as well as functions, at the top
         level of a source file.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

                  :class: title

The offside rule and white space in an expression
-------------------------------------------------


      In our definitions of ``lend`` and ``lend2``, the left margin of
      our text wandered around quite a bit. This was not an accident: in
      Haskell, white space has meaning.

      Haskell uses indentation as a cue to parse sections of code. This
      use of layout to convey structure is sometimes called the *offside
      rule*. At the beginning of a source file, the first top level
      declaration or definition can start in any column, and the Haskell
      compiler or interpreter remembers that indentation level. Every
      subsequent top level declaration must have the same indentation.

      Here's an illustration of the top level indentation rule. Our
      first file, ``GoodIndent.hs``, is well behaved.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/GoodIndent.hs
         -- This is the leftmost column.

           -- It's fine for top-level declarations to start in any column...
           firstGoodIndentation = 1

           -- ...provided all subsequent declarations do, too!
           secondGoodIndentation = 2

      Our second, ``BadIndent.hs``, doesn't play by the rules.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/BadIndent.hs
         -- This is the leftmost column.

             -- Our first declaration is in column 4.
             firstBadIndentation = 1

           -- Our second is left of the first, which is illegal!
           secondBadIndentation = 2

      Here's what happens when we try to load the two files into **ghci**.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :load GoodIndent.hs
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( GoodIndent.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: Main.
         ghci> :load BadIndent.hs
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( BadIndent.hs, interpreted )

         BadIndent.hs:8:2: parse error on input `secondBadIndentation'
         Failed, modules loaded: none.

      An empty following line is treated as a continuation of the
      current item, as is a following line indented further to the
      right.

      The rules for ``let`` expressions and ``where`` clauses are
      similar. After a ``let`` or ``where`` keyword, the Haskell
      compiler or interpreter remembers the indentation of the next
      token it sees. If the line that follows is empty, or its
      indentation is further to the right, it is considered to continue
      the previous line. If the indentation is the same as the start of
      the preceding item, this is treated as beginning a new item in the
      same block.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/Indentation.hs
         foo = let firstDefinition = blah blah
                   -- a comment-only line is treated as empty
                                       continuation blah

                   -- we reduce the indentation, so this is a new definition
                   secondDefinition = yada yada

                                      continuation yada
               in whatever

      Here are nested uses of ``let`` and ``where``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/letwhere.hs
         bar = let b = 2
                   c = True
               in let a = b
                  in (a, c)

      The name ``a`` is only visible within the inner ``let``
      expression. It's not visible in the outer ``let``. If we try to
      use the name ``a`` there, we'll get a compilation error. The
      indentation gives both us and the compiler a visual cue as to what
      is currently in scope.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/letwhere.hs
         foo = x
             where x = y
                       where y = 2

      Similarly, the scope of the first ``where`` clause is the
      definition of ``foo``, but the scope of the second is just the
      first ``where`` clause.

      The indentation we use for the ``let`` and ``where`` clauses makes
      our intentions easy to figure out.

                     :class: title

A note about tabs versus spaces
-------------------------------


         If you use a Haskell-aware text editor (e.g. Emacs), it is
         probably already configured to use space characters for all
         white space when you edit Haskell source files. If your editor
         is *not* Haskell-aware, you should configure it to only use
         space characters.

         The reason for this is portability. In an editor that uses a
         fixed-width font, tab stops are by convention placed at
         different intervals on Unix-like systems (every eight
         characters) than on Windows (every four characters). This means
         that no matter what your personal beliefs are about where tabs
         belong, you can't rely on someone else's editor honouring your
         preferences. Any indentation that uses tabs is going to look
         broken under *someone's* configuration. In fact, this could
         lead to compilation problems, as the Haskell language standard
         requires implementations to use the Unix tab width convention.
         Using space characters avoids this problem entirely.

The offside rule is not mandatory
---------------------------------


         We can use explicit structuring instead of layout to indicate
         what we mean. To do so, we start a block of equations with an
         opening curly brace; separate each item with a semicolon; and
         finish the block with a closing curly brace. The following two
         uses of ``let`` have the same meanings.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/Braces.hs
            bar = let a = 1
                      b = 2
                      c = 3
                  in a + b + c

            foo = let { a = 1;  b = 2;
                    c = 3 }
                  in a + b + c

         When we use explicit structuring, the normal layout rules don't
         apply, which is why we can get away with unusual indentation in
         the second ``let`` expression.

         We can use explicit structuring anywhere that we'd normally use
         layout. It's valid for ``where`` clauses, and even top-level
         declarations. Just remember that although the facility exists,
         explicit structuring is hardly ever actually *used* in Haskell
         programs.

                  :class: title

The case expression
-------------------


      Function definitions are not the only place where we can use
      pattern matching. The ``case`` construct lets us match patterns
      within an expression. Here's what it looks like. This function
      (defined for us in ``Data.Maybe``) unwraps a Maybe value, using a
      default if the value is ``Nothing``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/Guard.hs
         fromMaybe defval wrapped =
             case wrapped of
               Nothing     -> defval
               Just value  -> value

      The ``case`` keyword is followed by an arbitrary expression: the
      pattern match is performed against the result of this expression.
      The ``of`` keyword signifies the end of the expression and the
      beginning of the block of patterns and expressions.

      Each item in the block consists of a pattern, followed by an arrow
      ``->``, followed by an expression to evaluate if that pattern
      matches. These expressions must all have the same type. The result
      of the ``case`` expression is the result of the expression
      associated with the first pattern to match. Matches are attempted
      from top to bottom.

      To express “here's the expression to evaluate if none of the other
      patterns match”, we just use the wild card pattern ``_`` as the
      last in our list of patterns. If a pattern match fails, we will
      get the same kind of runtime error as we saw earlier.

Common beginner mistakes with patterns
--------------------------------------


      There are a few ways in which new Haskell programmers can
      misunderstand or misuse patterns. Here are some attempts at
      pattern matching gone awry. Depending on what you expect one of
      these examples to do, it might contain a surprise.

Incorrectly matching against a variable
---------------------------------------


         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/BogusPattern.hs
            data Fruit = Apple | Orange

            apple = "apple"

            orange = "orange"        

            whichFruit :: String -> Fruit

            whichFruit f = case f of
                             apple  -> Apple
                             orange -> Orange

         A naive glance suggests that this code is trying to check the
         value ``f`` to see whether it matches the value ``apple`` or
         ``orange``.

         It is easier to spot the mistake if we rewrite the code in an
         equational style.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/BogusPattern.hs
            equational apple = Apple
            equational orange = Orange

         Now can you see the problem? Here, it is more obvious ``apple``
         does not refer to the top level value named ``apple``: it is a
         local pattern variable.

         .. Note:: Irrefutable patterns
               - 

                  - 
                  - We refer to a pattern that always succeeds as
                     *irrefutable*. Plain variable names and the wild
                     card ``_`` are examples of irrefutable patterns.

         Here's a corrected version of this function.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/BogusPattern.hs
            betterFruit f = case f of
                              "apple"  -> Apple
                              "orange" -> Orange

         We fixed the problem by matching against the literal values
         ``"apple"`` and ``"orange"``.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch03/BadTree.hs
            bad_nodesAreSame (Node a _ _) (Node a _ _) = Just a
            bad_nodesAreSame _            _            = Nothing

         A name can only appear once in a set of pattern bindings. We
         cannot place a variable in multiple positions to express the
         notion “this value and that should be identical”. Instead,
         we'll solve this problem using *guards*, another invaluable
         Haskell feature.

Conditional evaluation with guards
----------------------------------


      Pattern matching limites us to performing fixed tests of a value's
      shape. Although this is useful, we will often want to make a more
      expressive check before evaluating a function's body. Haskell
      provides a feature, *guards*, that give us this ability. We'll
      introduce the idea with a modification of the function we wrote to
      compare two nodes of a tree.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/BadTree.hs
         nodesAreSame (Node a _ _) (Node b _ _)
             | a == b     = Just a
         nodesAreSame _ _ = Nothing

      In this example, we use pattern matching to ensure that we are
      looking at values of the right shape, and a guard to compare
      pieces of them.

      A pattern can be followed by zero or more guards, each an
      expression of type Bool. A guard is introduced by a ``|`` symbol.
      This is followed by the guard expression, then an ``=`` symbol (or
      ``->`` if we're in a ``case`` expression), then the body to use if
      the guard expression evaluates to ``True``. If a pattern matches,
      each guard associated with that pattern is evaluated, in the order
      in which they are written. If a guard succeeds, the body
      affiliated with it is used as the result of the function. If no
      guard succeeds, pattern matching moves on to the next pattern.

      When a guard expression is evaluated, all of the variables
      mentioned in the pattern with which it is associated are bound and
      can be used.

      Here is a reworked version of our ``lend`` function that uses
      guards.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch03/Lending.hs
         lend3 amount balance
              | amount <= 0            = Nothing
              | amount > reserve * 0.5 = Nothing
              | otherwise              = Just newBalance
             where reserve    = 100
                   newBalance = balance - amount

      The special-looking guard expression ``otherwise`` is simply a
      variable bound to the value ``True``, to aid readability.

      We can use guards anywhere that we can use patterns. Writing a
      function as a series of equations using pattern matching and
      guards can make it much clearer. Remember the ``myDrop`` function
      we defined in the section called `“Conditional
      evaluation” <types-and-functions.html#funcstypes.if>`__?

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch02/myDrop.hs
         myDrop n xs = if n <= 0 || null xs
                       then xs
                       else myDrop (n - 1) (tail xs)

      Here is a reformulation that uses patterns and guards.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch02/myDrop.hs
         niceDrop n xs | n <= 0 = xs
         niceDrop _ []          = []
         niceDrop n (_:xs)      = niceDrop (n - 1) xs

      This change in style lets us enumerate *up front* the cases in
      which we expect a function to behave differently. If we bury the
      decisions inside a function as ``if`` expressions, the code
      becomes harder to read.

Thinking in Haskell
-------------------

   Our early learning of Haskell has two distinct aspects. The first
   is coming to terms with the shift in mindset from imperative
   programming to functional: we have to replace our programming
   habits from other languages. We do this not because imperative
   techniques are bad, but because in a functional language other
   techniques work better.

   Our second challenge is learning our way around the standard
   Haskell libraries. As in any language, the libraries act as a
   lever, enabling us to multiply our problem solving power. Haskell
   libraries tend to operate at a higher level of abstraction than
   those in many other languages. We'll need to work a little harder
   to learn to use the libraries, but in exchange they offer a lot of
   power.

   In this chapter, we'll introduce a number of common functional
   programming techniques. We'll draw upon examples from imperative
   languages to highlight the shift in thinking that we'll need to
   make. As we do so, we'll walk through some of the fundamentals of
   Haskell's standard libraries. We'll also intermittently cover a
   few more language features along the way.

A simple command line framework
-------------------------------

   In most of this chapter, we will concern ourselves with code that
   has no interaction with the outside world. To maintain our focus
   on practical code, we will begin by developing a gateway between
   our “pure” code and the outside world. Our framework simply reads
   the contents of one file, applies a function to the file, and
   writes the result to another file.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/InteractWith.hs
      -- Save this in a source file, e.g. Interact.hs

      import System.Environment (getArgs)

      interactWith function inputFile outputFile = do
        input <- readFile inputFile
        writeFile outputFile (function input)

      main = mainWith myFunction
        where mainWith function = do
                args <- getArgs
                case args of
                  [input,output] -> interactWith function input output
                  _ -> putStrLn "error: exactly two arguments needed"

              -- replace "id" with the name of our function below
              myFunction = id

   This is all we need to write simple, but complete, file processing
   programs. This is a complete program. We can compile it to an
   executable named ``InteractWith`` as follows.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      $ ghc --make InteractWith
      [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( InteractWith.hs, InteractWith.o )
      Linking InteractWith ...

   If we run this program from the shell or command prompt, it will
   accept two file names: the name of a file to read, and the name of
   a file to write.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      $ ./Interact
      error: exactly two arguments needed
      $ ./Interact hello-in.txt hello-out.txt
      $ cat hello-in.txt
      hello world
      $ cat hello-out.txt
      hello world

   Some of the notation in our source file is new. The ``do`` keyword
   introduces a block of *actions* that can cause effects in the real
   world, such as reading or writing a file. The ``<-`` operator is
   the equivalent of assignment inside a ``do`` block. This is enough
   explanation to get us started. We will talk in much more detail
   about these details of notation, and I/O in general, in
   `Chapter 7, I/O <io.html>`__.

   When we want to test a function that cannot talk to the outside
   world, we simply replace the name ``id`` in the code above with
   the name of the function we want to test. Whatever our function
   does, it will need to have the type String -> String: in other
   words, it must accept a string, and return a string.

Warming up: portably splitting lines of text
--------------------------------------------

   Haskell provides a built-in function, ``lines``, that lets us
   split a text string on line boundaries. It returns a list of
   strings with line termination characters omitted.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type lines
      lines :: String -> [String]
      ghci> lines "line 1\nline 2"
      ["line 1","line 2"]
      ghci> lines "foo\n\nbar\n"
      ["foo","","bar"]

   While ``lines`` looks useful, it relies on us reading a file in
   “text mode” in order to work. Text mode is a feature common to
   many programming languages: it provides a special behavior when we
   read and write files on Windows. When we read a file in text mode,
   the file I/O library translates the line ending sequence
   ``"\r\n"`` (carriage return followed by newline) to ``"\n"``
   (newline alone), and it does the reverse when we write a file. On
   Unix-like systems, text mode does not perform any translation. As
   a result of this difference, if we read a file on one platform
   that was written on the other, the line endings are likely to
   become a mess. (Both ``readFile`` and ``writeFile`` operate in
   text mode.)

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> lines "a\r\nb"
      ["a\r","b"]

   The ``lines`` function only splits on newline characters, leaving
   carriage returns dangling at the ends of lines. If we read a
   Windows-generated text file on a Linux or Unix box, we'll get
   trailing carriage returns at the end of each line.

   We have comfortably used Python's “universal newline” support for
   years: this transparently handles Unix and Windows line ending
   conventions for us. We would like to provide something similar in
   Haskell.

   Since we are still early in our career of reading Haskell code, we
   will discuss our Haskell implementation in quite some detail.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/SplitLines.hs
      splitLines :: String -> [String]

   Our function's type signature indicates that it accepts a single
   string, the contents of a file with some unknown line ending
   convention. It returns a list of strings, representing each line
   from the file.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/SplitLines.hs
      splitLines [] = []
      splitLines cs =
          let (pre, suf) = break isLineTerminator cs
          in  pre : case suf of 
                      ('\r':'\n':rest) -> splitLines rest
                      ('\r':rest)      -> splitLines rest
                      ('\n':rest)      -> splitLines rest
                      _                -> []

      isLineTerminator c = c == '\r' || c == '\n'

   Before we dive into detail, notice first how we have organized our
   code. We have presented the important pieces of code first,
   keeping the definition of ``isLineTerminator`` until later.
   Because we have given the helper function a readable name, we can
   guess what it does even before we've read it, which eases the
   smooth “flow” of reading the code.

   The Prelude defines a function named ``break`` that we can use to
   partition a list into two parts. It takes a function as its first
   parameter. That function must examine an element of the list, and
   return a Bool to indicate whether to break the list at that point.
   The ``break`` function returns a pair, which consists of the
   sublist consumed before the predicate returned ``True`` (the
   *prefix*), and the rest of the list (the *suffix*).

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> break odd [2,4,5,6,8]
      ([2,4],[5,6,8])
      ghci> :module +Data.Char
      ghci> break isUpper "isUpper"
      ("is","Upper")

   Since we only need to match a single carriage return or newline at
   a time, examining one element of the list at a time is good enough
   for our needs.

   The first equation of ``splitLines`` indicates that if we match an
   empty string, we have no further work to do.

   In the second equation, we first apply ``break`` to our input
   string. The prefix is the substring before a line terminator, and
   the suffix is the remainder of the string. The suffix will include
   the line terminator, if any is present.

   The “ ``pre :`` ” expression tells us that we should add the
   ``pre`` value to the front of the list of lines. We then use a
   ``case`` expression to inspect the suffix, so we can decide what
   to do next. The result of the ``case`` expression will be used as
   the second argument to the ``(:)`` list constructor.

   The first pattern matches a string that begins with a carriage
   return, followed by a newline. The variable ``rest`` is bound to
   the remainder of the string. The other patterns are similar, so
   they ought to be easy to follow.

   A prose description of a Haskell function isn't necessarily easy
   to follow. We can gain a better understanding by stepping into
   **ghci**, and oberving the behavior of the function in different
   circumstances.

   Let's start by partitioning a string that doesn't contain any line
   terminators.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> splitLines "foo"
      ["foo"]

   Here, our application of ``break`` never finds a line terminator,
   so the suffix it returns is empty.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> break isLineTerminator "foo"
      ("foo","")

   The ``case`` expression in ``splitLines`` must thus be matching on
   the fourth branch, and we're finished. What about a slightly more
   interesting case?

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> splitLines "foo\r\nbar"
      ["foo","bar"]

   Our first application of ``break`` gives us a non-empty suffix.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> break isLineTerminator "foo\r\nbar"
      ("foo","\r\nbar")

   Because the suffix begins with a carriage return, followed by a
   newline, we match on the first branch of the ``case`` expression.
   This gives us ``pre`` bound to ``"foo"``, and ``suf`` bound to
   ``"bar"``. We apply ``splitLines`` recursively, this time on
   ``"bar"`` alone.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> splitLines "bar"
      ["bar"]

   The result is that we construct a list whose head is ``"foo"`` and
   whose tail is ``["bar"]``.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> "foo" : ["bar"]
      ["foo","bar"]

   This sort of experimenting with **ghci** is a helpful way to
   understand and debug the behavior of a piece of code. It has an
   even more important benefit that is almost accidental in nature.
   It can be tricky to test complicated code from **ghci**, so we
   will tend to write smaller functions. This can further help the
   readability of our code.

   This style of creating and reusing small, powerful pieces of code
   is a fundamental part of functional programming.

A line ending conversion program
--------------------------------

      Let's hook our ``splitLines`` function into the little
      framework we wrote earlier. Make a copy of the ``Interact.hs``
      source file; let's call the new file ``FixLines.hs``. Add the
      ``splitLines`` function to the new source file. Since our
      function must produce a single String, we must stitch the list
      of lines back together. The Prelude provides an ``unlines``
      function that concatenates a list of strings, adding a newline
      to the end of each.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/SplitLines.hs
         fixLines :: String -> String
         fixLines input = unlines (splitLines input)

      If we replace the ``id`` function with ``fixLines``, we can
      compile an executable that will convert a text file to our
      system's native line ending.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         $ ghc --make FixLines
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( FixLines.hs, FixLines.o )
         Linking FixLines ...

      If you are on a Windows system, find and download a text file
      that was created on a Unix system (for example
      `gpl-3.0.txt <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt>`__).
      Open it in the standard Notepad text editor. The lines should
      all run together, making the file almost unreadable. Process
      the file using the **FixLines** command you just created, and
      open the output file in Notepad. The line endings should now be
      fixed up.

      On Unix-like systems, the standard pagers and editors hide
      Windows line endings. This makes it more difficult to verify
      that **FixLines** is actually eliminating them. Here are a few
      commands that should help.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         $ file gpl-3.0.txt
         gpl-3.0.txt: ASCII English text

               :name: fp.infix
               :class: title

Infix functions
---------------

   Usually, when we define or apply a function in Haskell, we write
   the name of the function, followed by its arguments. This notation
   is referred to as *prefix*, because the name of the function comes
   before its arguments.

   If a function or constructor takes two or more arguments, we have
   the option of using it in *infix* form, where we place it
   *between* its first and second arguments. This allows us to use
   functions as infix operators.

   To define or apply a function or value constructor using infix
   notation, we enclose its name in backtick characters (sometimes
   known as backquotes). Here are simple infix definitions of a
   function and a type.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/Plus.hs
      a `plus` b = a + b

      data a `Pair` b = a `Pair` b
                        deriving (Show)

      -- we can use the constructor either prefix or infix
      foo = Pair 1 2
      bar = True `Pair` "quux"

   Since infix notation is purely a syntactic convenience, it does
   not change a function's behavior.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> 1 `plus` 2
      3
      ghci> plus 1 2
      3
      ghci> True `Pair` "something"
      True `Pair` "something"
      ghci> Pair True "something"
      True `Pair` "something"

   Infix notation can often help readability. For instance, the
   Prelude defines a function, ``elem``, that indicates whether a
   value is present in a list. If we use ``elem`` using prefix
   notation, it is fairly easy to read.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> elem 'a' "camogie"
      True

   If we switch to infix notation, the code becomes even easier to
   understand. It is now clearer that we're checking to see if the
   value on the left is present in the list on the right.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> 3 `elem` [1,2,4,8]
      False

   We see a more pronounced improvement with some useful functions
   from the ``Data.List`` module. The ``isPrefixOf`` function tells
   us if one list matches the beginning of another.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :module +Data.List
      ghci> "foo" `isPrefixOf` "foobar"
      True

   The ``isInfixOf`` and ``isSuffixOf`` functions match anywhere in a
   list and at its end, respectively.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> "needle" `isInfixOf` "haystack full of needle thingies"
      True
      ghci> "end" `isSuffixOf` "the end"
      True

   There is no hard-and-fast rule that dictates when you ought to use
   infix versus prefix notation, although prefix notation is far more
   common. It's best to choose whichever makes your code more
   readable in a specific situation.

   .. Note:: Beware familiar notation in an unfamiliar language

      A few other programming languages use backticks, but in
      spite of the visual similarities, the purpose of
      backticks in Haskell does not remotely resemble their
      meaning in, for example, Perl, Python, or Unix shell
      scripts.

      The only legal thing we can do with backticks in
      Haskell is wrap them around the name of a function. We
      can't, for example, use them to enclose a complex
      expression whose value is a function. It might be
      convenient if we could, but that's not how the
      language is today.

               :class: title

Working with lists
------------------

   As the bread and butter of functional programming, lists deserve
   some serious attention. The standard prelude defines dozens of
   functions for dealing with lists. Many of these will be
   indispensable tools, so it's important that we learn them early
   on.

   For better or worse, this section is going to read a bit like a
   “laundry list” of functions. Why present so many functions at
   once? These functions are both easy to learn and absolutely
   ubiquitous. If we don't have this toolbox at our fingertips, we'll
   end up wasting time by reinventing simple functions that are
   already present in the standard libraries. So bear with us as we
   go through the list; the effort you'll save will be huge.

   The ``Data.List`` module is the “real” logical home of all
   standard list functions. The Prelude merely re-exports a large
   subset of the functions exported by ``Data.List``. Several useful
   functions in ``Data.List`` are *not* re-exported by the standard
   prelude. As we walk through list functions in the sections that
   follow, we will explicitly mention those that are only in
   ``Data.List``.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :module +Data.List

   Because none of these functions is complex or takes more than
   about three lines of Haskell to write, we'll be brief in our
   descriptions of each. In fact, a quick and useful learning
   exercise is to write a definition of each function after you've
   read about it.

                  :class: title

Basic list manipulation
-----------------------

      The ``length`` function tells us how many elements are in a
      list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type length
         length :: [a] -> Int
         ghci> length []
         0
         ghci> length [1,2,3]
         3
         ghci> length "strings are lists, too"
         22

      If you need to determine whether a list is empty, use the
      ``null`` function.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type null
         null :: [a] -> Bool
         ghci> null []
         True
         ghci> null "plugh"
         False

      To access the first element of a list, we use the ``head``
      function.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type head
         head :: [a] -> a
         ghci> head [1,2,3]
         1

      The converse, ``tail``, returns all *but* the head of a list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type tail
         tail :: [a] -> [a]
         ghci> tail "foo"
         "oo"

      Another function, ``last``, returns the very last element of a
      list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type last
         last :: [a] -> a
         ghci> last "bar"
         'r'

      The converse of ``last`` is ``init``, which returns a list of
      all but the last element of its input.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type init
         init :: [a] -> [a]
         ghci> init "bar"
         "ba"

      Several of the functions above behave poorly on empty lists, so
      be careful if you don't know whether or not a list is empty.
      What form does their misbehavior take?

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> head []
         *** Exception: Prelude.head: empty list

      Try each of the above functions in **ghci**. Which ones crash
      when given an empty list?

Safely and sanely working with crashy functions
-----------------------------------------------

      When we want to use a function like ``head``, where we know
      that it might blow up on us if we pass in an empty list, the
      temptation might initially be strong to check the length of the
      list before we call ``head``. Let's construct an artificial
      example to illustrate our point.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/EfficientList.hs
         myDumbExample xs = if length xs > 0
                            then head xs
                            else 'Z'

      If we're coming from a language like Perl or Python, this might
      seem like a perfectly natural way to write this test. Behind
      the scenes, Python lists are arrays; and Perl arrays are, well,
      arrays. So they necessarily know how long they are, and calling
      ``len(foo)`` or ``scalar(@foo)`` is a perfectly natural thing
      to do. But as with many other things, it's not a good idea to
      blindly transplant such an assumption into Haskell.

      We've already seen the definition of the list algebraic data
      type many times, and know that a list doesn't store its own
      length explicitly. Thus, the only way that ``length`` can
      operate is to walk the entire list.

      Therefore, when we only care whether or not a list is empty,
      calling ``length`` isn't a good strategy. It can potentially do
      a lot more work than we want, if the list we're working with is
      finite. Since Haskell lets us easily create infinite lists, a
      careless use of ``length`` may even result in an infinite loop.

      A more appropriate function to call here instead is ``null``,
      which runs in constant time. Better yet, using ``null`` makes
      our code indicate what property of the list we really care
      about. Here are two improved ways of expressing
      ``myDumbExample``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/EfficientList.hs
         mySmartExample xs = if not (null xs)
                             then head xs
                             else 'Z'

         myOtherExample (x:_) = x
         myOtherExample [] = 'Z'

                  :name: id590211
                  :class: title

Partial and total functions
---------------------------

      Functions that only have return values defined for a subset of
      valid inputs are called *partial* functions (calling ``error``
      doesn't qualify as returning a value!). We call functions that
      return valid results over their entire input domains *total*
      functions.

      It's always a good idea to know whether a function you're using
      is partial or total. Calling a partial function with an input
      that it can't handle is probably the single biggest source of
      straightforward, avoidable bugs in Haskell programs.

      Some Haskell programmers go so far as to give partial functions
      names that begin with a prefix such as ``unsafe``, so that they
      can't shoot themselves in the foot accidentally.

      It's arguably a deficiency of the standard prelude that it
      defines quite a few “unsafe” partial functions, like ``head``,
      without also providing “safe” total equivalents.

More simple list manipulations
------------------------------

      Haskell's name for the “append” function is ``(++)``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type (++)
         (++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
         ghci> "foo" ++ "bar"
         "foobar"
         ghci> [] ++ [1,2,3]
         [1,2,3]
         ghci> [True] ++ []
         [True]

      The ``concat`` function takes a list of lists, all of the same
      type, and concatenates them into a single list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type concat
         concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
         ghci> concat [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
         [1,2,3,4,5,6]

      It removes one level of nesting.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> concat [[[1,2],[3]], [[4],[5],[6]]]
         [[1,2],[3],[4],[5],[6]]
         ghci> concat (concat [[[1,2],[3]], [[4],[5],[6]]])
         [1,2,3,4,5,6]

      The ``reverse`` function returns the elements of a list in
      reverse order.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type reverse
         reverse :: [a] -> [a]
         ghci> reverse "foo"
         "oof"

      For lists of Bool, the ``and`` and ``or`` functions generalise
      their two-argument cousins, ``(&&)`` and ``(||)``, over lists.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type and
         and :: [Bool] -> Bool
         ghci> and [True,False,True]
         False
         ghci> and []
         True
         ghci> :type or
         or :: [Bool] -> Bool
         ghci> or [False,False,False,True,False]
         True
         ghci> or []
         False

      They have more useful cousins, ``all`` and ``any``, which
      operate on lists of any type. Each one takes a predicate as its
      first argument; ``all`` returns ``True`` if that predicate
      succeeds on every element of the list, while ``any`` returns
      ``True`` if the predicate succeeds on at least one element of
      the list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type all
         all :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
         ghci> all odd [1,3,5]
         True
         ghci> all odd [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5]
         False
         ghci> all odd []
         True
         ghci> :type any
         any :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
         ghci> any even [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5]
         True
         ghci> any even []
         False

Working with sublists
---------------------

      The ``take`` function, which we already met in the section called 
      `“Function application” <types-and-functions.html#funcstypes.calling>`__,
      returns a sublist consisting of the first *k* elements from a
      list. Its converse, ``drop``, drops *k* elements from the start
      of the list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type take
         take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
         ghci> take 3 "foobar"
         "foo"
         ghci> take 2 [1]
         [1]
         ghci> :type drop
         drop :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
         ghci> drop 3 "xyzzy"
         "zy"
         ghci> drop 1 []
         []

      The ``splitAt`` function combines the functions of ``take`` and
      ``drop``, returning a pair of the input list, split at the
      given index.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type splitAt
         splitAt :: Int -> [a] -> ([a], [a])
         ghci> splitAt 3 "foobar"
         ("foo","bar")

      The ``takeWhile`` and ``dropWhile`` functions take predicates:
      ``takeWhile`` takes elements from the beginning of a list as
      long as the predicate returns ``True``, while ``dropWhile``
      drops elements from the list as long as the predicate returns
      ``True``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type takeWhile
         takeWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
         ghci> takeWhile odd [1,3,5,6,8,9,11]
         [1,3,5]
         ghci> :type dropWhile
         dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
         ghci> dropWhile even [2,4,6,7,9,10,12]
         [7,9,10,12]

      Just as ``splitAt`` “tuples up” the results of ``take`` and
      ``drop``, the functions ``break`` (which we already saw in `the
      section called “Warming up: portably splitting lines of
      text” <#fp.splitlines>`__) and
      ``span`` tuple up the results of ``takeWhile`` and
      ``dropWhile``.

      Each function takes a predicate; ``break`` consumes its input
      while its predicate fails, while ``span`` consumes while its
      predicate succeeds.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type span
         span :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> ([a], [a])
         ghci> span even [2,4,6,7,9,10,11]
         ([2,4,6],[7,9,10,11])
         ghci> :type break
         break :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> ([a], [a])
         ghci> break even [1,3,5,6,8,9,10]
         ([1,3,5],[6,8,9,10])

                  :name: fp.list.search
                  :class: title

Searching lists
---------------

      As we've already seen, the ``elem`` function indicates whether
      a value is present in a list. It has a companion function,
      ``notElem``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type elem
         elem :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool
         ghci> 2 `elem` [5,3,2,1,1]
         True
         ghci> 2 `notElem` [5,3,2,1,1]
         False

      For a more general search, ``filter`` takes a predicate, and
      returns every element of the list on which the predicate
      succeeds.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type filter
         filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
         ghci> filter odd [2,4,1,3,6,8,5,7]
         [1,3,5,7]

      In ``Data.List``, three predicates, ``isPrefixOf``,
      ``isInfixOf``, and ``isSuffixOf``, let us test for the presence
      of sublists within a bigger list. The easiest way to use them
      is using infix notation.

      The ``isPrefixOf`` function tells us whether its left argument
      matches the beginning of its right argument.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :module +Data.List
         ghci> :type isPrefixOf
         isPrefixOf :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
         ghci> "foo" `isPrefixOf` "foobar"
         True
         ghci> [1,2] `isPrefixOf` []
         False

      The ``isInfixOf`` function indicates whether its left argument
      is a sublist of its right.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :module +Data.List
         ghci> [2,6] `isInfixOf` [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5,8,9,7,9]
         True
         ghci> "funk" `isInfixOf` "sonic youth"
         False

      The operation of ``isSuffixOf`` shouldn't need any explanation.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :module +Data.List
         ghci> ".c" `isSuffixOf` "crashme.c"
         True

                  :class: title

Working with several lists at once
----------------------------------

      The ``zip`` function takes two lists and “zips” them into a
      single list of pairs. The resulting list is the same length as
      the shorter of the two inputs.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type zip
         zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
         ghci> zip [12,72,93] "zippity"
         [(12,'z'),(72,'i'),(93,'p')]

      More useful is ``zipWith``, which takes two lists and applies a
      function to each pair of elements, generating a list that is
      the same length as the shorter of the two.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type zipWith
         zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
         ghci> zipWith (+) [1,2,3] [4,5,6]
         [5,7,9]

      Haskell's type system makes it an interesting challenge to
      write functions that take variable numbers of
      arguments :sup:`[` `8 <#ftn.id591518>`__ :sup:`]`. So if we
      want to zip three lists together, we call ``zip3`` or
      ``zipWith3``, and so on up to ``zip7`` and ``zipWith7``.

                  :class: title

Special string-handling functions
---------------------------------

      We've already encountered the standard ``lines`` function in
      the section called `“Warming up: portably splitting lines of
      text” <#fp.splitlines>`__, and its
      standard counterpart, ``unlines``. Notice that ``unlines``
      always places a newline on the end of its result.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> lines "foo\nbar"
         ["foo","bar"]
         ghci> unlines ["foo", "bar"]
         "foo\nbar\n"

      The ``words`` function splits an input string on any white
      space. Its counterpart, ``unwords``, uses a single space to
      join a list of words.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> words "the  \r  quick \t  brown\n\n\nfox"
         ["the","quick","brown","fox"]
         ghci> unwords ["jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]
         "jumps over the lazy dog"

How to think about loops
------------------------

   Unlike traditional languages, Haskell has neither a ``for`` loop
   nor a ``while`` loop. If we've got a lot of data to process, what
   do we use instead? There are several possible answers to this
   question.

                  :name: fp.tailrecursion
                  :class: title

Explicit recursion
------------------

      A straightforward way to make the jump from a language that has
      loops to one that doesn't is to run through a few examples,
      looking at the differences. Here's a C function that takes a
      string of decimal digits and turns them into an integer.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         int as_int(char *str)
         {
             int acc; /* accumulate the partial result */

             for (acc = 0; isdigit(*str); str++) {
             acc = acc * 10 + (*str - '0');
             }

             return acc;
         }

      Given that Haskell doesn't have any looping constructs, how
      should we think about representing a fairly straightforward
      piece of code like this?

      We don't have to start off by writing a type signature, but it
      helps to remind us of what we're working with.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/IntParse.hs
         import Data.Char (digitToInt) -- we'll need ord shortly

         asInt :: String -> Int

      The C code computes the result incrementally as it traverses
      the string; the Haskell code can do the same. However, in
      Haskell, we can express the equivalent of a loop as a function.
      We'll call ours ``loop`` just to keep things nice and explicit.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/IntParse.hs
         loop :: Int -> String -> Int

         asInt xs = loop 0 xs

      That first parameter to ``loop`` is the accumulator variable
      we'll be using. Passing zero into it is equivalent to
      initialising the ``acc`` variable in C at the beginning of the
      loop.

      Rather than leap into blazing code, let's think about the data
      we have to work with. Our familiar String is just a synonym for
      [Char], a list of characters. The easiest way for us to get the
      traversal right is to think about the structure of a list: it's
      either empty, or a single element followed by the rest of the
      list.

      We can express this structural thinking directly by pattern
      matching on the list type's constructors. It's often handy to
      think about the easy cases first: here, that means we will
      consider the empty-list case.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/IntParse.hs
         loop acc [] = acc

      An empty list doesn't just mean “the input string is empty”;
      it's also the case we'll encounter when we traverse all the way
      to the end of a non-empty list. So we don't want to “error out”
      if we see an empty list. Instead, we should do something
      sensible. Here, the sensible thing is to terminate the loop,
      and return our accumulated value.

      The other case we have to consider arises when the input list
      is not empty. We need to do something with the current element
      of the list, and something with the rest of the list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/IntParse.hs
         loop acc (x:xs) = let acc' = acc * 10 + digitToInt x
                           in loop acc' xs

      We compute a new value for the accumulator, and give it the
      name ``acc'``. We then call the ``loop`` function again,
      passing it the updated value ``acc'`` and the rest of the input
      list; this is equivalent to the loop starting another round in
      C.

      .. Note:: Single quotes in variable names

         Remember, a single quote is a legal character to use
         in a Haskell variable name, and is pronounced
         “prime”. There's a common idiom in Haskell programs
         involving a variable, say ``foo``, and another
         variable, say ``foo'``. We can usually assume that
         ``foo'`` is somehow related to ``foo``. It's often
         a new value for ``foo``, as in our code above.

         Sometimes we'll see this idiom extended, such as
         ``foo''``. Since keeping track of the number of
         single quotes tacked onto the end of a name rapidly
         becomes tedious, use of more than two in a row is
         thankfully rare. Indeed, even one single quote can
         be easy to miss, which can lead to confusion on the
         part of readers. It might be better to think of the
         use of single quotes as a coding convention that
         you should be able to recognize, and less as one
         that you should actually follow.

      Each time the ``loop`` function calls itself, it has a new
      value for the accumulator, and it consumes one element of the
      input list. Eventually, it's going to hit the end of the list,
      at which time the ``[]`` pattern will match, and the recursive
      calls will cease.

      How well does this function work? For positive integers, it's
      perfectly cromulent.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> asInt "33"
         33

      But because we were focusing on how to traverse lists, not
      error handling, our poor function misbehaves if we try to feed
      it nonsense.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> asInt ""
         0
         ghci> asInt "potato"
         *** Exception: Char.digitToInt: not a digit 'p'

      We'll defer fixing our function's shortcomings to
      `Q: 1 <#fp.asInt.fix>`__.

      Because the last thing that ``loop`` does is simply call
      itself, it's an example of a tail recursive function. There's
      another common idiom in this code, too. Thinking about the
      structure of the list, and handling the empty and non-empty
      cases separately, is a kind of approach called *structural
      recursion*.

      We call the non-recursive case (when the list is empty) the
      *base case* (sometimes the *terminating case*). We'll see
      people refer to the case where the function calls itself as the
      recursive case (surprise!), or they might give a nod to
      mathematical induction and call it the *inductive case*.

      As a useful technique, structural recursion is not confined to
      lists; we can use it on other algebraic data types, too. We'll
      have more to say about it later.

      .. Note:: What's the big deal about tail recursion?

         In an imperative language, a loop executes in
         constant space. Lacking loops, we use tail
         recursive functions in Haskell instead. Normally, a
         recursive function allocates some space each time
         it applies itself, so it knows where to return to.

         Clearly, a recursive function would be at a huge
         disadvantage relative to a loop if it allocated
         memory for every recursive application: this would
         require linear space instead of constant space.
         However, functional language implementations detect
         uses of tail recursion, and transform tail
         recursive calls to run in constant space; this is
         called *tail call optimisation*, abbreviated TCO.

         Few imperative language implementations perform
         TCO; this is why using any kind of ambitiously
         functional style in an imperative language often
         leads to memory leaks and poor performance.

Transforming every piece of input
---------------------------------

      Consider another C function, ``square``, which squares every
      element in an array.

      .. code:: cpp
         :class: programlisting

         void square(double *out, const double *in, size_t length)
         {
             for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
             out[i] = in[i] * in[i];
             }
         }

      This contains a straightforward and common kind of loop, one
      that does exactly the same thing to every element of its input
      array. How might we write this loop in Haskell?

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Map.hs
         square :: [Double] -> [Double]

         square (x:xs) = x*x : square xs
         square []     = []

      Our ``square`` function consists of two pattern matching
      equations. The first “deconstructs” the beginning of a
      non-empty list, to get its head and tail. It squares the first
      element, then puts that on the front of a new list, which is
      constructed by calling ``square`` on the remainder of the empty
      list. The second equation ensures that ``square`` halts when it
      reaches the end of the input list.

      The effect of ``square`` is to construct a new list that's the
      same length as its input list, with every element in the input
      list substituted with its square in the output list.

      Here's another such C loop, one that ensures that every letter
      in a string is converted to uppercase.

      .. code:: cpp
         :class: programlisting

         #include <ctype.h>

         char *uppercase(const char *in)
         {
             char *out = strdup(in);
             
             if (out != NULL) {
             for (size_t i = 0; out[i] != '\0'; i++) {
                 out[i] = toupper(out[i]);
             }
             }

             return out;
         }

      Let's look at a Haskell equivalent.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Map.hs
         import Data.Char (toUpper)

         upperCase :: String -> String

         upperCase (x:xs) = toUpper x : upperCase xs
         upperCase []     = []

      Here, we're importing the ``toUpper`` function from the
      standard ``Data.Char`` module, which contains lots of useful
      functions for working with Char data.

      Our ``upperCase`` function follows a similar pattern to our
      earlier ``square`` function. It terminates with an empty list
      when the input list is empty; and when the input isn't empty,
      it calls ``toUpper`` on the first element, then constructs a
      new list cell from that and the result of calling itself on the
      rest of the input list.

      These examples follow a common pattern for writing recursive
      functions over lists in Haskell. The *base case* handles the
      situation where our input list is empty. The *recursive case*
      deals with a non-empty list; it does something with the head of
      the list, and calls itself recursively on the tail.

Mapping over a list
-------------------

      The ``square`` and ``upperCase`` functions that we just defined
      produce new lists that are the same lengths as their input
      lists, and do only one piece of work per element. This is such
      a common pattern that Haskell's prelude defines a function,
      ``map``, to make it easier. ``map`` takes a function, and
      applies it to every element of a list, returning a new list
      constructed from the results of these applications.

      Here are our ``square`` and ``upperCase`` functions rewritten
      to use ``map``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Map.hs
         square2 xs = map squareOne xs
             where squareOne x = x * x

         upperCase2 xs = map toUpper xs

      This is our first close look at a function that takes another
      function as its argument. We can learn a lot about what ``map``
      does by simply inspecting its type.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type map
         map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]

      The signature tells us that ``map`` takes two arguments. The
      first is a function that takes a value of one type, ``a``, and
      returns a value of another type, ``b``.

      Since ``map`` takes a function as argument, we refer to it as a
      *higher-order* function. (In spite of the name, there's nothing
      mysterious about higher-order functions; it's just a term for
      functions that take other functions as arguments, or return
      functions.)

      Since ``map`` abstracts out the pattern common to our
      ``square`` and ``upperCase`` functions so that we can reuse it
      with less boilerplate, we can look at what those functions have
      in common and figure out how to implement it ourselves.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Map.hs
         myMap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]

         myMap f (x:xs) = f x : myMap f xs
         myMap _ _      = []

      .. Note:: What are those wild cards doing there?

         If you're new to functional programming, the reasons
         for matching patterns in certain ways won't always
         be obvious. For example, in the definition of
         ``myMap`` above, the first equation binds the
         function we're mapping to the variable ``f``, but
         the second uses wild cards for both parameters.
         What's going on?

         We use a wild card in place of ``f`` to indicate
         that we aren't calling the function ``f`` on the
         right hand side of the equation. What about the
         list parameter? The list type has two constructors.
         We've already matched on the non-empty constructor
         in the first equation that defines ``myMap``. By
         elimination, the constructor in the second equation
         is necessarily the empty list constructor, so
         there's no need to perform a match to see what its
         value really is.

         As a matter of style, it is fine to use wild cards
         for well known simple types like lists and Maybe.
         For more complicated or less familiar types, it can
         be safer and more readable to name constructors
         explicitly.

      We try out our ``myMap`` function to give ourselves some
      assurance that it behaves similarly to the standard ``map``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :module +Data.Char
         ghci> map toLower "SHOUTING"
         "shouting"
         ghci> myMap toUpper "whispering"
         "WHISPERING"
         ghci> map negate [1,2,3]
         [-1,-2,-3]

      This pattern of spotting a repeated idiom, then abstracting it
      so we can reuse (and write less!) code, is a common aspect of
      Haskell programming. While abstraction isn't unique to Haskell,
      higher order functions make it remarkably easy.

                  :class: title

Selecting pieces of input
-------------------------

      Another common operation on a sequence of data is to comb
      through it for elements that satisfy some criterion. Here's a
      function that walks a list of numbers and returns those that
      are odd. Our code has a recursive case that's a bit more
      complex than our earlier functions: it only puts a number in
      the list it returns if the number is odd. Using a guard
      expresses this nicely.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Filter.hs
         oddList :: [Int] -> [Int]

         oddList (x:xs) | odd x     = x : oddList xs
                        | otherwise = oddList xs
         oddList _                  = []

      Let's see that in action.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> oddList [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34]
         [1,1,3,5,13,21]

      Once again, this idiom is so common that the Prelude defines a
      function, ``filter``, which we have already introduced. It
      removes the need for boilerplate code to recurse over the list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type filter
         filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
         ghci> filter odd [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5]
         [3,1,1,5,9,5]

      The ``filter`` function takes a predicate and applies it to
      every element in its input list, returning a list of only those
      for which the predicate evaluates to ``True``. We'll revisit
      ``filter`` again soon, in the section called `“Folding from the
      right” <#fp.foldr.filter>`__.

                  :name: id592937
                  :class: title

Computing one answer over a collection
--------------------------------------

      Another common thing to do with a collection is reduce it to a
      single value. A simple example of this is summing the values of
      a list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Sum.hs
         mySum xs = helper 0 xs
             where helper acc (x:xs) = helper (acc + x) xs
                   helper acc _      = acc

      Our ``helper`` function is tail recursive, and uses an
      accumulator parameter, ``acc``, to hold the current partial sum
      of the list. As we already saw with ``asInt``, this is a
      “natural” way to represent a loop in a pure functional
      language.

      For something a little more complicated, let's take a look at
      the Adler-32 checksum. This is a popular checksum algorithm; it
      concatenates two 16-bit checksums into a single 32-bit
      checksum. The first checksum is the sum of all input bytes,
      plus one. The second is the sum of all intermediate values of
      the first checksum. In each case, the sums are computed modulo
      65521. Here's a straightforward, unoptimised Java
      implementation. (It's safe to skip it if you don't read Java.)

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         public class Adler32 
         {
             private static final int base = 65521;

             public static int compute(byte[] data, int offset, int length)
             {
             int a = 1, b = 0;

             for (int i = offset; i < offset + length; i++) {
                 a = (a + (data[i] & 0xff)) % base;
                 b = (a + b) % base;
             }

             return (b << 16) | a;
             }
         }

      Although Adler-32 is a simple checksum, this code isn't
      particularly easy to read on account of the bit-twiddling
      involved. Can we do any better with a Haskell implementation?

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Adler32.hs
         import Data.Char (ord)
         import Data.Bits (shiftL, (.&.), (.|.))

         base = 65521

         adler32 xs = helper 1 0 xs
             where helper a b (x:xs) = let a' = (a + (ord x .&. 0xff)) `mod` base
                                           b' = (a' + b) `mod` base
                                       in helper a' b' xs
                   helper a b _     = (b `shiftL` 16) .|. a

      This code isn't exactly easier to follow than the Java code,
      but let's look at what's going on. First of all, we've
      introduced some new functions. The ``shiftL`` function
      implements a logical shift left; ``(.&.)`` provides bitwise
      “and”; and ``(.|.)`` provides bitwise “or”.

      Once again, our ``helper`` function is tail recursive. We've
      turned the two variables we updated on every loop iteration in
      Java into accumulator parameters. When our recursion terminates
      on the end of the input list, we compute our checksum and
      return it.

      If we take a step back, we can restructure our Haskell
      ``adler32`` to more closely resemble our earlier ``mySum``
      function. Instead of two accumulator parameters, we can use a
      pair as the accumulator.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Adler32.hs
         adler32_try2 xs = helper (1,0) xs
             where helper (a,b) (x:xs) =
                       let a' = (a + (ord x .&. 0xff)) `mod` base
                           b' = (a' + b) `mod` base
                       in helper (a',b') xs
                   helper (a,b) _     = (b `shiftL` 16) .|. a

      Why would we want to make this seemingly meaningless structural
      change? Because as we've already seen with ``map`` and
      ``filter``, we can extract the common behavior shared by
      ``mySum`` and ``adler32_try2`` into a higher-order function. We
      can describe this behavior as “do something to every element of
      a list, updating an accumulator as we go, and returning the
      accumulator when we're done”.

      This kind of function is called a *fold*, because it “folds up”
      a list. There are two kinds of fold over lists, ``foldl`` for
      folding from the left (the start) and ``foldr`` for folding
      from the right (the end).

                  :name: fp.foldl
                  :class: title

The left fold
-------------

      Here is the definition of ``foldl``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a

         foldl step zero (x:xs) = foldl step (step zero x) xs
         foldl _    zero []     = zero

      The ``foldl`` function takes a “step” function, an initial
      value for its accumulator, and a list. The “step” takes an
      accumulator and an element from the list, and returns a new
      accumulator value. All ``foldl`` does is call the “stepper” on
      the current accumulator and an element of the list, and passes
      the new accumulator value to itself recursively to consume the
      rest of the list.

      We refer to ``foldl`` as a “left fold” because it consumes the
      list from left (the head) to right.

      Here's a rewrite of ``mySum`` using ``foldl``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Sum.hs
         foldlSum xs = foldl step 0 xs
             where step acc x = acc + x

      That local function ``step`` just adds two numbers, so let's
      simply use the addition operator instead, and eliminate the
      unnecessary ``where`` clause.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Sum.hs
         niceSum :: [Integer] -> Integer
         niceSum xs = foldl (+) 0 xs

      Notice how much simpler this code is than our original
      ``mySum``? We're no longer using explicit recursion, because
      ``foldl`` takes care of that for us. We've simplified our
      problem down to two things: what the initial value of the
      accumulator should be (the second parameter to ``foldl``), and
      how to update the accumulator (the ``(+)`` function). As an
      added bonus, our code is now shorter, too, which makes it
      easier to understand.

      Let's take a deeper look at what ``foldl`` is doing here, by
      manually writing out each step in its evaluation when we call
      ``niceSum [1,2,3]``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         foldl (+) 0 (1:2:3:[])
                   == foldl (+) (0 + 1)             (2:3:[])
                   == foldl (+) ((0 + 1) + 2)       (3:[])
                   == foldl (+) (((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) []
                   ==           (((0 + 1) + 2) + 3)

      We can rewrite ``adler32_try2`` using ``foldl`` to let us focus
      on the details that are important.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Adler32.hs
         adler32_foldl xs = let (a, b) = foldl step (1, 0) xs
                            in (b `shiftL` 16) .|. a
             where step (a, b) x = let a' = a + (ord x .&. 0xff)
                                   in (a' `mod` base, (a' + b) `mod` base)

      Here, our accumulator is a pair, so the result of ``foldl``
      will be, too. We pull the final accumulator apart when
      ``foldl`` returns, and bit-twiddle it into a “proper” checksum.

                  :class: title

Why use folds, maps, and filters?
---------------------------------

      A quick glance reveals that ``adler32_foldl`` isn't really any
      shorter than ``adler32_try2``. Why should we use a fold in this
      case? The advantage here lies in the fact that folds are
      extremely common in Haskell, and they have regular, predictable
      behavior.

      This means that a reader with a little experience will have an
      easier time understanding a use of a fold than code that uses
      explicit recursion. A fold isn't going to produce any
      surprises, but the behavior of a function that recurses
      explicitly isn't immediately obvious. Explicit recursion
      requires us to read closely to understand exactly what's going
      on.

      This line of reasoning applies to other higher-order library
      functions, including those we've already seen, ``map`` and
      ``filter``. Because they're library functions with well-defined
      behavior, we only need to learn what they do once, and we'll
      have an advantage when we need to understand any code that uses
      them. These improvements in readability also carry over to
      writing code. Once we start to think with higher order
      functions in mind, we'll produce concise code more quickly.

Folding from the right
----------------------

      The counterpart to ``foldl`` is ``foldr``, which folds from the
      right of a list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b

         foldr step zero (x:xs) = step x (foldr step zero xs)
         foldr _    zero []     = zero

      Let's follow the same manual evaluation process with
      ``foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3]`` as we did with ``niceSum`` 
      in the section called `“The left fold” <#fp.foldl>`__.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         foldr (+) 0 (1:2:3:[])
                   == 1 +           foldr (+) 0 (2:3:[])
                   == 1 + (2 +      foldr (+) 0 (3:[])
                   == 1 + (2 + (3 + foldr (+) 0 []))
                   == 1 + (2 + (3 + 0))

      The difference between ``foldl`` and ``foldr`` should be clear
      from looking at where the parentheses and the “empty list”
      elements show up. With ``foldl``, the empty list element is on
      the left, and all the parentheses group to the left. With
      ``foldr``, the ``zero`` value is on the right, and the
      parentheses group to the right.

      There is a lovely intuitive explanation of how ``foldr`` works:
      it replaces the empty list with the ``zero`` value, and every
      constructor in the list with an application of the step
      function.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         1 : (2 : (3 : []))
         1 + (2 + (3 + 0 ))

      At first glance, ``foldr`` might seem less useful than
      ``foldl``: what use is a function that folds from the right?
      But consider the Prelude's ``filter`` function, which we last
      encountered in the section called 
      `“Selecting pieces of input” <#fp.filter>`__. If we write
      ``filter`` using explicit recursion, it will look something
      like this.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
         filter p []   = []
         filter p (x:xs)
             | p x       = x : filter p xs
             | otherwise = filter p xs

      Perhaps surprisingly, though, we can write ``filter`` as a
      fold, using ``foldr``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         myFilter p xs = foldr step [] xs
             where step x ys | p x       = x : ys
                             | otherwise = ys

      This is the sort of definition that could cause us a headache,
      so let's examine it in a little depth. Like ``foldl``,
      ``foldr`` takes a function and a base case (what to do when the
      input list is empty) as arguments. From reading the type of
      ``filter``, we know that our ``myFilter`` function must return
      a list of the same type as it consumes, so the base case should
      be a list of this type, and the ``step`` helper function must
      return a list.

      Since we know that ``foldr`` calls ``step`` on one element of
      the input list at a time, with the accumulator as its second
      argument, what ``step`` does must be quite simple. If the
      predicate returns ``True``, it pushes that element onto the
      accumulated list; otherwise, it leaves the list untouched.

      The class of functions that we can express using ``foldr`` is
      called *primitive recursive*. A surprisingly large number of
      list manipulation functions are primitive recursive. For
      example, here's ``map`` written in terms of ``foldr``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         myMap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]

         myMap f xs = foldr step [] xs
             where step x ys = f x : ys

      In fact, we can even write ``foldl`` using ``foldr``!

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         myFoldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a

         myFoldl f z xs = foldr step id xs z
             where step x g a = g (f a x)

      .. Tip:: Understanding foldl in terms of foldr

         If you want to set yourself a solid challenge, try
         to follow the above definition of ``foldl`` using
         ``foldr``. Be warned: this is not trivial! You
         might want to have the following tools at hand:
         some headache pills and a glass of water, **ghci**
         (so that you can find out what the ``id`` function
         does), and a pencil and paper.

         You will want to follow the same manual evaluation
         process as we outlined above to see what ``foldl``
         and ``foldr`` were really doing. If you get stuck,
         you may find the task easier after reading the section called 
         `“Partial function application and currying” <#fp.partialapp>`__.

      Returning to our earlier intuitive explanation of what
      ``foldr`` does, another useful way to think about it is that it
      *transforms* its input list. Its first two arguments are “what
      to do with each head/tail element of the list”, and “what to
      substitute for the end of the list”.

      The “identity” transformation with ``foldr`` thus replaces the
      empty list with itself, and applies the list constructor to
      each head/tail pair:

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         identity :: [a] -> [a]
         identity xs = foldr (:) [] xs

      It transforms a list into a copy of itself.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> identity [1,2,3]
         [1,2,3]

      If ``foldr`` replaces the end of a list with some other value,
      this gives us another way to look at Haskell's list append
      function, ``(++)``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> [1,2,3] ++ [4,5,6]
         [1,2,3,4,5,6]

      All we have to do to append a list onto another is substitute
      that second list for the end of our first list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         append :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
         append xs ys = foldr (:) ys xs

      Let's try this out.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> append [1,2,3] [4,5,6]
         [1,2,3,4,5,6]

      Here, we replace each list constructor with another list
      constructor, but we replace the empty list with the list we
      want to append onto the end of our first list.

      As our extended treatment of folds should indicate, the
      ``foldr`` function is nearly as important a member of our
      list-programming toolbox as the more basic list functions we
      saw in the section called 
      `“Working with lists” <#fp.lists>`__. It can
      consume and produce a list incrementally, which makes it useful
      for writing lazy data processing code.

Left folds, laziness, and space leaks
-------------------------------------

      To keep our initial discussion simple, we used ``foldl``
      throughout most of this section. This is convenient for
      testing, but we will never use ``foldl`` in practice.

      The reason has to do with Haskell's non-strict evaluation. If
      we apply ``foldl (+) [1,2,3]``, it evaluates to the expression
      ``(((0 + 1) + 2) + 3)``. We can see this occur if we revisit
      the way in which the function gets expanded.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         foldl (+) 0 (1:2:3:[])
                   == foldl (+) (0 + 1)             (2:3:[])
                   == foldl (+) ((0 + 1) + 2)       (3:[])
                   == foldl (+) (((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) []
                   ==           (((0 + 1) + 2) + 3)

      The final expression will not be evaluated to ``6`` until its
      value is demanded. Before it is evaluated, it must be stored as
      a thunk. Not surprisingly, a thunk is more expensive to store
      than a single number, and the more complex the thunked
      expression, the more space it needs. For something cheap like
      arithmetic, thunking an expresion is more computationally
      expensive than evaluating it immediately. We thus end up paying
      both in space and in time.

      When GHC is evaluating a thunked expression, it uses an
      internal stack to do so. Because a thunked expression could
      potentially be infinitely large, GHC places a fixed limit on
      the maximum size of this stack. Thanks to this limit, we can
      try a large thunked expression in **ghci** without needing to
      worry that it might consume all of memory.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> foldl (+) 0 [1..1000]
         500500

      From looking at the expansion above, we can surmise that this
      creates a thunk that consists of 1000 integers and 999
      applications of ``(+)``. That's a lot of memory and effort to
      represent a single number! With a larger expression, although
      the size is still modest, the results are more dramatic.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> foldl (+) 0 [1..1000000]
         *** Exception: stack overflow

      On small expressions, ``foldl`` will work correctly but slowly,
      due to the thunking overhead that it incurs. We refer to this
      invisible thunking as a *space leak*, because our code is
      operating normally, but using far more memory than it should.

      On larger expressions, code with a space leak will simply fail,
      as above. A space leak with ``foldl`` is a classic roadblock
      for new Haskell programmers. Fortunately, this is easy to
      avoid.

      The ``Data.List`` module defines a function named ``foldl'``
      that is similar to ``foldl``, but does not build up thunks. The
      difference in behavior between the two is immediately obvious.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> foldl  (+) 0 [1..1000000]
         *** Exception: stack overflow
         ghci> :module +Data.List
         ghci> foldl' (+) 0 [1..1000000]
         500000500000

      Due to the thunking behavior of ``foldl``, it is wise to avoid
      this function in real programs: even if it doesn't fail
      outright, it will be unnecessarily inefficient. Instead, import
      ``Data.List`` and use ``foldl'``.

Anonymous (lambda) functions
----------------------------

   In many of the function definitions we've seen so far, we've
   written short helper functions.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/Partial.hs
      isInAny needle haystack = any inSequence haystack
          where inSequence s = needle `isInfixOf` s

   Haskell lets us write completely anonymous functions, which we can
   use to avoid the need to give names to our helper functions.
   Anonymous functions are often called “lambda” functions, in a nod
   to their heritage in the lambda calculus. We introduce an
   anonymous function with a backslash character, ``\``, pronounced
   *lambda* :sup:`[` `9 <#ftn.id594951>`__ :sup:`]`. This is
   followed by the function's arguments (which can include patterns),
   then an arrow ``->`` to introduce the function's body.

   Lambdas are most easily illustrated by example. Here's a rewrite
   of ``isInAny`` using an anonymous function.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/Partial.hs
      isInAny2 needle haystack = any (\s -> needle `isInfixOf` s) haystack

   We've wrapped the lambda in parentheses here so that Haskell can
   tell where the function body ends.

   Anonymous functions behave in every respect identically to
   functions that have names, but Haskell places a few important
   restrictions on how we can define them. Most importantly, while we
   can write a normal function using multiple clauses containing
   different patterns and guards, a lambda can only have a single
   clause in its definition.

   The limitation to a single clause restricts how we can use
   patterns in the definition of a lambda. We'll usually write a
   normal function with several clauses to cover different pattern
   matching possibilities.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/Lambda.hs
      safeHead (x:_) = Just x
      safeHead _ = Nothing

   But as we can't write multiple clauses to define a lambda, we must
   be certain that any patterns we use will match.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/Lambda.hs
      unsafeHead = \(x:_) -> x

   This definition of ``unsafeHead`` will explode in our faces if we
   call it with a value on which pattern matching fails.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type unsafeHead
      unsafeHead :: [t] -> t
      ghci> unsafeHead [1]
      1
      ghci> unsafeHead []
      *** Exception: Lambda.hs:7:13-23: Non-exhaustive patterns in lambda

   The definition typechecks, so it will compile, so the error will
   occur at runtime. The moral of this story is to be careful in how
   you use patterns when defining an anonymous function: make sure
   your patterns can't fail!

   Another thing to notice about the ``isInAny`` and ``isInAny2``
   functions we showed above is that the first version, using a
   helper function that has a name, is a little easier to read than
   the version that plops an anonymous function into the middle. The
   named helper function doesn't disrupt the “flow” of the function
   in which it's used, and the judiciously chosen name gives us a
   little bit of information about what the function is expected to
   do.

   In contrast, when we run across a lambda in the middle of a
   function body, we have to switch gears and read its definition
   fairly carefully to understand what it does. To help with
   readability and maintainability, then, we tend to avoid lambdas in
   many situations where we could use them to trim a few characters
   from a function definition. Very often, we'll use a partially
   applied function instead, resulting in clearer and more readable
   code than either a lambda or an explicit function. Don't know what
   a partially applied function is yet? Read on!

   We don't intend these caveats to suggest that lambdas are useless,
   merely that we ought to be mindful of the potential pitfalls when
   we're thinking of using them. In later chapters, we will see that
   they are often invaluable as “glue”.

Partial function application and currying
-----------------------------------------

   You may wonder why the ``->`` arrow is used for what seems to be
   two purposes in the type signature of a function.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type dropWhile
      dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

   It looks like the ``->`` is separating the arguments to
   ``dropWhile`` from each other, but that it also separates the
   arguments from the return type. But in fact ``->`` has only one
   meaning: it denotes a function that takes an argument of the type
   on the left, and returns a value of the type on the right.

   The implication here is very important: in Haskell, *all functions
   take only one argument*. While ``dropWhile`` *looks* like a
   function that takes two arguments, it is actually a function of
   one argument, which returns a function that takes one argument.
   Here's a perfectly valid Haskell expression.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :module +Data.Char
      ghci> :type dropWhile isSpace
      dropWhile isSpace :: [Char] -> [Char]

   Well, *that* looks useful. The value ``dropWhile isSpace`` is a
   function that strips leading white space from a string. How is
   this useful? As one example, we can use it as an argument to a
   higher order function.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> map (dropWhile isSpace) [" a","f","   e"]
      ["a","f","e"]

   Every time we supply an argument to a function, we can “chop” an
   element off the front of its type signature. Let's take ``zip3``
   as an example to see what we mean; this is a function that zips
   three lists into a list of three-tuples.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type zip3
      zip3 :: [a] -> [b] -> [c] -> [(a, b, c)]
      ghci> zip3 "foo" "bar" "quux"
      [('f','b','q'),('o','a','u'),('o','r','u')]

   If we apply ``zip3`` with just one argument, we get a function
   that accepts two arguments. No matter what arguments we supply to
   this compound function, its first argument will always be the
   fixed value we specified.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type zip3 "foo"
      zip3 "foo" :: [b] -> [c] -> [(Char, b, c)]
      ghci> let zip3foo = zip3 "foo"
      ghci> :type zip3foo
      zip3foo :: [b] -> [c] -> [(Char, b, c)]
      ghci> (zip3 "foo") "aaa" "bbb"
      [('f','a','b'),('o','a','b'),('o','a','b')]
      ghci> zip3foo "aaa" "bbb"
      [('f','a','b'),('o','a','b'),('o','a','b')]
      ghci> zip3foo [1,2,3] [True,False,True]
      [('f',1,True),('o',2,False),('o',3,True)]

   When we pass fewer arguments to a function than the function can
   accept, we call this *partial application* of the function: we're
   applying the function to only some of its arguments.

   In the example above, we have a partially applied function,
   ``zip3 "foo"``, and a new function, ``zip3foo``. We can see that
   the type signatures of the two and their behavior are identical.

   This applies just as well if we fix two arguments, giving us a
   function of just one argument.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> let zip3foobar = zip3 "foo" "bar"
      ghci> :type zip3foobar
      zip3foobar :: [c] -> [(Char, Char, c)]
      ghci> zip3foobar "quux"
      [('f','b','q'),('o','a','u'),('o','r','u')]
      ghci> zip3foobar [1,2]
      [('f','b',1),('o','a',2)]

   Partial function application lets us avoid writing tiresome
   throwaway functions. It's often more useful for this purpose than
   the anonymous functions we introduced in `the section called
   “Anonymous (lambda)
   functions” <#fp.anonymous>`__. Looking
   back at the ``isInAny`` function we defined there, here's how we'd
   use a partially applied function instead of a named helper
   function or a lambda.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/Partial.hs
      isInAny3 needle haystack = any (isInfixOf needle) haystack

   Here, the expression ``isInfixOf needle`` is the partially applied
   function. We're taking the function ``isInfixOf``, and “fixing”
   its first argument to be the ``needle`` variable from our
   parameter list. This gives us a partially applied function that
   has exactly the same type and behavior as the helper and lambda in
   our earlier definitions.

   Partial function application is named *currying*, after the
   logician Haskell Curry (for whom the Haskell language is named).

   As another example of currying in use, let's return to the
   list-summing function we wrote in the section called 
   `“The left fold” <#fp.foldl>`__.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/Sum.hs
      niceSum :: [Integer] -> Integer
      niceSum xs = foldl (+) 0 xs

   We don't need to fully apply ``foldl``; we can omit the list
   ``xs`` from both the parameter list and the parameters to
   ``foldl``, and we'll end up with a more compact function that has
   the same type.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/Sum.hs
      nicerSum :: [Integer] -> Integer
      nicerSum = foldl (+) 0

                  :class: title

Sections
--------

      Haskell provides a handy notational shortcut to let us write a
      partially applied function in infix style. If we enclose an
      operator in parentheses, we can supply its left or right
      argument inside the parentheses to get a partially applied
      function. This kind of partial application is called a
      *section*.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> (1+) 2
         3
         ghci> map (*3) [24,36]
         [72,108]
         ghci> map (2^) [3,5,7,9]
         [8,32,128,512]

      If we provide the left argument inside the section, then
      calling the resulting function with one argument supplies the
      operator's right argument. And vice versa.

      Recall that we can wrap a function name in backquotes to use it
      as an infix operator. This lets us use sections with functions.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type (`elem` ['a'..'z'])
         (`elem` ['a'..'z']) :: Char -> Bool

      The above definition fixes ``elem``'s second argument, giving
      us a function that checks to see whether its argument is a
      lowercase letter.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> (`elem` ['a'..'z']) 'f'
         True

      Using this as an argument to ``all``, we get a function that
      checks an entire string to see if it's all lowercase.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> all (`elem` ['a'..'z']) "Frobozz"
         False

      If we use this style, we can further improve the readability of
      our earlier ``isInAny3`` function.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Partial.hs
         isInAny4 needle haystack = any (needle `isInfixOf`) haystack

As-patterns
-----------

   Haskell's ``tails`` function, in the ``Data.List`` module,
   generalises the ``tail`` function we introduced earlier. Instead
   of returning one “tail” of a list, it returns *all* of them.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :m +Data.List
      ghci> tail "foobar"
      "oobar"
      ghci> tail (tail "foobar")
      "obar"
      ghci> tails "foobar"
      ["foobar","oobar","obar","bar","ar","r",""]

   Each of these strings is a *suffix* of the initial string, so
   ``tails`` produces a list of all suffixes, plus an extra empty
   list at the end. It always produces that extra empty list, even
   when its input list is empty.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> tails []
      [[]]

   What if we want a function that behaves like ``tails``, but which
   *only* returns the non-empty suffixes? One possibility would be
   for us to write our own version by hand. We'll use a new piece of
   notation, the ``@`` symbol.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/SuffixTree.hs
      suffixes :: [a] -> [[a]]
      suffixes xs@(_:xs') = xs : suffixes xs'
      suffixes _ = []

   The pattern ``xs@(_:xs')`` is called an *as-pattern*, and it means
   “bind the variable ``xs`` to the value that matches the right side
   of the ``@`` symbol”.

   In our example, if the pattern after the “@” matches, ``xs`` will
   be bound to the entire list that matched, and ``xs'`` to all but
   the head of the list (we used the wild card ``_`` pattern to
   indicate that we're not interested in the value of the head of the
   list).

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> tails "foo"
      ["foo","oo","o",""]
      ghci> suffixes "foo"
      ["foo","oo","o"]

   The as-pattern makes our code more readable. To see how it helps,
   let us compare a definition that lacks an as-pattern.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/SuffixTree.hs
      noAsPattern :: [a] -> [[a]]
      noAsPattern (x:xs) = (x:xs) : noAsPattern xs
      noAsPattern _ = []

   Here, the list that we've deconstructed in the pattern match just
   gets put right back together in the body of the function.

   As-patterns have a more practical use than simple readability:
   they can help us to share data instead of copying it. In our
   definition of ``noAsPattern``, when we match ``(x:xs)``, we
   construct a new copy of it in the body of our function. This
   causes us to allocate a new list node at run time. That may be
   cheap, but it isn't free. In contrast, when we defined
   ``suffixes``, we reused the value ``xs`` that we matched with our
   as-pattern. Since we reuse an existing value, we avoid a little
   allocation.

               :class: title

Code reuse through composition
------------------------------

   It seems a shame to introduce a new function, ``suffixes``, that
   does almost the same thing as the existing ``tails`` function.
   Surely we can do better?

   Recall the ``init`` function we introduced in the section called
   `“Working with lists” <#fp.lists>`__: it
   returns all but the last element of a list.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/SuffixTree.hs
      suffixes2 xs = init (tails xs)

   This ``suffixes2`` function behaves identically to ``suffixes``,
   but it's a single line of code.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> suffixes2 "foo"
      ["foo","oo","o"]

   If we take a step back, we see the glimmer of a pattern here:
   we're applying a function, then applying another function to its
   result. Let's turn that pattern into a function definition.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/SuffixTree.hs
      compose :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
      compose f g x = f (g x)

   We now have a function, ``compose``, that we can use to “glue” two
   other functions together.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/SuffixTree.hs
      suffixes3 xs = compose init tails xs

   Haskell's automatic currying lets us drop the ``xs`` variable, so
   we can make our definition even shorter.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/SuffixTree.hs
      suffixes4 = compose init tails

   Fortunately, we don't need to write our own ``compose`` function.
   Plugging functions into each other like this is so common that the
   Prelude provides function composition via the ``(.)`` operator.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/SuffixTree.hs
      suffixes5 = init . tails

   The ``(.)`` operator isn't a special piece of language syntax;
   it's just a normal operator.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type (.)
      (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
      ghci> :type suffixes
      suffixes :: [a] -> [[a]]
      ghci> :type suffixes5
      suffixes5 :: [a] -> [[a]]
      ghci> suffixes5 "foo"
      ["foo","oo","o"]

   We can create new functions at any time by writing chains of
   composed functions, stitched together with ``(.)``, so long (of
   course) as the result type of the function on the right of each
   ``(.)`` matches the type of parameter that the function on the
   left can accept.

   As an example, let's solve a simple puzzle: counting the number of
   words in a string that begin with a capital letter.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :module +Data.Char
      ghci> let capCount = length . filter (isUpper . head) . words
      ghci> capCount "Hello there, Mom!"
      2

   We can understand what this composed function does by examining
   its pieces. The ``(.)`` function is right associative, so we will
   proceed from right to left.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type words
      words :: String -> [String]

   The ``words`` function has a result type of [String], so whatever
   is on the left side of ``(.)`` must accept a compatible argument.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type isUpper . head
      isUpper . head :: [Char] -> Bool

   This function returns ``True`` if a word begins with a capital
   letter (try it in **ghci**), so ``filter (isUpper . head)``
   returns a list of Strings containing only words that begin with
   capital letters.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type filter (isUpper . head)
      filter (isUpper . head) :: [[Char]] -> [[Char]]

   Since this expression returns a list, all that remains is
   calculate the length of the list, which we do with another
   composition.

   Here's another example, drawn from a real application. We want to
   extract a list of macro names from a C header file shipped with
   ``libpcap``, a popular network packet filtering library. The
   header file contains a large number definitions of the following
   form.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      #define DLT_EN10MB      1       /* Ethernet (10Mb) */
      #define DLT_EN3MB       2       /* Experimental Ethernet (3Mb) */
      #define DLT_AX25        3       /* Amateur Radio AX.25 */

   Our goal is to extract names such as ``DLT_EN10MB`` and
   ``DLT_AX25``.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/dlts.hs
      import Data.List (isPrefixOf)

      dlts :: String -> [String]

      dlts = foldr step [] . lines

   We treat an entire file as a string, split it up with ``lines``,
   then apply ``foldr step []`` to the resulting list of lines. The
   ``step`` helper function operates on a single line.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch04/dlts.hs
        where step l ds
                | "#define DLT_" `isPrefixOf` l = secondWord l : ds
                | otherwise                     = ds
              secondWord = head . tail . words

   If we match a macro definition with our guard expression, we cons
   the name of the macro onto the head of the list we're returning;
   otherwise, we leave the list untouched.

   While the individual functions in the body of ``secondWord`` are
   by now familiar to us, it can take a little practice to piece
   together a chain of compositions like this. Let's walk through the
   procedure.

   Once again, we proceed from right to left. The first function is
   ``words``.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type words
      words :: String -> [String]
      ghci> words "#define DLT_CHAOS    5"
      ["#define","DLT_CHAOS","5"]

   We then apply ``tail`` to the result of ``words``.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type tail
      tail :: [a] -> [a]
      ghci> tail ["#define","DLT_CHAOS","5"]
      ["DLT_CHAOS","5"]
      ghci> :type tail . words
      tail . words :: String -> [String]
      ghci> (tail . words) "#define DLT_CHAOS    5"
      ["DLT_CHAOS","5"]

   Finally, applying ``head`` to the result of ``drop 1 . words``
   will give us the name of our macro.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type head . tail . words
      head . tail . words :: String -> String
      ghci> (head . tail . words) "#define DLT_CHAOS    5"
      "DLT_CHAOS"

Use your head wisely
--------------------

      After warning against unsafe list functions in `the section
      called “Safely and sanely working with crashy
      functions” <#fp.lists.safe>`__, here
      we are calling both ``head`` and ``tail``, two of those unsafe
      list functions. What gives?

      In this case, we can assure ourselves by inspection that we're
      safe from a runtime failure. The pattern guard in the
      definition of ``step`` contains two words, so when we apply
      ``words`` to any string that makes it past the guard, we'll
      have a list of at least two elements, ``"#define"`` and some
      macro beginning with ``"DLT_"``.

      This the kind of reasoning we ought to do to convince ourselves
      that our code won't explode when we call partial functions.
      Don't forget our earlier admonition: calling unsafe functions
      like this requires care, and can often make our code more
      fragile in subtle ways. If we for some reason modified the
      pattern guard to only contain one word, we could expose
      ourselves to the possibility of a crash, as the body of the
      function assumes that it will receive two words.

Tips for writing readable code
------------------------------

   So far in this chapter, we've come across two tempting looking
   features of Haskell: tail recursion and anonymous functions. As
   nice as these are, we don't often want to use them.

   Many list manipulation operations can be most easily expressed
   using combinations of library functions such as ``map``, ``take``,
   and ``filter``. Without a doubt, it takes some practice to get
   used to using these. In return for our initial investment, we can
   write and read code more quickly, and with fewer bugs.

   The reason for this is simple. A tail recursive function
   definition has the same problem as a loop in an imperative
   language: it's completely general. It might perform some
   filtering, some mapping, or who knows what else. We are forced to
   look in detail at the entire definition of the function to see
   what it's really doing. In contrast, ``map`` and most other list
   manipulation functions do only *one* thing. We can take for
   granted what these simple building blocks do, and focus on the
   idea the code is trying to express, not the minute details of how
   it's manipulating its inputs.

   In the middle ground between tail recursive functions (with
   complete generality) and our toolbox of list manipulation
   functions (each of which does one thing) lie the folds. A fold
   takes more effort to understand than, say, a composition of
   ``map`` and ``filter`` that does the same thing, but it behaves
   more regularly and predictably than a tail recursive function. As
   a general rule, don't use a fold if you can compose some library
   functions, but otherwise try to use a fold in preference to a
   hand-rolled a tail recursive loop.

   As for anonymous functions, they tend to interrupt the “flow” of
   reading a piece of code. It is very often as easy to write a local
   function definition in a ``let`` or ``where`` clause, and use
   that, as it is to put an anonymous function into place. The
   relative advantages of a named function are twofold: we don't need
   to understand the function's definition when we're reading the
   code that uses it; and a well chosen function name acts as a tiny
   piece of local documentation.

Space leaks and strict evaluation
---------------------------------

   The ``foldl`` function that we discussed earlier is not the only
   place where space leaks can arise in Haskell code. We will use it
   to illustrate how non-strict evaluation can sometimes be
   problematic, and how to solve the difficulties that can arise.

   .. Tip:: Do you need to know all of this right now?

      It is perfectly reasonable to skip this section until
      you encounter a space leak “in the wild”. Provided you
      use ``foldr`` if you are generating a list, and
      ``foldl'`` instead of ``foldl`` otherwise, space leaks
      are unlikely to bother you in practice for a while.

                  :class: title

Avoiding space leaks with seq
-----------------------------

      We refer to an expression that is not evaluated lazily as
      *strict*, so ``foldl'`` is a strict left fold. It bypasses
      Haskell's usual non-strict evaluation through the use of a
      special function named ``seq``.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         foldl' _    zero []     = zero
         foldl' step zero (x:xs) =
             let new = step zero x
             in  new `seq` foldl' step new xs

      This ``seq`` function has a peculiar type, hinting that it is
      not playing by the usual rules.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :type seq
         seq :: a -> t -> t

      It operates as follows: when a ``seq`` expression is evaluated,
      it forces its first argument to be evaluated, then returns its
      second argument. It doesn't actually do anything with the first
      argument: ``seq`` exists solely as a way to force that value to
      be evaluated. Let's walk through a brief application to see
      what happens.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         foldl' (+) 1 (2:[])

      This expands as follows.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         let new = 1 + 2
         in new `seq` foldl' (+) new []

      The use of ``seq`` forcibly evaluates ``new`` to ``3``, and
      returns its second argument.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         foldl' (+) 3 []

      We end up with the following result.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         3

      Thanks to ``seq``, there are no thunks in sight.

                  :class: title

Learning to use seq
-------------------

      Without some direction, there is an element of mystery to using
      ``seq`` effectively. Here are some useful rules for using it
      well.

      To have any effect, a ``seq`` expression must be the first
      thing evaluated in an expression.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         -- incorrect: seq is hidden by the application of someFunc
         -- since someFunc will be evaluated first, seq may occur too late
         hiddenInside x y = someFunc (x `seq` y)

         -- incorrect: a variation of the above mistake
         hiddenByLet x y z = let a = x `seq` someFunc y
                             in anotherFunc a z

         -- correct: seq will be evaluated first, forcing evaluation of x
         onTheOutside x y = x `seq` someFunc y

      To strictly evaluate several values, chain applications of
      ``seq`` together.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         chained x y z = x `seq` y `seq` someFunc z

      A common mistake is to try to use ``seq`` with two unrelated
      expressions.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         badExpression step zero (x:xs) =
             seq (step zero x)
                 (badExpression step (step zero x) xs)

      Here, the apparent intention is to evaluate ``step zero x``
      strictly. Since the expression is duplicated in the body of the
      function, strictly evaluating the first instance of it will
      have no effect on the second. The use of ``let`` from the
      definition of ``foldl'`` above shows how to achieve this effect
      correctly.

      When evaluating an expression, ``seq`` stops as soon as it
      reaches a constructor. For simple types like numbers, this
      means that it will evaluate them completely. Algebraic data
      types are a different story. Consider the value
      ``(1+2):(3+4):[]``. If we apply ``seq`` to this, it will
      evaluate the ``(1+2)`` thunk. Since it will stop when it
      reaches the first ``(:)`` constructor, it will have no effect
      on the second thunk. The same is true for tuples:
      ``seq ((1+2),(3+4)) True`` will do nothing to the thunks inside
      the pair, since it immediately hits the pair's constructor.

      If necessary, we can use normal functional programming
      techniques to work around these limitations.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch04/Fold.hs
         strictPair (a,b) = a `seq` b `seq` (a,b)

         strictList (x:xs) = x `seq` x : strictList xs
         strictList []     = []

      It is important to understand that ``seq`` isn't free: it has
      to perform a check at runtime to see if an expression has been
      evaluated. Use it sparingly. For instance, while our
      ``strictPair`` function evaluates the contents of a pair up to
      the first constructor, it adds the overheads of pattern
      matching, two applications of ``seq``, and the construction of
      a new tuple. If we were to measure its performance in the inner
      loop of a benchmark, we might find it to slow the program down.

      Aside from its performance cost if overused, ``seq`` is not a
      miracle cure-all for memory consumption problems. Just because
      you *can* evaluate something strictly doesn't mean you
      *should*. Careless use of ``seq`` may do nothing at all; move
      existing space leaks around; or introduce new leaks.

      The best guides to whether ``seq`` is necessary, and how well
      it is working, are performance measurement and profiling, which
      we will cover in `Chapter 25, Profiling and
      optimization <profiling-and-optimization.html>`__. From a base
      of empirical measurement, you will develop a reliable sense of
      when ``seq`` is most useful.

            .. rubric:: A whirlwind tour of JSON
               :name: id597922
               :class: title

   In this chapter, we'll develop a small, but complete, Haskell
   library. Our library will manipulate and serialize data in a
   popular form known as JSON.

   The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) language is a small, simple
   representation for storing and transmitting structured data, for
   example over a network connection. It is most commonly used to
   transfer data from a web service to a browser-based JavaScript
   application. The JSON format is described at
   `www.json.org <http://www.json.org/>`__, and in greater detail by
   `RFC 4627 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt>`__.

   JSON supports four basic types of value: strings, numbers,
   booleans, and a special value named ``null``.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      "a string" 12345 true
            null

   The language provides two compound types: an *array* is an ordered
   sequence of values, and an *object* is an unordered collection of
   name/value pairs. The names in an object are always strings; the
   values in an object or array can be of any type.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      [-3.14, true, null, "a string"]
            {"numbers": [1,2,3,4,5], "useful": false}

               :name: library.jvalue
               :class: title

   To work with JSON data in Haskell, we use an algebraic data type
   to represent the range of possible JSON types.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/SimpleJSON.hs
      data JValue = JString String
                  | JNumber Double
                  | JBool Bool
                  | JNull
                  | JObject [(String, JValue)]
                  | JArray [JValue]
                    deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

   For each JSON type, we supply a distinct value constructor. Some
   of these constructors have parameters: if we want to construct a
   JSON string, we must provide a String value as an argument to the
   ``JString`` constructor.

   To start experimenting with this code, save the file
   ``SimpleJSON.hs`` in your editor, switch to a **ghci** window, and
   load the file into **ghci**.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :load SimpleJSON
      [1 of 1] Compiling SimpleJSON       ( SimpleJSON.hs, interpreted )
      Ok, modules loaded: SimpleJSON.
      ghci> JString "foo"
      JString "foo"
      ghci> JNumber 2.7
      JNumber 2.7
      ghci> :type JBool True
      JBool True :: JValue

   We can see how to use a constructor to take a normal Haskell value
   and turn it into a JValue. To do the reverse, we use pattern
   matching. Here's a function that we can add to ``SimpleJSON.hs``
   that will extract a string from a JSON value for us. If the JSON
   value actually contains a string, our function will wrap the
   string with the ``Just`` constructor. Otherwise, it will return
   ``Nothing``.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/SimpleJSON.hs
      getString :: JValue -> Maybe String
      getString (JString s) = Just s
      getString _           = Nothing

   When we save the modified source file, we can reload it in
   **ghci** and try the new definition. (The **:reload** command
   remembers the last source file we loaded, so we do not need to
   name it explicitly.)

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :reload
      Ok, modules loaded: SimpleJSON.
      ghci> getString (JString "hello")
      Just "hello"
      ghci> getString (JNumber 3)
      Nothing

   A few more accessor functions, and we've got a small body of code
   to work with.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/SimpleJSON.hs
      getInt (JNumber n) = Just (truncate n)
      getInt _           = Nothing

      getDouble (JNumber n) = Just n
      getDouble _           = Nothing

      getBool (JBool b) = Just b
      getBool _         = Nothing

      getObject (JObject o) = Just o
      getObject _           = Nothing

      getArray (JArray a) = Just a
      getArray _          = Nothing

      isNull v            = v == JNull

   The ``truncate`` function turns a floating point or rational
   number into an integer by dropping the digits after the decimal
   point.

               :name: library.anatomy
               :class: title

   A Haskell source file contains a definition of a single *module*.
   A module lets us determine which names inside the module are
   accessible from other modules.

   A source file begins with a *module declaration*. This must
   precede all other definitions in the source file.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/SimpleJSON.hs
      module SimpleJSON
          (
            JValue(..)
          , getString
          , getInt
          , getDouble
          , getBool
          , getObject
          , getArray
          , isNull
          ) where

   The word ``module`` is reserved. It is followed by the name of the
   module, which must begin with a capital letter. A source file must
   have the same *base name* (the component before the suffix) as the
   name of the module it contains. This is why our file
   ``SimpleJSON.hs`` contains a module named ``SimpleJSON``.

   Following the module name is a list of *exports*, enclosed in
   parentheses. The ``where`` keyword indicates that the body of the
   module follows.

   The list of exports indicates which names in this module are
   visible to other modules. This lets us keep private code hidden
   from the outside world. The special notation ``(..)`` that follows
   the name ``JValue`` indicates that we are exporting both the type
   and all of its constructors.

   It might seem strange that we can export a type's name (i.e. its
   type constructor), but not its value constructors. The ability to
   do this is important: it lets us hide the details of a type from
   its users, making the type *abstract*. If we cannot see a type's
   value constructors, we cannot pattern match against a value of
   that type, nor can we construct a new value of that type. Later in
   this chapter, we'll discuss some situations in which we might want
   to make a type abstract.

   If we omit the exports (and the parentheses that enclose them)
   from a module declaration, every name in the module will be
   exported.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Exporting.hs
      module ExportEverything where

   To export no names at all (which is rarely useful), we write an
   empty export list using a pair of parentheses.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Exporting.hs
      module ExportNothing () where

               :name: id598438
               :class: title

   In addition to the **ghci** interpreter, the GHC distribution
   includes a compiler, **ghc**, that generates native code. If you
   are already familiar with a command line compiler such as **gcc**
   or **cl** (the C++ compiler component of Microsoft's Visual
   Studio), you'll immediately be at home with **ghc**.

   To compile a source file, we first open a terminal or command
   prompt window, then invoke **ghc** with the name of the source
   file to compile.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      ghc -c SimpleJSON.hs

   The ``-c`` option tells **ghc** to only generate object code. If
   we were to omit the ``-c`` option, the compiler would attempt to
   generate a complete executable. That would fail, because we
   haven't written a ``main`` function, which GHC calls to start the
   execution of a standalone program.

   After **ghc** completes, if we list the contents of the directory,
   it should contain two new files: ``SimpleJSON.hi`` and
   ``SimpleJSON.o``. The former is an *interface file*, in which
   **ghc** stores information about the names exported from our
   module in machine-readable form. The latter is an *object file*,
   which contains the generated machine code.

      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Main.hs
      module Main () where

      import SimpleJSON

      main = print (JObject [("foo", JNumber 1), ("bar", JBool False)])

   Notice the ``import`` directive that follows the module
   declaration. This indicates that we want to take all of the names
   that are exported from the ``SimpleJSON`` module, and make them
   available in our module. Any ``import`` directives must appear in
   a group at the beginning of a module. They must appear after the
   module declaration, but before all other code. We cannot, for
   example, scatter them throughout a source file.

   Our choice of naming for the source file and function is
   deliberate. To create an executable, **ghc** expects a module
   named ``Main`` that contains a function named ``main``. The
   ``main`` function is the one that will be called when we run the
   program once we've built it.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      ghc -o simple Main.hs SimpleJSON.o

   This time around, we're omitting the ``-c`` option when we invoke
   **ghc**, so it will attempt to generate an executable. The process
   of generating an executable is called *linking*. As our command
   line suggests, **ghc** is perfectly able to both compile source
   files and link an executable in a single invocation.

   We pass **ghc** a new option, ``-o``, which takes one argument:
   this is the name of the executable that **ghc** should
   create :sup:`[` `10 <#ftn.id598725>`__ :sup:`]`. Here, we've
   decided to name the program ``simple``. On Windows, the program
   will have the suffix ``.exe``, but on Unix variants there will not
   be a suffix.

   Finally, we supply the name of our new source file, ``Main.hs``,
   and the object file we already compiled, ``SimpleJSON.o``. We must
   explicitly list every one of our files that contains code that
   should end up in the executable. If we forget a source or object
   file, **ghc** will complain about *undefined symbols*, which
   indicates that some of the definitions that it needs are not
   provided in the files we have supplied.

   When compiling, we can pass **ghc** any mixture of source and
   object files. If **ghc** notices that it has already compiled a
   source file into an object file, it will only recompile the source
   file if we've modified it.

   Once **ghc** has finished compiling and linking our ``simple``
   program, we can run it from the command line.

               :name: id598831
               :class: title

   Now that we have a Haskell representation for JSON's types, we'd
   like to be able to take Haskell values and render them as JSON
   data.

   There are a few ways we could go about this. Perhaps the most
   direct would be to write a rendering function that prints a value
   in JSON form. Once we're done, we'll explore some more interesting
   approaches.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PutJSON.hs
      module PutJSON where

      import Data.List (intercalate)
      import SimpleJSON

      renderJValue :: JValue -> String

      renderJValue (JString s)   = show s
      renderJValue (JNumber n)   = show n
      renderJValue (JBool True)  = "true"
      renderJValue (JBool False) = "false"
      renderJValue JNull         = "null"

      renderJValue (JObject o) = "{" ++ pairs o ++ "}"
        where pairs [] = ""
              pairs ps = intercalate ", " (map renderPair ps)
              renderPair (k,v)   = show k ++ ": " ++ renderJValue v

      renderJValue (JArray a) = "[" ++ values a ++ "]"
        where values [] = ""
              values vs = intercalate ", " (map renderJValue vs)

   Good Haskell style involves separating pure code from code that
   performs I/O. Our ``renderJValue`` function has no interaction
   with the outside world, but we still need to be able to print a
   JValue.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PutJSON.hs
      putJValue :: JValue -> IO ()
      putJValue v = putStrLn (renderJValue v)

   Printing a JSON value is now easy.

   Why should we separate the rendering code from the code that
   actually prints a value? This gives us flexibility. For instance,
   if we wanted to compress the data before writing it out, and we
   intermixed rendering with printing, it would be much more
   difficult to adapt our code to that change in circumstances.

   This idea of separating pure from impure code is powerful, and
   pervasive in Haskell code. Several Haskell compression libraries
   exist, all of which have simple interfaces: a compression function
   accepts an uncompressed string and returns a compressed string. We
   can use function composition to render JSON data to a string, then
   compress to another string, postponing any decision on how to
   actually display or transmit the data.

            .. rubric:: Type inference is a double-edged sword
               :name: id598932
               :class: title

   A Haskell compiler's ability to infer types is powerful and
   valuable. Early on, you'll probably be faced by a strong
   temptation to take advantage of type inference by omitting as many
   type declarations as possible: let's simply make the compiler
   figure the whole lot out!

   Skimping on explicit type information has a downside, one that
   disproportionately affects new Haskell programmer. As a new
   Haskell programmer, we're extremely likely to write code that will
   fail to compile due to straightforward type errors.

   When we omit explicit type information, we force the compiler to
   figure out our intentions. It will infer types that are logical
   and consistent, but perhaps not at all what we meant. If we and
   the compiler unknowingly disagree about what is going on, it will
   naturally take us longer to find the source of our problem.

   Suppose, for instance, that we write a function that we believe
   returns a String, but we don't write a type signature for it.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Trouble.hs
      upcaseFirst (c:cs) = toUpper c -- forgot ":cs" here

   Here, we want to upper-case the first character of a word, but
   we've forgotten to append the rest of the word onto the result. We
   think our function's type is String -> String, but the compiler
   will correctly infer its type as String -> Char. Let's say we then
   try to use this function somewhere else.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Trouble.hs
      camelCase :: String -> String
      camelCase xs = concat (map upcaseFirst (words xs))

   When we try to compile this code or load it into **ghci**, we
   won't necessarily get an obvious error message.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :load Trouble
      [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Trouble.hs, interpreted )

      Trouble.hs:9:27:
          Couldn't match expected type `[Char]' against inferred type `Char'
            Expected type: [Char] -> [Char]
            Inferred type: [Char] -> Char
          In the first argument of `map', namely `upcaseFirst'
          In the first argument of `concat', namely
              `(map upcaseFirst (words xs))'
      Failed, modules loaded: none.

   Notice that the error is reported where we *use* the
   ``upcaseFirst`` function. If we're erroneously convinced that our
   definition and type for ``upcaseFirst`` are correct, we may end up
   staring at the wrong piece of code for quite a while, until
   enlightenment strikes.

   Every time we write a type signature, we remove a degree of
   freedom from the type inference engine. This reduces the
   likelihood of divergence between our understanding of our code and
   the compiler's. Type declarations also act as shorthand for
   ourselves as readers of our own code, making it easier for us to
   develop a sense of what must be going on.

   This is not to say that we need to pepper every tiny fragment of
   code with a type declaration. It is, however, usually good form to
   add a signature to every top-level definition in our code. It's
   best to start out fairly aggressive with explicit type signatures,
   and slowly ease back as your mental model of how type checking
   works becomes more accurate.

   .. Tip:: Explicit types, undefined values, and error

      The special value ``undefined`` will happily typecheck
      no matter where we use it, as will an expression like
      ``error "argh!"``. It is especially important that we
      write type signatures when we use these. Suppose we
      use ``undefined`` or ``error "write me"`` to act as a
      placeholder in the body of a top-level definition. If
      we omit a type signature, we may be able to use the
      value we have defined in places where a correctly
      typed version would be rejected by the compiler. This
      can easily lead us astray.

               :name: id599139
               :class: title

   Our JSON rendering code is narrowly tailored to the exact needs of
   our data types and the JSON formatting conventions. The output it
   produces can be unfriendly to human eyes. We will now look at
   rendering as a more generic task: how can we build a library that
   is useful for rendering data in a variety of situations?

   We would like to produce output that is suitable either for human
   consumption (e.g. for debugging) or for machine processing.
   Libraries that perform this job are referred to as *pretty
   printers*. There already exist several Haskell pretty printing
   libraries. We are creating one of our own not to replace them, but
   for the many useful insights we will gain into both library design
   and functional programming techniques.

   We will call our generic pretty printing module ``Prettify``, so
   our code will go into a source file named ``Prettify.hs``.

   .. Note:: Naming

      In our ``Prettify`` module, we will base our names on
      those used by several established Haskell pretty
      printing libraries. This will give us a degree of
      compatibility with existing mature libraries.

   To make sure that ``Prettify`` meets practical needs, we write a
   new JSON renderer that uses the ``Prettify`` API. After we're
   done, we'll go back and fill in the details of the ``Prettify``
   module.

   Instead of rendering straight to a string, our ``Prettify`` module
   will use an abstract type that we'll call Doc. By basing our
   generic rendering library on an abstract type, we can choose an
   implementation that is flexible and efficient. If we decide to
   change the underlying code, our users will not be able to tell.

   We will name our new JSON rendering module ``PrettyJSON.hs``, and
   retain the name ``renderJValue`` for the rendering function.
   Rendering one of the basic JSON values is straightforward.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyJSON.hs
      renderJValue :: JValue -> Doc
      renderJValue (JBool True)  = text "true"
      renderJValue (JBool False) = text "false"
      renderJValue JNull         = text "null"
      renderJValue (JNumber num) = double num
      renderJValue (JString str) = string str

   The ``text``, ``double``, and ``string`` functions will be
   provided by our ``Prettify`` module.

            .. rubric:: Developing Haskell code without going nuts
               :name: id599306
               :class: title

   Early on, as we come to grips with Haskell development, we have so
   many new, unfamiliar concepts to keep track of at one time that it
   can be a challenge to write code that compiles at all.

   As we write our first substantial body of code, it's a *huge* help
   to pause every few minutes and try to compile what we've produced
   so far. Because Haskell is so strongly typed, if our code compiles
   cleanly, we're assuring ourselves that we're not wandering too far
   off into the programming weeds.

   One useful technique for quickly developing the skeleton of a
   program is to write placeholder, or *stub* versions of types and
   functions. For instance, we mentioned above that our ``string``,
   ``text`` and ``double`` functions would be provided by our
   ``Prettify`` module. If we don't provide definitions for those
   functions or the Doc type, our attempts to “compile early, compile
   often” with our JSON renderer will fail, as the compiler won't
   know anything about those functions. To avoid this problem, we
   write stub code that doesn't do anything.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyStub.hs
      import SimpleJSON

      data Doc = ToBeDefined
               deriving (Show)

      string :: String -> Doc
      string str = undefined

      text :: String -> Doc
      text str = undefined

      double :: Double -> Doc
      double num = undefined

   The special value ``undefined`` has the type ``a``, so it always
   typechecks, no matter where we use it. If we attempt to evaluate
   it, it will cause our program to crash.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> :type undefined
      undefined :: a
      ghci> undefined
      *** Exception: Prelude.undefined
      ghci> :type double
      double :: Double -> Doc
      ghci> double 3.14
      *** Exception: Prelude.undefined

   Even though we can't yet run our stubbed code, the compiler's type
   checker will ensure that our program is sensibly typed.

               :name: id599468
               :class: title

   When we must pretty print a string value, JSON has moderately
   involved escaping rules that we must follow. At the highest level,
   a string is just a series of characters wrapped in quotes.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyJSON.hs
      string :: String -> Doc
      string = enclose '"' '"' . hcat . map oneChar

   .. Note:: Point-free style

      This style of writing a definition exclusively as a
      composition of other functions is called *point-free
      style*. The use of the word “point” is not related to
      the “ ``.`` ” character used for function
      composition. The term *point* is roughly synonymous
      (in Haskell) with *value*, so a *point-free*
      expression makes no mention of the values that it
      operates on.

      Contrast the point-free definition of ``string`` above
      with this “pointy” version, which uses a variable
      ``s`` to refer to the value on which it operates.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch05/PrettyJSON.hs
         pointyString :: String -> Doc
         pointyString s = enclose '"' '"' (hcat (map oneChar s))

   The ``enclose`` function simply wraps a Doc value with an opening
   and closing character.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyJSON.hs
      enclose :: Char -> Char -> Doc -> Doc
      enclose left right x = char left <> x <> char right

   We provide a ``(<>)`` function in our pretty printing library. It
   appends two Doc values, so it's the Doc equivalent of ``(++)``.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyStub.hs
      (<>) :: Doc -> Doc -> Doc
      a <> b = undefined

      char :: Char -> Doc
      char c = undefined

   Our pretty printing library also provides ``hcat``, which
   concatenates multiple Doc values into one: it's the analogue of
   ``concat`` for lists.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyStub.hs
      hcat :: [Doc] -> Doc
      hcat xs = undefined

   Our ``string`` function applies the ``oneChar`` function to every
   character in a string, concatenates the lot, and encloses the
   result in quotes. The ``oneChar`` function escapes or renders an
   individual character.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyJSON.hs
      oneChar :: Char -> Doc
      oneChar c = case lookup c simpleEscapes of
                    Just r -> text r
                    Nothing | mustEscape c -> hexEscape c
                            | otherwise    -> char c
          where mustEscape c = c < ' ' || c == '\x7f' || c > '\xff'

      simpleEscapes :: [(Char, String)]
      simpleEscapes = zipWith ch "\b\n\f\r\t\\\"/" "bnfrt\\\"/"
          where ch a b = (a, ['\\',b])

   The ``simpleEscapes`` value is a list of pairs. We call a list of
   pairs an *association list*, or *alist* for short. Each element of
   our alist associates a character with its escaped representation.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> take 4 simpleEscapes
      [('\b',"\\b"),('\n',"\\n"),('\f',"\\f"),('\r',"\\r")]

   Our ``case`` expression attempts to see if our character has a
   match in this alist. If we find the match, we emit it, otherwise
   we might need to escape the character in a more complicated way.
   If so, we perform this escaping. Only if neither kind of escaping
   is required do we emit the plain character. To be conservative,
   the only unescaped characters we emit are printable ASCII
   characters.

   The more complicated escaping involves turning a character into
   the string “ ``\u`` ” followed by a four-character sequence of
   hexadecimal digits representing the numeric value of the Unicode
   character.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyJSON.hs
      smallHex :: Int -> Doc
      smallHex x  = text "\\u"
                 <> text (replicate (4 - length h) '0')
                 <> text h
          where h = showHex x ""

   The ``showHex`` function comes from the ``Numeric`` library (you
   will need to import this at the beginning of ``Prettify.hs``), and
   returns a hexadecimal representation of a number.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> showHex 114111 ""
      "1bdbf"

   The ``replicate`` function is provided by the Prelude, and builds
   a fixed-length repeating list of its argument.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> replicate 5 "foo"
      ["foo","foo","foo","foo","foo"]

   There's a wrinkle: the four-digit encoding that ``smallHex``
   provides can only represent Unicode characters up to ``0xffff``.
   Valid Unicode characters can range up to ``0x10ffff``. To properly
   represent a character above ``0xffff`` in a JSON string, we follow
   some complicated rules to split it into two. This gives us an
   opportunity to perform some bit-level manipulation of Haskell
   numbers.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyJSON.hs
      astral :: Int -> Doc
      astral n = smallHex (a + 0xd800) <> smallHex (b + 0xdc00)
          where a = (n `shiftR` 10) .&. 0x3ff
                b = n .&. 0x3ff

   The ``shiftR`` function comes from the ``Data.Bits`` module, and
   shifts a number to the right. The ``(.&.)`` function, also from
   ``Data.Bits``, performs a bit-level *and* of two values.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> 0x10000 `shiftR` 4   :: Int
      4096
      ghci> 7 .&. 2   :: Int
      2

   Now that we've written ``smallHex`` and ``astral``, we can provide
   a definition for ``hexEscape``.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyJSON.hs
      hexEscape :: Char -> Doc
      hexEscape c | d < 0x10000 = smallHex d
                  | otherwise   = astral (d - 0x10000)
        where d = ord c

               :name: id600000
               :class: title

   Compared to strings, pretty printing arrays and objects is a snap.
   We already know that the two are visually similar: each starts
   with an opening character, followed by a series of values
   separated with commas, followed by a closing character. Let's
   write a function that captures the common structure of arrays and
   objects.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyJSON.hs
      series :: Char -> Char -> (a -> Doc) -> [a] -> Doc
      series open close item = enclose open close
                             . fsep . punctuate (char ',') . map item

   We'll start by interpreting this function's type. It takes an
   opening and closing character, then a function that knows how to
   pretty print a value of some unknown type ``a``, followed by a
   list of values of type ``a``, and it returns a value of type Doc.

   Notice that although our type signature mentions four parameters,
   we have only listed three in the definition of the function. We
   are simply following the same rule that lets us simplify a
   definiton like ``myLength xs = length xs`` to
   ``myLength = length``.

   We have already written ``enclose``, which wraps a Doc value in
   opening and closing characters. The ``fsep`` function will live in
   our ``Prettify`` module. It combines a list of Doc values into
   one, possibly wrapping lines if the output will not fit on a
   single line.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyStub.hs
      fsep :: [Doc] -> Doc
      fsep xs = undefined

   By now, you should be able to define your own stubs in
   ``Prettify.hs``, by following the examples we have supplied. We
   will not explicitly define any more stubs.

   The ``punctuate`` function will also live in our ``Prettify``
   module, and we can define it in terms of functions for which we've
   already written stubs.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
      punctuate :: Doc -> [Doc] -> [Doc]
      punctuate p []     = []
      punctuate p [d]    = [d]
      punctuate p (d:ds) = (d <> p) : punctuate p ds

   With this definition of ``series``, pretty printing an array is
   entirely straightforward. We add this equation to the end of the
   block we've already written for our ``renderJValue`` function.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyJSON.hs
      renderJValue (JArray ary) = series '[' ']' renderJValue ary

   To pretty print an object, we need to do only a little more work:
   for each element, we have both a name and a value to deal with.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyJSON.hs
      renderJValue (JObject obj) = series '{' '}' field obj
          where field (name,val) = string name
                                <> text ": "
                                <> renderJValue val

               :name: id600205
               :class: title

   Now that we have written the bulk of our ``PrettyJSON.hs`` file,
   we must go back to the top and add a module declaration.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/PrettyJSON.hs
      module PrettyJSON
          (
            renderJValue
          ) where

      import Numeric (showHex)
      import Data.Char (ord)
      import Data.Bits (shiftR, (.&.))

      import SimpleJSON (JValue(..))
      import Prettify (Doc, (<>), char, double, fsep, hcat, punctuate, text,
                       compact, pretty)

   We export just one name from this module: ``renderJValue``, our
   JSON rendering function. The other definitions in the module exist
   purely to support ``renderJValue``, so there's no reason to make
   them visible to other modules.

   Regarding imports, the ``Numeric`` and ``Data.Bits`` modules are
   distributed with GHC. We've already written the ``SimpleJSON``
   module, and filled our ``Prettify`` module with skeletal
   definitions. Notice that there's no difference in the way we
   import standard modules from those we've written ourselves.

   With each ``import`` directive, we explicitly list each of the
   names we want to bring into our module's namespace. This is not
   required: if we omit the list of names, all of the names exported
   from a module will be available to us. However, it's generally a
   good idea to write an explicit import list.

   .. container:: itemizedlist

      -  An explicit list makes it clear which names we're importing
         from where. This will make it easier for a reader to look up
         documentation if they encounter an unfamiliar function.

      -  Occasionally, a library maintainer will remove or rename a
         function. If a function disappears from a third party module
         that we use, any resulting compilation error is likely to
         happen long after we've written the module. The explicit
         list of imported names can act as a reminder to ourselves of
         where we had been importing the missing name from, which
         will help us to pinpoint the problem more quickly.

      -  It can also occur that someone will add a name to a module
         that is identical to a name already in our own code. If we
         don't use an explicit import list, we'll end up with the
         same name in our module twice. If we use that name, GHC will
         report an error due to the ambiguity. An explicit list lets
         us avoid the possibility of accidentally importing an
         unexpected new name.

   This idea of using explicit imports is a guideline that usually
   makes sense, not a hard-and-fast rule. Occasionally, we'll need so
   many names from a module that listing each one becomes messy. In
   other cases, a module might be so widely used that a moderately
   experienced Haskell programmer will probably know which names come
   from that module.

   In our ``Prettify`` module, we represent our Doc type as an
   algebraic data type.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
      data Doc = Empty
               | Char Char
               | Text String
               | Line
               | Concat Doc Doc
               | Union Doc Doc
                 deriving (Show,Eq)

   Observe that the Doc type is actually a tree. The ``Concat`` and
   ``Union`` constructors create an internal node from two other Doc
   values, while the ``Empty`` and other simple constructors build
   leaves.

   In the header of our module, we will export the name of the type,
   but not any of its constructors: this will prevent modules that
   use the Doc type from creating and pattern matching against Doc
   values.

   Instead, to create a Doc, a user of the ``Prettify`` module will
   call a function that we provide. Here are the simple construction
   functions. As we add real definitions, we must replace any stubbed
   versions already in the ``Prettify.hs`` source file.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
      empty :: Doc
      empty = Empty

      char :: Char -> Doc
      char c = Char c

      text :: String -> Doc
      text "" = Empty
      text s  = Text s

      double :: Double -> Doc
      double d = text (show d)

   The ``Line`` constructor represents a line break. The ``line``
   function creates *hard* line breaks, which always appear in the
   pretty printer's output. Sometimes we'll want a *soft* line break,
   which is only used if a line is too wide to fit in a window or
   page. We'll introduce a ``softline`` function shortly.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
      line :: Doc
      line = Line

   Almost as simple as the basic constructors is the ``(<>)``
   function, which concatenates two Doc values.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
      (<>) :: Doc -> Doc -> Doc
      Empty <> y = y
      x <> Empty = x
      x <> y = x `Concat` y

   We pattern match against ``Empty`` so that concatenating a Doc
   value with ``Empty`` on the left or right will have no effect.
   This keeps us from bloating the tree with useless values.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: screen

      ghci> text "foo" <> text "bar"
      Concat (Text "foo") (Text "bar")
      ghci> text "foo" <> empty
      Text "foo"
      ghci> empty <> text "bar"
      Text "bar"

   .. Tip:: A mathematical moment

      If we briefly put on our mathematical hats, we can say
      that ``Empty`` is the identity under concatenation,
      since nothing happens if we concatenate a Doc value
      with ``Empty``. In a similar vein, 0 is the identity
      for adding numbers, and 1 is the identity for
      multiplying them. Taking the mathematical perspective
      has useful practical consequences, as we will see in a
      number of places throughout this book.

   Our ``hcat`` and ``fsep`` functions concatenate a list of Doc
   values into one. In `the section called
   “Exercises” <functional-programming.html#fp.fold.exercises>`__, we
   mentioned that we could define concatenation for lists using
   ``foldr``.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Concat.hs
      concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
      concat = foldr (++) []

   Since ``(<>)`` is analogous to ``(++)``, and ``empty`` to ``[]``,
   we can see how we might write ``hcat`` and ``fsep`` as folds, too.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
      hcat :: [Doc] -> Doc
      hcat = fold (<>)

      fold :: (Doc -> Doc -> Doc) -> [Doc] -> Doc
      fold f = foldr f empty

   The definition of ``fsep`` depends on several other functions.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
      fsep :: [Doc] -> Doc
      fsep = fold (</>)

      (</>) :: Doc -> Doc -> Doc
      x </> y = x <> softline <> y

      softline :: Doc
      softline = group line

   These take a little explaining. The ``softline`` function should
   insert a newline if the current line has become too wide, or a
   space otherwise. How can we do this if our Doc type doesn't
   contain any information about rendering? Our answer is that every
   time we encounter a soft newline, we maintain *two* alternative
   representations of the document, using the ``Union`` constructor.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
      group :: Doc -> Doc
      group x = flatten x `Union` x

   Our ``flatten`` function replaces a ``Line`` with a space, turning
   two lines into one longer line.

   .. code:: haskell
      :class: programlisting

      -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
      flatten :: Doc -> Doc
      flatten (x `Concat` y) = flatten x `Concat` flatten y
      flatten Line           = Char ' '
      flatten (x `Union` _)  = flatten x
      flatten other          = other

   Notice that we always call ``flatten`` on the left element of a
   ``Union``: the left of each ``Union`` is always the same width (in
   characters) as, or wider than, the right. We'll be making use of
   this property in our rendering functions below.

   .. container:: sect2

      .. container:: titlepage

         .. container::

            .. container::

               .. rubric:: Compact rendering
                  :name: id600830
                  :class: title

      We frequently need to use a representation for a piece of data
      that contains as few characters as possible. For example, if
      we're sending JSON data over a network connection, there's no
      sense in laying it out nicely: the software on the far end
      won't care whether the data is pretty or not, and the added
      white space needed to make the layout look good would add a lot
      of overhead.

      For these cases, and because it's a simple piece of code to
      start with, we provide a bare-bones compact rendering function.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
         compact :: Doc -> String
         compact x = transform [x]
             where transform [] = ""
                   transform (d:ds) =
                       case d of
                         Empty        -> transform ds
                         Char c       -> c : transform ds
                         Text s       -> s ++ transform ds
                         Line         -> '\n' : transform ds
                         a `Concat` b -> transform (a:b:ds)
                         _ `Union` b  -> transform (b:ds)

      The ``compact`` function wraps its argument in a list, and
      applies the ``transform`` helper function to it. The
      ``transform`` function treats its argument as a stack of items
      to process, where the first element of the list is the top of
      the stack.

      The ``transform`` function's ``(d:ds)`` pattern breaks the
      stack into its head, ``d``, and the remainder, ``ds``. In our
      ``case`` expression, the first several branches recurse on
      ``ds``, consuming one item from the stack for each recursive
      application. The last two branches add items in front of
      ``ds``: the ``Concat`` branch adds both elements to the stack,
      while the ``Union`` branch ignores its left element, on which
      we called ``flatten``, and adds its right element to the stack.

      We have now fleshed out enough of our original skeletal
      definitions that we can try out our ``compact`` function in
      **ghci**.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> let value = renderJValue (JObject [("f", JNumber 1), ("q", JBool True)])
         ghci> :type value
         value :: Doc
         ghci> putStrLn (compact value)
         {"f": 1.0,
         "q": true
         }

      To better understand how the code works, let's look at a
      simpler example in more detail.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> char 'f' <> text "oo"
         Concat (Char 'f') (Text "oo")
         ghci> compact (char 'f' <> text "oo")
         "foo"

      When we apply ``compact``, it turns its argument into a list
      and applies ``transform``.

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  The ``transform`` function receives a one-item list,
            which matches the ``(d:ds)`` pattern. Thus ``d`` is the
            value ``Concat (Char 'f') (Text "oo")``, and ``ds`` is
            the empty list, ``[]``.

            Since ``d``'s constructor is ``Concat``, the ``Concat``
            pattern matches in the ``case`` expression. On the right
            hand side, we add ``Char 'f'`` and ``Text "oo"`` to the
            stack, and apply ``transform`` recursively.

         -  

            .. container:: itemizedlist

               -  The ``transform`` function receives a two-item
                  list, again matching the ``(d:ds)`` pattern. The
                  variable ``d`` is bound to ``Char 'f'``, and ``ds``
                  to ``[Text "oo"]``.

                  The ``case`` expression matches in the ``Char``
                  branch. On the right hand side, we use ``(:)`` to
                  construct a list whose head is ``'f'``, and whose
                  body is the result of a recursive application of
                  ``transform``.

               -  

                  .. container:: itemizedlist

                     -  The recursive invocation receives a one-item
                        list. The variable ``d`` is bound to
                        ``Text "oo"``, and ``ds`` to ``[]``.

                        The ``case`` expression matches in the
                        ``Text`` branch. On the right hand side, we
                        use ``(++)`` to concatenate ``"oo"`` with the
                        result of a recursive application of
                        ``transform``.

                     -  

                        .. container:: itemizedlist

                           -  In the final invocation, ``transform``
                              is invoked with an empty list, and
                              returns an empty string.

                     -  The result is ``"oo" ++ ""``.

               -  The result is ``'f' : "oo" ++ ""``.

                  :class: title

      While our ``compact`` function is useful for machine-to-machine
      communication, its result is not always easy for a human to
      follow: there's very little information on each line. To
      generate more readable output, we'll write another function,
      ``pretty``. Compared to ``compact``, ``pretty`` takes one extra
      argument: the maximum width of a line, in columns. (We're
      assuming that our typeface is of fixed width.)

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
         pretty :: Int -> Doc -> String

      To be more precise, this Int parameter controls the behaviour
      of ``pretty`` when it encounters a ``softline``. Only at a
      ``softline`` does ``pretty`` have the option of either
      continuing the current line or beginning a new line. Elsewhere,
      we must strictly follow the directives set out by the person
      using our pretty printing functions.

      Here's the core of our implementation

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
         pretty width x = best 0 [x]
             where best col (d:ds) =
                       case d of
                         Empty        -> best col ds
                         Char c       -> c :  best (col + 1) ds
                         Text s       -> s ++ best (col + length s) ds
                         Line         -> '\n' : best 0 ds
                         a `Concat` b -> best col (a:b:ds)
                         a `Union` b  -> nicest col (best col (a:ds))
                                                    (best col (b:ds))
                   best _ _ = ""

                   nicest col a b | (width - least) `fits` a = a
                                  | otherwise                = b
                                  where least = min width col

      Our ``best`` helper function takes two arguments: the number of
      columns emitted so far on the current line, and the list of
      remaining Doc values to process.

      In the simple cases, ``best`` updates the ``col`` variable in
      straightforward ways as it consumes the input. Even the
      ``Concat`` case is obvious: we push the two concatenated
      components onto our stack/list, and don't touch ``col``.

      The interesting case involves the ``Union`` constructor. Recall
      that we applied ``flatten`` to the left element, and did
      nothing to the right. Also, remember that ``flatten`` replaces
      newlines with spaces. Therefore, our job is to see which (if
      either) of the two layouts, the ``flatten`` ed one or the
      original, will fit into our ``width`` restriction.

      To do this, we write a small helper that determines whether a
      single line of a rendered Doc value will fit into a given
      number of columns.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch05/Prettify.hs
         fits :: Int -> String -> Bool
         w `fits` _ | w < 0 = False
         w `fits` ""        = True

                  :class: title

      In order to understand how this code works, let's first
      consider a simple Doc value.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> empty </> char 'a'
         Concat (Union (Char ' ') Line) (Char 'a')

      We'll apply ``pretty 2`` on this value. When we first apply
      ``best``, the value of ``col`` is zero. It matches the
      ``Concat`` case, pushes the values ``Union (Char ' ') Line``
      and ``Char 'a'`` onto the stack, and applies itself
      recursively. In the recursive application, it matches on
      ``Union (Char ' ') Line``.

      At this point, we're going to ignore Haskell's usual order of
      evaluation. This keeps our explanation of what's going on
      simple, without changing the end result. We now have two
      subexpressions, ``best 0 [Char ' ', Char 'a']`` and
      ``best 0 [Line, Char 'a']``. The first evaluates to ``" a"``,
      and the second to ``"\na"``. We then substitute these into the
      outer expression to give ``nicest 0 " a" "\na"``.

      To figure out what the result of ``nicest`` is here, we do a
      little substitution. The values of ``width`` and ``col`` are 0
      and 2, respectively, so ``least`` is 0, and ``width - least``
      is 2. We quickly evaluate :literal:`2 \`fits\` " a"` in
      **ghci**.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> 2 `fits` " a"
         True

      Since this evaluates to ``True``, the result of ``nicest`` here
      is ``" a"``.

      If we apply our ``pretty`` function to the same JSON data as
      earlier, we can see that it produces different output depending
      on the width that we give it.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> putStrLn (pretty 10 value)
         {"f": 1.0,
         "q": true
         }
         ghci> putStrLn (pretty 20 value)
         {"f": 1.0, "q": true
         }
         ghci> putStrLn (pretty 30 value)
         {"f": 1.0, "q": true }

                  It should add spaces to a document until it is the given number of columns wide. If it is already wider than this value, it should add no spaces.

               :class: title

   The Haskell community has built a standard set of tools, named
   Cabal, that help with building, installing, and distributing
   software. Cabal organises software as a *package*. A package
   contains one library, and possibly several executable programs.

                  :name: id601900
                  :class: title

      To do anything with a package, Cabal needs a description of it.
      This is contained in a text file whose name ends with the
      suffix ``.cabal``. This file belongs in the top-level directory
      of your project. It has a simple format, which we'll describe
      below.

      A Cabal package must have a name. Usually, the name of the
      package matches the name of the ``.cabal`` file. We'll call our
      package ``mypretty``, so our file is ``mypretty.cabal``. Often,
      the directory that contains a ``.cabal`` file will have the
      same name as the package, e.g. ``mypretty``.

      A package description begins with a series of global
      properties, which apply to every library and executable in the
      package.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         Name:          mypretty
         Version:       0.1

         -- This is a comment.  It stretches to the end of the line.

      Package names must be unique. If you create and install a
      package that has the same name as a package already present on
      your system, GHC will become very confused.

      The global properties include a substantial amount of
      information that is intended for human readers, not Cabal
      itself.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         Synopsis:      My pretty printing library, with JSON support
         Description:
           A simple pretty printing library that illustrates how to
           develop a Haskell library.
         Author:        Real World Haskell
         Maintainer:    nobody@realworldhaskell.org

      As the ``Description`` field indicates, a field can span
      multiple lines, provided they're indented.

      Also included in the global properties is license information.
      Most Haskell packages are licensed under the BSD license, which
      Cabal calls
      ``BSD3`` :sup:`[` `11 <#ftn.id602026>`__ :sup:`]`.
      (Obviously, you're free to choose whatever license you think is
      appropriate.) The optional ``License-File`` field lets us
      specify the name of a file that contains the exact text of our
      package's licensing terms.

      The features supported by successive versions of Cabal evolve
      over time, so it's wise to indicate what versions of Cabal we
      expect to be compatible with. The features we are describing
      are supported by versions 1.2 and higher of Cabal.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         Cabal-Version: >= 1.2

      To describe an individual library within a package, we write a
      *library section*. The use of indentation here is significant:
      the contents of a section must be indented.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         library
           Exposed-Modules: Prettify
                            PrettyJSON
                            SimpleJSON
           Build-Depends:   base >= 2.0

      The ``Exposed-Modules`` field contains a list of modules that
      should be available to users of this package. An optional
      field, ``Other-Modules``, contains a list of *internal*
      modules. These are required for this library to function, but
      will not be visible to users.

      The ``Build-Depends`` field contains a comma-separated list of
      packages that our library requires to build. For each package,
      we can optionally specify the range of versions with which this
      library is known to work. The ``base`` package contains many of
      the core Haskell modules, such as the Prelude, so it's
      effectively always required.

      .. Tip:: Figuring out build dependencies

         We don't have to guess or do any research to
         establish which packages we depend on. If we try to
         build our package without a ``Build-Depends``
         field, compilation will fail with a useful error
         message. Here's an example where we commented out
         the dependency on the ``base`` package.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            $ runghc Setup build
            Preprocessing library mypretty-0.1...
            Building mypretty-0.1...

            PrettyJSON.hs:8:7:
                Could not find module `Data.Bits':
                  it is a member of package base, which is hidden

         The error message makes it clear that we need to
         add the ``base`` package, even though ``base`` is
         already installed. Forcing us to be explicit about
         every package we need has a practical benefit: a
         command line tool named ``cabal-install`` will
         automatically download, build, and install a
         package and all of the packages it depends on.

                  :name: id602195
                  :class: title

      GHC includes a simple package manager that tracks which
      packages are installed, and what the versions of those packages
      are. A command line tool named **ghc-pkg** lets us work with
      its package databases.

      We say *databases* because GHC distinguishes between
      *system-wide* packages, which are available to every user, and
      *per-user* packages, which are only visible to the current
      user. The per-user database lets us avoid the need for
      administrative privileges to install packages.

      The **ghc-pkg** command provides subcommands to address
      different tasks. Most of the time, we'll only need two of them.
      The ``ghc-pkg list`` command lets us see what packages are
      installed. When we want to uninstall a package,
      ``ghc-pkg unregister`` tells GHC that we won't be using a
      particular package any longer. (We will have to manually delete
      the installed files ourselves.)

                  :class: title

      In addition to a ``.cabal`` file, a package must contain a
      *setup* file. This allows Cabal's build process to be heavily
      customised, if a package needs it. The simplest setup file
      looks like this.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch05/Setup.hs
         #!/usr/bin/env runhaskell
         import Distribution.Simple
         main = defaultMain

      We save this file under the name ``Setup.hs``.

      Once we have the ``.cabal`` and ``Setup.hs`` files written, we
      have three steps left.

      To instruct Cabal how to build and where to install a package,
      we run a simple command.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         $ runghc Setup configure

      This ensures that the packages we need are available, and
      stores settings to be used later by other Cabal commands.

      If we do not provide any arguments to ``configure``, Cabal will
      install our package in the system-wide package database. To
      install it into our home directory and our personal package
      database, we must provide a little more information.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         $ runghc Setup configure --prefix=$HOME --user

      Following the ``configure`` step, we build the package.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         $ runghc Setup build

      If this succeeds, we can install the package. We don't need to
      indicate where to install to: Cabal will use the settings we
      provided in the ``configure`` step. It will install to our own
      directory and update GHC's per-user package database.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         $ runghc Setup install

   GHC already bundles a pretty printing library,
   ``Text.PrettyPrint.HughesPJ``. It provides the same basic API as
   our example, but a much richer and more useful set of pretty
   printing functions. We recommend using it, rather than writing
   your own.

   The design of the ``HughesPJ`` pretty printer was introduced by
   John Hughes in [`Hughes95 <bibliography.html#bib.hughes95>`__].
   The library was subsequently improved by Simon Peyton Jones, hence
   the name. Hughes's paper is long, but well worth reading for his
   discussion of how to design a library in Haskell.

   In this chapter, our pretty printing library is based on a simpler
   system described by Philip Wadler in
   [`Wadler98 <bibliography.html#bib.wadler98>`__]. His library was
   extended by Daan Leijen; this version is available for download
   from Hackage as ``wl-pprint``. If you use the **cabal** command
   line tool, you can download, build, and install it in one step
   with **cabal install wl-pprint**.

   Typeclasses are among the most powerful features in Haskell. They
   allow you to define generic interfaces that provide a common feature
   set over a wide variety of types. Typeclasses are at the heart of
   some basic language features such as equality testing and numeric
   operators. Before we talk about what exactly typeclasses are, though,
   we'd like to explain the need for them.

                  :name: typeclasses.need
                  :class: title

      Let's imagine that for some unfathomable reason, the designers of
      the Haskell language neglected to implement the equality test
      ``==``. Once you got over your shock at hearing this, you resolved
      to implement your own equality tests. Your application consisted
      of a simple ``Color`` type, and so your first equality test is for
      this type. Your first attempt might look like this:

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/naiveeq.hs
         data Color = Red | Green | Blue

         colorEq :: Color -> Color -> Bool
         colorEq Red   Red   = True
         colorEq Green Green = True
         colorEq Blue  Blue  = True
         colorEq _     _     = False

      You can test this with **ghci**:

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :load naiveeq.hs
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( naiveeq.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: Main.
         ghci> colorEq Red Red
         True
         ghci> colorEq Red Green
         False

      Now, let's say that you want to add an equality test for
      ``String`` s. Since a Haskell ``String`` is a list of characters,
      we can write a simple function to perform that test. For
      simplicity, we cheat a bit and use the ``==`` operator here to
      illustrate.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/naiveeq.hs
         stringEq :: [Char] -> [Char] -> Bool

         -- Match if both are empty
         stringEq [] [] = True

         -- If both start with the same char, check the rest
         stringEq (x:xs) (y:ys) = x == y && stringEq xs ys

         -- Everything else doesn't match
         stringEq _ _ = False

      You should now be able to see a problem: we have to use a function
      with a different name for every different type that we want to be
      able to compare. That's inefficient and annoying. It's much more
      convenient to be able to just use ``==`` to compare anything. It
      may also be useful to write generic functions such as ``/=`` that
      could be implemented in terms of ``==``, and valid for almost
      anything. By having a generic function that can compare anything,
      we can also make our code generic: if a piece of code only needs
      to compare things, then it ought to be able to accept any data
      type that the compiler knows how to compare. And, what's more, if
      new data types are added later, the existing code shouldn't have
      to be modified.

      Haskell's typeclasses are designed to address all of these things.

                  :class: title

      Typeclasses define a set of functions that can have different
      implementations depending on the type of data they are given.
      Typeclasses may look like the objects of object-oriented
      programming, but they are truly quite different.

      Let's use typeclasses to solve our equality dilemma from earlier
      in the chapter. To begin with, we must define the typeclass
      itself. We want a function that takes two parameters, both the
      same type, and returns a ``Bool`` indicating whether or not they
      are equal. We don't care what that type is, but we just want two
      items of that type. Here's our first definition of a typeclass:

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/eqclasses.hs
         class BasicEq a where
             isEqual :: a -> a -> Bool

      This says that we are declaring a typeclass named ``BasicEq``, and
      we'll refer to instance types with the letter ``a``. An instance
      type of this typeclass is any type that implements the functions
      defined in the typeclass. This typeclass defines one function.
      That function takes two parameters—both corresponding to instance
      types—and returns a ``Bool``.

      .. Note:: When is a class not a class?

         The keywoard to define a typeclass in Haskell is
         ``class``. Unfortunately, this may be confusing for
         those of you coming from an object-oriented
         background, as we are not really defining the same
         thing.

      On the first line, the name of the parameter ``a`` was chosen
      arbitrarily. We could have used any name. The key is that, when
      you list the types of your functions, you must use that name to
      refer to instance types.

      Let's look at this in **ghci**. Recall that you can type **:type**
      in **ghci** to have it show you the type of something. Let's see
      what it says about ``isEqual``:

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         *Main> :type isEqual
         isEqual :: (BasicEq a) => a -> a -> Bool
             

      You can read that this way: "For all types ``a``, so long as ``a``
      is an instance of ``BasicEq``, ``isEqual`` takes two parameters of
      type ``a`` and returns a ``Bool``". Let's take a quick look at
      defining ``isEqual`` for a particular type.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/eqclasses.hs
         instance BasicEq Bool where
             isEqual True  True  = True
             isEqual False False = True
             isEqual _     _     = False

      You can also use **ghci** to verify that we can now use
      ``isEqual`` on ``Bool`` s, but not on any other type:

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :load eqclasses.hs
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( eqclasses.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: Main.
         ghci> isEqual False False
         True
         ghci> isEqual False True
         False
         ghci> isEqual "Hi" "Hi"

         <interactive>:1:0:
             No instance for (BasicEq [Char])
               arising from a use of `isEqual' at <interactive>:1:0-16
             Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (BasicEq [Char])
             In the expression: isEqual "Hi" "Hi"
             In the definition of `it': it = isEqual "Hi" "Hi"

      Notice that when we tried to compare two strings, **ghci** noticed
      that we hadn't provided an instance of ``BasicEq`` for ``String``.
      It therefore didn't know how to compare a ``String``, and
      suggested that we could fix the problem by defining an instance of
      ``BasicEq`` for ``[Char]``, which is the same as ``String``.

      We'll go into more detail on defining instances in the section
      called `“Declaring typeclass instances” <#typeclasses.instances>`__.
      First, though, let's continue to look at ways to define
      typeclasses. In this example, a not-equal-to function might be
      useful. Here's what we might say to define a typeclass with two
      functions:

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/eqclasses.hs
         class BasicEq2 a where
             isEqual2    :: a -> a -> Bool
             isNotEqual2 :: a -> a -> Bool

      Someone providing an instance of ``BasicEq2`` will be required to
      define two functions: ``isEqual2`` and ``isNotEqual2``.

      While our definition of ``BasicEq2`` is fine, it seems that we're
      making extra work for ourselves. Logically speaking, if we know
      what ``isEqual`` or ``isNotEqual`` would return, we know how to
      figure out what the other function would return, for all types.
      Rather than making users of the typeclass define both functions
      for all types, we can provide default implementations for them.
      Then, users will only have to implement one function.
      :sup:`[` `12 <#ftn.id603171>`__ :sup:`]` Here's an example that
      shows how to do this.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/eqclasses.hs
         class BasicEq3 a where
             isEqual3 :: a -> a -> Bool
             isEqual3 x y = not (isNotEqual3 x y)

             isNotEqual3 :: a -> a -> Bool
             isNotEqual3 x y = not (isEqual3 x y)

      People implementing this class must provide an implementation of
      at least one function. They can implement both if they wish, but
      they will not be required to. While we did provide defaults for
      both functions, each function depends on the presence of the other
      to calculate an answer. If we don't specify at least one, the
      resulting code would be an endless loop. Therefore, at least one
      function must always be implemented.

      With ``BasicEq3``, we have provided a class that does very much
      the same thing as Haskell's built-in ``==`` and ``/=`` operators.
      In fact, these operators are defined by a typeclass that looks
      almost identical to ``BasicEq3``. The Haskell 98 Report defines a
      typeclass that implements equality comparison. Here is the code
      for the built-in ``Eq`` typeclass. Note how similar it is to our
      ``BasicEq3`` typeclass.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         class  Eq a  where
             (==), (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool

                -- Minimal complete definition:
                --     (==) or (/=)
             x /= y     =  not (x == y)
             x == y     =  not (x /= y)
            

   .. container:: sect1

      .. container:: titlepage

         .. container::

            .. container::

               .. rubric:: Declaring typeclass instances
                  :name: typeclasses.instances
                  :class: title

      Now that you know how to define typeclasses, it's time to learn
      how to define instances of typeclasses. Recall that types are made
      instances of a particular typeclass by implementing the functions
      necessary for that typeclass.

      Recall our attempt to create a test for equality over a ``Color``
      type back in the section called `“The need for typeclasses” <#typeclasses.need>`__. Now
      let's see how we could make that same ``Color`` type a member of
      the ``BasicEq3`` class.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/eqclasses.hs
         instance BasicEq3 Color where
             isEqual3 Red Red = True
             isEqual3 Green Green = True
             isEqual3 Blue Blue = True
             isEqual3 _ _ = False

      Notice that we provide essentially the same function as we used
      back in the section called `“The need for typeclasses” <#typeclasses.need>`__. In
      fact, the implementation is identical. However, in this case, we
      can use ``isEqual3`` on *any* type that we declare is an instance
      of ``BasicEq3``, not just this one color type. We could define
      equality tests for anything from numbers to graphics using the
      same basic pattern. In fact, as you will see in the section
      called `“Equality, Ordering, and Comparisons” <#typeclasses.wellknown.equality>`__,
      this is exactly how you can make Haskell's ``==`` operator work
      for your own custom types.

      Note also that the ``BasicEq3`` class defined both ``isEqual3``
      and ``isNotEqual3``, but we implemented only one of them in the
      ``Color`` instance. That's because of the default implementation
      contained in ``BasicEq3``. Since we didn't explicitly define
      ``isNotEqual3``, the compiler automatically uses the default
      implementation given in the ``BasicEq3`` declaration.

                  :class: title

      Now that we've discussed defining your own typeclasses and making
      your types instances of typeclasses, it's time to introduce you to
      typeclasses that are a standard part of the Haskell Prelude. As we
      mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, typeclasses are at the
      core of some important aspects of the language. We'll cover the
      most common ones here. For more details, the Haskell library
      reference is a good resource. It will give you a description of
      the typeclasses, and usually also will tell you which functions
      you must implement to have a complete definition.

      .. container:: sect2

         .. container:: titlepage

            .. container::

               .. container::

                  .. rubric:: Show
                     :name: typeclasses.wellknown.show
                     :class: title

         The ``Show`` typeclass is used to convert values to
         ``String`` s. It is perhaps most commonly used to convert
         numbers to ``String`` s, but it is defined for so many types
         that it can be used to convert quite a bit more. If you have
         defined your own types, making them instances of ``Show`` will
         make it easy to display them in **ghci** or print them out in
         programs.

         The most important function of ``Show`` is ``show``. It takes
         one argument: the data to convert. It returns a ``String``
         representing that data. **ghci** reports the type of ``show``
         like this:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type show
            show :: (Show a) => a -> String

         Let's look at some examples of converting values to strings:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> show 1
            "1"
            ghci> show [1, 2, 3]
            "[1,2,3]"
            ghci> show (1, 2)
            "(1,2)"

         Remember that **ghci** displays results as they would be
         entered into a Haskell program. So the expression ``show 1``
         returns a single-character string containing the digit ``1``.
         That is, the quotes are not part of the string itself. We can
         make that clear by using ``putStrLn``:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> putStrLn (show 1)
            1
            ghci> putStrLn (show [1,2,3])
            [1,2,3]

         You can also use ``show`` on ``String`` s:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> show "Hello!"
            "\"Hello!\""
            ghci> putStrLn (show "Hello!")
            "Hello!"
            ghci> show ['H', 'i']
            "\"Hi\""
            ghci> putStrLn (show "Hi")
            "Hi"
            ghci> show "Hi, \"Jane\""
            "\"Hi, \\\"Jane\\\"\""
            ghci> putStrLn (show "Hi, \"Jane\"")
            "Hi, \"Jane\""

         Running ``show`` on ``String`` s can be confusing. Since
         ``show`` generates a result that is suitable for a Haskell
         literal, ``show`` adds quotes and escaping suitable for
         inclusion in a Haskell program. **ghci** also uses ``show`` to
         display results, so quotes and escaping get added twice. Using
         ``putStrLn`` can help make this difference clear.

         You can define a ``Show`` instance for your own types easily.
         Here's an example:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/eqclasses.hs
            instance Show Color where
                show Red   = "Red"
                show Green = "Green"
                show Blue  = "Blue"

         This example defines an instance of ``Show`` for our type
         ``Color`` (see the section called `“The need for typeclasses” <#typeclasses.need>`__). 
         The implementation is simple: we define a function ``show`` and
         that's all that's needed.

         .. Note:: The Show typeclass

            ``Show`` is usually used to define a ``String``
            representation for data that is useful for a
            machine to parse back with ``Read``. Haskell
            programmers generally write custom functions to
            format data in pretty ways for displaying to end
            users, if this representation would be different
            than expected via ``Show``.

      .. container:: sect2

         .. container:: titlepage

            .. container::

               .. container::

                  .. rubric:: Read
                     :name: typeclasses.wellknown.read
                     :class: title

         The ``Read`` typeclass is essentially the opposite of ``Show``:
         it defines functions that will take a ``String``, parse it, and
         return data in any type that is a member of ``Read``. The most
         useful function in ``Read`` is ``read``. You can ask **ghci**
         for its type like this:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :type read
            read :: (Read a) => String -> a

         Here's an example illustrating the use of ``read`` and
         ``show``:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/read.hs
            main = do
                    putStrLn "Please enter a Double:"
                    inpStr <- getLine
                    let inpDouble = (read inpStr)::Double
                    putStrLn ("Twice " ++ show inpDouble ++ " is " ++ show (inpDouble * 2))

         This is a simple example of ``read`` and ``show`` together.
         Notice that we gave an explicit type of ``Double`` when
         processing the ``read``. That's because ``read`` returns a
         value of type ``Read a => a`` and ``show`` expects a value of
         type ``Show a => a``. There are many types that have instances
         defined for both ``Read`` and ``Show``. Without knowing a
         specific type, the compiler must guess from these many types
         which one is needed. In situations like this, it may often
         choose ``Integer``. If we wanted to accept floating-point
         input, this wouldn't work, so we provided an explicit type.

         .. Tip:: A note about defaulting

            In most cases, if the explicit ``Double`` type
            annotation were omitted, the compiler would refuse
            to guess a common type and simply give an error.
            The fact that it could default to ``Integer`` here
            is a special case arising from the fact that the
            literal ``2`` is treated as an ``Integer`` unless a
            different type of expected for it.

         You can see the same effect at work if you try to use ``read``
         on the **ghci** command line. **ghci** internally uses ``show``
         to display results, meaning that you can hit this ambiguous
         typing problem there as well. You'll need to explicitly give
         types for your ``read`` results in **ghci** as shown here:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> read "5"

            <interactive>:1:0:
                Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
                  `Read a' arising from a use of `read' at <interactive>:1:0-7
                Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
            ghci> :type (read "5")
            (read "5") :: (Read a) => a
            ghci> (read "5")::Integer
            5
            ghci> (read "5")::Double
            5.0

         Recall the type of ``read``: ``(Read a) => String -> a``. The
         ``a`` here is the type of each instance of ``Read``. Which
         particular parsing function is called depends upon the type
         that is expected from the return value of ``read``. Let's see
         how that works:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> (read "5.0")::Double
            5.0
            ghci> (read "5.0")::Integer
            *** Exception: Prelude.read: no parse

         Notice the error when trying to parse ``5.0`` as an
         ``Integer``. The interpreter selected a different instance of
         ``Read`` when the return value was expected to be ``Integer``
         than it did when a ``Double`` was expected. The ``Integer``
         parser doesn't accept decimal points, and caused an exception
         to be raised.

         The ``Read`` class provides for some fairly complicated
         parsers. You can define a simple parser by providing an
         implementation for the ``readsPrec`` function. Your
         implementation can return a list containing exactly one tuple
         on a successful parse, or an empty list on an unsuccessful
         parse. Here's an example implementation:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/eqclasses.hs
            instance Read Color where
                -- readsPrec is the main function for parsing input
                readsPrec _ value = 
                    -- We pass tryParse a list of pairs.  Each pair has a string
                    -- and the desired return value.  tryParse will try to match
                    -- the input to one of these strings.
                    tryParse [("Red", Red), ("Green", Green), ("Blue", Blue)]
                    where tryParse [] = []    -- If there is nothing left to try, fail
                          tryParse ((attempt, result):xs) =
                                  -- Compare the start of the string to be parsed to the
                                  -- text we are looking for.
                                  if (take (length attempt) value) == attempt
                                     -- If we have a match, return the result and the
                                     -- remaining input
                                     then [(result, drop (length attempt) value)]
                                     -- If we don't have a match, try the next pair
                                     -- in the list of attempts.
                                     else tryParse xs

         This example handles the known cases for the three colors. It
         returns an empty list (resulting in a "no parse" message) for
         others. The function is supposed to return the part of the
         input that was not parsed, so that the system can integrate the
         parsing of different types together. Here's an example of using
         this new instance of ``Read``:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> (read "Red")::Color
            Red
            ghci> (read "Green")::Color
            Green
            ghci> (read "Blue")::Color
            Blue
            ghci> (read "[Red]")::[Color]
            [Red]
            ghci> (read "[Red,Red,Blue]")::[Color]
            [Red,Red,Blue]
            ghci> (read "[Red, Red, Blue]")::[Color]
            *** Exception: Prelude.read: no parse

         Notice the error on the final attempt. That's because our
         parser is not smart enough to handle leading spaces yet. If we
         modified it to accept leading spaces, that attempt would work.
         You could rectify this by modifying your ``Read`` instance to
         discard any leading spaces, which is common practice in Haskell
         programs.

         .. Tip:: Read is not widely used

            While it is possible to build sophisticated parsers
            using the ``Read`` typeclass, many people find it
            easier to do so using Parsec, and rely on ``Read``
            only for simpler tasks. Parsec is covered in detail
            in `Chapter 16, Using Parsec <using-parsec.html>`__.

                     :class: title

         You may often have a data structure in memory that you need to
         store on disk for later retrieval or to send across the
         network. The process of converting data in memory to a flat
         series of bits for storage is called *serialization*.

         It turns out that ``read`` and ``show`` make excellent tools
         for serialization. ``show`` produces output that is both
         human-readable and machine-readable. Most ``show`` output is
         also syntactically-valid Haskell, though it is up to people
         that write ``Show`` instances to make it so.

         .. Tip:: Parsing large strings

            String handling in Haskell is normally lazy, so
            ``read`` and ``show`` can be used on quite large
            data structures without incident. The built-in
            ``read`` and ``show`` instances in Haskell are
            efficient and implemented in pure Haskell. For
            information on how to handle parsing exceptions,
            refer to `Chapter 19, Error handling <error-handling.html>`__.

         Let's try it out in **ghci**:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> let d1 = [Just 5, Nothing, Nothing, Just 8, Just 9]::[Maybe Int]
            ghci> putStrLn (show d1)
            [Just 5,Nothing,Nothing,Just 8,Just 9]
            ghci> writeFile "test" (show d1)

         First, we assign ``d1`` to be a list. Next, we print out the
         result of ``show d1`` so we can see what it generates. Then, we
         write the result of ``show d1`` to a file named ``test``.

         Let's try reading it back. *FIXME: xref to explanation of
         variable binding in ghci*

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> input <- readFile "test"
            "[Just 5,Nothing,Nothing,Just 8,Just 9]"
            ghci> let d2 = read input

            <interactive>:1:9:
                Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
                  `Read a' arising from a use of `read' at <interactive>:1:9-18
                Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
            ghci> let d2 = (read input)::[Maybe Int]
            ghci> print d1
            [Just 5,Nothing,Nothing,Just 8,Just 9]
            ghci> print d2
            [Just 5,Nothing,Nothing,Just 8,Just 9]
            ghci> d1 == d2
            True

         First, we ask Haskell to read the file
         back. :sup:`[` `13 <#ftn.id604799>`__ :sup:`]` Then, we try
         to assign the result of ``read input`` to ``d2``. That
         generates an error. The reason is that the interpreter doesn't
         know what type ``d2`` is meant to be, so it doesn't know how to
         parse the input. If we give it an explicit type, it works, and
         we can verify that the two sets of data are equal.

         Since so many different types are instances of ``Read`` and
         ``Show`` by default (and others can be made instances easily;
         see the section called `“Automatic Derivation” <#typeclasses.auto.derivation>`__),
         you can use it for some really complex data structures. Here
         are a few examples of slightly more complex data structures:

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> putStrLn $ show [("hi", 1), ("there", 3)]
            [("hi",1),("there",3)]
            ghci> putStrLn $ show [[1, 2, 3], [], [4, 0, 1], [], [503]]
            [[1,2,3],[],[4,0,1],[],[503]]
            ghci> putStrLn $ show [Left 5, Right "three", Left 0, Right "nine"]
            [Left 5,Right "three",Left 0,Right "nine"]
            ghci> putStrLn $ show [Left 0, Right [1, 2, 3], Left 5, Right []]
            [Left 0,Right [1,2,3],Left 5,Right []]

         *FIXME: some of these tables don't render well under sgml2x.
         Will need to verify that they look good under the O'Reilly

         Haskell has a powerful set of numeric types. You can use
         everything from fast 32-bit or 64-bit integers to
         arbitrary-precision rational numbers. You probably know that
         operators such as ``+`` can work with just about all of these.
         This feature is implemented using typeclasses. As a side
         benefit, it allows you to define your own numeric types and
         make them first-class citizens in Haskell.

         Let's begin our discussion of the typeclasses surrounding
         numeric types with an examination of the types themselves.
         `Table 6.1, “Selected Numeric Types” <#numerictypes.summary>`__
         describes the most commonly-used numeric types in Haskell. Note
         that there are also many more numeric types available for
         specific purposes such as interfacing to C.

                     - ``Double``
                     - Double-precision floating point. A common choice
                        for floating-point data.
                  - 

                     - ``Float``
                     - Single-precision floating point. Often used when
                        interfacing with C.

                        [-2^29..2^29-1]. Commonly used.
                  - 

                     - ``Int8``
                     - 8-bit signed integer
                  - 

                     - ``Int16``
                     - 16-bit signed integer
                  - 

                     - ``Int32``

                  - 

                     - ``Int64``
                     - 64-bit signed integer
                  - 

                     - ``Integer``
                     - Arbitrary-precision signed integer; range limited
                        only by machine resources. Commonly used.
                  - 

                     - ``Rational``
                     - Arbitrary-precision rational numbers. Stored as a
                        ratio of two ``Integer`` s.
                  - 

                     - ``Word``
                     - Fixed-precision unsigned integer; storage size
                        same as ``Int``
                  - 

                     - ``Word8``
                     - 8-bit unsigned integer
                  - 

                     - ``Word16``
                     - 16-bit unsigned integer
                  - 

                     - ``Word32``
                     - 32-bit unsigned integer
                  - 

                     - ``Word64``
                     - 64-bit unsigned integer

         These are quite a few different numeric types. There are some
         operations, such as addition, that work with all of them. There
         are others, such as ``asin``, that only apply to floating-point
         types. `Table 6.2, “Selected Numeric Functions and Constants” <#numerictypes.funcs>`__
         summarizes the different functions that operate on numeric
         types, and `Table 6.3, “Typeclass Instances for Numeric Types” <#numerictypes.typeclasses>`__
         matches the types with their respective typeclasses. As you
         read that table, keep in mind that Haskell operators are just
         functions: you can say either ``(+) 2 3`` or ``2 + 3`` with the
         same result. By convention, when referring to an operator as a
         function, it is written in parenthesis as seen in this table.

         Converting between numeric types is another common need.
         `Table 6.2, “Selected Numeric Functions and Constants” <#numerictypes.funcs>`__
         listed many functions that can be used for conversion. However,
         it is not always obvious how to apply them to convert between
         two arbitrary types. To help you out, 
         `Table 6.4, “Conversion Between Numeric Types” <#numerictypes.conversion>`__
         provides information on converting between different types.

         For an extended example demonstrating the use of these numeric

         Types” <#data.num>`__.

         We've already talked about the arithmetic operators such as
         ``+`` that can be used for all sorts of different numbers. But
         there are some even more widely-applied operators in Haskell.
         The most obvious, of course, are the equality tests: ``==`` and
         ``/=``. These operators are defined in the ``Eq`` class.

         There are also comparison operators such as ``>=`` and ``<=``.
         These are declared by the ``Ord`` typeclass. These are in a
         separate typeclass because there are some types, such as
         ``Handle``, where an equality test makes sense, but there is no
         way to express a particular ordering. Anything that is an
         instance of ``Ord`` can be sorted by ``Data.List.sort``.

         Almost all Haskell types are instances of ``Eq``, and nearly as
         many are instances of ``Ord``.

         .. Tip:: Tip

            Sometimes, the ordering in ``Ord`` is arbitrary. For
            instance, for ``Maybe``, ``Nothing`` sorts before
            ``Just x``, but this was a somewhat arbitrary
            decision.

               .. rubric:: Automatic Derivation
                  :name: typeclasses.auto.derivation
                  :class: title

      For many simple data types, the Haskell compiler can automatically
      derive instances of ``Read``, ``Show``, ``Bounded``, ``Enum``,
      ``Eq``, and ``Ord`` for us. This saves us the effort of having to
      manually write code to compare or display our own types.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/colorderived.hs
         data Color = Red | Green | Blue
              deriving (Read, Show, Eq, Ord)

      .. Note::  Which types can be automatically derived?

         The Haskell standard requires compilers to be able to
         automatically derive instances of these specific
         typeclasses. This automation is not available for
         other typeclasses.

      Let's take a look at how these derived instances work for us:

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> show Red
         "Red"
         ghci> (read "Red")::Color
         Red
         ghci> (read "[Red,Red,Blue]")::[Color]
         [Red,Red,Blue]
         ghci> (read "[Red, Red, Blue]")::[Color]
         [Red,Red,Blue]
         ghci> Red == Red
         True
         ghci> Red == Blue
         False
         ghci> Data.List.sort [Blue,Green,Blue,Red]
         [Red,Green,Blue,Blue]
         ghci> Red < Blue
         True

      Notice that the sort order for ``Color`` was based on the order
      that the constructors were defined.

      Automatic derivation is not always possible. For instance, if you
      defined a type ``data MyType = MyType (Int -> Bool)``, the
      compiler will not be able to derive an instance of ``Show``
      because it doesn't know how to render a function. We will get a
      compilation error in such a situation.

      When we automatically derive an instance of some typeclass, the
      types that we refer to in our ``data`` declaration must also be
      instances of that typeclass (manually or automatically).

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/AutomaticDerivation.hs
         data CannotShow = CannotShow
                         deriving (Show)

         -- will not compile, since CannotShow is not an instance of Show
         data CannotDeriveShow = CannotDeriveShow CannotShow
                                 deriving (Show)

         data OK = OK

         instance Show OK where
             show _ = "OK"

         data ThisWorks = ThisWorks OK

      The JValue type that we introduced in the section called
      `“Representing JSON data in Haskell” <#library.jvalue>`__
      is not especially easy to work with. Here is a truncated and
      tidied snippet of some real JSON data, produced by a well known
      search engine.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         {
           "query": "awkward squad haskell",
           "estimatedCount": 3920,
           "moreResults": true,
           "results":
           [{
             "title": "Simon Peyton Jones: papers",
             "snippet": "Tackling the awkward squad: monadic input/output ...",
             "url": "http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/marktoberdorf/",
            },
            {
             "title": "Haskell for C Programmers | Lambda the Ultimate",
             "snippet": "... the best job of all the tutorials I've read ...",
             "url": "http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/724",
            }]
         }

      And here's a further slimmed down fragment of that data,
      represented in Haskell.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch05/SimpleResult.hs
         import SimpleJSON

         result :: JValue
         result = JObject [
           ("query", JString "awkward squad haskell"),
           ("estimatedCount", JNumber 3920),
           ("moreResults", JBool True),
           ("results", JArray [
              JObject [
               ("title", JString "Simon Peyton Jones: papers"),
               ("snippet", JString "Tackling the awkward ..."),
               ("url", JString "http://.../marktoberdorf/")
              ]])
           ]

      Because Haskell doesn't natively support lists that contain types
      of different value, we can't directly represent a JSON object that
      contains values of different types. Instead, we must wrap each
      value with a JValue constructor. This limits our flexibility: if
      we want to change the number ``3920`` to a string ``"3,920"``, we
      must change the constructor that we use to wrap it from
      ``JNumber`` to ``JString``.

      Haskell's typeclasses offer a tempting solution to this problem.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         type JSONError = String

         class JSON a where
             toJValue :: a -> JValue
             fromJValue :: JValue -> Either JSONError a

         instance JSON JValue where
             toJValue = id
             fromJValue = Right

      Now, instead of applying a constructor like ``JNumber`` to a value
      to wrap it, we apply the ``toJValue`` function. If we change a
      value's type, the compiler will choose a suitable implementation
      of toJValue to use with it.

      We also provide a ``fromJValue`` function, which attempts to
      convert a JValue into a value of our desired type.

                     :name: id607846
                     :class: title

         The return type of our ``fromJValue`` function uses the Either
         type. Like Maybe, this type is predefined for us, and we'll
         often use it to represent a computation that could fail.

         While Maybe is useful for this purpose, it gives us no
         information if a failure occurs: we literally have ``Nothing``.
         The Either type has a similar structure, but instead of
         ``Nothing``, the “something bad happened” constructor is named
         ``Left``, and it takes a parameter.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/DataEither.hs
            data Maybe a = Nothing
                         | Just a
                           deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show)

            data Either a b = Left a
                            | Right b
                              deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show)

         Quite often, the type we use for the ``a`` parameter value is
         String, so we can provide a useful description if something
         goes wrong. To see how we use the Either type in practice,
         let's look at a simple instance of our typeclass.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
            instance JSON Bool where
                toJValue = JBool
                fromJValue (JBool b) = Right b
                fromJValue _ = Left "not a JSON boolean"

                     :class: title

         The Haskell 98 standard does not allow us to write an instance
         of the following form, even though it seems perfectly
         reasonable.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
            instance JSON String where
                toJValue               = JString

                fromJValue (JString s) = Right s
                fromJValue _           = Left "not a JSON string"

         Recall that String is a synonym for [Char], which in turn is
         the type [a] where Char is substituted for the type parameter
         ``a``. According to Haskell 98's rules, we are not allowed to
         supply a type in place of a type parameter when we write an
         instance. In other words, it would be legal for us to write an
         instance for [a], but not for [Char].

         While GHC follows the Haskell 98 standard by default, we can
         relax this particular restriction by placing a specially
         formatted comment at the top of our source file.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
            {-# LANGUAGE TypeSynonymInstances #-}

         This comment is a directive to the compiler, called a *pragma*,
         which tells it to enable a language extension. The
         ``TypeSynonymInstances`` language extension makes the above
         code legal. We'll encounter a few other language extensions in
         this chapter, and a handful more later in this book.

      Haskell's typeclasses are intentionally designed to let us create
      new instances of a typeclass whenever we see fit.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         doubleToJValue :: (Double -> a) -> JValue -> Either JSONError a
         doubleToJValue f (JNumber v) = Right (f v)
         doubleToJValue _ _ = Left "not a JSON number"

         instance JSON Int where
             toJValue = JNumber . realToFrac
             fromJValue = doubleToJValue round

         instance JSON Integer where
             toJValue = JNumber . realToFrac
             fromJValue = doubleToJValue round

         instance JSON Double where
             toJValue = JNumber
             fromJValue = doubleToJValue id

      We can add new instances anywhere; they are not confined to the
      module where we define a typeclass. This feature of the typeclass
      system is referred to as its *open world assumption*. If we had a
      way to express a notion of “the following are the only instances
      of this typeclass that can exist”, we would have a *closed* world.

      We would like to be able to turn a list into what JSON calls an
      array. We won't worry about implementation details just yet, so
      let's use ``undefined`` as the bodies of the instance's methods.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/BrokenClass.hs
         instance (JSON a) => JSON [a] where
             toJValue = undefined
             fromJValue = undefined

      It would also be convenient if we could turn a list of name/value
      pairs into a JSON object.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/BrokenClass.hs
         instance (JSON a) => JSON [(String, a)] where
             toJValue = undefined
             fromJValue = undefined

         If we put these definitions into a source file and load them
         into **ghci**, everything initially seems fine.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> :load BrokenClass
            [1 of 2] Compiling SimpleJSON       ( ../ch05/SimpleJSON.hs, interpreted )
            [2 of 2] Compiling BrokenClass      ( BrokenClass.hs, interpreted )
            Ok, modules loaded: SimpleJSON, BrokenClass.

         However, once we try to *use* the list-of-pairs instance, we
         run into trouble.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> toJValue [("foo","bar")]

            <interactive>:1:0:
                Overlapping instances for JSON [([Char], [Char])]
                  arising from a use of `toJValue' at <interactive>:1:0-23
                Matching instances:
                  instance (JSON a) => JSON [a]
                    -- Defined at BrokenClass.hs:(44,0)-(46,25)
                  instance (JSON a) => JSON [(String, a)]
                    -- Defined at BrokenClass.hs:(50,0)-(52,25)
                In the expression: toJValue [("foo", "bar")]
                In the definition of `it': it = toJValue [("foo", "bar")]

         This problem of *overlapping instances* is a consequence of
         Haskell's open world assumption. Here's a simpler example that
         makes it clearer what's going on.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/Overlap.hs
            class Borked a where
                bork :: a -> String

            instance Borked Int where
                bork = show

            instance Borked (Int, Int) where
                bork (a, b) = bork a ++ ", " ++ bork b

            instance (Borked a, Borked b) => Borked (a, b) where
                bork (a, b) = ">>" ++ bork a ++ " " ++ bork b ++ "<<"

         We have two instances of the typeclass Borked for pairs: one
         for a pair of Ints and another for a pair of anything else
         that's Borked.

         Suppose that we want to ``bork`` a pair of Int values. To do
         so, the compiler must choose an instance to use. Because these
         instances are right next to each other, it may seem that it
         could simply choose the more specific instance.

         However, GHC is conservative by default, and insists that there
         must be only one possible instance that it can use. It will
         thus report an error if we try to use ``bork``.

         .. Note:: When do overlapping instances matter?

            As we mentioned earlier, we can scatter instances of
            a typeclass across several modules. GHC does not
            complain about the mere existence of overlapping
            instances. Instead, it only complains when we try
            to use a method of the affected typeclass, when it
            is forced to make a decision about which instance
            to use.

                     :name: id608327
                     :class: title

         Normally, we cannot write an instance of a typeclass for a
         specialized version of a polymorphic type. The [Char] type is
         the polymorphic type [a] specialized to the type Char. We are
         thus prohibited from declaring [Char] to be an instance of a
         typeclass. This is highly inconvenient, since strings are
         ubiquitous in real code.

         The ``TypeSynonymInstances`` language extension removes this
         restriction, permitting us to write such instances.

         GHC supports another useful language extension,
         ``OverlappingInstances``, which addresses the problem we saw
         with overlapping instances. When there are multiple overlapping
         instances to choose from, this extension causes the compiler to
         pick the most specific one.

         We frequently use this extension together with
         ``TypeSynonymInstances``. Here's an example.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/SimpleClass.hs
            {-# LANGUAGE TypeSynonymInstances, OverlappingInstances #-}

            import Data.List

            class Foo a where
                foo :: a -> String

            instance Foo a => Foo [a] where
                foo = concat . intersperse ", " . map foo

            instance Foo Char where
                foo c = [c]

            instance Foo String where
                foo = id

         If we apply ``foo`` to a String, the compiler will use the
         String-specific implementation. Even though we have an instance
         of Foo for [a] and Char, the instance for String is more
         specific, so GHC chooses it. For other types of list, we will
         see the behavior specified for [a].

         With the ``OverlappingInstances`` extension enabled, GHC will
         still reject code if it finds more than one equally specific
         instance.

         .. Note:: When to use the OverlappingInstances extension

            Here's an important point: GHC treats
            ``OverlappingInstances`` as affecting the
            declaration of an instance, *not* a location where
            we use the instance. In other words, when we define
            an instance that we wish to allow to overlap with
            another instance, we must enable the extension for
            the module that contains the definition. When it
            compiles the module, GHC will record that instance
            as “can be overlapped with other instances”.

            Once we import this module and use the instance, we
            *won't* need to enable ``OverlappingInstances`` in
            the importing module: GHC will already know that
            the instance was marked as “okay to overlap” when
            it was defined.

            This behaviour is useful when we are writing a
            library: we can choose to create overlappable
            instances, but users of our library do not need to
            enable any special language extensions.

                     :class: title

         The ``OverlappingInstances`` and ``TypeSynonymInstances``
         language extensions are specific to GHC, and by definition were
         not present in Haskell 98. However, the familiar Show typeclass
         from Haskell 98 somehow renders a list of Char differently from
         a list of Int. It achieves this via a clever, but simple,
         trick.

         The Show class defines both a ``show`` method, which renders
         one value, and a ``showList`` method, which renders a list of
         values. The default implementation of ``showList`` renders a
         list using square brackets and commas.

         The instance of Show for [a] is implemented using ``showList``.
         The instance of Show for Char provides a special implementation
         of ``showList`` that uses double quotes and escapes
         non-ASCII-printable characters.

         As a result, if someone applies ``show`` to a [Char] value, the
         implementation of ``showList`` will be chosen, and it will
         correctly render the string using quotes.

         At least sometimes, then, we can avoid the need for the
         ``OverlappingInstances`` extension with a little bit of lateral
         thinking.

                  :class: title

      In addition to the familiar ``data`` keyword, Haskell provides us
      with another way to create a new type, using the ``newtype``
      keyword.

      .. code:: haskell

         newtype NewtypeInt = N Int
             deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

      The purpose of a ``newtype`` declaration is to rename an existing
      type, giving it a distinct identity. As we can see, it is similar
      in appearance to a type declared using the ``data`` keyword.

      .. Note:: The type and newtype keywords

         Although their names are similar, the ``type`` and
         ``newtype`` keywords have different purposes. The
         ``type`` keyword gives us another way of referring to
         a type, like a nickname for a friend. Both we and the
         compiler know that [Char] and String names refer to
         the same type.

         In contrast, the ``newtype`` keyword exists to *hide*
         the nature of a type. Consider a UniqueID type.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/Newtype.hs
            newtype UniqueID = UniqueID Int
                deriving (Eq)

         The compiler treats UniqueID as a different type from
         Int. As a user of a UniqueID, we know only that we
         have a unique identifier; we cannot see that it is
         implemented as an Int.

      When we declare a ``newtype``, we must choose which of the
      underlying type's typeclass instances we want to expose. Here,
      we've elected to make NewtypeInt provide Int's instances for Eq,
      Ord and Show. As a result, we can compare and print values of type
      NewtypeInt.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> N 1 < N 2
         True

      Since we are *not* exposing Int's Num or Integral instances,
      values of type NewtypeInt are not numbers. For instance, we can't
      add them.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> N 313 + N 37

         <interactive>:1:0:
             No instance for (Num NewtypeInt)
               arising from a use of `+' at <interactive>:1:0-11
             Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num NewtypeInt)
             In the expression: N 313 + N 37
             In the definition of `it': it = N 313 + N 37

      As with the ``data`` keyword, we can use a ``newtype``'s value
      constructor to create a new value, or to pattern match on an
      existing value.

      If a ``newtype`` does not use automatic deriving to expose the
      underlying type's implementation of a typeclass, we are free to
      either write a new instance or leave the typeclass unimplemented.

                     :class: title

         The ``newtype`` keyword exists to give an existing type a new
         identity, and it has more restrictions on its uses than the
         ``data`` keyword. Specifically, a ``newtype`` can only have one
         value constructor, and that constructor must have exactly one
         field.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/NewtypeDiff.hs
            -- ok: any number of fields and constructors
            data TwoFields = TwoFields Int Int

            -- ok: exactly one field
            newtype Okay = ExactlyOne Int

            -- ok: type parameters are no problem
            newtype Param a b = Param (Either a b)

            -- ok: record syntax is fine
            newtype Record = Record {
                  getInt :: Int
                }

            -- bad: no fields
            newtype TooFew = TooFew

            -- bad: more than one field
            newtype TooManyFields = Fields Int Int

            -- bad: more than one constructor
            newtype TooManyCtors = Bad Int
                                 | Worse Int

         Beyond this, there's another important difference between
         ``data`` and ``newtype``. A type created with the ``data``
         keyword has a book-keeping cost at runtime, for example to
         track which constructor a value was created with. A ``newtype``
         value, on the other hand, can only have one constructor, and so
         does not need this overhead. This makes it more space- and
         time-efficient at runtime.

         Because a ``newtype``'s constructor is used only at compile
         time and does not even exist at runtime, pattern matching on
         ``undefined`` behaves differently for types defined using
         ``newtype`` than for those that use ``data``.

         To understand the difference, let's first review what we might
         expect with a normal datatype. We are already familiar with the
         idea that if ``undefined`` is evaluated at runtime, it causes a
         crash.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> undefined
            *** Exception: Prelude.undefined

         Here is a pattern match where we construct a DataInt using the
         ``D`` constructor, and put ``undefined`` inside.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> case D undefined of D _ -> 1
            1

         Since our pattern matches against the constructor but doesn't
         inspect the payload, the ``undefined`` remains unevaluated and
         does not cause an exception to be thrown.

         In this example, we're not using the ``D`` constructor, so the
         unprotected ``undefined`` is evaluated when the pattern match
         occurs, and we throw an exception.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> case undefined of D _ -> 1
            *** Exception: Prelude.undefined

         When we use the ``N`` constructor for the NewtypeInt type, we
         see the same behaviour as with the DataInt type's ``D``
         constructor: no exception.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> case N undefined of N _ -> 1
            1

         The crucial difference arises when we get rid of the ``N``
         constructor from the expression, and match against an
         unprotected ``undefined``.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: screen

            ghci> case undefined of N _ -> 1
            1

         We don't crash! Because there's no constructor present at
         runtime, matching against ``N _`` is in fact equivalent to
         matching against the plain wild card ``_``: since the wild card
         always matches, the expression does not need to be evaluated.

         .. Tip:: Another perspective on newtype constructors

            Even though we use the value constructor for a
            ``newtype`` in the same way as that of a type
            defined using the ``data`` keyword, all it does is
            coerce a value between its “normal” type and its
            ``newtype`` type.

            In other words, when we apply the ``N`` constructor
            in an expression, we coerce an expression from type
            Int to type NewtypeInt as far as we and the
            compiler are concerned, but absolutely nothing
            occurs at runtime.

            Similarly, when we match on the ``N`` constructor
            in a pattern, we coerce an expression from type
            NewtypeInt to Int, but again there's no overhead
            involved at runtime.

                     :name: id609334
                     :class: title

         Here's a brief recap of Haskell's three ways to introduce new
         names for types.

         .. container:: itemizedlist

            -  The ``data`` keyword introduces a truly new albegraic
               data type.

            -  The ``type`` keyword gives us a synonym to use for an
               existing type. We can use the type and its synonym
               interchangeably.

            -  The ``newtype`` keyword gives an existing type a distinct
               identity. The original type and the new type are *not*
               interchangeable.

   .. container:: sect1

      .. container:: titlepage

         .. container::

            .. container::

               .. rubric:: JSON typeclasses without overlapping
                  instances
                  :name: jsonclass.instances
                  :class: title

      Enabling GHC's support for overlapping instances is an effective
      and quick way to make our JSON code happy. In more complex cases,
      we will occasionally be faced with several equally good instances
      for some typeclass, in which case overlapping instances will not
      help us and we will need to put some ``newtype`` declarations into
      place. To see what's involved, let's rework our JSON typeclass
      instances to use ``newtype`` s instead of overlapping instances.

      Our first task, then, is to help the compiler to distinguish
      between [a], the representation we use for JSON arrays, and
      [(String,[a])], which we use for objects. These were the types
      that gave us problems before we learned about
      ``OverlappingInstances``. We wrap up the list type so that the
      compiler will not see it as a list.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         newtype JAry a = JAry {
               fromJAry :: [a]
             } deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

      When we export this type from our module, we'll export the
      complete details of the type. Our module header will look like
      this:

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClassExport.hs
         module JSONClass
             (
               JAry(..)
             ) where

      The “ ``(..)`` ” following the JAry name means “export all
      details of this type”.

      .. Note:: A slight deviation from normal use
           
         Usually, when we export a ``newtype``, we will *not*
         export its data constructor, in order to keep the
         details of the type abstract. Instead, we would define
         a function to apply the constructor for us.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
            jary :: [a] -> JAry a
            jary = JAry

         We would then export the type constructor, the
         deconstructor function, and our construction function,
         but not the data constructor.

         .. code:: haskell
            :class: programlisting

            -- file: ch06/JSONClassExport.hs
            module JSONClass
                (
                  JAry(fromJAry)
                , jary
                ) where

         When we don't export a type's data constructor,
         clients of our library can only use the functions we
         provide to construct and deconstruct values of that
         type. This gives us, the library authors, the liberty
         to change our internal representation if we need to.

         If we export the data constructor, clients are likely
         to start depending on it, for instance by using it in
         patterns. If we later wish to change the innards of
         our type, we'll risk breaking any code that uses the
         constructor.

         In our circumstances here, we have nothing to gain by
         making the array wrapper abstract, so we may as well
         simply export the entire definition of the type.

      We provide another wrapper type that hides our representation of a
      JSON object.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         newtype JObj a = JObj {
               fromJObj :: [(String, a)]
             } deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

      With these types defined, we make small changes to the definition
      of our ``JValue`` type.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         data JValue = JString String
                     | JNumber Double
                     | JBool Bool
                     | JNull
                     | JObject (JObj JValue)   -- was [(String, JValue)]
                     | JArray (JAry JValue)    -- was [JValue]
                       deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

      This change doesn't affect the instances of the JSON typeclass
      that we've already written, but we will want to write instances
      for our new JAry and JObj types.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         jaryFromJValue :: (JSON a) => JValue -> Either JSONError (JAry a)

         jaryToJValue :: (JSON a) => JAry a -> JValue

         instance (JSON a) => JSON (JAry a) where
             toJValue = jaryToJValue
             fromJValue = jaryFromJValue

      Let's take a slow walk through the individual steps of converting
      a JAry a to a JValue. Given a list where we know that everything
      inside is a JSON instance, converting it to a list of JValues is
      easy.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         listToJValues :: (JSON a) => [a] -> [JValue]
         listToJValues = map toJValue

      Taking this and wrapping it to become a JAry JValue is just a
      matter of applying the ``newtype``'s type constructor.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         jvaluesToJAry :: [JValue] -> JAry JValue
         jvaluesToJAry = JAry

      (Remember, this has no performance cost. We're just telling the
      compiler to hide the fact that we're using a list.) To turn this
      into a JValue, we apply another type constructor.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         jaryOfJValuesToJValue :: JAry JValue -> JValue
         jaryOfJValuesToJValue = JArray

      Assemble these pieces using function composition, and we get a
      concise one-liner for converting to a JValue.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         jaryToJValue = JArray . JAry . map toJValue . fromJAry

      We have more work to do to convert *from* a JValue to a JAry a,
      but we'll break it into reusable parts. The basic function is
      straightforward.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         jaryFromJValue (JArray (JAry a)) =
             whenRight JAry (mapEithers fromJValue a)
         jaryFromJValue _ = Left "not a JSON array"

      The ``whenRight`` function inspects its argument: calls a function
      on it if it was created with the ``Right`` constructor, and leaves
      a ``Left`` value untouched.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         whenRight :: (b -> c) -> Either a b -> Either a c
         whenRight _ (Left err) = Left err
         whenRight f (Right a) = Right (f a)

      More complicated is ``mapEithers``. It acts like the regular
      ``map`` function, but if it ever encounters a ``Left`` value, it
      returns that immediately, instead of continuing to accumulate a
      list of ``Right`` values.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         mapEithers :: (a -> Either b c) -> [a] -> Either b [c]
         mapEithers f (x:xs) = case mapEithers f xs of
                                 Left err -> Left err
                                 Right ys -> case f x of
                                               Left err -> Left err
                                               Right y -> Right (y:ys)
         mapEithers _ _ = Right []

      Because the elements of the list hidden in the JObj type have a
      little more structure, the code to convert to and from a JValue is
      a bit more complex. Fortunately, we can reuse the functions that
      we just defined.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/JSONClass.hs
         import Control.Arrow (second)

         instance (JSON a) => JSON (JObj a) where
             toJValue = JObject . JObj . map (second toJValue) . fromJObj

             fromJValue (JObject (JObj o)) = whenRight JObj (mapEithers unwrap o)
               where unwrap (k,v) = whenRight ((,) k) (fromJValue v)
             fromJValue _ = Left "not a JSON object"

                  :class: title

      The Haskell 98 standard has a subtle feature that can sometimes
      bite us in unexpected circumstances. Here's a simple function
      definition that illustrates the issue.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/Monomorphism.hs
         myShow = show

      If we try to load this definition into **ghci**, it issues a
      peculiar complaint.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: screen

         ghci> :load Monomorphism
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Monomorphism.hs, interpreted )

         Monomorphism.hs:2:9:
             Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
               `Show a' arising from a use of `show' at Monomorphism.hs:2:9-12
             Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
               myShow :: a -> String (bound at Monomorphism.hs:2:0)
             Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
                           or use -fno-monomorphism-restriction
         Failed, modules loaded: none.

      The “monomorphism restriction” to which the error message refers
      is a part of the Haskell 98 standard. *Monomorphism* is simply the
      opposite of polymorphism: it indicates that an expression has
      exactly one type. The *restriction* lies in the fact that Haskell
      sometimes forces a declaration to be less polymorphic than we
      would expect.

      We mention the monomorphism restriction here because although it
      isn't specifically related to typeclasses, they usually provide
      the circumstances in which it crops up.

      .. Tip::

         It's possible that you will not run into the
         monomorphism restriction in real code for a long time.
         We don't think you need to try to remember the details
         of this section. It should suffice to make a mental
         note of its existence, until eventually GHC complains
         at you with something like the above error message. If
         that occurs, simply remember that you read about the
         error here, and come back for guidance.

      We won't attempt to explain the monomorphism
      restriction :sup:`[` `14 <#ftn.id610076>`__ :sup:`]`. The
      consensus within the Haskell community is that it doesn't arise
      often; it is tricky to explain; it provides almost no practical
      benefit; and so it mostly serves to trip people up. For an example
      of its trickiness, while the definition above falls afoul of it,
      the following two compile without problems.

      .. code:: haskell
         :class: programlisting

         -- file: ch06/Monomorphism.hs
         myShow2 value = show value

         myShow3 :: (Show a) => a -> String
         myShow3 = show

      As these alternative definitions suggest, if GHC complains about
      the monomorphism restriction, we have three easy ways to address
      the error.

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  Make the function's arguments explicit, instead of leaving
            them implicit.

         -  Give the definition an explicit type signature, instead of
            making the compiler infer its type.

         -  Leave the code untouched, and compile the module with the
            ``NoMonomorphismRestriction`` language extension enabled.
            This disables the monomorphism restriction.

      Because the monomorphism restriction is unwanted and unloved, it
      will almost certainly be dropped from the next revision of the
      Haskell standard. This does not quite mean that compiling with
      ``NoMonomorphismRestriction`` is always the right thing to do:
      some Haskell compilers (including older versions of GHC) do not
      understand this extension, but they'll accept either of the other
      approaches to making the error disappear. If this degree of
      portability isn't a concern to you, then by all means enable the
      language extension.

      In this chapter, you learned about the need for typeclasses and
      how to use them. We talked about defining our own typeclasses and
      then covered some of the important typeclasses that are defined in
      the Haskell library. Finally, we showed how to have the Haskell
      compiler automatically derive instances of certain typeclasses for
      your types.

         :sup:`[` `12 <#id603171>`__ :sup:`]` We provided a default
         implementation of both functions, which gives implementers of
         instances choice: they can pick which one they implement. We
         could have provided a default for only one function, which
         would have forced users to implement the other every time. As
         it is, users can implement one or both, as they see fit.

   It should be obvious that most, if not all, programs are devoted to
   gathering data from outside, processing it, and providing results
   back to the outside world. That is, input and output are key.

   Haskell's I/O system is powerful and expressive. It is easy to work
   with and important to understand. Haskell strictly separates pure
   code from code that could cause things to occur in the world. That
   is, it provides a complete isolation from side-effects in pure code.
   Besides helping programmers to reason about the correctness of their
   code, it also permits compilers to automatically introduce
   optimizations and parallelism.

   We'll begin this chapter with simple, standard-looking I/O in
   Haskell. Then we'll discuss some of the more powerful options as well
   as provide more detail on how I/O fits into the pure, lazy,
   functional Haskell world.

                  :name: io.basics
                  :class: title

      Let's get started with I/O in Haskell by looking at a program that
      looks surprisingly similar to I/O in other languages such as C or
      Perl.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch07/basicio.hs
         main = do
                putStrLn "Greetings!  What is your name?"
                inpStr <- getLine
                putStrLn $ "Welcome to Haskell, " ++ inpStr ++ "!"

      You can compile this program to a standalone executable, run it
      with **runghc**, or invoke ``main`` from within **ghci**. Here's a
      sample session using **runghc**:

      .. code:: screen

         $ runghc basicio.hs
         Greetings!  What is your name?
         John
         Welcome to Haskell, John!

      That's a fairly simple, obvious result. You can see that
      ``putStrLn`` writes out a ``String``, followed by an end-of-line
      character. ``getLine`` reads a line from standard input. The
      ``<-`` syntax may be new to you. Put simply, that binds the result
      from executing an I/O action to a name.
      :sup:`[` `15 <#ftn.id610368>`__ :sup:`]` We use the simple list
      concatenation operator ``++`` to join the input string with our
      own text.

      Let's take a look at the types of ``putStrLn`` and ``getLine``.
      You can find that information in the library reference, or just
      ask **ghci**:

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :type putStrLn
         putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
         ghci> :type getLine
         getLine :: IO String

      Notice that both of these types have IO in their return value.
      That is your key to knowing that they may have side effects, or
      that they may return different values even when called with the
      same arguments, or both. The type of ``putStrLn`` looks like a
      function. It takes a parameter of type ``String`` and returns
      value of type ``IO ()``. Just what is an ``IO ()`` though?

      Anything that is type ``IO`` *``something``* is an I/O *action*.
      You can store it and nothing will happen. I could say
      ``writefoo = putStrLn "foo"`` and nothing happens right then. But
      if I later use ``writefoo`` in the middle of another I/O action,
      the ``writefoo`` action will be executed when its parent action is
      executed -- I/O actions can be glued together to form bigger I/O
      actions. The ``()`` is an empty tuple (pronounced “unit”),
      indicating that there is no return value from ``putStrLn``. This
      is similar to ``void`` in Java or
      C. :sup:`[` `16 <#ftn.id610538>`__ :sup:`]`

      .. Tip::

         Actions can be created, assigned, and passed anywhere.
         However, they may only be performed (executed) from
         within another I/O action.

      Let's look at this with **ghci**:

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> let writefoo = putStrLn "foo"
         ghci> writefoo
         foo

      In this example, the output ``foo`` is not a return value from
      ``putStrLn``. Rather, it's the side effect of ``putStrLn``
      actually writing ``foo`` to the terminal.

      Notice one other thing: **ghci** actually executed ``writefoo``.
      This means that, when given an I/O action, **ghci** will perform
      it for you on the spot.

      .. Note:: What Is An I/O Action?
           
         Actions:

         .. container:: itemizedlist

            -  Have the type ``IO`` *``t``*

            -  Are first-class values in Haskell and fit
               seamlessly with Haskell's type system

            -  Produce an effect when *performed*, but not when
               *evaluated*. That is, they only produce an
               effect when called by something else in an I/O
               context.

            -  Any expression may produce an action as its
               value, but the action will not perform I/O until
               it is executed inside another I/O action (or it
               is ``main``)

            -  Performing (executing) an action of type
               ``IO t`` may perform I/O and will ultimately
               deliver a result of type ``t``

      The type of ``getLine`` may look strange to you. It looks like a
      value, rather than a function. And in fact, that is one way to
      look at it: ``getLine`` is storing an I/O action. When that action
      is performed, you get a ``String``. The ``<-`` operator is used to
      "pull out" the result from performing an I/O action and store it
      in a variable.

      ``main`` itself is an I/O action with type ``IO ()``. You can only
      perform I/O actions from within other I/O actions. All I/O in
      Haskell programs is driven from the top at ``main``, which is
      where execution of every Haskell program begins. This, then, is
      the mechanism that provides isolation from side effects in
      Haskell: you perform I/O in your ``IO`` actions, and call pure
      (non-I/O) functions from there. Most Haskell code is pure; the I/O
      actions perform I/O and call that pure code.

      ``do`` is a convenient way to define a sequence of actions. As
      you'll see later, there are other ways. When you use ``do`` in
      this way, indentation is significant; make sure you line up your
      actions properly.

      You only need to use ``do`` if you have more than one action that
      you need to perform. The value of a ``do`` block is the value of
      the last action executed. For a complete description of ``do``
      syntax, see `the section called “Desugaring of do
      blocks” <monads.html#monads.do>`__.

      Let's consider an example of calling pure code from within an I/O
      action:

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch07/callingpure.hs
         name2reply :: String -> String
         name2reply name =
             "Pleased to meet you, " ++ name ++ ".\n" ++
             "Your name contains " ++ charcount ++ " characters."
             where charcount = show (length name)

         main :: IO ()
         main = do
                putStrLn "Greetings once again.  What is your name?"
                inpStr <- getLine
                let outStr = name2reply inpStr
                putStrLn outStr

      Notice the ``name2reply`` function in this example. It is a
      regular Haskell function and obeys all the rules we've told you
      about: it always returns the same result when given the same
      input, it has no side effects, and it operates lazily. It uses
      other Haskell functions: ``(++)``, ``show``, and ``length``.

      Down in ``main``, we bind the result of ``name2reply inpStr`` to
      ``outStr``. When you're working in a ``do`` block, you use ``<-``
      to get results from IO actions and ``let`` to get results from
      pure code. When used in a ``do`` block, you should not put ``in``
      after your ``let`` statement.

      You can see here how we read the person's name from the keyboard.
      Then, that data got passed to a pure function, and its result was
      printed. In fact, the last two lines of ``main`` could have been
      replaced with ``putStrLn (name2reply inpStr)``. So, while ``main``
      did have side effects—it caused things to appear on the terminal,
      for instance—``name2reply`` did not and could not. That's because
      ``name2reply`` is a pure function, not an action.

      Let's examine this with **ghci**:

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :load callingpure.hs
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( callingpure.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: Main.
         ghci> name2reply "John"
         "Pleased to meet you, John.\nYour name contains 4 characters."
         ghci> putStrLn (name2reply "John")
         Pleased to meet you, John.
         Your name contains 4 characters.

      The ``\n`` within the string is the end-of-line (newline)
      character, which causes the terminal to begin a new line in its
      output. Just calling ``name2reply "John"`` in **ghci** will show
      you the ``\n`` literally, because it is using ``show`` to display
      the return value. But using ``putStrLn`` sends it to the terminal,
      and the terminal interprets ``\n`` to start a new line.

      What do you think will happen if you simply type **``main``** at
      the **ghci** prompt? Give it a try.

      After looking at these example programs, you may be wondering if
      Haskell is really imperative rather than pure, lazy, and
      functional. Some of these examples look like a sequence of actions
      to be followed in order. There's more to it than that, though.
      We'll discuss that question later in this chapter in `the section
      called “Is Haskell Really Imperative?” <#io.imperative>`__
      and `the section called “Lazy I/O” <#io.lazy>`__.

         As a way to help with understanding the differences between
         pure code and I/O, here's a comparison table. When we speak of
         pure code, we are talking about Haskell functions that always
         return the same result when given the same input and have no
         side effects. In Haskell, only the execution of I/O actions
         avoid these rules.

         In this section, we've discussed how Haskell draws a clear
         distinction between pure code and I/O actions. Most languages
         don't draw this distinction. In languages such as C or Java,
         there is no such thing as a function that is guaranteed by the
         compiler to always return the same result for the same
         arguments, or a function that is guaranteed to never have side
         effects. The only way to know if a given function has side
         effects is to read its documentation and hope that it's
         accurate.

         Many bugs in programs are caused by unanticipated side effects.
         Still more are caused by misunderstanding circumstances in
         which functions may return different results for the same
         input. As multithreading and other forms of parallelism grow
         increasingly common, it becomes more difficult to manage global
         side effects.

         Haskell's method of isolating side effects into I/O actions
         provides a clear boundary. You can always know which parts of
         the system may alter state and which won't. You can always be
         sure that the pure parts of your program aren't having
         unanticipated results. This helps you to think about the
         program. It also helps the compiler to think about it. Recent
         versions of **ghc**, for instance, can provide a level of
         automatic parallelism for the pure parts of your code --
         something of a holy grail for computing.

         For more discussion on this topic, refer to the section called
         `“Side Effects with Lazy I/O” <#io.sideeffects>`__.

                  :name: io.files
                  :class: title

      So far, you've seen how to interact with the user at the
      computer's terminal. Of course, you'll often need to manipulate
      specific files. That's easy to do, too.

      Haskell defines quite a few basic functions for I/O, many of which
      are similar to functions seen in other programming languages. The
      library reference for ``System.IO`` provides a good summary of all
      the basic I/O functions, should you need one that we aren't
      touching upon here.

      You will generally begin by using ``openFile``, which will give
      you a file ``Handle``. That ``Handle`` is then used to perform
      specific operations on the file. Haskell provides functions such
      as ``hPutStrLn`` that work just like ``putStrLn`` but take an
      additional argument—a ``Handle``—that specifies which file to
      operate upon. When you're done, you'll use ``hClose`` to close the
      ``Handle``. These functions are all defined in ``System.IO``, so
      you'll need to import that module when working with files. There
      are "h" functions corresponding to virtually all of the non-"h"
      functions; for instance, there is ``print`` for printing to the
      screen and ``hPrint`` for printing to a file.

      Let's start with an imperative way to read and write files. This
      should seem similar to a ``while`` loop that you may find in other
      languages. This isn't the best way to write it in Haskell; later,
      you'll see examples of more Haskellish approaches.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch07/toupper-imp.hs
         import System.IO
         import Data.Char(toUpper)

         main :: IO ()
         main = do 
                inh <- openFile "input.txt" ReadMode
                outh <- openFile "output.txt" WriteMode
                mainloop inh outh
                hClose inh
                hClose outh

         mainloop :: Handle -> Handle -> IO ()
         mainloop inh outh = 
             do ineof <- hIsEOF inh
                if ineof
                    then return ()
                    else do inpStr <- hGetLine inh
                            hPutStrLn outh (map toUpper inpStr)
                            mainloop inh outh

      Like every Haskell program, execution of this program begins with
      ``main``. Two files are opened: ``input.txt`` is opened for
      reading, and ``output.txt`` is opened for writing. Then we call
      ``mainloop`` to process the file.

      ``mainloop`` begins by checking to see if we're at the end of file
      (EOF) for the input. If not, we read a line from the input. We
      write out the same line to the output, after first converting it
      to uppercase. Then we recursively call ``mainloop`` again to
      continue processing the
      file. :sup:`[` `17 <#ftn.id611551>`__ :sup:`]`

      Notice that ``return`` call. This is not really the same as
      ``return`` in C or Python. In those languages, ``return`` is used
      to terminate execution of the current function immediately, and to
      return a value to the caller. In Haskell, ``return`` is the
      opposite of ``<-``. That is, ``return`` takes a pure value and
      wraps it inside IO. Since every I/O action must return some IO
      type, if your result came from pure computation, you must use
      ``return`` to wrap it in IO. As an example, if ``7`` is an
      ``Int``, then ``return 7`` would create an action stored in a
      value of type ``IO Int``. When executed, that action would produce
      the result ``7``. For more details on ``return``, see `the section
      called “The True Nature of Return” <#io.return>`__.

      Let's try running the program. We've got a file named
      ``input.txt`` that looks like this:

      .. code:: programlisting

         This is ch08/input.txt

         Test Input
         I like Haskell

         I/O is fun

         123456789
             

      Now, you can use ``runghc toupper-imp.hs`` and you'll find
      ``output.txt`` in your directory. It should look like this:

      .. code:: programlisting

         THIS IS CH08/INPUT.TXT

         TEST INPUT

         Let's use **ghci** to check on the type of ``openFile``:

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :module System.IO
            ghci> :type openFile
            openFile :: FilePath -> IOMode -> IO Handle

         ``FilePath`` is simply another name for ``String``. It is used
         in the types of I/O functions to help clarify that the
         parameter is being used as a filename, and not as regular data.

         ``IOMode`` specifies how the file is to be managed. The
         possible values for ``IOMode`` are listed in `Table 7.2,
         “Possible IOMode
         Values” <#io.files.openFile.IOModes>`__.

         While we are mostly working with text examples in this chapter,
         binary files can also be used in Haskell. If you are working
         with a binary file, you should use ``openBinaryFile`` instead
         of ``openFile``. Operating systems such as Windows process
         files differently if they are opened as binary instead of as
         text. On operating systems such as Linux, both ``openFile`` and
         ``openBinaryFile`` perform the same operation. Nevertheless,
         for portability, it is still wise to always use
         ``openBinaryFile`` if you will be dealing with binary data.

                  .. rubric:: Closing Handles
                     :name: io.files.closing
                     :class: title

         You've already seen that ``hClose`` is used to close file
         handles. Let's take a moment and think about why this is
         important.

         As you'll see in `the section called
         “Buffering” <#io.buffering>`__, Haskell maintains
         internal buffers for files. This provides an important
         performance boost. However, it means that until you call
         ``hClose`` on a file that is open for writing, your data may
         not be flushed out to the operating system.

         Another reason to make sure to ``hClose`` files is that open
         files take up resources on the system. If your program runs for
         a long time, and opens many files but fails to close them, it
         is conceivable that your program could even crash due to
         resource exhaustion. All of this is no different in Haskell
         than in other languages.

         When a program exits, Haskell will normally take care of
         closing any files that remain open. However, there are some
         circumstances in which this may not
         happen :sup:`[` `18 <#ftn.id612101>`__ :sup:`]`, so once
         again, it is best to be responsible and call ``hClose`` all the
         time.

         Haskell provides several tools for you to use to easily ensure
         this happens, regardless of whether errors are present. You can
         read about ``finally`` in the section called 
         `“Extended Example: Functional I/O and Temporary Files” <#io.example>`__ 
         and ``bracket`` in the section called
         *  `“The acquire-use-release cycle” <#find.acquire.use.release>`__.

                  .. rubric:: Seek and Tell
                     :name: io.files.seeking
                     :class: title

         When reading and writing from a ``Handle`` that corresponds to
         a file on disk, the operating system maintains an internal
         record of the current position. Each time you do another read,
         the operating system returns the next chunk of data that begins
         at the current position, and increments the position to reflect
         the data that you read.

         You can use ``hTell`` to find out your current position in the
         file. When the file is initially created, it is empty and your
         position will be 0. After you write out 5 bytes, your position
         will be 5, and so on. ``hTell`` takes a ``Handle`` and returns
         an ``IO Integer`` with your position.

         The companion to ``hTell`` is ``hSeek``. ``hSeek`` lets you
         change the file position. It takes three parameters: a
         ``Handle``, a ``SeekMode``, and a position.

         ``SeekMode`` can be one of three different values, which
         specify how the given position is to be interpreted.
         ``AbsoluteSeek`` means that the position is a precise location
         in the file. This is the same kind of information that
         ``hTell`` gives you. ``RelativeSeek`` means to seek from the
         current position. A positive number requests going forwards in
         the file, and a negative number means going backwards. Finally,
         ``SeekFromEnd`` will seek to the specified number of bytes
         before the end of the file. ``hSeek handle SeekFromEnd 0`` will
         take you to the end of the file. For an example of ``hSeek``,
         refer to `the section called “Extended Example: Functional I/O
         and Temporary Files” <#io.example>`__.

         Not all ``Handle`` s are seekable. A ``Handle`` usually
         corresponds to a file, but it can also correspond to other
         things such as network connections, tape drives, or terminals.
         You can use ``hIsSeekable`` to see if a given ``Handle`` is
         seekable.

                     :name: io.files.stdin
                     :class: title

         Earlier, we pointed out that for each non-"h" function, there
         is usually also a corresponding "h" function that works on any
         ``Handle``. In fact, the non-"h" functions are nothing more
         than shortcuts for their "h" counterparts.

         There are three pre-defined ``Handle`` s in ``System.IO``.
         These ``Handle`` s are always available for your use. They are
         ``stdin``, which corresponds to standard input; ``stdout`` for
         standard output; and ``stderr`` for standard error. Standard
         input normally refers to the keyboard, standard output to the
         monitor, and standard error also normally goes to the monitor.

         Functions such as ``getLine`` can thus be trivially defined
         like this:

         .. code:: programlisting

            getLine = hGetLine stdin
            putStrLn = hPutStrLn stdout
            print = hPrint stdout

         .. Tip::

            We're using partial application here. If this isn't
            making sense, consult `the section called “Partial
            function application and
            currying” <functional-programming.html#fp.partialapp>`__
            for a refresher.

         Earlier, we told you what the three standard file handles
         "normally" correspond to. That's because some operating systems
         let you redirect the file handles to come from (or go to)
         different places—files, devices, or even other programs. This
         feature is used extensively in shell scripting on POSIX (Linux,
         BSD, Mac) operating systems, but can also be used on Windows.

         It often makes sense to use standard input and output instead
         of specific files. This lets you interact with a human at the
         terminal. But it also lets you work with input and output
         files—or even combine your code with other programs—if that's
         what's requested. :sup:`[` `19 <#ftn.id612475>`__ :sup:`]`

         As an example, we can provide input to ``callingpure.hs`` in
         advance like this:

         .. code:: screen

            $ echo John|runghc callingpure.hs
            Greetings once again.  What is your name?
            Pleased to meet you, John.
            Your name contains 4 characters.
                  

         While ``callingpure.hs`` was running, it did not wait for input
         at the keyboard; instead it received ``John`` from the ``echo``
         program. Notice also that the output didn't contain the word
         ``John`` on a separate line as it did when this program was run
         at the keyboard. The terminal normally echoes everything you
         type back to you, but that is technically input, and is not
         included in the output stream.

                     :class: title

         So far in this chapter, we've discussed the contents of the
         files. Let's now talk a bit about the files themselves.

         ``System.Directory`` provides two functions you may find
         useful. ``removeFile`` takes a single argument, a filename, and
         deletes that file. :sup:`[` `20 <#ftn.id612589>`__ :sup:`]`
         ``renameFile`` takes two filenames: the first is the old name
         and the second is the new name. If the new filename is in a
         different directory, you can also think of this as a move. The
         old filename must exist prior to the call to ``renameFile``. If
         the new file already exists, it is removed before the rename
         takes place.

         Like many other functions that take a filename, if the "old"
         name doesn't exist, ``renameFile`` will raise an exception.
         More information on exception handling can be found in
         `Chapter 19, Error handling <error-handling.html>`__.

         There are many other functions in ``System.Directory`` for
         doing things such as creating and removing directories, finding
         lists of files in directories, and testing for file existence.
         These are discussed in `the section called “Directory and File
         Information” <systems-programming-in-haskell.html#systems.directories>`__.

                     :name: io.files.temp
                     :class: title

         Programmers frequently need temporary files. These files may be
         used to store large amounts of data needed for computations,
         data to be used by other programs, or any number of other uses.

         While you could craft a way to manually open files with unique
         names, the details of doing this in a secure way differ from
         platform to platform. Haskell provides a convenient function
         called ``openTempFile`` (and a corresponding
         ``openBinaryTempFile``) to handle the difficult bits for you.

         ``openTempFile`` takes two parameters: the directory in which
         to create the file, and a "template" for naming the file. The
         directory could simply be ``"."`` for the current working
         directory. Or you could use
         ``System.Directory.getTemporaryDirectory`` to find the best
         place for temporary files on a given machine. The template is
         used as the basis for the file name; it will have some random
         characters added to it to ensure that the result is truly
         unique. It guarantees that it will be working on a unique
         filename, in fact.

         The return type of ``openTempFile`` is
         ``IO (FilePath, Handle)``. The first part of the tuple is the
         name of the file created, and the second is a ``Handle`` opened
         in ``ReadWriteMode`` over that file. When you're done with the
         file, you'll want to ``hClose`` it and then call ``removeFile``
         to delete it. See the following example for a sample function
         to use.

      it does and how it works.

      Let's start looking at this program from the end. The
      ``withTempFile`` function demonstrates that Haskell doesn't forget
      its functional nature when I/O is introduced. This function takes
      a ``String`` and another function. The function passed to
      ``withTempFile`` is invoked with the name and ``Handle`` of a
      temporary file. When that function exits, the temporary file is
      closed and deleted. So even when dealing with I/O, we can still
      find the idiom of passing functions as parameters to be
      convenient. Lisp programmers might find our ``withTempFile``
      function similar to Lisp's ``with-open-file`` function.

      There is some exception handling going on to make the program more
      robust in the face of errors. You normally want the temporary
      files to be deleted after processing completes, even if something
      went wrong. So we make sure that happens. For more on exception
      handling, see `Chapter 19, Error
      handling <error-handling.html>`__.

      Let's return to the start of the program. ``main`` is defined
      simply as ``withTempFile "mytemp.txt" myAction``. ``myAction``,
      then, will be invoked with the name and ``Handle`` of the
      temporary file.

      ``myAction`` displays some information to the terminal, writes
      some data to the file, seeks to the beginning of the file, and
      reads the data back with
      ``hGetContents``. :sup:`[` `21 <#ftn.id612980>`__ :sup:`]` It
      then displays the contents of the file byte-for-byte, and also as
      a Haskell literal via ``print c``. That's the same as
      ``putStrLn (show c)``.

      Let's look at the output:

      .. code:: screen

         $ runhaskell tempfile.hs
         Welcome to tempfile.hs
         I have a temporary file at /tmp/mytemp8572.txt
         My initial position is 0
         Writing one line containing 22 bytes: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
         After writing, my new position is 23
         The file content is:
         [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

         Which could be expressed as this Haskell literal:
         "[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n"
             

      Every time you run this program, your temporary file name should
      be slightly different since it contains a randomly-generated
      component. Looking at this output, there are a few questions that
      might occur to you:

      .. container:: orderedlist

         1. Why is your position 23 after writing a line with 22 bytes?

         2. Why is there an empty line after the file content display?

         3. Why is there a ``\n`` at the end of the Haskell literal
            display?

      You might be able to guess that the answers to all three questions
      are related. See if you can work out the answers for a moment. If
      you need some help, here are the explanations:

      .. container:: orderedlist

         1. That's because we used ``hPutStrLn`` instead of ``hPutStr``
            to write the data. ``hPutStrLn`` always terminates the line
            by writing a ``\n`` at the end, which didn't appear in
            ``tempdata``.

         2. We used ``putStrLn c`` to display the file contents ``c``.
            Because the data was written originally with ``hPutStrLn``,
            ``c`` ends with the newline character, and ``putStrLn`` adds
            a second newline character. The result is a blank line.

         3. The ``\n`` is the newline character from the original
            ``hPutStrLn``.

      As a final note, the byte counts may be different on some
      operating systems. Windows, for instance, uses the two-byte
      sequence ``\r\n`` as the end-of-line marker, so you may see
      differences on that platform.

                  :name: io.lazy
                  :class: title

      So far in this chapter, you've seen examples of fairly traditional
      I/O. Each line, or block of data, is requested individually and
      processed individually.

      Haskell has another approach available to you as well. Since
      Haskell is a lazy language, meaning that any given piece of data
      is only evaluated when its value must be known, there are some
      novel ways of approaching I/O.

      .. container:: sect2

         .. container:: titlepage

            .. container::

               .. container::

                  .. rubric:: hGetContents
                     :name: io.lazy.hGetContents
                     :class: title

         One novel way to approach I/O is the ``hGetContents``
         function. :sup:`[` `22 <#ftn.id613259>`__ :sup:`]`
         ``hGetContents`` has the type ``Handle -> IO String``. The
         ``String`` it returns represents all of the data in the file
         given by the
         ``Handle``. :sup:`[` `23 <#ftn.id613298>`__ :sup:`]`

         In a strictly-evaluated language, using such a function is
         often a bad idea. It may be fine to read the entire contents of
         a 2KB file, but if you try to read the entire contents of a
         500GB file, you are likely to crash due to lack of RAM to store
         all that data. In these languages, you would traditionally use
         mechanisms such as loops to process the file's entire data.

         But ``hGetContents`` is different. The ``String`` it returns is
         evaluated lazily. At the moment you call ``hGetContents``,
         nothing is actually read. Data is only read from the ``Handle``
         as the elements (characters) of the list are processed. As
         elements of the ``String`` are no longer used, Haskell's
         garbage collector automatically frees that memory. All of this
         happens completely transparently to you. And since you have
         what looks like—and, really, is—a pure ``String``, you can pass
         it to pure (non-IO) code.

         Let's take a quick look at an example. Back in `the section
         called “Working With Files and Handles” <#io.files>`__,
         you saw an imperative program that converted the entire content
         of a file to uppercase. Its imperative algorithm was similar to
         what you'd see in many other languages. Here now is the much
         simpler algorithm that exploits lazy evaluation:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/toupper-lazy1.hs
            import System.IO
            import Data.Char(toUpper)

            main :: IO ()
            main = do 
                   inh <- openFile "input.txt" ReadMode
                   outh <- openFile "output.txt" WriteMode
                   inpStr <- hGetContents inh
                   let result = processData inpStr
                   hPutStr outh result
                   hClose inh
                   hClose outh

            processData :: String -> String
            processData = map toUpper

         Notice that ``hGetContents`` handled *all* of the reading for
         us. Also, take a look at ``processData``. It's a pure function
         since it has no side effects and always returns the same result
         each time it is called. It has no need to know—and no way to
         tell—that its input is being read lazily from a file in this
         case. It can work perfectly well with a 20-character literal or
         a 500GB data dump on disk.

         You can even verify that with **ghci**:

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :load toupper-lazy1.hs
            [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( toupper-lazy1.hs, interpreted )
            Ok, modules loaded: Main.
            ghci> processData "Hello, there!  How are you?"
            "HELLO, THERE!  HOW ARE YOU?"
            ghci> :type processData
            processData :: String -> String
            ghci> :type processData "Hello!"
            processData "Hello!" :: String

         .. warning::

            If we had tried to hang on to ``inpStr`` in the
            above example, past the one place where it was used
            (the call to ``processData``), the program would
            have lost its memory efficiency. That's because the
            compiler would have been forced to keep
            ``inpStr``'s value in memory for future use. Here
            it knows that ``inpStr`` will never be reused, and
            frees the memory as soon as it is done with it.
            Just remember: memory is only freed after its last
            use.

         This program was a bit verbose to make it clear that there was
         pure code in use. Here's a bit more concise version, which we
         will build on in the next examples:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/toupper-lazy2.hs
            import System.IO
            import Data.Char(toUpper)

            main = do 
                   inh <- openFile "input.txt" ReadMode
                   outh <- openFile "output.txt" WriteMode
                   inpStr <- hGetContents inh
                   hPutStr outh (map toUpper inpStr)
                   hClose inh
                   hClose outh

         You are not required to ever consume all the data from the
         input file when using ``hGetContents``. Whenever the Haskell
         system determines that the entire string ``hGetContents``
         returned can be garbage collected —which means it will never
         again be used—the file is closed for you automatically. The
         same principle applies to data read from the file. Whenever a
         given piece of data will never again be needed, the Haskell
         environment releases the memory it was stored within. Strictly
         speaking, we wouldn't have to call ``hClose`` at all in this
         example program. However, it is still a good practice to get
         into, as later changes to a program could make the call to
         ``hClose`` important.

         .. warning::

            When using ``hGetContents``, it is important to
            remember that even though you may never again
            explicitly reference ``Handle`` directly in the
            rest of the program, you must not close the
            ``Handle`` until you have finished consuming its
            results via ``hGetContents``. Doing so would cause
            you to miss on some or all of the file's data.
            Since Haskell is lazy, you generally can assume
            that you have consumed input only after you have
            output the result of the computations involving the
            input.

      .. container:: sect2

               .. container::

                  .. rubric:: readFile and writeFile
                     :name: io.lazy.readFile
                     :class: title

         Haskell programmers use ``hGetContents`` as a filter quite
         often. They read from one file, do something to the data, and
         write the result out elsewhere. This is so common that there
         are some shortcuts for doing it. ``readFile`` and ``writeFile``
         are shortcuts for working with files as strings. They handle
         all the details of opening files, closing files, reading data,
         and writing data. ``readFile`` uses ``hGetContents``
         internally.

         Can you guess the Haskell types of these functions? Let's check
         with **ghci**:

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :type readFile
            readFile :: FilePath -> IO String
            ghci> :type writeFile
            writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO ()

         Now, here's an example program that uses ``readFile`` and
         ``writeFile``:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/toupper-lazy3.hs
            import Data.Char(toUpper)

            main = do 
                   inpStr <- readFile "input.txt"
                   writeFile "output.txt" (map toUpper inpStr)

         Look at that—the guts of the program take up only two lines!
         ``readFile`` returned a lazy ``String``, which we stored in
         ``inpStr``. We then took that, processed it, and passed it to
         ``writeFile`` for writing.

         Neither ``readFile`` nor ``writeFile`` ever provide a
         ``Handle`` for you to work with, so there is nothing to ever
         ``hClose``. ``readFile`` uses ``hGetContents`` internally, and
         the underlying ``Handle`` will be closed when the returned
         ``String`` is garbage-collected or all the input has been
         consumed. ``writeFile`` will close its underlying ``Handle``
         when the entire ``String`` supplied to it has been written.

         By now, you should understand how lazy input works in Haskell.
         But what about laziness during output?

         As you know, nothing in Haskell is evaluated before its value
         is needed. Since functions such as ``writeFile`` and ``putStr``
         write out the entire ``String`` passed to them, that entire
         ``String`` must be evaluated. So you are guaranteed that the
         argument to ``putStr`` will be evaluated in
         full. :sup:`[` `24 <#ftn.id613923>`__ :sup:`]`

         But what does that mean for laziness of the input? In the
         examples above, will the call to ``putStr`` or ``writeFile``
         force the entire input string to be loaded into memory at once,
         just to be written out?

         The answer is no. ``putStr`` (and all the similar output
         functions) write out data as it becomes available. They also
         have no need for keeping around data already written, so as
         long as nothing else in the program needs it, the memory can be
         freed immediately. In a sense, you can think of the ``String``
         between ``readFile`` and ``writeFile`` as a pipe linking the
         two. Data goes in one end, is transformed some way, and flows
         back out the other.

         You can verify this yourself by generating a large
         ``input.txt`` for ``toupper-lazy3.hs``. It may take a bit to
         process, but you should see a constant—and low—memory usage
         while it is being processed.

                     :class: title

         You learned that ``readFile`` and ``writeFile`` address the
         common situation of reading from one file, making a conversion,
         and writing to a different file. There's a situation that's
         even more common than that: reading from standard input, making
         a conversion, and writing the result to standard output. For
         that situation, there is a function called ``interact``. The
         type of ``interact`` is ``(String -> String) -> IO ()``. That
         is, it takes one argument: a function of type
         ``String -> String``. That function is passed the result of
         ``getContents``—that is, standard input read lazily. The result
         of that function is sent to standard output.

         We can convert our example program to operate on standard input
         and standard output by using ``interact``. Here's one way to do
         that:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/toupper-lazy4.hs
            import Data.Char(toUpper)

            main = interact (map toUpper)

         Look at that—*one* line of code to achieve our transformation!
         To achieve the same effect as with the previous examples, you
         could run this one like this:

         .. code:: screen

            $ runghc toupper-lazy4.hs < input.txt > output.txt
                  

         Or, if you'd like to see the output printed to the screen, you
         could type:

         .. code:: screen

            $ runghc toupper-lazy4.hs < input.txt
                  

         If you want to see that Haskell output truly does write out
         chunks of data as soon as they are received, run
         ``runghc toupper-lazy4.hs`` without any other command-line
         parameters. You should see each character echoed back out as
         soon as you type it, but in uppercase. Buffering may change
         this behavior; see the section called
         `“Buffering” <#io.buffering>`__ later in this chapter for
         more on buffering. If you see each line echoed as soon as you
         type it, or even nothing at all for awhile, buffering is
         causing this behavior.

         You can also write simple interactive programs using
         ``interact``. Let's start with a simple example: adding a line
         of text before the uppercase output.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/toupper-lazy5.hs
            import Data.Char(toUpper)

            main = interact (map toUpper . (++) "Your data, in uppercase, is:\n\n")

         .. Tip::

            If the use of the ``.`` operator is confusing, you
            might wish to refer to the section called 
            `“Code reuse through composition” <functional-programming.html#fp.compose>`__.

         Here we add a string at the beginning of the output. Can you
         spot the problem, though?

         Since we're calling ``map`` on the *result* of ``(++)``, that
         header itself will appear in uppercase. We can fix that in this
         way:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/toupper-lazy6.hs
            import Data.Char(toUpper)

            main = interact ((++) "Your data, in uppercase, is:\n\n" . 
                             map toUpper)

         This moved the header outside of the ``map``.

                        :class: title

            Another common use of ``interact`` is filtering. Let's say
            that you want to write a program that reads a file and
            prints out every line that contains the character "a".
            Here's how you might do that with ``interact``:

            .. code:: programlisting

               -- file: ch07/filter.hs
               main = interact (unlines . filter (elem 'a') . lines)

            This may have introduced three functions that you aren't
            familiar with yet. Let's inspect their types with **ghci**:

            .. code:: screen

               ghci> :type lines
               lines :: String -> [String]
               ghci> :type unlines
               unlines :: [String] -> String
               ghci> :type elem
               elem :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool

            Can you guess what these functions do just by looking at
            their types? If not, you can find them explained in `the
            section called “Warming up: portably splitting lines of
            text” <functional-programming.html#fp.splitlines>`__ and
            `the section called “Special string-handling
            functions” <functional-programming.html#fp.lists.strings>`__.
            You'll frequently see ``lines`` and ``unlines`` used with
            I/O. Finally, ``elem`` takes a element and a list and
            returns ``True`` if that element occurs anywhere in the
            list.

            Try running this over our standard example input:

            .. code:: screen

                 $ runghc filter.hs < input.txt
                 I like Haskell
                 Haskell is great
                       

            Sure enough, you got back the two lines that contain an "a".
            Lazy filters are a powerful way to use Haskell. When you
            think about it, a filter—such as the standard Unix program
            **grep**—sounds a lot like a function. It takes some input,
            applies some computation, and generates a predictable
            output.

                  :class: title

      You've seen a number of examples of I/O in Haskell by this point.
      Let's take a moment to step back and think about how I/O relates
      to the broader Haskell language.

      Since Haskell is a pure language, if you give a certain function a
      specific argument, the function will return the same result every
      time you give it that argument. Moreover, the function will not
      change anything about the program's overall state.

      You may be wondering, then, how I/O fits into this picture. Surely
      if you want to read a line of input from the keyboard, the
      function to read input can't possibly return the same result every
      time it is run, right? Moreover, I/O is all about changing state.
      I/O could cause pixels on a terminal to light up, to cause paper
      to start coming out of a printer, or even to cause a package to be
      shipped from a warehouse on a different continent. I/O doesn't
      just change the state of a program. You can think of I/O as
      changing the state of the world.

                     :name: io.monad.actions
                     :class: title

         Most languages do not make a distinction between a pure
         function and an impure one. Haskell has functions in the
         mathematical sense: they are purely computations which cannot
         be altered by anything external. Moreover, the computation can
         be performed at any time—or even never, if its result is never
         needed.

         Clearly, then, we need some other tool to work with I/O. That
         tool in Haskell is called *actions*. Actions resemble
         functions. They do nothing when they are defined, but perform
         some task when they are invoked. I/O actions are defined within
         the IO monad. Monads are a powerful way of chaining functions
         together purely and are covered in 
         `Chapter 14, Monads <monads.html>`__. It's not necessary to understand
         monads in order to understand I/O. Just understand that the
         result type of actions is "tagged" with IO. Let's take a look
         at some types:

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :type putStrLn
            putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
            ghci> :type getLine
            getLine :: IO String

         The type of ``putStrLn`` is just like any other function. The
         function takes one parameter and returns an ``IO ()``. This
         ``IO ()`` is the action. You can store and pass actions in pure
         code if you wish, though this isn't frequently done. An action
         doesn't do anything until it is invoked. Let's look at an
         example of this:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/actions.hs
            str2action :: String -> IO ()
            str2action input = putStrLn ("Data: " ++ input)

            list2actions :: [String] -> [IO ()]
            list2actions = map str2action

            numbers :: [Int]
            numbers = [1..10]

            strings :: [String]
            strings = map show numbers

            actions :: [IO ()]
            actions = list2actions strings

            printitall :: IO ()
            printitall = runall actions

            -- Take a list of actions, and execute each of them in turn.
            runall :: [IO ()] -> IO ()
            runall [] = return ()
            runall (firstelem:remainingelems) = 
                do firstelem
                   runall remainingelems

            main = do str2action "Start of the program"
                      printitall
                      str2action "Done!"

         ``str2action`` is a function that takes one parameter and
         returns an ``IO ()``. As you can see at the end of ``main``,
         you could use this directly in another action and it will print
         out a line right away. Or, you can store—but not execute—the
         action from pure code. You can see an example of that in
         ``list2actions``—we use ``map`` over ``str2action`` and return
         a list of actions, just like we would with other pure data. You
         can see that everything up through ``printitall`` is built up
         with pure tools.

         Although we define ``printitall``, it doesn't get executed
         until its action is evaluated somewhere else. Notice in
         ``main`` how we use ``str2action`` as an I/O action to be
         executed, but earlier we used it outside of the I/O monad and
         assembled results into a list.

         You could think of it this way: every statement, except
         ``let``, in a ``do`` block must yield an I/O action which will
         be executed.

         The call to ``printitall`` finally executes all those actions.
         Actually, since Haskell is lazy, the actions aren't generated
         until here either.

         When you run the program, your output will look like this:

         .. code:: screen

            Data: Start of the program
            Data: 1
            Data: 2
            Data: 3
            Data: 4
            Data: 5
            Data: 6
            Data: 7
            Data: 8
            Data: 9
            Data: 10
            Data: Done!
                  

         We can actually write this in a much more compact way. Consider
         this revision of the example:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/actions2.hs
            str2message :: String -> String
            str2message input = "Data: " ++ input

            str2action :: String -> IO ()
            str2action = putStrLn . str2message

            numbers :: [Int]
            numbers = [1..10]

            main = do str2action "Start of the program"
                      mapM_ (str2action . show) numbers
                      str2action "Done!"

         Notice in ``str2action`` the use of the standard function
         composition operator. In ``main``, there's a call to ``mapM_``.
         This function is similar to ``map``. It takes a function and a
         list. The function supplied to ``mapM_`` is an I/O action that
         is executed for every item in the list. ``mapM_`` throws out
         the result of the function, though you can use ``mapM`` to
         return a list of I/O results if you want them. Take a look at
         their types:

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :type mapM
            mapM :: (Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
            ghci> :type mapM_
            mapM_ :: (Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m ()

         .. Tip::

            These functions actually work for more than just
            I/O; they work for any ``Monad``. For now, wherever
            you see "M", just think "IO". Also, functions that
            end with an underscore typically discard their
            result.

         Why a ``mapM`` when we already have ``map``? Because ``map`` is
         a pure function that returns a list. It doesn't—and
         can't—actually execute actions directly. ``mapM`` is a utility
         that lives in the IO monad and thus can actually execute the
         actions. :sup:`[` `25 <#ftn.id614894>`__ :sup:`]`

         Going back to ``main``, ``mapM_`` applies
         ``(str2action . show)`` to every element in ``numbers``.
         ``show`` converts each number to a ``String`` and
         ``str2action`` converts each ``String`` to an action. ``mapM_``
         combines these individual actions into one big action that
         prints out lines.

                     :class: title

         ``do`` blocks are actually shortcut notations for joining
         together actions. There are two operators that you can use
         instead of ``do`` blocks: ``>>`` and ``>>=``. Let's look at
         their types in **ghci**:

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :type (>>)
            (>>) :: (Monad m) => m a -> m b -> m b
            ghci> :type (>>=)
            (>>=) :: (Monad m) => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b

         The ``>>`` operator sequences two actions together: the first
         action is performed, then the second. The result of the
         computation is the result of the second action. The result of
         the first action is thrown away. This is similar to simply
         having a line in a ``do`` block. You might write
         ``putStrLn "line 1"`` ``>>`` ``putStrLn "line 2"`` to test
         this out. It will print out two lines, discard the result from
         the first ``putStrLn``, and provide the result from the second.

         The ``>>=`` operator runs an action, then passes its result to
         a function that returns an action. That second action is run as
         well, and the result of the entire expression is the result of
         that second action. As an example, you could write
         ``getLine`` ``>>=`` ``putStrLn``, which would read a line
         from the keyboard and then display it back out.

         Let's re-write one of our examples to avoid ``do`` blocks.
         Remember this example from the start of the chapter?

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/basicio.hs
            main = do
                   putStrLn "Greetings!  What is your name?"
                   inpStr <- getLine
                   putStrLn $ "Welcome to Haskell, " ++ inpStr ++ "!"

         Let's write that without a ``do`` block:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/basicio-nodo.hs
            main =
                putStrLn "Greetings!  What is your name?" >>
                getLine >>=
                (\inpStr -> putStrLn $ "Welcome to Haskell, " ++ inpStr ++ "!")

         The Haskell compiler internally performans a translation just
         like this when you define a ``do`` block.

                  .. rubric:: The True Nature of Return
                     :name: io.return
                     :class: title

         Earlier in this chapter, we mentioned that ``return`` is
         probably not what it looks like. Many languages have a keyword
         named ``return`` that aborts execution of a function
         immediately and returns a value to the caller.

         The Haskell ``return`` function is quite different. In Haskell,
         ``return`` is used to wrap data in a monad. When speaking about
         I/O, ``return`` is used to take pure data and bring it into the
         IO monad.

         Now, why would we want to do that? Remember that anything whose
         result depends on I/O must be within the IO monad. So if we are
         writing a function that performs I/O, then a pure computation,
         we will need to use ``return`` to make this pure computation
         the proper return value of the function. Otherwise, a type
         error would occur. Here's an example:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/return1.hs
            import Data.Char(toUpper)

            isGreen :: IO Bool
            isGreen =
                do putStrLn "Is green your favorite color?"
                   inpStr <- getLine
                   return ((toUpper . head $ inpStr) == 'Y')

         We have a pure computation that yields a ``Bool``. That
         computation is passed to ``return``, which puts it into the IO
         monad. Since it is the last value in the ``do`` block, it
         becomes the return value of ``isGreen``, but this is not
         because we used the ``return`` function.

         Here's a version of the same program with the pure computation
         broken out into a separate function. This helps keep the pure
         code separate, and can also make the intent more clear.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/return2.hs
            import Data.Char(toUpper)

            isYes :: String -> Bool
            isYes inpStr = (toUpper . head $ inpStr) == 'Y'

            isGreen :: IO Bool
            isGreen =
                do putStrLn "Is green your favorite color?"
                   inpStr <- getLine
                   return (isYes inpStr)

         Finally, here's a contrived example to show that ``return``
         truly does not have to occur at the end of a ``do`` block. In
         practice, it usually is, but it need not be so.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch07/return3.hs
            returnTest :: IO ()
            returnTest =
                do one <- return 1
                   let two = 2
                   putStrLn $ show (one + two)

         Notice that we used ``<-`` in combination with ``return``, but
         ``let`` in combination with the simple literal. That's because
         we needed both values to be pure in order to add them, and
         ``<-`` pulls things out of monads, effectively reversing the
         effect of ``return``. Run this in **ghci** and you'll see ``3``
         displayed, as expected.

                  :name: io.imperative
                  :class: title

      These ``do`` blocks may look a lot like an imperative language.
      After all, you're giving commands to run in sequence most of the
      time.

      But Haskell remains a lazy language at its core. While it is
      necessary to sequence actions for I/O at times, this is done using
      tools that are part of Haskell already. Haskell achieves a nice
      separation of I/O from the rest of the language through the IO
      monad as well.

               .. rubric:: Side Effects with Lazy I/O
                  :name: io.sideeffects
                  :class: title

      Earlier in this chapter, you read about ``hGetContents``. We
      explained that the ``String`` it returns can be used in pure code.

      We need to get a bit more specific about what side effects are.
      When we say Haskell has no side-effects, what exactly does that
      mean?

      At a certain level, side-effects are always possible. A
      poorly-written loop, even if written in pure code, could cause the
      system's RAM to be exhausted and the machine to crash. Or it could
      cause data to be swapped to disk.

      When we speak of no side effects, we mean that pure code in
      Haskell can't run commands that trigger side effects. Pure
      functions can't modify a global variable, request I/O, or run a
      command to take down a system.

      When you have a ``String`` from ``hGetContents`` that is passed to
      a pure function, the function has no idea that this ``String`` is
      backed by a disk file. It will behave just as it always would, but
      processing that ``String`` may cause the environment to issue I/O
      commands. The pure function isn't issuing them; they are happening
      as a result of the processing the pure function is doing, just as
      with the example of swapping RAM to disk.

      In some cases, you may need more control over exactly when your
      I/O occurs. Perhaps you are reading data interactively from the
      user, or via a pipe from another program, and need to communicate
      directly with the user. In those cases, ``hGetContents`` will
      probably not be appropriate.

               .. rubric:: Buffering
                  :name: io.buffering
                  :class: title

      The I/O subsystem is one of the slowest parts of a modern
      computer. Completing a write to disk can take thousands of times
      as long as a write to memory. A write over the network can be
      hundreds or thousands of times slower yet. Even if your operation
      doesn't directly communicate with the disk—perhaps because the
      data is cached—I/O still involves a system call, which slows
      things down by itself.

      For this reason, modern operating systems and programming
      languages both provide tools to help programs perform better where
      I/O is concerned. The operating system typically performs
      caching—storing frequently-used pieces of data in memory for
      faster access.

      Programming languages typically perform buffering. This means that
      they may request one large chunk of data from the operating
      system, even if the code underneath is processing data one
      character at a time. By doing this, they can achieve remarkable
      performance gains because each request for I/O to the operating
      system carries a processing cost. Buffering allows us to read the
      same amount of data with far fewer I/O requests.

      Haskell, too, provides buffering in its I/O system. In many cases,
      it is even on by default. Up till now, we have pretended it isn't
      there. Haskell usually is good about picking a good default
      buffering mode. But this default is rarely the fastest. If you
      have speed-critical I/O code, changing buffering could make a
      significant impact on your program.

                  .. rubric:: Buffering Modes
                     :name: id615631
                     :class: title

         There are three different buffering modes in Haskell. They are
         defined as the ``BufferMode`` type: ``NoBuffering``,
         ``LineBuffering``, and ``BlockBuffering``.

         ``NoBuffering`` does just what it sounds like—no buffering.
         Data read via functions like ``hGetLine`` will be read from the
         OS one character at a time. Data written will be written
         immediately, and also often will be written one character at a
         time. For this reason, ``NoBuffering`` is usually a very poor
         performer and not suitable for general-purpose use.

         ``LineBuffering`` causes the output buffer to be written
         whenever the newline character is output, or whenever it gets
         too large. On input, it will usually attempt to read whatever
         data is available in chunks until it first sees the newline
         character. When reading from the terminal, it should return
         data immediately after each press of Enter. It is often a
         reasonable default.

         ``BlockBuffering`` causes Haskell to read or write data in
         fixed-size chunks when possible. This is the best performer
         when processing large amounts of data in batch, even if that
         data is line-oriented. However, it is unusable for interactive
         programs because it will block input until a full block is
         read. ``BlockBuffering`` accepts one parameter of type
         ``Maybe``: if ``Nothing``, it will use an
         implementation-defined buffer size. Or, you can use a setting
         such as ``Just 4096`` to set the buffer to 4096 bytes.

         The default buffering mode is dependent upon the operating
         system and Haskell implementation. You can ask the system for
         the current buffering mode by calling ``hGetBuffering``. The
         current mode can be set with ``hSetBuffering``, which accepts a
         ``Handle`` and ``BufferMode``. As an example, you can say
         ``hSetBuffering stdin (BlockBuffering Nothing)``.

                     :class: title

         For any type of buffering, you may sometimes want to force
         Haskell to write out any data that has been saved up in the
         buffer. There are a few times when this will happen
         automatically: a call to ``hClose``, for instance. Sometimes
         you may want to instead call ``hFlush``, which will force any
         pending data to be written immediately. This could be useful
         when the ``Handle`` is a network socket and you want the data
         to be transmitted immediately, or when you want to make the
         data on disk available to other programs that might be reading
         it concurrently.

                  :name: io.args
                  :class: title

      Many command-line programs are interested in the parameters passed
      on the command line. ``System.Environment.getArgs`` returns
      ``IO [String]`` listing each argument. This is the same as
      ``argv`` in C, starting with ``argv[1]``. The program name
      (``argv[0]`` in C) is available from
      ``System.Environment.getProgName``.

      The ``System.Console.GetOpt`` module provides some tools for
      parsing command-line options. If you have a program with complex
      options, you may find it useful. You can find an example of its
      use in the section called 
      `“Command line parsing” <software-transactional-memory.html#stm.urlcheck.parseArgs>`__.

                  :class: title

      If you need to read environment variables, you can use one of two
      functions in ``System.Environment``: ``getEnv`` or
      ``getEnvironment``. ``getEnv`` looks for a specific variable and
      raises an exception if it doesn't exist. ``getEnvironment``
      returns the whole environment as a ``[(String, String)]``, and
      then you can use functions such as ``lookup`` to find the
      environment entry you want.

      Setting environment variables is not defined in a cross-platform
      way in Haskell. If you are on a POSIX platform such as Linux, you
      can use ``putEnv`` or ``setEnv`` from the ``System.Posix.Env``
      module. Environment setting is not defined for Windows.

      This simple microbenchmark reads a text file full of numbers, and

         main = do

           where sumFile = sum . map read . words

      Although the String type is the default used for reading and
      writing files, it is not efficient, so a simple program like this
      will perform badly.

      A String is represented as a list of Char values; each element of
      a list is allocated individually, and has some book-keeping
      overhead. These factors affect the memory consumption and
      performance of a program that must read or write text or binary
      data. On simple benchmarks like this, even programs written in
      interpreted languages such as Python can outperform Haskell code
      that uses String by an order of magnitude.

      The ``bytestring`` library provides a fast, cheap alternative to
      the String type. Code written with ``bytestring`` can often match
      or exceed the performance and memory footprint of C, while
      maintaining Haskell's expressivity and conciseness.

      The library supplies two modules. Each defines functions that are
      nearly drop-in replacements for their String counterparts.

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  The ``Data.ByteString`` module defines a *strict* type named
            ByteString. This represents a string of binary or text data
            in a single array.

         -  The ``Data.ByteString.Lazy`` module provides a *lazy* type,
            also named ByteString. This represents a string of data as a
            list of *chunks*, arrays of up to 64KB in size.

      Each ByteString type performs better under particular
      circumstances. For streaming a large quantity (hundreds of
      megabytes to terabytes) of data, the lazy ByteString type is
      usually best. Its chunk size is tuned to be friendly to a modern
      CPU's L1 cache, and a garbage collector can quickly discard chunks
      of streamed data that are no longer being used.

      The strict ByteString type performs best for applications that are
      less concerned with memory footprint, or that need to access data
      randomly.

         all modern Unix-like systems.

         This is a simple matter of looking at the first four bytes in
         the file, and seeing if they match a specific sequence of
         bytes. A byte sequence that identifies a file's type is often
         known as a *magic number*.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch08/ElfMagic.hs
            import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as L

            hasElfMagic :: L.ByteString -> Bool
            hasElfMagic content = L.take 4 content == elfMagic
                where elfMagic = L.pack [0x7f, 0x45, 0x4c, 0x46]

         We import the ``ByteString`` modules using Haskell's *qualified
         import* syntax, the ``import qualified`` that we see above.
         This lets us refer to a module with a name of our choosing.

         For instance, when we want to refer to the lazy ``ByteString``
         module's ``take`` function, we must write ``L.take``, since we
         imported the module under the name ``L``. If we are not
         explicit about which version of e.g. ``take`` we want, the
         compiler will report an error.

         We will always use qualified import syntax with the
         ``ByteString`` modules, because they provide many functions
         that have the same names as Prelude functions.

         .. tip::

            Qualified imports make it easy to switch between
            ByteString types. All you should need to do is
            modify an ``import`` declaration at the top of your
            source file; the rest of your code will probably
            not need any changes. You can thus handily
            benchmark the two types, to see which is best
            suited to your application's needs

         Whether or not we use qualified imports, we can always use the
         entire name of a module to identify something unambiguously.
         For instance, both ``Data.ByteString.Lazy.length`` and
         ``L.length`` identify the same function, as do ``Prelude.sum``
         and ``sum``.

         The lazy and strict ``ByteString`` modules are intended for
         binary I/O. The Haskell data type for representing bytes is
         Word8; if we need to refer to it by name, we import it from the
         ``Data.Word`` module.

         The ``L.pack`` function takes a list of Word8 values, and packs
         them into a lazy ByteString. (The ``L.unpack`` function
         performs the reverse conversion.) Our ``hasElfMagic`` function
         simply compares the first four bytes of a ``ByteString``
         against a magic number.

         We are writing in classic Haskell style, where our
         ``hasElfMagic`` function does not perform I/O. Here is the
         function that uses it on a file.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch08/ElfMagic.hs
            isElfFile :: FilePath -> IO Bool
            isElfFile path = do
              content <- L.readFile path
              return (hasElfMagic content)

         The ``L.readFile`` function is the lazy ByteString equivalent
         of ``readFile``. It operates lazily, reading the file as data
         is demanded. It is also efficient, reading chunks of up to 64KB
         at once. The lazy ByteString is a good choice for our task:
         since we only need to read at most the first four bytes of the
         file, we can safely use this function on a file of any size.

                     :class: title

         For convenience, the ``bytestring`` library provides two other
         modules with limited text I/O capabilities,
         ``Data.ByteString.Char8`` and ``Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8``.
         These expose individual string elements as Char instead of
         Word8.

         .. warning::

            The functions in these modules only work with
            byte-sized Char values, so they are only suitable
            for use with ASCII and some European character
            sets. Values above 255 are truncated.

         The character-oriented ``bytestring`` modules provide useful
         functions for text processing. Here is a file that contains
         monthly stock prices for a well-known Internet company from
         mid-2008.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> putStr =<< readFile "prices.csv"

            2008-04-30,27.17,27.78,26.76,27.41,30597400,27.41

         How can we find the highest closing price from a series of
         entries like this? Closing prices are in the fourth
         comma-separated column. This function obtains a closing price
         from one line of data.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch08/HighestClose.hs
            import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L

            closing = readPrice . (!!4) . L.split ','

         Since this function is written in point-free style, we read
         from right to left. The ``L.split`` function splits a lazy
         ByteString into a list of them, every time it finds a matching
         character. The ``(!!)`` operator retrieves the *k* th element
         of a list. Our ``readPrice`` function turns a string
         representing a fractional price into a whole number.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch08/HighestClose.hs
            readPrice :: L.ByteString -> Maybe Int
            readPrice str =
                case L.readInt str of
                  Nothing             -> Nothing
                  Just (dollars,rest) ->
                    case L.readInt (L.tail rest) of
                      Nothing           -> Nothing
                      Just (cents,more) ->
                        Just (dollars * 100 + cents)

         We use the ``L.readInt`` function, which parses an integer. It
         returns both the integer and the remainder of the string once a
         run of digits is consumed. Our definition is slightly
         complicated by ``L.readInt`` returning ``Nothing`` if parsing
         fails.

         Our function for finding the highest closing price is
         straightforward.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch08/HighestClose.hs
            highestClose = maximum . (Nothing:) . map closing . L.lines

            highestCloseFrom path = do
                contents <- L.readFile path
                print (highestClose contents)

         We use one trick to work around the fact that we cannot supply
         an empty list to the ``maximum`` function.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> maximum [3,6,2,9]
            9
            ghci> maximum []
            *** Exception: Prelude.maximum: empty list

         Since we do not want our code to throw an exception if we have
         no stock data, the ``(Nothing:)`` expression ensures that the
         list of Maybe Int values that we supply to ``maximum`` will
         never be empty.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> maximum [Nothing, Just 1]
            Just 1
            ghci> maximum [Nothing]
            Nothing

         Does our function work?

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :load HighestClose
            [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( HighestClose.hs, interpreted )
            Ok, modules loaded: Main.
            ghci> highestCloseFrom "prices.csv"
            Loading package array-0.1.0.0 ... linking ... done.
            Loading package bytestring-0.9.0.1 ... linking ... done.
            Just 2741

         Since we have separated our I/O from our logic, we can test the
         no-data case without having to create an empty file.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> highestClose L.empty

                  :class: title

      Many systems-oriented programming languages provide library
      routines that let us match a file name against a pattern, or that
      will give a list of files that match the pattern. In other
      languages, this function is often named ``fnmatch``.) Although
      Haskell's standard library generally has good systems programming
      facilities, it doesn't provide these kinds of pattern matching
      functions. We'll take this as an opportunity to develop our own.

      The kinds of patterns we'll be dealing with are commonly referred
      to as *glob patterns* (the term we'll use), wild card patterns, or
      shell-style patterns. They have just a few simple rules. You
      probably already know them, but we'll quickly recap here.

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  Matching a string against a pattern starts at the beginning
            of the string, and finishes at the end.

         -  Most literal characters match themselves. For example, the
            text ``foo`` in a pattern will match ``foo``, and only
            ``foo``, in an input string.

         -  The ``*`` (asterisk) character means “match anything”; it
            will match any text, including the empty string. For
            instance, the pattern ``foo*`` will match any string that
            begins with ``foo``, such as ``foo`` itself, ``foobar``, or
            ``foo.c``. The pattern ``quux*.c`` will match any string
            that begins with ``quux`` and ends in ``.c``, such as
            ``quuxbaz.c``.

         -  The ``?`` (question mark) character matches any single
            character. The pattern ``pic??.jpg`` will match names like
            ``picaa.jpg`` or ``pic01.jpg``.

         -  A ``[`` (open square bracket) character begins a *character
            class*, which is ended by a ``]``. Its meaning is “match any
            character in this class”. A character class can be *negated*
            by following the opening ``[`` with a ``!``, so that it
            means “match any character *not* in this class”.

            As a shorthand, a character followed by a ``-`` (dash),
            followed by another character, denotes a *range*: “match any
            character within this set”.

            Character classes have an added subtlety; they can't be
            empty. The first character after the opening ``[`` or ``[!``
            is part of the class, so we can write a class containing the
            ``]`` character as ``[]aeiou]``. The pattern
            ``pic[0-9].[pP][nN][gG]`` will match a name consisting of
            the string ``pic``, followed by a single digit, followed by
            any capitalization of the strig ``.png``.

      While Haskell doesn't provide a way to match glob patterns among
      its standard libraries, it provides a good regular expression
      matching library. Glob patterns are nothing more than cut-down
      regular expressions with slightly different syntax. It's easy to
      convert glob patterns into regular expressions, but to do so, we
      must first understand how to use regular expressions in Haskell.

                  :name: glob.regex
                  :class: title

      In this section, we will be assume that you are already familiar
      with regular expressions by way of some other language, such as
      Python, Perl, or Java :sup:`[` `26 <#ftn.id617121>`__ :sup:`]`.

      For brevity, we will abbreviate “regular expression” as *regexp*
      from here on.

      Rather than introduce regexps as something new, we will focus on
      what's different about regexp handling in Haskell, compared to
      other languages. Haskell's regular expression matching libraries
      are a lot more expressive than those of other languages, so
      there's plenty to talk about.

      To begin our exploration of the regexp libraries, the only module
      we'll need to work with is ``Text.Regex.Posix``. As usual, the
      most convenient way to explore this module is by interacting with
      it via **ghci**.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :module +Text.Regex.Posix

      The only function that we're likely to need for normal use is the
      regexp matching function, an infix operator named ``(=~)``
      (borrowed from Perl). The first hurdle to overcome is that
      Haskell's regexp libraries make heavy use of polymorphism. As a
      result, the type signature of the ``(=~)`` operator is difficult
      to understand, so we will not explain it here.

      The ``=~`` operator uses typeclasses for both of its arguments,
      and also for its return type. The first argument (on the left of
      the ``=~``) is the text to match; the second (on the right) is the
      regular expression to match against. We can pass either a String
      or a ByteString as either argument.

                  .. rubric:: The many types of result
                     :name: id617251
                     :class: title

         The ``=~`` operator is polymorphic in its return type, so the
         Haskell compiler needs some way to know what type of result we
         would like. In real code, it may be able to infer the right
         type, due to the way we subsequently use the result. But such
         cues are often lacking when we're exploring with **ghci**. If
         we omit a specific type for the result, we'll get an error from
         the interpreter, as it does not have enough information to
         successfuly infer the result type.

         When **ghci** can't infer the ``target`` type, we tell it what
         we'd like the type to be. If we want a result of type Bool,
         we'll get a pass/fail answer.

         .. code:: screen

            False
            ghci> "your right hand" =~ "(hand|foot)" :: Bool
            True

         In the bowels of the regexp libraries, there's a typeclass
         named ``RegexContext`` that describes how a ``target`` type
         should behave; the base library defines many instances of this
         typeclass for us. The Bool type is an instance of this
         typeclass, so we get back a usable result. Another such
         instance is Int, which gives us a count of the number of times
         the regexp matches.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> "a star called henry" =~ "planet" :: Int
            0
            ghci> "honorificabilitudinitatibus" =~ "[aeiou]" :: Int
            13

         If we ask for a String result, we'll get the first substring
         that matches, or an empty string if nothing matches.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> "I, B. Ionsonii, uurit a lift'd batch" =~ "(uu|ii)" :: String

            ghci> "hi ludi, F. Baconis nati, tuiti orbi" =~ "Shakespeare" :: String
            ""

         Another valid type of result is [String], which returns a list
         of *all* matching strings.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> "I, B. Ionsonii, uurit a lift'd batch" =~ "(uu|ii)" :: [String]

                In the definition of `it':
                    it = "I, B. Ionsonii, uurit a lift'd batch" =~ "(uu|ii)" ::
                         [String]

                Possible fix:

                         [String]

         .. note:: Watch out for String results
   
            If you want a result that's a plain String, beware.
            Since ``(=~)`` returns an empty string to signify
            “no match”, this poses an obvious difficulty if the
            empty string could also be a valid match for the
            regexp. If such a case arises, you should use a
            different return type instead, such as [String].

         That's about it for “simple” result types, but we're not by any
         means finished. Before we continue, let's use a single pattern
         for our remaining examples. We can define this pattern as a
         variable in **ghci**, to save a little typing.

            ghci> let pat = "(foo[a-z]*bar|quux)"

         We can obtain quite a lot of information about the context in
         which a match occurs. If we ask for a (String, String, String)
         tuple, we'll get back the text *before* the first match, the
         text *of* that match, and the text that *follows* it.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> "before foodiebar after" =~ pat :: (String,String,String)
            ("before ","foodiebar"," after")

         If the match fails, the entire text is returned as the “before”
         element of the tuple, with the other two elements left empty.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> "no match here" =~ pat :: (String,String,String)
            ("no match here","","")

         Asking for a four-element tuple gives us a fourth element
         that's a list of all groups in the pattern that matched.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> "before foodiebar after" =~ pat :: (String,String,String,[String])
            ("before ","foodiebar"," after",["foodiebar"])

         We can get numeric information about matches, too. A pair of
         Ints gives us the starting offset of the first match, and its
         length. If we ask for a list of these pairs, we'll get this
         information for all matches.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> "before foodiebar after" =~ pat :: (Int,Int)
            (7,9)
            ghci> "i foobarbar a quux" =~ pat :: [(Int,Int)]

            <interactive>:1:0:
                No instance for (RegexContext Regex [Char] [(Int, Int)])
                  arising from a use of `=~' at <interactive>:1:0-26
                Possible fix:
                  add an instance declaration for
                  (RegexContext Regex [Char] [(Int, Int)])
                In the expression: "i foobarbar a quux" =~ pat :: [(Int, Int)]
                In the definition of `it':
                    it = "i foobarbar a quux" =~ pat :: [(Int, Int)]

         A failed match is represented by the value ``-1`` as the first
         element of the tuple (the match offset) if we've asked for a
         single tuple, or an empty list if we've asked for a list of
         tuples.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> "eleemosynary" =~ pat :: (Int,Int)
            (-1,0)

                Possible fix:

                In the expression: "mondegreen" =~ pat :: [(Int, Int)]
                In the definition of `it': it = "mondegreen" =~ pat :: [(Int, Int)]

         This is not a comprehensive list of built-in instances of the
         ``RegexContext`` typeclass. For a complete list, see the
         documentation for the ``Text.Regex.Base.Context`` module.

         This ability to make a function polymorphic in its result type
         is an unusual feature for a statically typed language.

                     :class: title

         As we noted earlier, the ``=~`` operator uses typeclasses for
         its argument types and its return type. We can use either
         String or strict ByteString values for both the regular
         expression and the text to match against.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :module +Data.ByteString.Char8
            ghci> :type pack "foo"
            pack "foo" :: ByteString

         We can then try using different combinations of String and
         ByteString.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> pack "foo" =~ "bar" :: Bool
            False
            ghci> "foo" =~ pack "bar" :: Int
            0
            ghci> pack "foo" =~ pack "o" :: [(Int, Int)]

            <interactive>:1:0:
                No instance for (RegexContext Regex ByteString [(Int, Int)])
                  arising from a use of `=~' at <interactive>:1:0-21
                Possible fix:
                  add an instance declaration for
                  (RegexContext Regex ByteString [(Int, Int)])
                In the expression: pack "foo" =~ pack "o" :: [(Int, Int)]
                In the definition of `it':
                    it = pack "foo" =~ pack "o" :: [(Int, Int)]

         However, we need to be aware that if we want a string value in
         the result of a match, the text we're matching against must be
         the same type of string. Let's see what this means in practice.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> pack "good food" =~ ".ood" :: [ByteString]

            <interactive>:1:0:
                No instance for (RegexContext Regex ByteString [ByteString])
                  arising from a use of `=~' at <interactive>:1:0-25
                Possible fix:
                  add an instance declaration for
                  (RegexContext Regex ByteString [ByteString])
                In the expression: pack "good food" =~ ".ood" :: [ByteString]
                In the definition of `it':
                    it = pack "good food" =~ ".ood" :: [ByteString]

         In the above example, we've used the ``pack`` to turn a String
         into a ByteString. The type checker accepts this because
         ByteString appears in the result type. But if we try getting a
         String out, that *won't* work.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> "good food" =~ ".ood" :: [ByteString]

            <interactive>:1:0:
                No instance for (RegexContext Regex [Char] [ByteString])
                  arising from a use of `=~' at <interactive>:1:0-20
                Possible fix:
                  add an instance declaration for
                  (RegexContext Regex [Char] [ByteString])
                In the expression: "good food" =~ ".ood" :: [ByteString]
                In the definition of `it':
                    it = "good food" =~ ".ood" :: [ByteString]

         We can easily fix this problem by making the string types of
         the left hand side and the result match once again.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> "good food" =~ ".ood" :: [String]

            <interactive>:1:0:
                No instance for (RegexContext Regex [Char] [String])
                  arising from a use of `=~' at <interactive>:1:0-20
                Possible fix:
                  add an instance declaration for
                  (RegexContext Regex [Char] [String])
                In the expression: "good food" =~ ".ood" :: [String]
                In the definition of `it': it = "good food" =~ ".ood" :: [String]

         This restriction does *not* apply to the type of the regexp
         we're matching against. It can be either a String or
         ByteString, unconstrained by the other types in use.

                     :class: title

         When you look through Haskell library documentation, you'll see
         several regexp-related modules. The modules under
         ``Text.Regex.Base`` define the common API adhered to by all of
         the other regexp modules. It's possible to have multiple
         implementations of the regexp API installed at one time. At the
         time of writing, GHC is bundled with one implementation,
         ``Text.Regex.Posix``. As its name suggests, this package
         provides POSIX regexp semantics.

         .. note:: Perl and POSIX regular expressions
            
            If you're coming to Haskell from a language like
            Perl, Python, or Java, and you've used regular
            expressions in one of those languages, you should
            be aware that the POSIX regexps handled by the
            ``Text.Regex.Posix`` module are different in some
            significant ways from Perl-style regexps. Here are
            a few of the more notable differences.

            Perl regexp engines perform left-biased matching
            when matching alternatives, whereas POSIX engines
            choose the greediest match. What this means is that
            given a regexp of ``(foo|fo*)`` and a text string
            of ``foooooo``, a Perl-style engine will give a
            match of ``foo`` (the leftmost match), while a
            POSIX engine will match the entire string (the
            greediest match).

            POSIX regexps have less uniform syntax than
            Perl-style regexps. They also lack a number of
            capabilities provided by Perl-style regexps, such
            as zero-width assertions and control over greedy
            matching.

         Other Haskell regexp packages are available for download from
         Hackage. Some provide better performance than the current POSIX
         engine (e.g. ``regex-tdfa``); others provide the Perl-style
         matching that most programmers are now familiar with (e.g.
         ``regex-pcre``). All follow the standard API that we have
         covered in this section.

                  :name: glob.translate
                  :class: title

      Now that we've seen the myriad of ways to match text against
      regular expressions, let's turn our attention back to glob
      patterns. We want to write a function that will take a glob
      pattern and return its representation as a regular expression.
      Both glob patterns and regexps are text strings, so the type that
      our function ought to have seems clear.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/GlobRegex.hs
         module GlobRegex
             (
               globToRegex
             , matchesGlob
             ) where

         import Text.Regex.Posix ((=~))

         globToRegex :: String -> String

      The regular expression that we generate must be *anchored*, so
      that it starts matching from the beginning of a string and
      finishes at the end.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/GlobRegex.hs
         globToRegex cs = '^' : globToRegex' cs ++ "$"

      Recall that the String is just a synonym for [Char], a list of
      Chars. The ``:`` operator puts a value (the ``^`` character in
      this case) onto the front of a list, where the list is the value
      returned by the yet-to-be-seen ``globToRegex'`` function.

      .. note::  Using a value before defining it
         
         Haskell does not require that a value or function be
         declared or defined in a source file before it's used.
         It's perfectly normal for a definition to come *after*
         the first place it's used. The Haskell compiler
         doesn't care about ordering at this level. This grants
         us the flexibility to structure our code in the manner
         that makes most logical sense to us, rather than
         follow an order that makes the compiler writer's life
         easiest.

         Haskell module writers often use this flexibility to
         put “more important” code earlier in a source file,
         relegating “plumbing” to later. This is exactly how we
         are presenting the ``globToRegex`` function and its
         helpers here.

      With the regular expression rooted, the ``globToRegex'`` function
      will do the bulk of the translation work. We'll use the
      convenience of Haskell's pattern matching to enumerate each of the
      cases we'll need to cover.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/GlobRegex.hs
         globToRegex' :: String -> String
         globToRegex' "" = ""

         globToRegex' ('*':cs) = ".*" ++ globToRegex' cs

         globToRegex' ('?':cs) = '.' : globToRegex' cs

         globToRegex' ('[':'!':c:cs) = "[^" ++ c : charClass cs
         globToRegex' ('[':c:cs)     = '['  :  c : charClass cs
         globToRegex' ('[':_)        = error "unterminated character class"

         globToRegex' (c:cs) = escape c ++ globToRegex' cs

      Our first clause stipulates that if we hit the end of our glob
      pattern (by which time we'll be looking at the empty string), we
      return ``$``, the regular expression symbol for “match
      end-of-line”. Following this is a series of clauses that switch
      our pattern from glob syntax to regexp syntax. The last clause
      passes every other character through, possibly escaping it first.

      The ``escape`` function ensures that the regexp engine will not
      interpret certain characters as pieces of regular expression
      syntax.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/GlobRegex.hs
         escape :: Char -> String
         escape c | c `elem` regexChars = '\\' : [c]
                  | otherwise = [c]
             where regexChars = "\\+()^$.{}]|"

      The ``charClass`` helper function only checks that a character
      class is correctly terminated. It passes its input through
      unmodified until it hits a ``]``, when it hands control back to
      ``globToRegex'``.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/GlobRegex.hs
         charClass :: String -> String
         charClass (']':cs) = ']' : globToRegex' cs
         charClass (c:cs)   = c : charClass cs
         charClass []       = error "unterminated character class"

      Now that we've finished defining ``globToRegex`` and its helpers,
      let's load it into **ghci** and try it out.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :load GlobRegex.hs
         [1 of 1] Compiling GlobRegex        ( GlobRegex.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: GlobRegex.
         ghci> :module +Text.Regex.Posix
         ghci> globToRegex "f??.c"
         Loading package array-0.1.0.0 ... linking ... done.
         Loading package containers-0.1.0.1 ... linking ... done.
         Loading package bytestring-0.9.0.1 ... linking ... done.

         Loading package regex-base-0.93.1 ... linking ... done.
         Loading package regex-posix-0.93.1 ... linking ... done.
         "^f..\\.c$"

      Sure enough, that looks like a reasonable regexp. Can we use it to
      match against a string?

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> "foo.c" =~ globToRegex "f??.c" :: Bool
         True
         ghci> "test.c" =~ globToRegex "t[ea]s*" :: Bool
         True
         ghci> "taste.txt" =~ globToRegex "t[ea]s*" :: Bool
         True

      It works! Now let's play around a little with **ghci**. We can
      create a temporary definition for ``fnmatch`` and try it out.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> let fnmatch pat name  =  name =~ globToRegex pat :: Bool
         ghci> :type fnmatch
         fnmatch :: (RegexLike Regex source1) => String -> source1 -> Bool
         ghci> fnmatch "d*" "myname"
         False

      The name ``fnmatch`` doesn't really have the “Haskell nature”,
      though. By far the most common Haskell style is for functions to
      have descriptive, “camel cased” names. Camel casing concatenates
      words, capitalising all but possibly the first word. For instance,
      the words “file name matches” would become the name
      ``fileNameMatches``. The name “camel case” comes from the “humps”
      introduced by the capital letters. In our library, we'll give this
      function the name ``matchesGlob``.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/GlobRegex.hs
         matchesGlob :: FilePath -> String -> Bool
         name `matchesGlob` pat = name =~ globToRegex pat

      You may have noticed that most of the names that we have used for
      variables so far have been short. As a rule of thumb, descriptive
      variable names are more useful in longer function definitions, as
      they aid readability. For a two-line function, a long variable
      name has less value.

      In an imperative language, the ``globToRegex'`` function is one
      that we'd usually express as a loop. For example, Python's
      standard fnmatch module includes a function named ``translate``
      that does exactly the same job as our ``globToRegex`` function.
      It's written as a loop.

      If you've been exposed to functional programming through a
      language such as Scheme or ML, you've probably had drilled into
      your head the notion that “the way to emulate a loop is via tail
      recursion”.

      Looking at the ``globToRegex'`` function, we can see that it is
      *not* tail recursive. To see why, examine its final clause again
      (several of its other clauses are structured similarly).

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/GlobRegex.hs
         globToRegex' (c:cs) = escape c ++ globToRegex' cs

      It applies itself recursively, and the result of the recursive
      application is used as a parameter to the ``(++)`` function. Since
      the recursive application *isn't* the last thing the function
      does, ``globToRegex'`` is not tail recursive.

      Why is our definition of this function not tail recursive? The
      answer lies with Haskell's non-strict evaluation strategy. Before
      we start talking about that, let's quickly talk about why, in a
      traditional language, we'd try to avoid this kind of recursive
      definition. Here is a simpler definition, of the ``(++)``
      operator. It is recursivem, but not tail recursive.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/append.hs
         (++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]

         (x:xs) ++ ys = x : (xs ++ ys)
         []     ++ ys = ys

      In a strict language, if we evaluate ``"foo" ++ "bar"``, the
      entire list is constructed, then returned. Non-strict evaluation
      defers much of the work until it is needed.

      If we demand an element of the expression ``"foo" ++ "bar"``, the
      first pattern of the function's definition matches, and we return
      the expression ``x : (xs ++ ys)``. Because the ``(:)`` constructor
      is non-strict, the evaluation of ``xs ++ ys`` can be deferred: we
      generate more elements of the result at whatever rate they are
      demanded. When we generate more of the result, we will no longer
      be using ``x``, so the garbage collector can reclaim it. Since we
      generate elements of the result on demand, and do not hold onto
      parts that we are done with, the compiler can evaluate our code in
      constant space.

                  :name: glob.use
                  :class: title

      It's all very well to have a function that can match glob
      patterns, but we'd like to be able to put this to practical use.
      On Unix-like systems, the ``glob`` function returns the names of
      all files and directories that match a given glob pattern. Let's
      build a similar function in Haskell. Following the Haskell norm of
      descriptive naming, we'll call our function ``namesMatching``.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/Glob.hs
         module Glob (namesMatching) where

      We specify that ``namesMatching`` is the only name that users of
      our ``Glob`` module will be able to see.

      This function will obviously have to manipulate filesystem paths a
      lot, splicing and joining them as it goes. We'll need to use a few
      previously unfamiliar modules along the way.

      The ``System.Directory`` module provides standard functions for
      working with directories and their contents.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/Glob.hs
         import System.Directory (doesDirectoryExist, doesFileExist,
                                  getCurrentDirectory, getDirectoryContents)

      The ``System.FilePath`` module abstracts the details of an
      operating system's path name conventions. The ``(</>)`` function
      joins two path components.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :m +System.FilePath
         ghci> "foo" </> "bar"
         Loading package filepath-1.1.0.0 ... linking ... done.
         "foo/bar"

      The name of the ``dropTrailingPathSeparator`` function is
      perfectly descriptive.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> dropTrailingPathSeparator "foo/"
         "foo"

      The ``splitFileName`` function splits a path at the last slash.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> splitFileName "foo/bar/Quux.hs"
         ("foo/bar/","Quux.hs")
         ghci> splitFileName "zippity"
         ("","zippity")

      Using ``System.FilePath`` together with the ``System.Directory``
      module, we can write a portable ``namesMatching`` function that
      will run on both Unix-like and Windows systems.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/Glob.hs
         import System.FilePath (dropTrailingPathSeparator, splitFileName, (</>))

      In this module, we'll be emulating a “for” loop; getting our first
      taste of exception handling in Haskell; and of course using the
      ``matchesGlob`` function we just wrote.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/Glob.hs
         import Control.Exception (handle)
         import Control.Monad (forM)
         import GlobRegex (matchesGlob)

      Since directories and files live in the “real world” of activities
      that have effects, our globbing function will have to have ``IO``
      in its result type.

      If the string we're passed contains no pattern characters, we
      simply check that the given name exists in the filesystem. (Notice
      that we use Haskell's function guard syntax here to write a nice
      tidy definition. An “if” would do, but isn't as aesthetically
      pleasing.)

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/Glob.hs
         isPattern :: String -> Bool
         isPattern = any (`elem` "[*?")

         namesMatching pat
           | not (isPattern pat) = do
             exists <- doesNameExist pat
             return (if exists then [pat] else [])

      The name ``doesNameExist`` refers to a function that we will
      define shortly.

      What if the string *is* a glob pattern? Our function definition
      continues.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/Glob.hs
           | otherwise = do
             case splitFileName pat of
               ("", baseName) -> do
                   curDir <- getCurrentDirectory
                   listMatches curDir baseName
               (dirName, baseName) -> do
                   dirs <- if isPattern dirName
                           then namesMatching (dropTrailingPathSeparator dirName)
                           else return [dirName]
                   let listDir = if isPattern baseName
                                 then listMatches
                                 else listPlain
                   pathNames <- forM dirs $ \dir -> do
                                    baseNames <- listDir dir baseName
                                    return (map (dir </>) baseNames)
                   return (concat pathNames)

      We use ``splitFileName`` to split the string into a pair of
      “everything but the final name” and “the final name”. If the first
      element is empty, we're looking for a pattern in the current
      directory. Otherwise, we must check the directory name and see if
      it contains patterns. If it does not, we create a singleton list
      of the directory name. If it contains a pattern, we list all of
      the matching directories.

      .. note:: Things to watch out for
         
         The ``System.FilePath`` module can be a little tricky.
         Above is a case in point; the ``splitFileName``
         function leaves a trailing slash on the end of the
         directory name that it returns.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :module +System.FilePath
            ghci> splitFileName "foo/bar"
            Loading package filepath-1.1.0.0 ... linking ... done.
            ("foo/","bar")

         If we didn't remember (or know enough) to remove that
         slash, we'd recurse endlessly in ``namesMatching``,
         because of the following behaviour of
         ``splitFileName``.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> splitFileName "foo/"
            ("foo/","")

         You can guess what happened to us that led us to add
         this note!

      Finally, we collect all matches in every directory, giving us a
      list of lists, and concatenate them into a single list of names.

      The unfamiliar ``forM`` function above acts a little like a “for”
      loop: it maps its second argument (an action) over its first (a
      list), and returns the list of results.

      We have a few loose ends to clean up. The first is the definition
      of the ``doesNameExist`` function, used above. The
      ``System.Directory`` module doesn't let us check to see if a name
      exists in the filesystem. It forces us to decide whether we want
      to check for a file or a directory. This API is ungainly, so we
      roll the two checks into a single function. In the name of
      performance, we make the check for a file first, since files are
      far more common than directories.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/Glob.hs
         doesNameExist :: FilePath -> IO Bool

         doesNameExist name = do
             fileExists <- doesFileExist name
             if fileExists
               then return True
               else doesDirectoryExist name

      We have two other functions to define, each of which returns a
      list of names in a directory. The ``listMatches`` function returns
      a list of all files matching the given glob pattern in a
      directory.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/Glob.hs
         listMatches :: FilePath -> String -> IO [String]
         listMatches dirName pat = do
             dirName' <- if null dirName
                         then getCurrentDirectory
                         else return dirName
             handle (const (return [])) $ do
                 names <- getDirectoryContents dirName'
                 let names' = if isHidden pat
                              then filter isHidden names
                              else filter (not . isHidden) names
                 return (filter (`matchesGlob` pat) names')

         isHidden ('.':_) = True
         isHidden _       = False

      The ``listPlain`` function returns either an empty or singleton
      list, depending on whether the single name it's passed exists.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/Glob.hs
         listPlain :: FilePath -> String -> IO [String]
         listPlain dirName baseName = do
             exists <- if null baseName
                       then doesDirectoryExist dirName
                       else doesNameExist (dirName </> baseName)
             return (if exists then [baseName] else [])

      If we look closely at the definition of ``listMatches`` above,
      we'll see a call to a function named ``handle``. Earlier on, we
      imported this from the ``Control.Exception`` module; as that
      import implies, this gives us our first taste of exception
      handling in Haskell. Let's drop into **ghci** and see what we can
      find out.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :module +Control.Exception
         ghci> :type handle
         handle :: (Exception -> IO a) -> IO a -> IO a

      This is telling us that ``handle`` takes two arguments. The first
      is a function that is passed an exception value, and can have side
      effects (see the IO type in its return value); this is the handler
      to run if an exception is thrown. The second argument is the code
      that might throw an exception.

      As for the exception handler, the type of the ``handle``
      constrains it to return the same type of value as the body of code
      that threw the exception. So its choices are to either throw an
      exception or, as in our case, return a list of Strings.

      The ``const`` function takes two arguments; it always returns its
      first argument, no matter what its second argument is.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :type const
         const :: a -> b -> a
         ghci> :type return []
         return [] :: (Monad m) => m [a]
         ghci> :type handle (const (return []))
         handle (const (return [])) :: IO [a] -> IO [a]

      We use ``const`` to write an exception handler that ignores the
      exception it is passed. Instead, it causes our code to return an
      empty list if we catch an exception.

      We won't have anything more to say about exception handling here.
      There's plenty more to cover, though, so we'll be returning to the
      subject of exceptions in chapter `Chapter 19, Error
      handling <error-handling.html>`__.

                  :name: glob.errapi
                  :class: title

      It's not necessarily a disaster if our ``globToRegex`` is passed a
      malformed pattern. Perhaps a user mistyped a pattern, in which
      case we'd like to be able to report a meaningful error message.

      Calling the ``error`` function when this kind of problem occurs
      can be a drastic response (exploring its consequences was the
      focus of exercise
      `Q: 1 <#ch07.q.error>`__).
      The ``error`` throws an exception. Pure Haskell code cannot deal
      with exceptions, so control is going to rocket out of our pure
      code into the nearest caller that lives in ``IO`` and has an
      appropriate exception handler installed. If no such handler is
      installed, the Haskell runtime will default to terminating our
      program (or print a nasty error message, in **ghci**).

      So calling ``error`` is a little like pulling the handle of a
      fighter plane's ejection seat. We're bailing out of a catastrophic
      situation that we can't deal with gracefully, and there's likely
      to be a lot of flaming wreckage strewn about by the time we hit
      the ground.

      We've established that ``error`` is for disasters, but we're still
      using it in ``globToRegex``. In that case, malformed input should
      be rejected, but not turned into a big deal. What would be a
      better way to handle this?

      Haskell's type system and libraries to the rescue! We can encode
      the possibility of failure in the type signature of
      ``globToRegex``, using the predefined Either type.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/GlobRegexEither.hs
         type GlobError = String

         globToRegex :: String -> Either GlobError String

      A value returned by ``globToRegex`` will now be either
      ``Left "an error message"`` or ``Right "a valid regexp"``. This
      return type forces our callers to deal with the possibility of
      error. (You'll find that this use of the Either type occurs
      frequently in Haskell code.)

                  :class: title

      The ``namesMatching`` function isn't very exciting by itself, but
      it's a useful building block. Combine it with a few more
      functions, and we can start to do interesting things.

      Here's one such example. Let's define a ``renameWith`` function
      that, instead of simply renaming a file, applies a function to the
      file's name, and renames the file to whatever that function
      returns.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/Useful.hs
         import System.FilePath (replaceExtension)
         import System.Directory (doesFileExist, renameDirectory, renameFile)
         import Glob (namesMatching)

         renameWith :: (FilePath -> FilePath)
                    -> FilePath
                    -> IO FilePath

         renameWith f path = do
             let path' = f path
             rename path path'
             return path'

      Once again, we work around the ungainly file/directory split in
      ``System.Directory`` with a helper function.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/Useful.hs
         rename :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()

         rename old new = do
             isFile <- doesFileExist old
             let f = if isFile then renameFile else renameDirectory
             f old new

      The ``System.FilePath`` module provides many useful functions for
      manipulating file names. These functions mesh nicely with our
      ``renameWith`` and ``namesMatching`` functions, so that we can
      quickly use them to create functions with complex behaviour. As an
      example, this terse function changes the file name suffixing
      convention for C++ source files.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch08/Useful.hs
         cc2cpp =
           mapM (renameWith (flip replaceExtension ".cpp")) =<< namesMatching "*.cc"

      The ``cc2cpp`` function uses a few functions we'll be seeing over
      and over. The ``flip`` function takes another function as
      argument, and swaps the order of its arguments (inspect the type
      of ``replaceExtension`` in **ghci** to see why). The ``=<<``
      function feeds the result of the action on its right side to the
      action on its left.

   The problem of “I know I have this file, but I don't know where it
   is” has been around for as long as computers have had hierarchical
   filesystems. The fifth edition of Unix introduced the **find**
   command in 1974; it remains indispensable today. The state of the art
   has come a long way: modern operating systems ship with advanced
   document indexing and search capabilities.

   There's still a valuable place for **find**-like capability in the
   programmer's toolbox. In this chapter, we'll develop a library that
   gives us many of **find**'s capabilities, without leaving Haskell.
   We'll explore several different approaches to writing this library,
   each with different strengths.

                  :class: title

      If you don't use a Unix-like operating system, or you're not a
      heavy shell user, it's quite possible you may not have heard of
      **find**. Given a list of directories, it searches each one
      recursively and prints the name of every entry that matches an
      expression.

      Individual expressions can take such forms as “name matches this
      glob pattern”, “entry is a plain file”, “last modified before this
      date”, and many more. They can be stitched together into more
      complex expressions using “and” and “or” operators.

                  :name: id620419
                  :class: title

      Before we plunge into designing our library, let's solve a few
      smaller problems. Our first problem is to recursively list the
      contents of a directory and its subdirectories.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/RecursiveContents.hs
         module RecursiveContents (getRecursiveContents) where

         import Control.Monad (forM)
         import System.Directory (doesDirectoryExist, getDirectoryContents)
         import System.FilePath ((</>))

         getRecursiveContents :: FilePath -> IO [FilePath]

         getRecursiveContents topdir = do
           names <- getDirectoryContents topdir
           let properNames = filter (`notElem` [".", ".."]) names
           paths <- forM properNames $ \name -> do
             let path = topdir </> name
             isDirectory <- doesDirectoryExist path
             if isDirectory
               then getRecursiveContents path
               else return [path]
           return (concat paths)

      The ``filter`` expression ensures that a listing for a single
      directory won't contain the special directory names ``.`` or
      ``..``, which refer to the current and parent directory,
      respectively. If we forgot to filter these out, we'd recurse
      endlessly.

      We encountered ``forM`` in the previous chapter; it is ``mapM``
      with its arguments flipped.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :m +Control.Monad
         ghci> :type mapM
         mapM :: (Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
         ghci> :type forM
         forM :: (Monad m) => [a] -> (a -> m b) -> m [b]

      The body of the loop checks to see whether the current entry is a
      directory. If it is, it recursively calls ``getRecursiveContents``
      to list that directory. Otherwise, it returns a single-element
      list that is the name of the current entry. (Don't forget that the
      ``return`` function has a unique meaning in Haskell: it wraps a
      value with the monad's type constructor.)

      Another thing worth pointing out is the use of the variable
      ``isDirectory``. In an imperative language such as Python, we'd
      normally write ``if os.path.isdir(path)``. However, the
      ``doesDirectoryExist`` function is an *action*; its return type is
      IO Bool, not Bool. Since an ``if`` expression requires an
      expression of type Bool, we have to use ``<-`` to get the Bool
      result of the action out of its IO wrapper, so that we can use the
      plain, unwrapped Bool in the ``if``.

      Each iteration of the loop body yields a list of names, so the
      result of ``forM`` here is IO [[FilePath]]. We use ``concat`` to
      flatten it into a single list.

                  .. rubric:: Revisiting anonymous and named functions
                     :name: id620646
                     :class: title

         In `the section called “Anonymous (lambda)
         functions” <functional-programming.html#fp.anonymous>`__, we
         listed some reasons not to use anonymous functions, and yet
         here we are, using one as the body of a loop. This is one of
         the most common uses of anonymous functions in Haskell.

         We've already seen from their types that ``forM`` and ``mapM``
         take functions as arguments. Most loop bodies are blocks of
         code that only appear once in a program. Since we're most
         likely to use a loop body in only one place, why give it a
         name?

         Of course, it sometimes happens that we need to deploy exactly
         the same code in several different loops. Rather than cutting
         and pasting the same anonymous function, it makes sense in such
         cases to give a name to an existing anonymous function.

      .. container:: sect2

            .. container::

               .. container::

                  .. rubric:: Why provide both mapM and forM?
                     :name: id620698
                     :class: title

         It might seem a bit odd that there exist two functions that are
         identical but for the order in which they accept their
         arguments. However, ``mapM`` and ``forM`` are convenient in
         different circumstances.

         Consider our example above, using an anonymous function as a
         loop body. If we were to use ``mapM`` instead of ``forM``, we'd
         have to place the variable ``properNames`` after the body of
         the function. In order to get the code to parse correctly, we'd
         have to wrap the entire anonymous function in parentheses, or
         replace it with a named function that would otherwise be
         unnecessary. Try it yourself: copy the code above, replacing
         ``forM`` with ``mapM``, and see what this does to the
         readability of the code.

         By contrast, if the body of the loop was already a named
         function, and the list over which we were looping was computed
         by a complicated expression, we'd have a good case for using
         ``mapM`` instead.

         The stylistic rule of thumb to follow here is to use whichever
         of ``mapM`` or ``forM`` lets you write the tidiest code. If the
         loop body and the expression computing the data over which
         you're looping are both short, it doesn't matter which you use.
         If the loop is short, but the data is long, use ``mapM``. If
         the loop is long, but the data short, use ``forM``. And if both
         are long, use a ``let`` or ``where`` clause to make one of them
         short. With just a little practice, it will become obvious
         which of these approaches is best in every instance.

               .. rubric:: A naive finding function
                  :name: find.simpleFind
                  :class: title

      We can use our ``getRecursiveContents`` function as the basis for
      a simple-minded file finder.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/SimpleFinder.hs
         import RecursiveContents (getRecursiveContents)

         simpleFind :: (FilePath -> Bool) -> FilePath -> IO [FilePath]

         simpleFind p path = do
           names <- getRecursiveContents path
           return (filter p names)

      This function takes a predicate that we use to filter the names
      returned by ``getRecursiveContents``. Each name passed to the
      predicate is a complete path, so how can we perform a common
      operation like “find all files ending in the extension ``.c``”?

      The ``System.FilePath`` module contains numerous invaluable
      functions that help us to manipulate file names. In this case, we
      want ``takeExtension``.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :m +System.FilePath
         ghci> :type takeExtension
         takeExtension :: FilePath -> String
         ghci> takeExtension "foo/bar.c"
         Loading package filepath-1.1.0.0 ... linking ... done.
         ".c"
         ghci> takeExtension "quux"
         ""

      This gives us a simple matter of writing a function that takes a
      path, extracts its extension, and compares it with ``.c``.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :load SimpleFinder
         [1 of 2] Compiling RecursiveContents ( RecursiveContents.hs, interpreted )
         [2 of 2] Compiling Main             ( SimpleFinder.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: RecursiveContents, Main.
         ghci> :type simpleFind (\p -> takeExtension p == ".c")
         simpleFind (\p -> takeExtension p == ".c") :: FilePath -> IO [FilePath]

      While ``simpleFind`` works, it has a few glaring problems. The
      first is that the predicate is not very expressive. It can only
      look at the name of a directory entry; it cannot, for example,
      find out whether it's a file or a directory. This means that our
      attempt to use ``simpleFind`` will list directories ending in
      ``.c`` as well as files with the same extension.

      The second problem is that ``simpleFind`` gives us no control over
      how it traverses the filesystem. To see why this is significant,
      consider the problem of searching for a source file in a tree
      managed by the Subversion revision control system. Subversion
      maintains a private ``.svn`` directory in every directory that it
      manages; each one contains many subdirectories and files that are
      of no interest to us. While we can easily enough filter out any
      path containing ``.svn``, it's more efficient to simply avoid
      traversing these directories in the first place. For example, one
      of us has a Subversion source tree containing 45,000 files, 30,000
      of which are stored in 1,200 different ``.svn`` directories. It's
      cheaper to avoid traversing those 1,200 directories than to filter
      out the 30,000 files they contain.

      Finally, ``simpleFind`` is strict, because it consists of a series
      of actions executed in the IO monad. If we have a million files to
      traverse, we encounter a long delay, then receive one huge result
      containing a million names. This is bad for both resource usage
      and responsiveness. We might prefer a lazy stream of results
      delivered as they arrive.

      In the sections that follow, we'll overcome each one of these
      problems.

               .. rubric:: Predicates: from poverty to riches, while
                  remaining pure
                  :name: id621089
                  :class: title

      Our predicates can only look at file names. This excludes a wide
      variety of interesting behaviours: for instance, what if we'd like
      to list files of greater than a given size?

      An easy reaction to this is to reach for IO: instead of our
      predicate being of type FilePath -> Bool, why don't we change it
      to FilePath -> IO Bool? This would let us perform arbitrary I/O as
      part of our predicate. As appealing as this might seem, it's also
      potentially a problem: such a predicate could have arbitrary side
      effects, since a function with return type IO a can have whatever
      side effects it pleases.

      Let's enlist the type system in our quest to write more
      predictable, less buggy code: we'll keep predicates pure by
      avoiding the taint of “IO”. This will ensure that they can't have
      any nasty side effects. We'll feed them more information, too, so
      that they can gain the expressiveness we want without also
      becoming potentially dangerous.

      Haskell's portable ``System.Directory`` module provides a useful,
      albeit limited, set of file metadata.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :m +System.Directory

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  We can use ``doesFileExist`` and ``doesDirectoryExist`` to
            determine whether a directory entry is a file or a
            directory. There are not yet portable ways to query for
            other file types that have become widely available in recent
            years, such as named pipes, hard links and symbolic links.

            .. code:: screen

               ghci> :type doesFileExist
               doesFileExist :: FilePath -> IO Bool
               ghci> doesFileExist "."
               Loading package old-locale-1.0.0.0 ... linking ... done.
               Loading package old-time-1.0.0.0 ... linking ... done.
               Loading package directory-1.0.0.0 ... linking ... done.
               False
               ghci> :type doesDirectoryExist
               doesDirectoryExist :: FilePath -> IO Bool
               ghci> doesDirectoryExist "."
               True

         -  The ``getPermissions`` function lets us find out whether
            certain operations on a file or directory are allowed.

            .. code:: screen

               ghci> :type getPermissions
               getPermissions :: FilePath -> IO Permissions
               ghci> :info Permissions
               data Permissions
                 = Permissions {readable :: Bool,
                                writable :: Bool,
                                executable :: Bool,
                                searchable :: Bool}
                   -- Defined in System.Directory
               instance Eq Permissions -- Defined in System.Directory
               instance Ord Permissions -- Defined in System.Directory
               instance Read Permissions -- Defined in System.Directory
               instance Show Permissions -- Defined in System.Directory
               ghci> getPermissions "."
               Permissions {readable = True, writable = True, executable = False, searchable = True}
               ghci> :type searchable
               searchable :: Permissions -> Bool
               ghci> searchable it
               True

            (If you cannot recall the special **ghci** variable ``it``,
            take a look back at `the section called “First steps with
            types” <getting-started.html#starting.types>`__.) A
            directory will be ``searchable`` if we have permission to
            list its contents; files are never ``searchable``.

         -  Finally, ``getModificationTime`` tells us when an entry was
            last modified.

            .. code:: screen

               ghci> :type getModificationTime
               getModificationTime :: FilePath -> IO System.Time.ClockTime
               ghci> getModificationTime "."
               Mon Aug 18 12:08:24 CDT 2008

      If we stick with portable, standard Haskell code, these functions
      are all we have at our disposal. (We can also find a file's size
      using a small hack; see below.) They're also quite enough to let
      us illustrate the principles we're interested in, without letting
      us get carried away with an example that's too expansive. If you
      need to write more demanding code, the ``System.Posix`` and
      ``System.Win32`` module families provide much more detailed file
      metadata for the two major modern computing platforms. There also
      exists a ``unix-compat`` package on Hackage, which provides a
      Unix-like API on Windows.

      How many pieces of data does our new, richer predicate need to
      see? Since we can find out whether an entry is a file or a
      directory by looking at its Permissions, we don't need to pass in
      the results of ``doesFileExist`` or ``doesDirectoryExist``. We
      thus have four pieces of data that a richer predicate needs to
      look at.

      Our Predicate type is just a synonym for a function of four
      arguments. It will save us a little keyboard work and screen
      space.

      Notice that the return value of this predicate is Bool, not IO
      Bool: the predicate is pure, and cannot perform I/O. With this
      type in hand, our more expressive finder function is still quite
      trim.

         betterFind :: Predicate -> FilePath -> IO [FilePath]

         betterFind p path = getRecursiveContents path >>= filterM check
             where check name = do
                     perms <- getPermissions name
                     size <- getFileSize name
                     modified <- getModificationTime name
                     return (p name perms size modified)

      Let's walk through the code. We'll talk about ``getFileSize`` in
      some detail soon, so let's skip over it for now.

      We can't use ``filter`` to call our predicate ``p``, as ``p``'s
      purity means it cannot do the I/O needed to gather the metadata it
      requires.

      This leads us to the unfamiliar function ``filterM``. It behaves
      like the normal ``filter`` function, but in this case it evaluates
      its predicate in the IO monad, allowing the predicate to perform
      I/O.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :m +Control.Monad
         ghci> :type filterM
         filterM :: (Monad m) => (a -> m Bool) -> [a] -> m [a]

      Our ``check`` predicate is an I/O-capable wrapper for our pure
      predicate ``p``. It does all the “dirty” work of I/O on ``p``'s
      behalf, so that we can keep ``p`` incapable of unwanted side
      effects. After gathering the metadata, ``check`` calls ``p``, then
      uses ``return`` to wrap ``p``'s result with IO.

                  :name: id621667
                  :class: title

      Although ``System.Directory`` doesn't let us find out how large a
      file is, we can use the similarly portable ``System.IO`` module to
      do this. It contains a function named ``hFileSize``, which returns
      the size in bytes of an open file. Here's a simple function that
      wraps it.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
         simpleFileSize :: FilePath -> IO Integer

         simpleFileSize path = do
           h <- openFile path ReadMode
           size <- hFileSize h
           hClose h
           return size

      While this function works, it's not yet suitable for us to use. In
      ``betterFind``, we call ``getFileSize`` unconditionally on any
      directory entry; it should return ``Nothing`` if an entry is not a
      plain file, or the size wrapped by ``Just`` otherwise. This
      function instead throws an exception if an entry is not a plain
      file or could not be opened (perhaps due to insufficient
      permissions), and returns the size unwrapped.

      Here's a safer version of this function.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
         saferFileSize :: FilePath -> IO (Maybe Integer)

         saferFileSize path = handle (\_ -> return Nothing) $ do
           h <- openFile path ReadMode
           size <- hFileSize h
           hClose h
           return (Just size)

      The body of the function is almost identical, save for the
      ``handle`` clause.

      Our exception handler above ignores the exception it's passed, and
      returns ``Nothing``. The only change to the body that follows is
      that it wraps the file size with ``Just``.

      The ``saferFileSize`` function now has the correct type signature,
      and it won't throw any exceptions. But it's still not completely
      well behaved. There are directory entries on which ``openFile``
      will succeed, but ``hFileSize`` will throw an exception. This can
      happen with, for example, named pipes. Such an exception will be
      caught by ``handle``, but our call to ``hClose`` will never occur.

      A Haskell implementation will automatically close the file handle
      when it notices that the handle is no longer being used. That will
      not occur until the garbage collector runs, and the delay until
      the next garbage collection pass is not predictable.

      File handles are scarce resources. Their scarcity is enforced by
      the underlying operating system. On Linux, for example, a process
      is by default only allowed to have 1024 files open simultaneously.

      It's not hard to imagine a scenario in which a program that called
      a version of ``betterFind`` that used ``saferFileSize`` could
      crash due to ``betterFind`` exhausting the supply of open file
      handles before enough garbage file handles could be closed.

      This is a particularly pernicious kind of bug: it has several
      aspects that combine to make it incredibly difficult to track
      down. It will only be triggered if ``betterFind`` visits a
      sufficiently large number of non-files to hit the process's limit
      on open file handles, and then returns to a caller that tries to
      open another file before any of the accumulated garbage file
      handles is closed.

      To make matters worse, any subsequent error will be caused by data
      that is no longer reachable from within the program, and has yet
      to be garbage collected. Such a bug is thus dependent on the
      structure of the program, the contents of the filesystem, and how
      close the current run of the program is to triggering the garbage
      collector.

      This sort of problem is easy to overlook during development, and
      when it later occurs in the field (as these awkward problems
      always seem to do), it will be much harder to diagnose.

      Fortunately, we can avoid this kind of error very easily, while
      also making our function *shorter*.

                     :name: find.acquire.use.release
                     :class: title

         We need ``hClose`` to always be called if ``openFile``
         succeeds. The ``Control.Exception`` module provides the
         ``bracket`` function for exactly this purpose.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :type bracket
            bracket :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> (a -> IO c) -> IO c

         The ``bracket`` function takes three actions as arguments. The
         first action acquires a resource. The second releases the
         resource. The third runs in between, while the resource is
         acquired; let's call this the “use” action. If the “acquire”
         action succeeds, the “release” action is *always* called. This
         guarantees that the resource will always be released. The “use”
         and “release” actions are each passed the resource acquired by
         the “acquire” action.

         If an exception occurs while the “use” action is executing,
         ``bracket`` calls the “release” action and rethrows the
         exception. If the “use” action succeeds, ``bracket`` calls the
         “release” action, and returns the value returned by the “use”
         action.

         We can now write a function that is completely safe: it will
         not throw exceptions; neither will it accumulate garbage file
         handles that could cause spurious failures elsewhere in our
         program.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
            getFileSize path = handle (\_ -> return Nothing) $
              bracket (openFile path ReadMode) hClose $ \h -> do
                size <- hFileSize h
                return (Just size)

         Look closely at the arguments of ``bracket`` above. The first
         opens the file, and returns the open file handle. The second
         closes the handle. The third simply calls ``hFileSize`` on the
         handle and wraps the result in ``Just``.

         We need to use both ``bracket`` and ``handle`` for this
         function to operate correctly. The former ensures that we don't
         accumulate garbage file handles, while the latter gets rid of
         exceptions.

               .. rubric:: A domain specific language for predicates
                  :name: find.predicate
                  :class: title

      Let's take a stab at writing a predicate. Our predicate will check
      for a C++ source file that is over 128KB in size.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
         myTest path _ (Just size) _ =
             takeExtension path == ".cpp" && size > 131072
         myTest _ _ _ _ = False

      This isn't especially pleasing. The predicate takes four
      arguments, always ignores two of them, and requires two equations
      to define. Surely we can do better. Let's create some code that
      will help us to write more concise predicates.

      Sometimes, this kind of library is referred to as an *embedded
      domain specific language*: we use our programming language's
      native facilities (hence *embedded*) to write code that lets us
      solve some narrow problem (hence *domain specific*) particularly
      elegantly.

      Our first step is to write a function that returns one of its
      arguments. This one extracts the path from the arguments passed to
      a Predicate.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
         pathP path _ _ _ = path

      If we don't provide a type signature, a Haskell implementation
      will infer a very general type for this function. This can later
      lead to error messages that are difficult to interpret, so let's
      give ``pathP`` a type.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
         type InfoP a =  FilePath        -- path to directory entry
                      -> Permissions     -- permissions
                      -> Maybe Integer   -- file size (Nothing if not file)
                      -> ClockTime       -- last modified
                      -> a

         pathP :: InfoP FilePath

      We've created a type synonym that we can use as shorthand for
      writing other, similarly structured functions. Our type synonym
      accepts a type parameter so that we can specify different result
      types.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
         sizeP :: InfoP Integer
         sizeP _ _ (Just size) _ = size
         sizeP _ _ Nothing     _ = -1

      (We're being a little sneaky here, and returning a size of -1 for
      entries that are not files, or that we couldn't open.)

      In fact, a quick glance shows that the Predicate type that we
      defined near the beginning of this chapter is the same type as
      InfoP Bool. (We could thus legitimately get rid of the Predicate
      type.)

      What use are ``pathP`` and ``sizeP``? With a little more glue, we
      can use them in a predicate (the ``P`` suffix on each name is
      intended to suggest “predicate”). This is where things start to
      get interesting.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
         equalP :: (Eq a) => InfoP a -> a -> InfoP Bool
         equalP f k = \w x y z -> f w x y z == k

      The type signature of ``equalP`` deserves a little attention. It
      takes an InfoP a, which is compatible with both ``pathP`` and
      ``sizeP``. It takes an a. And it returns an InfoP Bool, which we
      already observed is a synonym for Predicate. In other words,
      ``equalP`` constructs a predicate.

      The ``equalP`` function works by returning an anonymous function.
      That one takes the arguments accepted by a predicate, passes them
      to ``f``, and compares the result to ``k``.

      This equation for ``equalP`` emphasises the fact that we think of
      it as taking two arguments. Since Haskell curries all functions,
      writing ``equalP`` in this way is not actually necessary. We can
      omit the anonymous function and rely on currying to work on our
      behalf, letting us write a function that behaves identically.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
         equalP' :: (Eq a) => InfoP a -> a -> InfoP Bool
         equalP' f k w x y z = f w x y z == k

      Before we continue with our explorations, let's load our module
      into **ghci**.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :load BetterPredicate
         [1 of 2] Compiling RecursiveContents ( RecursiveContents.hs, interpreted )
         [2 of 2] Compiling Main             ( BetterPredicate.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: RecursiveContents, Main.

      Let's see if a simple predicate constructed from these functions
      will work.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :type betterFind (sizeP `equalP` 1024)
         betterFind (sizeP `equalP` 1024) :: FilePath -> IO [FilePath]

      Notice that we're not actually calling ``betterFind``, we're
      merely making sure that our expression typechecks. We now have a
      more expressive way to list all files that are exactly some size.
      Our success gives us enough confidence to continue.

                  .. rubric:: Avoiding boilerplate with lifting
                     :name: find.predicate.lift
                     :class: title

         Besides ``equalP``, we'd like to be able to write other binary
         functions. We'd prefer not to write a complete definition of
         each one, because that seems unnecessarily verbose.

         To address this, let's put Haskell's powers of abstraction to
         use. We'll take the definition of ``equalP``, and instead of
         calling ``(==)`` directly, we'll pass in as another argument
         the binary function that we want to call.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
            liftP :: (a -> b -> c) -> InfoP a -> b -> InfoP c
            liftP q f k w x y z = f w x y z `q` k

            greaterP, lesserP :: (Ord a) => InfoP a -> a -> InfoP Bool
            greaterP = liftP (>)
            lesserP = liftP (<)

         This act of taking a function, such as ``(>)``, and
         transforming it into another function that operates in a
         different context, here ``greaterP``, is referred to as
         *lifting* it into that context. This explains the presence of
         ``lift`` in the function's name. Lifting lets us reuse code and
         reduce boilerplate. We'll be using it a lot, in different
         guises, throughout the rest of this book.

         When we lift a function, we'll often refer to its original and
         new versions as *unlifted* and *lifted*, respectively.

         By the way, our placement of ``q`` (the function to lift) as
         the first argument to ``liftP`` was quite deliberate. This made
         it possible for us to write such concise definitions of
         ``greaterP`` and ``lesserP``. Partial application makes finding
         the “best” order for arguments a more important part of API
         design in Haskell than in other languages. In languages without
         partial application, argument ordering is a matter of taste and
         convention. Put an argument in the wrong place in Haskell,
         however, and we lose the concision that partial application
         gives.

         We can recover some of that conciseness via combinators. For
         instance, ``forM`` was not added to the ``Control.Monad``
         module until 2007. Prior to that, people wrote ``flip mapM``
         instead.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :m +Control.Monad
            ghci> :t mapM
            mapM :: (Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
            ghci> :t forM
            forM :: (Monad m) => [a] -> (a -> m b) -> m [b]
            ghci> :t flip mapM
            flip mapM :: (Monad m) => [a] -> (a -> m b) -> m [b]

                     :class: title

         If we want to combine predicates, we can of course follow the
         obvious path of doing so by hand.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
            simpleAndP :: InfoP Bool -> InfoP Bool -> InfoP Bool
            simpleAndP f g w x y z = f w x y z && g w x y z

         Now that we know about lifting, it becomes more natural to
         reduce the amount of code we must write by lifting our existing
         Boolean operators.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
            liftP2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> InfoP a -> InfoP b -> InfoP c
            liftP2 q f g w x y z = f w x y z `q` g w x y z

            andP = liftP2 (&&)
            orP = liftP2 (||)

         Notice that ``liftP2`` is very similar to our earlier
         ``liftP``. In fact, it's more general, because we can write
         ``liftP`` in terms of ``liftP2``.

         .. code:: programlisting

         .. note:: Combinators
            
            In Haskell, we refer to functions that take other
            functions as arguments, returning new functions, as
            *combinators*.

         Now that we have some helper functions in place, we can return
         to the ``myTest`` function we defined earlier.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
            myTest path _ (Just size) _ =
                takeExtension path == ".cpp" && size > 131072
            myTest _ _ _ _ = False

         How will this function look if we write it using our new
         combinators?

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
            liftPath :: (FilePath -> a) -> InfoP a
            liftPath f w _ _ _ = f w

            myTest2 = (liftPath takeExtension `equalP` ".cpp") `andP`
                      (sizeP `greaterP` 131072)

         We've added one final combinator, ``liftPath``, since
         manipulating file names is such a common activity.

                     :name: id622920
                     :class: title

         We can take our domain specific language further by defining
         new infix operators.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/BetterPredicate.hs
            (==?) = equalP
            (&&?) = andP
            (>?) = greaterP

            myTest3 = (liftPath takeExtension ==? ".cpp") &&? (sizeP >? 131072)

         We chose names like ``(==?)`` for the lifted functions
         specifically for their visual similarity to their unlifted
         counterparts.

         The parentheses in our definition above are necessary, because
         we haven't told Haskell about the precedence or associativity
         of our new operators. The language specifies that operators
         without fixity declarations should be treated as ``infixl 9``,
         i.e. they are evaluated from left to right at the highest
         precedence level. If we were to omit the parentheses, the
         expression would thus be parsed as
         ``(((liftPath takeExtension) ==? ".cpp") &&? sizeP) >? 131072``,
         which is horribly wrong.

         We can respond by writing fixity declarations for our new
         operators. Our first step is to find out what the fixities of
         the unlifted operators are, so that we can mimic them.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :info ==
            class Eq a where
              (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
              ...
                -- Defined in GHC.Base
            infix 4 ==
            ghci> :info &&
            (&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool  -- Defined in GHC.Base
            infixr 3 &&
            ghci> :info >
            class (Eq a) => Ord a where
              ...
              (>) :: a -> a -> Bool
              ...
                -- Defined in GHC.Base
            infix 4 >

         With these in hand, we can now write a parenthesis-free
         expression that will be parsed identically to ``myTest3``.

                  :name: find.traverse
                  :class: title

      When traversing the filesystem, we'd like to give ourselves more
      control over which directories we enter, and when. An easy way in
      which we can allow this is to pass in a function that takes a list
      of subdirectories of a given directory, and returns another list.
      This list can have elements removed, or it can be ordered
      differently than the original list, or both. The simplest such
      control function is ``id``, which will return its input list
      unmodified.

      For variety, we're going to change a few aspects of our
      representation here. Instead of an elaborate function type InfoP
      a, we'll use a normal algebraic data type to represent
      substantially the same information.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/ControlledVisit.hs
         data Info = Info {
               infoPath :: FilePath
             , infoPerms :: Maybe Permissions
             , infoSize :: Maybe Integer
             , infoModTime :: Maybe ClockTime
             } deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

         getInfo :: FilePath -> IO Info

      We're using record syntax to give ourselves “free” accessor
      functions, such as ``infoPath``. The type of our ``traverse``
      function is simple, as we proposed above. To obtain Info about a
      file or directory, we call the ``getInfo`` action.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/ControlledVisit.hs
         traverse :: ([Info] -> [Info]) -> FilePath -> IO [Info]

      The definition of ``traverse`` is short, but dense.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/ControlledVisit.hs
         traverse order path = do
             names <- getUsefulContents path
             contents <- mapM getInfo (path : map (path </>) names)
             liftM concat $ forM (order contents) $ \info -> do
               if isDirectory info && infoPath info /= path
                 then traverse order (infoPath info)
                 else return [info]

         getUsefulContents :: FilePath -> IO [String]
         getUsefulContents path = do
             names <- getDirectoryContents path
             return (filter (`notElem` [".", ".."]) names)

         isDirectory :: Info -> Bool
         isDirectory = maybe False searchable . infoPerms

      While we're not introducing any new techniques here, this is one
      of the densest function definitions we've yet encountered. Let's
      walk through it almost line by line, explaining what is going on.
      The first couple of lines hold no mystery, as they're almost
      verbatim copies of code we've already seen.

      Things begin to get interesting when we assign to the variable
      ``contents``. Let's read this line from right to left. We already
      know that ``names`` is a list of directory entries. We make sure
      that the current directory is prepended to every element of the
      list, and included in the list itself. We use ``mapM`` to apply
      ``getInfo`` to the resulting paths.

      The line that follows is even more dense. Again reading from right
      to left, we see that the last element of the line begins the
      definition of an anonymous function that continues to the end of
      the paragraph. Given one Info value, this function either visits a
      directory recursively (there's an extra check to make sure we
      don't visit ``path`` again), or returns that value as a
      single-element list (to match the result type of ``traverse``).

      We use ``forM`` to apply this function to each element of the list
      of Info values returned by ``order``, the user-supplied traversal
      control function.

      At the beginning of the line, we use the technique of lifting in a
      new context. The ``liftM`` function takes a regular function,
      ``concat``, and lifts it into the IO monad. In other words, it
      takes the result of ``forM`` (of type IO [[Info]]) out of the IO
      monad, applies ``concat`` to it (yielding a result of type [Info],
      which is what we need), and puts the result back into the IO
      monad.

      Finally, we mustn't forget to define our ``getInfo`` function.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/ControlledVisit.hs
         maybeIO :: IO a -> IO (Maybe a)
         maybeIO act = handle (\_ -> return Nothing) (Just `liftM` act)

         getInfo path = do
           perms <- maybeIO (getPermissions path)
           size <- maybeIO (bracket (openFile path ReadMode) hClose hFileSize)
           modified <- maybeIO (getModificationTime path)
           return (Info path perms size modified)

      The only noteworthy thing here is a useful combinator,
      ``maybeIO``, which turns an IO action that might throw an
      exception into one that wraps its result in Maybe.

      Code as dense as ``traverse`` is not unusual in Haskell. The gain
      in expressiveness is significant, and it requires a relatively
      small amount of practice to be able to fluently read and write
      code in this style.

      For comparison, here's a less dense presentation of the same code.
      This might be more typical of a less experienced Haskell
      programmer.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/ControlledVisit.hs
         traverseVerbose order path = do
             names <- getDirectoryContents path
             let usefulNames = filter (`notElem` [".", ".."]) names
             contents <- mapM getEntryName ("" : usefulNames)
             recursiveContents <- mapM recurse (order contents)
             return (concat recursiveContents)
           where getEntryName name = getInfo (path </> name)
                 isDirectory info = case infoPerms info of
                                      Nothing -> False
                                      Just perms -> searchable perms
                 recurse info = do
                     if isDirectory info && infoPath info /= path
                         then traverseVerbose order (infoPath info)
                         else return [info]

      All we've done here is make a few substitutions. Instead of
      liberally using partial application and function composition,
      we've defined some local functions in a ``where`` block. In place
      of the ``maybe`` combinator, we're using a ``case`` expression.
      And instead of using ``liftM``, we're manually lifting ``concat``
      ourselves.

      This is not to say that density is a uniformly good property. Each
      line of the original ``traverse`` function is short. We introduce
      a local variable (``usefulNames``) and a local function
      (``isDirectory``) specifically to keep the lines short and the
      code clearer. Our names are descriptive. While we use function
      composition and pipelining, the longest pipeline contains only
      three elements.

      The key to writing maintainable Haskell code is to find a balance
      between density and readability. Where your code falls on this
      continuum is likely to be influenced by your level of experience.

                  :name: find.fold
                  :class: title

      While the ``traverse`` function gives us more control than our
      original ``betterFind`` function, it still has a significant
      failing: we can avoid recursing into directories, but we can't
      filter other names until after we've generated the entire list of
      names in a tree. If we are traversing a directory containing
      100,000 files of which we care about three, we'll allocate a
      100,000-element list before we have a chance to trim it down to
      the three we really want.

      One approach would be to provide a filter function as a new
      argument to ``traverse``, which we would apply to the list of
      names as we generate it. This would allow us to allocate a list of
      only as many elements as we need.

      However, this approach also has a weakness: say we know that we
      want at most three entries from our list, and that those three
      entries happen to be the first three of the 100,000 that we
      traverse. In this case, we'll needlessly visit 99,997 other
      entries. This is not by any means a contrived example: for
      example, the Maildir mailbox format stores a folder of email
      messages as a directory of individual files. It's common for a
      single directory representing a mailbox to contain tens of
      thousands of files.

      We can address the weaknesses of our two prior traversal functions
      by taking a different perspective: what if we think of filesystem
      traversal as a *fold* over the directory hierarchy?

      The familiar folds, ``foldr`` and ``foldl'``, neatly generalise
      the idea of traversing a list while accumulating a result. It's
      hardly a stretch to extend the idea of folding from lists to
      directory trees, but we'd like to add an element of *control* to
      our fold. We'll represent this control as an algebraic data type.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/FoldDir.hs
         data Iterate seed = Done     { unwrap :: seed }
                           | Skip     { unwrap :: seed }
                           | Continue { unwrap :: seed }
                             deriving (Show)

         type Iterator seed = seed -> Info -> Iterate seed

      The Iterator type gives us a convenient alias for the function
      that we fold with. It takes a seed and an Info value representing
      a directory entry, and returns both a new seed and an instruction
      for our fold function, where the instructions are represented as
      the constructors of the Iterate type.

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  If the instruction is ``Done``, traversal should cease
            immediately. The value wrapped by ``Done`` should be
            returned as the result.

         -  If the instruction is ``Skip`` and the current Info
            represents a directory, traversal will not recurse into that
            directory.

         -  Otherwise, the traversal should continue, using the wrapped
            value as the input to the next call to the fold function.

      Our fold is logically a kind of left fold, because we start
      folding from the first entry we encounter, and the seed for each
      step is the result of the prior step.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/FoldDir.hs
         foldTree :: Iterator a -> a -> FilePath -> IO a

         foldTree iter initSeed path = do
             endSeed <- fold initSeed path
             return (unwrap endSeed)
           where
             fold seed subpath = getUsefulContents subpath >>= walk seed

             walk seed (name:names) = do
               let path' = path </> name
               info <- getInfo path'
               case iter seed info of
                 done@(Done _) -> return done
                 Skip seed'    -> walk seed' names
                 Continue seed'
                   | isDirectory info -> do
                       next <- fold seed' path'
                       case next of
                         done@(Done _) -> return done
                         seed''        -> walk (unwrap seed'') names
                   | otherwise -> walk seed' names
             walk seed _ = return (Continue seed)

      There are a few interesting things about the way this code is
      written. The first is the use of scoping to avoid having to pass
      extra parameters around. The top-level ``foldTree`` function is
      just a wrapper for ``fold`` that peels off the constructor of the
      ``fold``'s final result.

      Because ``fold`` is a local function, we don't have to pass
      ``foldTree``'s ``iter`` variable into it; it can already access it
      in the outer scope. Similarly, ``walk`` can see ``path`` in its
      outer scope.

      Another point to note is that ``walk`` is a tail recursive loop,
      instead of an anonymous function called by ``forM`` as in our
      earlier functions. By taking the reins ourselves, we can stop
      early if we need to. This lets us drop out when our iterator
      returns ``Done``.

      Although ``fold`` calls ``walk``, ``walk`` calls ``fold``
      recursively to traverse subdirectories. Each function returns a
      seed wrapped in an Iterate: when ``fold`` is called by ``walk``
      and returns, ``walk`` examines its result to see whether it should
      continue or drop out because it returned ``Done``. In this way, a
      return of ``Done`` from the caller-supplied iterator immediately
      terminates all mutually recursive calls between the two functions.

      What does an iterator look like in practice? Here's a somewhat
      complicated example that looks for at most three bitmap images,
      and won't recurse into Subversion metadata directories.

               = Continue paths
           where extension = map toLower (takeExtension path)
                 path = infoPath info

      To use this, we'd call ``foldTree atMostThreePictures []``, giving
      us a return value of type IO [FilePath].

      Of course, iterators don't have to be this complicated. Here's one
      that counts the number of directories it encounters.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch09/FoldDir.hs
         countDirectories count info =
             Continue (if isDirectory info
                       then count + 1
                       else count)

      Here, the initial seed that we pass to ``foldTree`` should be the
      number zero.

               .. rubric:: Useful coding guidelines
                  :name: id624164
                  :class: title

      While many good Haskell programming habits come with experience,
      we have a few general guidelines to offer so that you can write
      readable code more quickly.

      As we already mentioned in `the section called “A note about tabs
      versus
      spaces” <defining-types-streamlining-functions.html#deftypes.tabs>`__,
      never use tab characters in Haskell source files. Use spaces.

      If you find yourself proudly thinking that a particular piece of
      code is fiendishly clever, stop and consider whether you'll be
      able to understand it again after you've stepped away from it for
      a month.

      The conventional way of naming types and variables with compound
      names is to use “camel case”, i.e. ``myVariableName``. This style
      is almost universal in Haskell code. Regardless of your opinion of
      other naming practices, if you follow a non-standard convention,
      your Haskell code will be somewhat jarring to the eyes of other
      readers.

      Until you've been working with Haskell for a substantial amount of
      time, spend a few minutes searching for library functions before
      you write small functions. This applies particularly to ubiquitous
      types like lists, Maybe, and Either. If the standard libraries
      don't already provide exactly what you need, you might be able to
      combine a few functions to obtain the result you desire.

      Long pipelines of composed functions are hard to read, where
      “long” means a series of more than three or four elements. If you
      have such a pipeline, use a ``let`` or ``where`` block to break it
      into smaller parts. Give each one of these pipeline elements a
      meaningful name, then glue them back together. If you can't think
      of a meaningful name for an element, ask yourself if you can even
      describe what it does. If the answer is “no”, simplify your code.

      Even though it's easy to resize a text editor window far beyond 80
      columns, this width is still very common. Wider lines are wrapped
      or truncated in 80-column text editor windows, which severely
      hurts readability. Treating lines as no more than 80 characters
      long limits the amount of code you can cram onto a single line.
      This helps to keep individual lines less complicated, therefore
      easier to understand.

                  .. rubric:: Common layout styles
                     :name: id624278
                     :class: title

         A Haskell implementation won't make a fuss about indentation as
         long as your code follows the layout rules and can hence be
         parsed unambiguously. That said, some layout patterns are
         widely used.

         The ``in`` keyword is usually aligned directly under the
         ``let`` keyword, with the expression immediately following it.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/Style.hs
            tidyLet = let foo = undefined
                          bar = foo * 2
                      in undefined

         While it's *legal* to indent the ``in`` differently, or to let
         it “dangle” at the end of a series of equations, the following
         would generally be considered odd.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/Style.hs
            weirdLet = let foo = undefined
                           bar = foo * 2
                in undefined

            strangeLet = let foo = undefined
                             bar = foo * 2 in
                undefined

         In contrast, it's usual to let a ``do`` dangle at the end of a
         line, rather than sit at the beginning of a line.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/Style.hs
            commonDo = do
              something <- undefined
              return ()

            -- not seen very often
            rareDo =
              do something <- undefined
                 return ()

         Curly braces and semicolons, though legal, are almost never
         used. There's nothing wrong with them; they just make code look
         strange due to their rarity. They're really intended to let
         programs generate Haskell code without having to implement the
         layout rules, not for human use.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/Style.hs
            unusualPunctuation =
                [ (x,y) | x <- [1..a], y <- [1..b] ] where {
                                                       b = 7;
             a = 6 }

            preferredLayout = [ (x,y) | x <- [1..a], y <- [1..b] ]
                where b = 7
                      a = 6

         If the right hand side of an equation starts on a new line,
         it's usually indented a small number of spaces relative to the
         name of the variable or function that it's defining.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/Style.hs
            normalIndent =
                undefined

            strangeIndent =
                                       undefined

         The actual number of spaces used to indent varies, sometimes
         within a single file. Depths of two, three, and four spaces are
         about equally common. A single space is legal, but not very
         visually distinctive, so it's easy to misread.

         When indenting a ``where`` clause, it's best to make it
         visually distinctive.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch09/Style.hs
            goodWhere = take 5 lambdas
                where lambdas = []

            alsoGood =
                take 5 lambdas
              where
                lambdas = []

            badWhere =           -- legal, but ugly and hard to read
                take 5 lambdas
                where
                lambdas = []

   In this chapter, we'll discuss a common task: parsing a binary file.
   We will use this task for two purposes. Our first is indeed to talk a
   little about parsing, but our main goal is to talk about program
   organisation, refactoring, and “boilerplate removal”. We will
   demonstrate how you can tidy up repetitious code, and set the stage
   for our discussion of monads in `Chapter 14, Monads <monads.html>`__.

   The file formats that we will work with come from the netpbm suite,
   an ancient and venerable collection of programs and file formats for
   working with bitmap images. These file formats have the dual
   advantages of wide use and being fairly easy, though not completely
   trivial, to parse. Most importantly for our convenience, netpbm files
   are not compressed.

                  :class: title

      The name of netpbm's greyscale file format is PGM (“portable grey
      map”). It is actually not one format, but two; the “plain” (or
      “P2”) format is encoded as ASCII, while the more common “raw”
      (“P5”) format is mostly binary.

      A file of either format starts with a header, which in turn begins
      with a “magic” string describing the format. For a plain file, the
      string is ``P2``, and for raw, it's ``P5``. The magic string is
      followed by white space, then by three numbers: the width, height,
      and maximum grey value of the image. These numbers are represented
      as ASCII decimal numbers, separated by white space.

      After the maximum grey value comes the image data. In a raw file,
      this is a string of binary values. In a plain file, the values are
      represented as ASCII decimal numbers separated by single space
      characters.

      A raw file can contain a sequence of images, one after the other,
      each with its own header. A plain file contains only one image.

                  :name: id624638
                  :class: title

      For our first try at a parsing function, we'll only worry about
      raw PGM files. We'll write our PGM parser as a *pure* function.
      It's not responsible for obtaining the data to parse, just for the
      actual parsing. This is a common approach in Haskell programs. By
      separating the reading of the data from what we subsequently do
      with it, we gain flexibility in where we take the data from.

      We'll use the ByteString type to store our greymap data, because
      it's compact. Since the header of a PGM file is ASCII text, but
      its body is binary, we import both the text- and binary-oriented
      ByteString modules.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/PNM.hs
         import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L8
         import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as L
         import Data.Char (isSpace)

      For our purposes, it doesn't matter whether we use a lazy or
      strict ByteString, so we've somewhat arbitrarily chosen the lazy
      kind.

      We'll use a straightforward data type to represent PGM images.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/PNM.hs
         data Greymap = Greymap {
               greyWidth :: Int
             , greyHeight :: Int
             , greyMax :: Int
             , greyData :: L.ByteString
             } deriving (Eq)

      Normally, a Haskell Show instance should produce a string
      representation that we can read back by calling ``read``. However,
      for a bitmap graphics file, this would potentially produce huge
      text strings, for example if we were to ``show`` a photo. For this
      reason, we're not going to let the compiler automatically derive a
      Show instance for us: we'll write our own, and intentionally
      simplify it.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/PNM.hs
         instance Show Greymap where
             show (Greymap w h m _) = "Greymap " ++ show w ++ "x" ++ show h ++
                                      " " ++ show m

      Because our Show instance intentionally avoids printing the bitmap
      data, there's no point in writing a Read instance, as we can't
      reconstruct a valid Greymap from the result of ``show``.

      Here's an obvious type for our parsing function.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/PNM.hs
         parseP5 :: L.ByteString -> Maybe (Greymap, L.ByteString)

      This will take a ByteString, and if the parse succeeds, it will
      return a single parsed Greymap, along with the string that remains
      after parsing. That residual string will

      Our parsing function has to consume a little bit of its input at a
      time. First, we need to assure ourselves that we're really looking
      at a raw PGM file; then we need to parse the numbers from the
      remainder of the header; then we consume the bitmap data. Here's
      an obvious way to express this, which we will use as a base for
      later improvements.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/PNM.hs
         matchHeader :: L.ByteString -> L.ByteString -> Maybe L.ByteString

         -- "nat" here is short for "natural number"
         getNat :: L.ByteString -> Maybe (Int, L.ByteString)

         getBytes :: Int -> L.ByteString
                  -> Maybe (L.ByteString, L.ByteString)

         parseP5 s =
           case matchHeader (L8.pack "P5") s of
             Nothing -> Nothing
             Just s1 ->
               case getNat s1 of
                 Nothing -> Nothing
                 Just (width, s2) ->
                   case getNat (L8.dropWhile isSpace s2) of
                     Nothing -> Nothing
                     Just (height, s3) ->
                       case getNat (L8.dropWhile isSpace s3) of
                         Nothing -> Nothing
                         Just (maxGrey, s4)
                           | maxGrey > 255 -> Nothing
                           | otherwise ->
                               case getBytes 1 s4 of
                                 Nothing -> Nothing
                                 Just (_, s5) ->
                                   case getBytes (width * height) s5 of
                                     Nothing -> Nothing
                                     Just (bitmap, s6) ->
                                       Just (Greymap width height maxGrey bitmap, s6)

      This is a very literal piece of code, performing all of the
      parsing in one long staircase of ``case`` expressions. Each
      function returns the residual ByteString left over after it has
      consumed all it needs from its input string. We pass each residual
      string along to the next step. We deconstruct each result in turn,
      either returning ``Nothing`` if the parsing step failed, or
      building up a piece of the final result as we proceed. Here are
      the bodies of the functions that we apply during parsing. Their
      types are commented out because we already presented them above.

                  :name: id624895
                  :class: title

      While our ``parseP5`` function works, the style in which we wrote
      it is somehow not pleasing. Our code marches steadily to the right
      of the screen, and it's clear that a slightly more complicated
      function would soon run out of visual real estate. We repeat a
      pattern of constructing and then deconstructing Maybe values, only
      continuing if a particular value matches ``Just``. All of the
      similar ``case`` expressions act as “boilerplate code”, busywork
      that obscures what we're really trying to do. In short, this
      function is begging for some abstraction and refactoring.

      If we step back a little, we can see two patterns. First is that
      many of the functions that we apply have similar types. Each takes
      a ByteString as its last argument, and returns Maybe something
      else. Secondly, every step in the “ladder” of our ``parseP5``
      function deconstructs a Maybe value, and either fails or passes
      the unwrapped result to a function.

      We can quite easily write a function that captures this second
      pattern.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/PNM.hs
         (>>?) :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
         Nothing >>? _ = Nothing
         Just v  >>? f = f v

      The ``(>>?)`` function acts very simply: it takes a value as its
      left argument, and a function as its right. If the value is not
      ``Nothing``, it applies the function to whatever is wrapped in the
      ``Just`` constructor. We have defined our function as an operator
      so that we can use it to chain functions together. Finally, we
      haven't provided a fixity declaration for ``(>>?)``, so it
      defaults to ``infixl 9`` (left associative, strongest operator
      precedence). In other words, ``a >>? b >>? c`` will be evaluated
      from left to right, as ``(a >>? b) >>? c)``.

      With this chaining function in hand, we can take a second try at
      our parsing function.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/PNM.hs
         parseP5_take2 :: L.ByteString -> Maybe (Greymap, L.ByteString)
         parseP5_take2 s =
             matchHeader (L8.pack "P5") s       >>?
             \s -> skipSpace ((), s)           >>?
             (getNat . snd)                    >>?
             skipSpace                         >>?
             \(width, s) ->   getNat s         >>?
             skipSpace                         >>?
             \(height, s) ->  getNat s         >>?
             \(maxGrey, s) -> getBytes 1 s     >>?
             (getBytes (width * height) . snd) >>?
             \(bitmap, s) -> Just (Greymap width height maxGrey bitmap, s)

         skipSpace :: (a, L.ByteString) -> Maybe (a, L.ByteString)
         skipSpace (a, s) = Just (a, L8.dropWhile isSpace s)

      The key to understanding this function is to think about the
      chaining. On the left hand side of each ``(>>?)`` is a Maybe
      value; on the right is a function that returns a Maybe value. Each
      left-and-right-sides expression is thus of type Maybe, suitable
      for passing to the following ``(>>?)`` expression.

      The other change that we've made to improve readability is add a
      ``skipSpace`` function. With these changes, we've halved the
      number of lines of code compared to our original parsing function.
      By removing the boilerplate ``case`` expressions, we've made the
      code easier to follow.

      While we warned against overuse of anonymous functions in `the
      section called “Anonymous (lambda)
      functions” <functional-programming.html#fp.anonymous>`__, we use
      several in our chain of functions here. Because these functions
      are so small, we wouldn't improve readability by giving them
      names.

               .. rubric:: Implicit state
                  :name: binary.implicit
                  :class: title

      We're not yet out of the woods. Our code explicitly passes pairs
      around, using one element for an intermediate part of the parsed
      result and the other for the current residual ByteString. If we
      want to extend the code, for example to track the number of bytes
      we've consumed so that we can report the location of a parse
      failure, we already have eight different spots that we will need
      to modify, just to pass a three-tuple around.

      This approach makes even a small body of code difficult to change.
      The problem lies with our use of pattern matching to pull values
      out of each pair: we have embedded the knowledge that we are
      always working with pairs straight into our code. As pleasant and
      helpful as pattern matching is, it can lead us in some undesirable
      directions if we do not use it carefully.

      Let's do something to address the inflexibility of our new code.
      First, we will change the type of state that our parser uses.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         data ParseState = ParseState {
               string :: L.ByteString
             , offset :: Int64           -- imported from Data.Int
             } deriving (Show)

      In our switch to an algebraic data type, we added the ability to
      track both the current residual string and the offset into the
      original string since we started parsing. The more important
      change was our use of record syntax: we can now *avoid* pattern
      matching on the pieces of state that we pass around, and use the
      accessor functions ``string`` and ``offset`` instead.

      We have given our parsing state a name. When we name something, it
      can become easier to reason about. For example, we can now look at
      parsing as a kind of function: it consumes a parsing state, and
      produces both a new parsing state and some other piece of
      information. We can directly represent this as a Haskell type.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         simpleParse :: ParseState -> (a, ParseState)
         simpleParse = undefined

      To provide more help to our users, we would like to report an
      error message if parsing fails. This only requires a minor tweak
      to the type of our parser.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         betterParse :: ParseState -> Either String (a, ParseState)
         betterParse = undefined

      In order to future-proof our code, it is best if we do not expose
      the implementation of our parser to our users. When we explicitly
      used pairs for state earlier, we found ourselves in trouble almost
      immediately, once we considered extending the capabilities of our
      parser. To stave off a repeat of that difficulty, we will hide the
      details of our parser type using a ``newtype`` declaration.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         newtype Parse a = Parse {
               runParse :: ParseState -> Either String (a, ParseState)
             }

      Remember that the ``newtype`` definition is just a compile-time
      wrapper around a function, so it has no run-time overhead. When we
      want to use the function, we will apply the ``runParser``
      accessor.

      If we do not export the ``Parse`` value constructor from our
      module, we can ensure that nobody else will be able to
      accidentally create a parser, nor will they be able to inspect its
      internals via pattern matching.

                  .. rubric:: The identity parser
                     :name: id625296
                     :class: title

         Let's try to define a simple parser, the *identity* parser. All
         it does is turn whatever it is passed into the result of the
         parse. In this way, it somewhat resembles the ``id`` function.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
            identity :: a -> Parse a
            identity a = Parse (\s -> Right (a, s))

         This function leaves the parse state untouched, and uses its
         argument as the result of the parse. We wrap the body of the
         function in our Parse type to satisfy the type checker. How can
         we use this wrapped function to parse something?

         The first thing we must do is peel off the ``Parse`` wrapper so
         that we can get at the function inside. We do so using the
         ``runParse`` function. We also need to construct a ParseState,
         then run our parsing function on that parse state. Finally,
         we'd like to separate the result of the parse from the final
         ParseState.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
            parse :: Parse a -> L.ByteString -> Either String a
            parse parser initState
                = case runParse parser (ParseState initState 0) of
                    Left err          -> Left err
                    Right (result, _) -> Right result

         Because neither the ``identity`` parser nor the ``parse``
         function examines the parse state, we don't even need to create
         an input string in order to try our code.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :load Parse
            [1 of 2] Compiling PNM              ( PNM.hs, interpreted )
            [2 of 2] Compiling Parse            ( Parse.hs, interpreted )
            Ok, modules loaded: PNM, Parse.
            ghci> :type parse (identity 1) undefined
            parse (identity 1) undefined :: (Num t) => Either String t
            ghci> parse (identity 1) undefined
            Loading package array-0.1.0.0 ... linking ... done.
            Loading package bytestring-0.9.0.1 ... linking ... done.
            Right 1
            ghci> parse (identity "foo") undefined
            Right "foo"

         A parser that doesn't even inspect its input might not seem
         interesting, but we will shortly see that in fact it is useful.
         Meanwhile, we have gained confidence that our types are correct
         and that we understand the basic workings of our code.

                     :class: title

         Record syntax is useful for more than just accessor functions:
         we can use it to copy and partly change an existing value. In
         use, the notation looks like this.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
            modifyOffset :: ParseState -> Int64 -> ParseState
            modifyOffset initState newOffset =
                initState { offset = newOffset }

         This creates a new ParseState value identical to ``initState``,
         but with its ``offset`` field set to whatever value we specify
         for ``newOffset``.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> let before = ParseState (L8.pack "foo") 0
            ghci> let after = modifyOffset before 3

            ghci> after
            ParseState {string = Chunk "foo" Empty, offset = 3}

         We can set as many fields as we want inside the curly braces,
         separating them using commas.

                     :class: title

         Let's focus now on writing a parser that does something
         meaningful. We're not going to get too ambitious yet: all we
         want to do is parse a single byte.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
            -- import the Word8 type from Data.Word
            parseByte :: Parse Word8
            parseByte =
                getState ==> \initState ->
                case L.uncons (string initState) of
                  Nothing ->
                      bail "no more input"
                  Just (byte,remainder) ->
                      putState newState ==> \_ ->
                      identity byte
                    where newState = initState { string = remainder,
                                                 offset = newOffset }
                          newOffset = offset initState + 1

         There are a number of new functions in our definition.

         The ``L8.uncons`` function takes the first element from a
         ByteString.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> L8.uncons (L8.pack "foo")
            Just ('f',Chunk "oo" Empty)
            ghci> L8.uncons L8.empty
            Nothing

         Our ``getState`` function retrieves the current parsing state,
         while ``putState`` replaces it. The ``bail`` function
         terminates parsing and reports an error. The ``(==>)`` function
         chains parsers together. We will cover each of these functions
         shortly.

         .. tip:: Hanging lambdas

            The definition of ``parseByte`` has a visual style
            that we haven't discussed before. It contains
            anonymous functions in which the parameters and
            ``->`` sit at the end of a line, with the
            function's body following on the next line.

            This style of laying out an anonymous function
            doesn't have an official name, so let's call it a
            “hanging lambda”. Its main use is to make room for
            more text in the body of the function. It also
            makes it more visually clear that there's a
            relationship between one function and the one that
            follows. Often, for instance, the result of the
            first function is being passed as a parameter to
            the second.

                     :name: id625735
                     :class: title

         Our ``parseByte`` function doesn't take the parse state as an
         argument. Instead, it has to call ``getState`` to get a copy of
         the state, and ``putState`` to replace the current state with a
         new one.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
            getState :: Parse ParseState
            getState = Parse (\s -> Right (s, s))

            putState :: ParseState -> Parse ()
            putState s = Parse (\_ -> Right ((), s))

         When reading these functions, recall that the left element of
         the tuple is the result of a Parse, while the right is the
         current ParseState. This makes it easier to follow what these
         functions are doing.

         The ``getState`` function extracts the current parsing state,
         so that the caller can access the string. The ``putState``
         function replaces the current parsing state with a new one.
         This becomes the state that will be seen by the next function
         in the ``(==>)`` chain.

         These functions let us move explicit state handling into the
         bodies of only those functions that need it. Many functions
         don't need to know what the current state is, and so they'll
         never call ``getState`` or ``putState``. This lets us write
         more compact code than our earlier parser, which had to pass
         tuples around by hand. We will see the effect in some of the
         code that follows.

         We've packaged up the details of the parsing state into the
         ParseState type, and we work with it using accessors instead of
         pattern matching. Now that the parsing state is passed around
         implicitly, we gain a further benefit. If we want to add more
         information to the parsing state, all we need to do is modify
         the definition of ParseState, and the bodies of whatever
         functions need the new information. Compared to our earlier
         parsing code, where all of our state was exposed through
         pattern matching, this is much more modular: the only code we
         affect is code that needs the new information.

                     :name: id625864
                     :class: title

         We carefully defined our Parse type to accommodate the
         possibility of failure. The ``(==>)`` combinator checks for a
         parse failure and stops parsing if it runs into a failure. But
         we haven't yet introduced the ``bail`` function, which we use
         to report a parse error.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
            bail :: String -> Parse a
            bail err = Parse $ \s -> Left $
                       "byte offset " ++ show (offset s) ++ ": " ++ err

         After we call ``bail``, ``(==>)`` will successfully pattern
         match on the ``Left`` constructor that it wraps the error
         message with, and it will not invoke the next parser in the
         chain. This will cause the error message to percolate back
         through the chain of prior callers.

                     :class: title

         The ``(==>)`` function serves a similar purpose to our earlier
         ``(>>?)`` function: it is “glue” that lets us chain functions
         together.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
            (==>) :: Parse a -> (a -> Parse b) -> Parse b

            firstParser ==> secondParser  =  Parse chainedParser
              where chainedParser initState   =
                      case runParse firstParser initState of
                        Left errMessage ->
                            Left errMessage
                        Right (firstResult, newState) ->
                            runParse (secondParser firstResult) newState

         The body of ``(==>)`` is interesting, and ever so slightly
         tricky. Recall that the Parse type represents really a function
         inside a wrapper. Since ``(==>)`` lets us chain two Parse
         values to produce a third, it must return a function, in a
         wrapper.

         The function doesn't really “do” much: it just creates a
         *closure* to remember the values of ``firstParser`` and
         ``secondParser``.

         .. tip::

            A closure is simply the pairing of a function with
            its *environment*, the bound variables that it can
            see. Closures are commonplace in Haskell. For
            instance, the section ``(+5)`` is a closure. An
            implementation must record the value ``5`` as the
            second argument to the ``(+)`` operator, so that
            the resulting function can add ``5`` to whatever
            value it is passed.

         This closure will not be unwrapped and applied until we apply
         ``parse``. At that point, it will be applied with a ParseState.
         It will apply ``firstParser`` and inspect its result. If that
         parse fails, the closure will fail too. Otherwise, it will pass
         the result of the parse and the new ParseState to
         ``secondParser``.

         This is really quite fancy and subtle stuff: we're effectively
         passing the ParseState down the chain of Parse values in a
         hidden argument. (We'll be revisiting this kind of code in a
         few chapters, so don't fret if that description seemed dense.)

                  :name: binary.functor
                  :class: title

      We're by now thoroughly familiar with the ``map`` function, which
      applies a function to every element of a list, returning a list of
      possibly a different type.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> map (+1) [1,2,3]
         [2,3,4]
         ghci> map show [1,2,3]
         ["1","2","3"]
         ghci> :type map show
         map show :: (Show a) => [a] -> [String]

      This ``map``-like activity can be useful in other instances. For
      example, consider a binary tree.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/TreeMap.hs
         data Tree a = Node (Tree a) (Tree a)
                     | Leaf a
                       deriving (Show)

      If we want to take a tree of strings and turn it into a tree
      containing the lengths of those strings, we could write a function
      to do this.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/TreeMap.hs
         treeLengths (Leaf s) = Leaf (length s)
         treeLengths (Node l r) = Node (treeLengths l) (treeLengths r)

      Now that our eyes are attuned to looking for patterns that we can
      turn into generally useful functions, we can see a possible case
      of this here.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/TreeMap.hs
         treeMap :: (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
         treeMap f (Leaf a)   = Leaf (f a)
         treeMap f (Node l r) = Node (treeMap f l) (treeMap f r)

      As we might hope, ``treeLengths`` and ``treeMap length`` give the
      same results.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> let tree = Node (Leaf "foo") (Node (Leaf "x") (Leaf "quux"))
         ghci> treeLengths tree
         Node (Leaf 3) (Node (Leaf 1) (Leaf 4))
         ghci> treeMap length tree
         Node (Leaf 3) (Node (Leaf 1) (Leaf 4))
         ghci> treeMap (odd . length) tree
         Node (Leaf True) (Node (Leaf True) (Leaf False))

      Haskell provides a well-known typeclass to further generalise
      ``treeMap``. This typeclass is named Functor, and it defines one
      function, ``fmap``.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/TreeMap.hs
         class Functor f where
             fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

      We can think of ``fmap`` as a kind of *lifting* function, as we
      introduced in `the section called “Avoiding boilerplate with
      lifting” <io-case-study-a-library-for-searching-the-filesystem.html#find.predicate.lift>`__.
      It takes a function over ordinary values a -> b and lifts it to
      become a function over containers f a -> f b, where ``f`` is the
      container type.

      If we substitute Tree for the type variable ``f``, for example,
      the type of ``fmap`` is identical to the type of ``treeMap``, and
      in fact we can use ``treeMap`` as the implementation of ``fmap``
      over Trees.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/TreeMap.hs
         instance Functor Tree where
             fmap = treeMap

      We can also use ``map`` as the implementation of ``fmap`` for
      lists.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/TreeMap.hs
         instance Functor [] where
             fmap = map

      We can now use ``fmap`` over different container types.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> fmap length ["foo","quux"]
         [3,4]
         ghci> fmap length (Node (Leaf "Livingstone") (Leaf "I presume"))
         Node (Leaf 11) (Leaf 9)

      The Prelude defines instances of Functor for several common types,
      notably lists and Maybe.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/TreeMap.hs
         instance Functor Maybe where
             fmap _ Nothing  = Nothing
             fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)

      The instance for Maybe makes it particularly clear what an
      ``fmap`` implementation needs to do. The implementation must have
      a sensible behaviour for each of a type's constructors. If a value
      is wrapped in ``Just``, for example, the ``fmap`` implementation
      calls the function on the unwrapped value, then rewraps it in
      ``Just``.

      The definition of Functor imposes a few obvious restrictions on
      what we can do with ``fmap``. For example, we can only make
      instances of ``Functor`` from types that have exactly one type
      parameter.

      We can't write an ``fmap`` implementation for Either a b or (a,
      b), for example, because these have two type parameters. We also
      can't write one for Bool or Int, as they have no type parameters.

      In addition, we can't place any constraints on our type
      definition. What does this mean? To illustrate, let's first look
      at a normal ``data`` definition and its ``Functor`` instance.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/ValidFunctor.hs
         data Foo a = Foo a
                    
         instance Functor Foo where
             fmap f (Foo a) = Foo (f a)

      When we define a new type, we can add a type constraint just after
      the ``data`` keyword as follows.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/ValidFunctor.hs
         data Eq a => Bar a = Bar a

         instance Functor Bar where
             fmap f (Bar a) = Bar (f a)

      This says that we can only put a type ``a`` into a Foo if ``a`` is
      a member of the ``Eq`` typeclass. However, the constraint renders
      it impossible to write a ``Functor`` instance for Bar.

                     :name: id626723
                     :class: title

         Adding a constraint to a type definition is essentially never a
         good idea. It has the effect of forcing you to add type
         constraints to *every* function that will operate on values of
         that type. Let's say that we need a stack data structure that
         we want to be able to query to see whether its elements obey
         some ordering. Here's a naive definition of the data type.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch10/TypeConstraint.hs
            data (Ord a) => OrdStack a = Bottom
                                       | Item a (OrdStack a)
                                         deriving (Show)

         If we want to write a function that checks the stack to see
         whether it is increasing (i.e. every element is bigger than the
         element below it), we'll obviously need an ``Ord`` constraint
         to perform the pairwise comparisons.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch10/TypeConstraint.hs
            isIncreasing :: (Ord a) => OrdStack a -> Bool
            isIncreasing (Item a rest@(Item b _))
                | a < b     = isIncreasing rest
                | otherwise = False
            isIncreasing _  = True

         However, because we wrote the type constraint on the type
         definition, that constraint ends up infecting places where it
         isn't needed: we need to add the ``Ord`` constraint to
         ``push``, which does not care about the ordering of elements on
         the stack.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch10/TypeConstraint.hs
            push :: (Ord a) => a -> OrdStack a -> OrdStack a
            push a s = Item a s

         Try removing that ``Ord`` constraint above, and the definition
         of ``push`` will fail to typecheck.

         This is why our attempt to write a ``Functor`` instance for Bar
         failed earlier: it would have required an ``Eq`` constraint to
         somehow get retroactively added to the signature of ``fmap``.

         Now that we've tentatively established that putting a type
         constraint on a type definition is a misfeature of Haskell,
         what's a more sensible alternative? The answer is simply to
         omit type constraints from type definitions, and instead place
         them on the functions that need them.

         In this example, we can drop the ``Ord`` constraints from
         ``OrdStack`` and ``push``. It needs to stay on
         ``isIncreasing``, which otherwise couldn't call ``(<)``. We now
         have the constraints where they actually matter. This has the
         further benefit of making the type signatures better document
         the true requirements of each function.

         Most Haskell container types follow this pattern. The Map type
         in the ``Data.Map`` module requires that its keys be ordered,
         but the type itself does not have such a constraint. The
         constraint is expressed on functions like ``insert``, where
         it's actually needed, and not on ``size``, where ordering isn't
         used.

                     :class: title

         Quite often, you'll see ``fmap`` called as an operator.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> (1+) `fmap` [1,2,3] ++ [4,5,6]
            [2,3,4,4,5,6]

         Perhaps strangely, plain old ``map`` is almost never used in
         this way.

         One possible reason for the stickiness of the
         ``fmap``-as-operator meme is that this use lets us omit
         parentheses from its second argument. Fewer parentheses leads
         to reduced mental juggling while reading a function.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> fmap (1+) ([1,2,3] ++ [4,5,6])
            [2,3,4,5,6,7]

         If you really want to use ``fmap`` as an operator, the
         ``Control.Applicative`` module contains an operator ``(<$>)``
         that is an alias for ``fmap``. The ``$`` in its name appeals to
         the similarity between applying a function to its arguments
         (using the ``($)`` operator) and lifting a function into a
         functor. We will see that this works well for parsing when we
         return to the code that we have been writing.

         You might hope that we could write a Functor instance for the
         type Either Int b, which has one type parameter.

                fmap f (Right r) = Right (f r)

         However, the type system of Haskell 98 cannot guarantee that
         checking the constraints on such an instance will terminate. A
         non-terminating constraint check may send a compiler into an
         infinite loop, so instances of this form are forbidden.

                     :class: title

         We've made a few implicit assumptions about how functors ought
         to work. It's helpful to make these explicit and to think of
         them as rules to follow, because this lets us treat functors as
         uniform, well-behaved objects. We have only two rules to
         remember, and they're simple.

         Our first rule is that a functor must preserve *identity*. That
         is, applying ``fmap id`` to a value should give us back an
         identical value.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> fmap id (Node (Leaf "a") (Leaf "b"))
            Node (Leaf "a") (Leaf "b")

         Our second rule is that functors must be *composable*. That is,
         composing two uses of ``fmap`` should give the same result as
         one ``fmap`` with the same functions composed.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> (fmap even . fmap length) (Just "twelve")
            Just True
            ghci> fmap (even . length) (Just "twelve")
            Just True

         Another way of looking at these two rules is that a functor
         must preserve *shape*. The structure of a collection should not
         be affected by a functor; only the values that it contains
         should change.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> fmap odd (Just 1)
            Just True
            ghci> fmap odd Nothing
            Nothing

         If you're writing a Functor instance, it's useful to keep these
         rules in mind, and indeed to test them, because the compiler
         can't check the rules we've listed above. On the other hand, if
         you're simply *using* functors, the rules are “natural” enough
         that there's no need to memorise them. They just formalize a
         few intuitive notions of “do what I mean”. Here is a pseudocode
         representation of the expected behavior.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch10/FunctorLaws.hs
            fmap id       ==  id
            fmap (f . g)  ==  fmap f . fmap g

               .. rubric:: Writing a functor instance for Parse
                  :name: id627398
                  :class: title

      For the types we have surveyed so far, the behaviour we ought to
      expect of ``fmap`` has been obvious. This is a little less clear
      for Parse, due to its complexity. A reasonable guess is that the
      function we're ``fmap`` ping should be applied to the current
      result of a parse, and leave the parse state untouched.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         instance Functor Parse where
             fmap f parser = parser ==> \result ->
                             identity (f result)

      This definition is easy to read, so let's perform a few quick
      experiments to see if we're following our rules for functors.

      First, we'll check that identity is preserved. Let's try this
      first on a parse that ought to fail: parsing a byte from an empty
      string (remember that ``(<$>)`` is ``fmap``).

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> parse parseByte L.empty
         Left "byte offset 0: no more input"
         ghci> parse (id <$> parseByte) L.empty
         Left "byte offset 0: no more input"

      Good. Now for a parse that should succeed.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> let input = L8.pack "foo"
         ghci> L.head input
         102
         ghci> parse parseByte input
         Right 102
         ghci> parse (id <$> parseByte) input
         Right 102

      By inspecting the results above, we can also see that our functor
      instance is obeying our second rule, that of preserving shape.
      Failure is preserved as failure, and success as success.

      Finally, we'll ensure that composability is preserved.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> parse ((chr . fromIntegral) <$> parseByte) input
         Right 'f'
         ghci> parse (chr <$> fromIntegral <$> parseByte) input
         Right 'f'

      On the basis of this brief inspection, our Functor instance
      appears to be well behaved.

               .. rubric:: Using functors for parsing
                  :name: id627617
                  :class: title

      All this talk of functors had a purpose: they often let us write
      tidy, expressive code. Recall the ``parseByte`` function that we
      introduced earlier. In recasting our PGM parser to use our new
      parser infrastructure, we'll often want to work with ASCII
      characters instead of Word8 values.

      While we could write a ``parseChar`` function that has a similar
      structure to ``parseByte``, we can now avoid this code duplication
      by taking advantage of the functor nature of Parse. Our functor
      takes the result of a parse and applies a function to it, so what
      we need is a function that turns a Word8 into a Char.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         w2c :: Word8 -> Char
         w2c = chr . fromIntegral

         -- import Control.Applicative
         parseChar :: Parse Char
         parseChar = w2c <$> parseByte

      We can also use functors to write a compact “peek” function. This
      returns ``Nothing`` if we're at the end of the input string.
      Otherwise, it returns the next character without consuming it
      (i.e. it inspects, but doesn't disturb, the current parsing
      state).

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         peekByte :: Parse (Maybe Word8)
         peekByte = (fmap fst . L.uncons . string) <$> getState

      The same lifting trick that let us define ``parseChar`` lets us
      write a compact definition for ``peekChar``.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         peekChar :: Parse (Maybe Char)
         peekChar = fmap w2c <$> peekByte

      Notice that ``peekByte`` and ``peekChar`` each make two calls to
      ``fmap``, one of which is disguised as ``(<$>)``. This is
      necessary because the type Parse (Maybe a) is a functor within a
      functor. We thus have to lift a function twice to “get it into”
      the inner functor.

      Finally, we'll write another generic combinator, which is the
      Parse analogue of the familiar ``takeWhile``: it consumes its
      input while its predicate returns ``True``.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         parseWhile :: (Word8 -> Bool) -> Parse [Word8]
         parseWhile p = (fmap p <$> peekByte) ==> \mp ->
                        if mp == Just True
                        then parseByte ==> \b ->
                             (b:) <$> parseWhile p
                        else identity []

      Once again, we're using functors in several places (doubled up,
      when necessary) to reduce the verbosity of our code. Here's a
      rewrite of the same function in a more direct style that does not
      use functors.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         parseWhileVerbose p =
             peekByte ==> \mc ->
             case mc of
               Nothing -> identity []
               Just c | p c ->
                          parseByte ==> \b ->
                          parseWhileVerbose p ==> \bs ->
                          identity (b:bs)
                      | otherwise ->
                          identity []

      The more verbose definition is likely easier to read when you are
      less familiar with functors. However, use of functors is
      sufficiently common in Haskell code that the more compact
      representation should become second nature (both to read and to
      write) fairly quickly.

                  :class: title

      With our new parsing code, what does the raw PGM parsing function
      look like now?

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         parseRawPGM =
             parseWhileWith w2c notWhite ==> \header -> skipSpaces ==>&
             assert (header == "P5") "invalid raw header" ==>&
             parseNat ==> \width -> skipSpaces ==>&
             parseNat ==> \height -> skipSpaces ==>&
             parseNat ==> \maxGrey ->
             parseByte ==>&
             parseBytes (width * height) ==> \bitmap ->
             identity (Greymap width height maxGrey bitmap)
           where notWhite = (`notElem` " \r\n\t")

      This definition makes use of a few more helper functions that we
      present here, following a pattern that should by now be familiar.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         parseWhileWith :: (Word8 -> a) -> (a -> Bool) -> Parse [a]
         parseWhileWith f p = fmap f <$> parseWhile (p . f)

         parseNat :: Parse Int
         parseNat = parseWhileWith w2c isDigit ==> \digits ->
                    if null digits
                    then bail "no more input"
                    else let n = read digits
                         in if n < 0
                            then bail "integer overflow"
                            else identity n

         (==>&) :: Parse a -> Parse b -> Parse b
         p ==>& f = p ==> \_ -> f

         skipSpaces :: Parse ()
         skipSpaces = parseWhileWith w2c isSpace ==>& identity ()

         assert :: Bool -> String -> Parse ()
         assert True  _   = identity ()
         assert False err = bail err

      The ``(==>&)`` combinator chains parsers like ``(==>)``, but the
      right hand side ignores the result from the left. The ``assert``
      function lets us check a property, and abort parsing with a useful
      error message if the property is ``False``.

      Notice how few of the functions that we have written make any
      reference to the current parsing state. Most notably, where our
      old ``parseP5`` function explicitly passed two-tuples down the
      chain of dataflow, all of the state management in ``parseRawPGM``
      is hidden from us.

      Of course, we can't completely avoid inspecting and modifying the
      parsing state. Here's a case in point, the last of the helper
      functions needed by ``parseRawPGM``.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch10/Parse.hs
         parseBytes :: Int -> Parse L.ByteString
         parseBytes n =
             getState ==> \st ->
             let n' = fromIntegral n
                 (h, t) = L.splitAt n' (string st)
                 st' = st { offset = offset st + L.length h, string = t }
             in putState st' ==>&
                assert (L.length h == n') "end of input" ==>&
                identity h

      Our main theme in this chapter has been abstraction. We found
      passing explicit state down a chain of functions to be
      unsatisfactory, so we abstracted this detail away. We noticed some
      recurring needs as we worked out our parsing code, and abstracted
      those into common functions. Along the way, we introduced the
      notion of a functor, which offers a generalised way to map over a
      parameterised type.

      We will revisit parsing in 
      `Chapter 16, Using Parsec <using-parsec.html>`__, to discuss Parsec, 
      a widely used and flexible parsing library. And in 
      `Chapter 14, Monads <monads.html>`__, we will return to our theme of
      abstraction, where we will find that much of the code that we have
      developed in this chapter can be further simplified by the use of
      monads.

      For efficiently parsing binary data represented as a ByteString, a
      number of packages are available via the Hackage package database.
      At the time of writing, the most popular is named ``binary``,
      which is easy to use and offers high performance.

   Building real systems means caring about quality control, robustness
   and correctness. With the right quality assurance mechanisms in
   place, well-written code can feel like a precision machine, with all
   functions performing their tasks exactly as specified. There is no
   sloppiness around the edges, and the final result can be code that is
   self-explanatory, obviously correct -- the kind of code that inspires
   confidence.

   In Haskell, we have several tools at our disposal for building such
   precise systems. The most obvious tool, and one built into the
   language itself, is the expressive type-system, which allows for
   complicated invariants to be enforced statically — making it
   impossible to write code violating chosen constraints. In addition,
   purity and polymorphism encourage a style of code that is modular,
   refactorable and testable. This is the kind of code that just doesn't
   go wrong.

   Testing plays a key role in keeping code on the straight-and-narrow
   path. The main testing mechanisms in Haskell are traditional unit
   testing (via the HUnit library), and its more powerful descendant:
   type-based “property” testing, with QuickCheck, an open source
   testing framework for Haskell. Property-based testing encourages a
   high level approach to testing in the form of abstract invariants
   functions should satisfy universally, with the actual test data
   generated for the programmer by the testing library. In this way code
   can be hammered with thousands of tests that would be infeasible to
   write by hand, often uncovering subtle corner cases that wouldn't be
   found otherwise.

   In this chapter we'll look at how to use QuickCheck to establish
   invariants in code and then re-examine the pretty printer developed
   in previous chapters, testing it with QuickCheck. We'll also see how
   to guide the testing process with GHC's code coverage tool: HPC.

                  :class: title

      To get an overview of how property-based testing works, we'll
      begin with a simple scenario: you've written a specialised sorting
      function and want to test its behaviour.

      First, we import the QuickCheck
      library :sup:`[` `27 <#ftn.id628218>`__ :sup:`]`, and any other
      modules we need:

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch11/QC-basics.hs
         import Test.QuickCheck
         import Data.List

      And the function we want to test — a custom sort routine:

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch11/QC-basics.hs
         qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
         qsort []     = []
         qsort (x:xs) = qsort lhs ++ [x] ++ qsort rhs
             where lhs = filter  (< x) xs
                   rhs = filter (>= x) xs

      This is the classic Haskell sort implementation: a study in
      functional programming elegance, if not efficiency (this isn't an
      inplace sort). Now, we'd like to check that this function obeys
      the basic rules a good sort should follow. One useful invariant to
      start with, and one that comes up in a lot of purely functional
      code, is *idempotency* — applying a function twice has the same
      result as applying it only once. For our sort routine, a stable
      sort algorithm, this should certainly be true, or things have gone
      horribly wrong! This invariant can be encoded as a property
      simply:

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch11/QC-basics.hs
         prop_idempotent xs = qsort (qsort xs) == qsort xs

      We'll use the QuickCheck convention of prefixing test properties
      with ``prop_`` to distinguish them from normal code. This
      idempotency property is written simply as a Haskell function
      stating an equality that must hold for any input data that is
      sorted. We can check this makes sense for a few simple cases by
      hand:

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> prop_idempotent []       
         True
         ghci> prop_idempotent [1,1,1,1]  
         True
         ghci> prop_idempotent [1..100]
         True
         ghci> prop_idempotent [1,5,2,1,2,0,9]
         True

      Looking good. However, writing out the input data by hand is
      tedious, and violates the moral code of the efficient functional
      programmer: let the machine do the work! To automate this the
      QuickCheck library comes with a set of data generators for all the
      basic Haskell data types. QuickCheck uses the Arbitrary typeclass
      to present a uniform interface to (pseudo-)random data generation
      with the type system used to resolve which generator to use.
      QuickCheck normally hides the data generation plumbing, however we
      can also run the generators by hand to get a sense for the
      distribution of data QuickCheck produces. For example, to generate
      a random list of boolean values:

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> generate 10 (System.Random.mkStdGen 2) arbitrary :: [Bool]
         [False,False,False,False,False,True]

      QuickCheck generates test data like this and passes it to the
      property of our choosing, via the ``quickCheck`` function. The
      type of the property itself determines which data generator is
      used. ``quickCheck`` then checks that for all the test data
      produced, the property is satisfied. Now, since our idempotency
      test is polymorphic in the list element type, we need to pick a
      particular type to generate test data for, which we write as a
      type constraint on the property. To run the test, we just call
      ``quickCheck`` with our property function, set to the required
      data type (otherwise the list element type will default to the
      uninteresting ``()`` type):

      .. code:: screen

         00, passed 100 tests.

      For the 100 different lists generated, our property held — great!
      When developing tests, it is often useful to see the actual data
      generated for each test. To do this, we would replace
      ``quickCheck`` with its sibling, ``verboseCheck``, to see
      (verbose) output for each test. Now, let's look at more
      sophisticated properties that our function might satisfy.

                     :name: id628462
                     :class: title

         Good libraries consist of a set of orthogonal primitives having
         sensible relationships to each other. We can use QuickCheck to
         specify the relationships between functions in our code,
         helping us find a good library interface by developing
         functions that are interrelated via useful properties.
         QuickCheck in this way acts as an API "lint" tool — it provides
         machine support for ensuring our library API makes sense.

         The list sorting function should certainly have a number of
         interesting properties that tie it to other list operations.
         For example: the first element in a sorted list should always
         be the smallest element of the input list. We might be tempted
         to specify this intuition in Haskell, using the ``List``
         library's ``minimum`` function:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/QC-basics.hs
            prop_minimum xs         = head (qsort xs) == minimum xs

         Testing this, though, reveals an error:

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> quickCheck (prop_minimum :: [Integer] -> Bool)
            0** Exception: Prelude.head: empty list

         The property failed when sorting an empty list — for which
         ``head`` and ``minimum`` are't defined, as we can see from
         their definition:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/minimum.hs
            head       :: [a] -> a
            head (x:_) = x
            head []    = error "Prelude.head: empty list"

            minimum    :: (Ord a) => [a] -> a
            minimum [] =  error "Prelude.minimum: empty list"
            minimum xs =  foldl1 min xs

         So this property will only hold for non-empty lists.
         QuickCheck, thankfully, comes with a full property writing
         embedded language, so we can specify more precisely our
         invariants, filtering out values we don't want to consider. For
         the empty list case, we really want to say: *if* the list is
         non-empty, *then* the first element of the sorted result is the
         minimum. This is done by using the ``(==>)`` implication
         function, which filters out invalid data before running the
         property:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/QC-basics.hs
            prop_minimum' xs         = not (null xs) ==> head (qsort xs) == minimum xs

         The result is quite clean. By separating out the empty list
         case, we can now confirm the property does in fact hold:

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> quickCheck (prop_minimum' :: [Integer] -> Property)
            00, passed 100 tests.

         Note that we had to change the type of the property from being
         a simple Bool result to the more general Property type (the
         property itself is now a function that filters non-empty lists,
         before testing them, rather than a simple boolean constant).

         We can now complete the basic property set for the sort
         function with some other invariants that it should satisfy:
         that the output is ordered (each element should be smaller
         than, or equal to, its successor); that the output is a
         permutation of the input (which we achieve via the list
         difference function, ``(\\)``); that the last sorted element
         should be the largest element; and if we find the smallest
         element of two different lists, that should be the first
         element if we append and sort those lists. These properties can
         be stated as:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/QC-basics.hs
            prop_ordered xs = ordered (qsort xs)
                where ordered []       = True
                      ordered [x]      = True
                      ordered (x:y:xs) = x <= y && ordered (y:xs)

            prop_permutation xs = permutation xs (qsort xs)
                where permutation xs ys = null (xs \ ys) && null (ys \ xs)

            prop_maximum xs         =
                not (null xs) ==>
                    last (qsort xs) == maximum xs

            prop_append xs ys       =
                not (null xs) ==>
                not (null ys) ==>
                    head (qsort (xs ++ ys)) == min (minimum xs) (minimum ys)

                     :class: title

         Another technique for gaining confidence in some code is to
         test it against a model implementation. We can tie our
         implementation of list sort to the reference sort function in
         the standard list library, and, if they behave the same, we
         gain confidence that our sort does the right thing.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/QC-basics.hs
            prop_sort_model xs      = sort xs == qsort xs

         This kind of model-based testing is extremely powerful. Often
         developers will have a reference implementation or prototype
         that, while inefficient, is correct. This can then be kept
         around and used to ensure optimised production code conforms to
         the reference. By building a large suite of these model-based
         tests, and running them regularly (on every commit, for
         example), we can cheaply ensure the precision of our code.
         Large Haskell projects often come bundled with property suites
         comparable in size to the project itself, with thousands of
         invariants tested on every change, keeping the code tied to the
         specification, and ensuring it behaves as required.

                  :class: title

      Testing individual functions for their natural properties is one
      of the basic building blocks that guides development of large
      systems in Haskell. We'll look now at a more complicated scenario:
      taking the pretty printing library developed in earlier chapters,
      and building a test suite for it.

                     :name: id628734
                     :class: title

         Recall that the pretty printer is built around the Doc, an
         algebraic data type that represents well-formed documents:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/Prettify2.hs

            data Doc = Empty
                     | Char Char
                     | Text String
                     | Line
                     | Concat Doc Doc
                     | Union Doc Doc
                     deriving (Show,Eq)

         The library itself is implemented as a set of functions that
         build and transform values of this document type, before
         finally rendering the finished document to a string.

         QuickCheck encourages an approach to testing where the
         developer specifies invariants that should hold for any data we
         can throw at the code. To test the pretty printing library,
         then, we'll need a source of input data. To do this, we take
         advantage of the small combinator suite for building random
         data that QuickCheck provides via the Arbitrary class. The
         class provides a function, ``arbitrary``, to generate data of
         each type, and with this we can define our data generator for
         our custom data types.
         :sup:`[` `28 <#ftn.id628795>`__ :sup:`]`

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/Arbitrary.hs
            class Arbitrary a where
              arbitrary   :: Gen a

         One thing to notice is that the generators run in a Gen
         environment, indicated by the type. This is a simple
         state-passing monad that is used to hide the random number
         generator state that is threaded through the code. We'll look
         thoroughly at monads in later chapters, but for now it suffices
         to know that, as Gen is defined as a monad, we can use ``do``
         syntax to write new generators that access the implicit random
         number source. To actually write generators for our custom type
         we use any of a set of functions defined in the library for
         introducing new random values and gluing them together to build
         up data structures of the type we're interested in. The types
         of the key functions are:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/Arbitrary.hs
              elements :: [a] -> Gen a
              choose   :: Random a => (a, a) -> Gen a
              oneof    :: [Gen a] -> Gen a

         The function ``elements``, for example, takes a list of values,
         and returns a generator of random values from that list.
         ``choose`` and ``oneof`` we'll use later. With this, we can
         start writing generators for simple data types. For example, if
         we define a new data type for ternary logic:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/Arbitrary.hs
            data Ternary
                = Yes
                | No
                | Unknown
                deriving (Eq,Show)

         we can write an Arbitrary instance for the Ternary type by
         defining a function that picks elements from a list of the
         possible values of Ternary type:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/Arbitrary.hs
            instance Arbitrary Ternary where
              arbitrary     = elements [Yes, No, Unknown]

         Another approach to data generation is to generate values for
         one of the basic Haskell types and then translate those values
         into the type you're actually interested in. We could have
         written the Ternary instance by generating integer values from
         0 to 2 instead, using ``choose``, and then mapping them onto
         the ternary values:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/Arbitrary2.hs
            instance Arbitrary Ternary where
              arbitrary     = do
                  n <- choose (0, 2) :: Gen Int
                  return $ case n of
                                0 -> Yes
                                1 -> No
                                _ -> Unknown

         For simple *sum* types, this approach works nicely, as the
         integers map nicely onto the constructors of the data type. For
         *product* types (such as structures and tuples), we need to
         instead generate each component of the product separately (and
         recursively for nested types), and then combine the components.
         For example, to generate random pairs of random values:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/Arbitrary.hs
            instance (Arbitrary a, Arbitrary b) => Arbitrary (a, b) where
              arbitrary = do
                  x <- arbitrary
                  y <- arbitrary
                  return (x, y)

         So let's now write a generator for all the different variants
         of the Doc type. We'll start by breaking the problem down,
         first generating random constructors for each type, then,
         depending on the result, the components of each field. The most
         complicated case are the union and concatenation variants.

         First, though, we need to write an instance for generating
         random characters — QuickCheck doesn't have a default instance
         for characters, due to the abundance of different text
         encodings we might want to use for character tests. We'll write
         our own, and, as we don't care about the actual text content of
         the document, a simple generator of alphabetic characters and
         punctuation will suffice (richer generators are simple
         extensions of this basic approach):

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/QC.hs
            instance Arbitrary Char where
                arbitrary = elements (['A'..'Z'] ++ ['a' .. 'z'] ++ " ~!@#$%^&*()")

         With this in place, we can now write an instance for documents,
         by enumerating the constructors, and filling the fields in. We
         choose a random integer to represent which document variant to
         generate, and then dispatch based on the result. To generate
         concat or union document nodes, we just recurse on
         ``arbitrary``, letting type inference determine which instance
         of ``Arbitrary`` we mean:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/QC.hs
            instance Arbitrary Doc where
                arbitrary = do
                    n <- choose (1,6) :: Gen Int
                    case n of
                         1 -> return Empty

                         2 -> do x <- arbitrary
                                 return (Char x)

                         3 -> do x <- arbitrary
                                 return (Text x)

                         4 -> return Line

                         5 -> do x <- arbitrary
                                 y <- arbitrary
                                 return (Concat x y)

                         6 -> do x <- arbitrary
                                 y <- arbitrary
                                 return (Union x y)

         That was fairly straightforward, and we can clean it up some
         more by using the ``oneof`` function, whose type we saw
         earlier, to pick between different generators in a list (we can
         also use the monadic combinator, ``liftM`` to avoid naming
         intermediate results from each generator):

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/QC.hs
            instance Arbitrary Doc where
                arbitrary =
                    oneof [ return Empty
                          , liftM  Char   arbitrary
                          , liftM  Text   arbitrary
                          , return Line
                          , liftM2 Concat arbitrary arbitrary
                          , liftM2 Union  arbitrary arbitrary ]

         The latter is more concise, just picking between a list of
         generators, but they describe the same data either way. We can
         check that the output makes sense, by generating a list of
         random documents (seeding the pseudo-random generator with an
         initial seed of 2):

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> generate 10 (System.Random.mkStdGen 2) arbitrary :: [Doc]
            [Line,Empty,Union Empty Line,Union (Char 'R') (Concat (Union Line (Concat (Text "i@BmSu") (Char ')'))) (Union (Concat (Concat (Concat (Text "kqV!iN") Line) Line) Line) Line)),Char 'M',Text "YdwVLrQOQh"]

         Looking at the output we see a good mix of simple, base cases,
         and some more complicated nested documents. We'll be generating
         hundreds of these each test run, so that should do a pretty
         good job. We can now write some generic properties for our
         document functions.

      .. container:: sect2

         .. container:: titlepage

            .. container::

                     :name: id629125
                     :class: title

         Two of the basic functions on documents are the null document
         constant (a nullary function), ``empty``, and the append
         function. Their types are:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/Prettify2.hs
            empty :: Doc
            (<>)  :: Doc -> Doc -> Doc

         Together, these should have a nice property: appending or
         prepending the empty list onto a second list, should leave the
         second list unchanged. We can state this invariant as a
         property:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/QC.hs
            prop_empty_id x =
                empty <> x == x
              &&
                x <> empty == x

         Confirming that this is indeed true, we're now underway with
         our testing:

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> quickCheck prop_empty_id
            00, passed 100 tests.

         To look at what actual test documents were generated (by
         replacing ``quickCheck`` with ``verboseCheck``). A good mixture
         of both simple and complicated cases are being generated. We
         can refine the data generation further, with constraints on the
         proportion of generated data, if desirable.

         Other functions in the API are also simple enough to have their
         behaviour fully described via properties. By doing so we can
         maintain an external, checkable description of the function's
         behaviour, so later changes won't break these basic invariants.

            prop_line     = line     == Line

            prop_double d = double d == text (show d)

         These properties are enough to fully test the structure
         returned by the basic document operators. To test the rest of
         the library will require more work.

                     :class: title

         Higher order functions are the basic glue of reusable
         programming, and our pretty printer library is no exception — a
         custom fold function is used internally to implement both
         document concatenation and interleaving separators between
         document chunks. The ``fold`` defined for documents takes a
         list of document pieces, and glues them all together with a
         supplied combining function:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/Prettify2.hs
            fold :: (Doc -> Doc -> Doc) -> [Doc] -> Doc
            fold f = foldr f empty

         We can write tests in isolation for specific instances of fold
         easily. Horizontal concatenation of documents, for example, is
         easy to specify by writing a reference implementation on lists:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/QC.hs

            prop_hcat xs = hcat xs == glue xs
                where
                    glue []     = empty
                    glue (d:ds) = d <> glue ds

         It is a similar story for ``punctuate``, where we can model
         inserting punctuation with list interspersion (from
         ``Data.List``, ``intersperse`` is a function that takes an
         element and interleaves it between other elements of a list):

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/QC.hs

            prop_punctuate s xs = punctuate s xs == intersperse s xs

         While this looks fine, running it reveals a flaw in our
         reasoning:

         .. code:: screen

            ghci>  quickCheck prop_punctuate
            Falsifiable, after 6 tests:
            Empty
            [Line,Text "",Line]
                

         The pretty printing library optimises away redundant empty
         documents, something the model implementation doesn't, so we'll
         need to augment our model to match reality. First, we can
         intersperse the punctuation text throughout the document list,
         then a little loop to clean up the ``Empty`` documents
         scattered through, like so:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/QC.hs
            prop_punctuate' s xs = punctuate s xs == combine (intersperse s xs)
                where
                    combine []           = []
                    combine [x]          = [x]

                    combine (x:Empty:ys) = x : combine ys
                    combine (Empty:y:ys) = y : combine ys
                    combine (x:y:ys)     = x `Concat` y : combine ys

         Running this in GHCi, we can confirm the result. It is
         reassuring to have the test framework spot the flaws in our
         reasoning about the code — exactly what we're looking for:

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> quickCheck prop_punctuate'
            00, passed 100 tests.

                     :class: title

         We can put all these tests together in a single file, and run
         them simply by using one of QuickCheck's driver functions.
         Several exist, including elaborate parallel ones. The basic
         batch driver is often good enough, however. All we need do is
         set up some default test parameters, and then list the
         functions we want to test:

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch11/Run.hs
            import Prettify2
            import Test.QuickCheck.Batch

            options = TestOptions
                  { no_of_tests         = 200
                  , length_of_tests     = 1
                  , debug_tests         = False }

            main = do
                runTests "simple" options
                    [ run prop_empty_id
                    , run prop_char
                    , run prop_text
                    , run prop_line
                    , run prop_double
                    ]

                runTests "complex" options
                    [ run prop_hcat
                    , run prop_puncutate'
                    ]

         We've structured the code here as a separate, standalone test
         script, with instances and properties in their own file,
         separate to the library source. This is typical for library
         projects, where the tests are kept apart from the library
         itself, and import the library via the module system. The test
         script can then be compiled and executed:

         .. code:: screen

            $ ghc --make Run.hs
            $ ./Run 
                             simple : .....                            (1000)
                            complex : ..                               (400)
               

         A total of 1400 individual tests were created, which is
         comforting. We can increase the depth easily enough, but to
         find out exactly how well the code is being tested we should
         turn to the built in code coverage tool, HPC, which can state
         precisely what is going on.

               .. rubric:: Measuring test coverage with HPC
                  :name: id629497
                  :class: title

      HPC (Haskell Program Coverage) is an extension to the compiler to
      observe what parts of the code were actually executed during a
      given program run. This is useful in the context of testing, as it
      lets us observe precisely which functions, branches and
      expressions were evaluated. The result is precise knowledge about
      the percent of code tested, that's easy to obtain. HPC comes with
      a simple utility to generate useful graphs of program coverage,
      making it easy to zoom in on weak spots in the test suite.

      To obtain test coverage data, all we need to do is add the
      ``-fhpc`` flag to the command line, when compiling the tests:

      .. code:: screen

             $ ghc -fhpc Run.hs --make
           

      Then run the tests as normal;

      .. code:: screen

             $ ./Run
                          simple : .....                            (1000)
                         complex : ..                               (400)

            

      During the test run the trace of the program is written to .tix
      and .mix files in the current directory. Afterwards, these files
      are used by the command line tool, ``hpc``, to display various
      statistics about what happened. The basic interface is textual. To
      begin, we can get a summary of the code tested during the run
      using the ``report`` flag to ``hpc``. We'll exclude the test
      programs themselves, (using the ``--exclude`` flag), so as to
      concentrate only on code in the pretty printer library. Entering
      the following into the console:

      .. code:: screen

             $ hpc report Run --exclude=Main --exclude=QC
              18% expressions used (30/158)
               0% boolean coverage (0/3)
                    0% guards (0/3), 3 unevaluated
                  100% 'if' conditions (0/0)
                  100% qualifiers (0/0)
              23% alternatives used (8/34)
               0% local declarations used (0/4)
              42% top-level declarations used (9/21)
             

      we see that, on the last line, 42% of top level definitions were
      evaluated during the test run. Not too bad for a first attempt. As
      we test more and more functions from the library, this figure will
      rise. The textual version is useful for a quick summary, but to
      really see what's going on it is best to look at the marked up
      output. To generate this, use the ``markup`` flag instead:

      .. code:: screen

             $ hpc markup Run --exclude=Main --exclude=QC
           

      This will generate one html file for each Haskell source file, and
      some index files. Loading the file ``hpc_index.html`` into a
      browser, we can see some pretty graphs of the code coverage:

      .. container:: informalfigure

         .. container:: mediaobject

            |Revised coverage for module Prettify2: 52% of top level
            definitions (up from 42%), 23% of alternatives, 18% of
            expressions.|

      Not too bad. Clicking through to the pretty module itself, we see
      the actual source of the program, marked up in bold yellow for
      code that wasn't tested, and code that was executed simply bold.

      .. container:: informalfigure

         .. container:: mediaobject

            |Screenshot of annotated coverage output, displaying the
            Monoid instance for Doc in bold yellow (not tested), and
            other code nearby in bold (was executed).|

      We forgot to test the Monoid instance, for example, and some of
      the more complicated functions. HPC helps keep our test suite
      honest. Let's add a test for the typeclass instance of Monoid, the
      class of types that support appending and empty elements:

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch11/QC.hs
         prop_mempty_id x =
             mempty `mappend` x == x
           &&
             x `mappend` mempty == (x :: Doc)

      Running this property in ghci, to check it is correct:

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> quickCheck prop_mempty_id
         00, passed 100 tests.

      We can now recompile and run the test driver. It is important to
      remove the old .tix file first though, or an error will occur as
      HPC tries to combine the statistics from separate runs:

      .. code:: screen

           $ ghc -fhpc Run.hs --make -no-recomp
           $ ./Run 
           Hpc failure: inconsistent number of tick boxes
           (perhaps remove Run.tix file?)
           $ rm *.tix
           $ ./Run   
                              simple : .....                            (1000)
                             complex : ...                              (600)

      Another two hundred tests were added to the suite, and our
      coverage statistics improves to 52 percent of the code base:

      .. container:: informalfigure

         .. container:: mediaobject

            |Coverage for module Prettify2: 42% of top level
            definitions, 23% of alternatives, 18% of expressions.|

      HPC ensures that we're honest in our testing, as anything less
      than 100% coverage will be pointed out in glaring color. In
      particular, it ensures the programmer has to think about error
      cases, and complicated branches with obscure conditions, all forms
      of code smell. When combined with a saturating test generation
      system, like QuickCheck's, testing becomes a rewarding activity,
      and a core part of Haskell development.

         :sup:`[` `27 <#id628218>`__ :sup:`]` Throughout this chapter
         we'll use QuickCheck 1.0 (classic QuickCheck). It should be

         :sup:`[` `28 <#id628795>`__ :sup:`]` The class also defines a
         method, ``coarbitrary``, which given a value of some type,
         yields a function for new generators. We can disregard for now,
         as it is only needed for generating random values of function
         type. One result of disregarding ``coarbitrary`` is that GHC
         will warn about it not being defined, however, it is safe to
         ignore these warnings.

   build a barcode recognition application. Given a picture of the back

                  :class: title

      The vast majority of packaged and mass-produced consumer goods
      sold have a barcode somewhere on them. Although there are dozens
      of barcode systems used across a variety specialised domains,
      consumer products typically use either UPC-A or EAN-13. UPC-A was
      developed in the United States, while EAN-13 is European in
      origin.

      EAN-13 was developed after UPC-A, and is a superset of UPC-A. (In
      fact, UPC-A has been officially declared obsolete since 2005,
      though it's still widely used within the United States.) Any
      software or hardware that can understand EAN-13 barcodes will
      automatically handle UPC-A barcodes. This neatly reduces our
      descriptive problem to one standard.

      As the name suggests, EAN-13 describes a 13-digit sequence, which
      is broken into four groups.

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  The first two digits describe the *number system*. This can
            either indicate the nationality of the manufacturer, or
            describe one of a few other categories, such as ISBN (book
            identifier) numbers.

         -  The next five digits are a manufacturer ID, assigned by a
            country's numbering authority.

         -  The five digits that follow are a product ID, assigned by
            the manufacturer. (Smaller manufacturers may have a longer
            manufacturer ID and shorter product ID, but they still add
            up to ten digits.)

         -  The last digit is a *check digit*, allowing a scanner to
            validate the digit string it scans.

      The only way in which an EAN-13 barcode differs from a UPC-A
      barcode is that the latter uses a single digit to represent its
      number system. EAN-13 barcodes retain UPC-A compatibility by
      setting the first number system digit to zero.

                     :class: title

         Before we worry about decoding an EAN-13 barcode, we need to
         understand how they are encoded. The system used by EAN-13 is a
         little involved. We start by computing the check digit, which
         is the last digit of a string.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            checkDigit :: (Integral a) => [a] -> a
            checkDigit ds = 10 - (sum products `mod` 10)
                where products = mapEveryOther (*3) (reverse ds)

            mapEveryOther :: (a -> a) -> [a] -> [a]
            mapEveryOther f = zipWith ($) (cycle [f,id])

         This is one of those algorithms that is more easily understood
         via the code than a verbal description. The computation
         proceeds from the right of the string. Each successive digit is
         either multiplied by three or left alone (the ``cycle``
         function repeats its input list infinitely). The check digit is
         the difference between their sum, modulo ten, and the number
         ten.

         A barcode is a series of fixed-width bars, where black
         represents a binary “one” bit, and white a “zero”. A run of the
         same digits thus looks like a thicker bar.

         The sequence of bits in a barcode is as follows.

         .. container:: itemizedlist

            -  The leading guard sequence, encoded as 101.

            -  A group of six digits, each seven bits wide.

            -  Another guard sequence, encoded as 01010.

            -  A group of six more digits.

            -  The trailing guard sequence, encoded as 101.

         The digits in the left and right groups have separate
         encodings. On the left, digits are encoded with parity bits.
         The parity bits encode the 13th digit of the barcode.

      using in the remainder of this chapter.

      The barcode encoding process can largely be table-driven, in which
      we use small tables of bit patterns to decide how to encode each
      digit. Haskell's bread-and-butter data types, lists and tuples,
      are not well suited to use for tables whose elements may be
      accessed randomly. A list has to be traversed linearly to reach
      the *k*\ th element. A tuple doesn't have this problem, but
      Haskell's type system makes it difficult to write a function that
      takes a tuple and an element offset and returns the element at
      that offset within the tuple. (We'll explore why in the exercises
      below.)

      The usual data type for constant-time random access is of course
      the array. Haskell provides several array data types. We'll thus
      represent our encoding tables as arrays of strings.

      The simplest array type is in the ``Data.Array`` module, which
      we're using here. This presents arrays that can contain values of
      any Haskell type. Like other common Haskell types, these arrays
      are immutable. An immutable array is populated with values just
      once, when it is created. Its contents cannot subsequently be
      modified. (The standard libraries also provide other array types,
      some of which are mutable, but we won't cover those for a while.)

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
         leftOddList = ["0001101", "0011001", "0010011", "0111101", "0100011",
                        "0110001", "0101111", "0111011", "0110111", "0001011"]

         rightList = map complement <$> leftOddList
             where complement '0' = '1'
                   complement '1' = '0'

         leftEvenList = map reverse rightList

         parityList = ["111111", "110100", "110010", "110001", "101100",
                       "100110", "100011", "101010", "101001", "100101"]

         listToArray :: [a] -> Array Int a
         listToArray xs = listArray (0,l-1) xs
             where l = length xs

         leftOddCodes, leftEvenCodes, rightCodes, parityCodes :: Array Int String

         leftOddCodes = listToArray leftOddList
         leftEvenCodes = listToArray leftEvenList
         rightCodes = listToArray rightList
         parityCodes = listToArray parityList

      The ``Data.Array`` module's ``listArray`` function populates an
      array from a list. It takes as its first parameter the bounds of
      the array to create; the second is the values with which to
      populate it.

      An unusual feature of the Array type is that its type is
      parameterised over both the data it contains and the index type.
      For example, the type of a one-dimensional array of String is
      Array Int String, but a two-dimensional array would have the type
      Array (Int,Int) String.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :m +Data.Array
         ghci> :type listArray
         listArray :: (Ix i) => (i, i) -> [e] -> Array i e

      We can construct an array easily.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> listArray (0,2) "foo"
         array (0,2) [(0,'f'),(1,'o'),(2,'o')]

      Notice that we have to specify the lower and upper bounds of the
      array. These bounds are inclusive, so an array from 0 to 2 has
      elements 0, 1, and 2.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> listArray (0,3) [True,False,False,True,False]
         array (0,3) [(0,True),(1,False),(2,False),(3,True)]
         ghci> listArray (0,10) "too short"
         array (0,10) [(0,'t'),(1,'o'),(2,'o'),(3,' '),(4,'s'),(5,'h'),(6,'o'),(7,'r'),(8,'t'),(9,*** Exception: (Array.!): undefined array element

      Once an array is constructed, we can use the ``(!)`` operator to
      access its elements by index.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> let a = listArray (0,14) ['a'..]
         ghci> a ! 2
         'c'
         ghci> a ! 100
         *** Exception: Error in array index

      Since the array construction function lets us specify the bounds
      of an array, we don't have to use the zero-based array indexing
      familiar to C programmers. We can choose whatever bounds are
      convenient for our purposes.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> let a = listArray (-9,5) ['a'..]
         ghci> a ! (-2)
         'h'

      The index type can be any member of the Ix type. This lets us use,
      for example, Char as the index type.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> let a = listArray ('a', 'h') [97..]
         ghci> a ! 'e'
         101

      To create a higher-dimensioned array, we use a tuple of Ix
      instances as the index type. The Prelude makes tuples of up to
      five elements members of the Ix class. To illustrate, here's a
      small three-dimensional array.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> let a = listArray ((0,0,0), (9,9,9)) [0..]
         ghci> a ! (4,3,7)
         437

                     :name: id630493
                     :class: title

         The list that we use to populate the array must contain at
         least as many elements as are in the array. If we do not
         provide enough elements, we'll get an error at runtime. When
         the error will occur depends on the nature of the array.

         Here, we are using an array type that is non-strict in its
         elements. If we provide a list of three values to an array that
         we specify as containing more than three elements, the
         remaining elements will undefined. We will not get an error
         unless we access an element beyond the third.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> let a = listArray (0,5) "bar"
            ghci> a ! 2
            'r'
            ghci> a ! 4
            *** Exception: (Array.!): undefined array element

         Haskell also provides strict arrays, which behave differently.
         We will discuss the tradeoffs between the two kinds of array
         much later, in `the section called “Unboxing, lifting, and
         bottom” <advanced-library-design-building-a-bloom-filter.html#bloomfilter.uarray>`__.

                     :name: barcode.fold
                     :class: title

         The ``bounds`` function returns a tuple describing the bounds
         that we used to create the array. The ``indices`` function
         returns a list of every index. We can use these to define some
         useful folds, since the ``Data.Array`` module doesn't define
         any fold functions itself.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            -- | Strict left fold, similar to foldl' on lists.
            foldA :: Ix k => (a -> b -> a) -> a -> Array k b -> a
            foldA f s a = go s (indices a)
                where go s (j:js) = let s' = f s (a ! j)
                                    in s' `seq` go s' js
                      go s _ = s

            -- | Strict left fold using the first element of the array as its
            -- starting value, similar to foldl1 on lists.
            foldA1 :: Ix k => (a -> a -> a) -> Array k a -> a
            foldA1 f a = foldA f (a ! fst (bounds a)) a

         You might wonder why the array modules don't already provide
         such useful things as folding functions. There are some obvious
         correspondences between a one-dimensional array and a list. For
         instance, there are only two natural ways in which we can fold
         sequentially: left-to-right and right-to-left. Additionally, we
         can only fold over one element at a time.

         This does not translate even to two-dimensional arrays. First
         of all, there are several kinds of fold that make sense. We
         might still want to fold over single elements, but we now have
         the possibility of folding over rows or columns, too. On top of
         this, for element-at-a-time folding, there are no longer just
         two sequences for traversal.

         In other words, for two-dimensional arrays, there are enough
         permutations of possibly useful behaviour that there aren't
         many compelling reasons to choose a handful for a standard
         library. This problem is only compounded for higher dimensions,
         so it's best to let developers write folds that suit the needs
         of their applications. As we can see from our examples above,
         this is not hard to do.

                     :name: barcode.array.mutable
                     :class: title

         While there exist “modification” functions for immutable
         arrays, they are not very practical. For example, the ``accum``
         function takes an array and a list of ``(index, value)`` pairs,
         and returns a new array with the values at the given indices
         replaced.

         Since arrays are immutable, modifying even one element requires
         copying the entire array. This quickly becomes prohibitively
         expensive on arrays of even modest size.

         Another array type, DiffArray in the ``Data.Array.Diff``
         module, attempts to offset the cost of small modifications by
         storing deltas between successive versions of an array.
         Unfortunately, it is not implemented efficiently at the time we
         are writing this book, and is currently too slow to be of
         practical use.

         .. note:: Don't lose hope
            
            It *is* in fact possible to modify an array
            efficiently in Haskell, using the ST monad. This is
            a subject that we will return to later, in
            `Chapter 26, Advanced library design: building a Bloom
            filter <advanced-library-design-building-a-bloom-filter.html>`__.

                  :name: id630808
                  :class: title

      Even though our goal is to *decode* a barcode, it's useful to have
      an encoder for reference. This will allow us to, for example,
      ensure that our code is correct by checking that the output of
      ``decode . encode`` the same as its input.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
         encodeEAN13 :: String -> String
         encodeEAN13 = concat . encodeDigits . map digitToInt

         -- | This function computes the check digit; don't pass one in.
         encodeDigits :: [Int] -> [String]
         encodeDigits s@(first:rest) =
             outerGuard : lefties ++ centerGuard : righties ++ [outerGuard]
           where (left, right) = splitAt 5 rest
                 lefties = zipWith leftEncode (parityCodes ! first) left
                 righties = map rightEncode (right ++ [checkDigit s])

         leftEncode :: Char -> Int -> String
         leftEncode '1' = (leftOddCodes !)
         leftEncode '0' = (leftEvenCodes !)

         rightEncode :: Int -> String
         rightEncode = (rightCodes !)

         outerGuard = "101"
         centerGuard = "01010"

      The string to encode is twelve digits long, with ``encodeDigits``
      adding a thirteenth check digit.

      The barcode is encoded as two groups of six digits, with a guard
      sequence in the middle and “outside” sequences on either side. But
      if we have two groups of six digits, what happened to the missing
      digit?

      Each digit in the left group is encoded using either odd or even
      parity, with the parity chosen based on the bits of the first
      digit in the string. If a bit of the first digit is zero, the
      corresponding digit in the left group is encoded with even parity.
      A one bit causes the digit to be encoded with odd parity. This
      encoding is an elegant hack, chosen to make EAN-13 barcodes
      backwards compatible with the older UPC-A standard.

                  :class: title

      Before we talk about decoding, let's set a few practical limits on
      what kinds of barcode image we can work with.

      Phone cameras and webcams generally output JPEG images, but
      writing a JPEG decoder would take us several chapters. We'll
      simplify our parsing problem by handling the netpbm file format.
      We will use the parsing combinators we developed earlier, in
      `Chapter 10, Code case study: parsing a binary data
      format <code-case-study-parsing-a-binary-data-format.html>`__.

      We'd like to deal with real images from the kinds of cheap,
      fixed-focus cameras that come with low-end cell phones. These
      images tend to be out of focus, noisy, low in contrast, and of
      poor resolution. Fortunately, it's not hard to write code that can
      handle noisy, defocused VGA-resolution (640x480) images with
      terrible contrast ratios. We've verified that the code in this
      chapter captures barcodes from real books, using pictures taken by
      authentically mediocre cameras.

      We will avoid any image processing heroics, because that's another
      chapter-consuming subject. We won't correct perspective. Neither
      will we sharpen images taken from too near to the subject, which
      causes narrow bars to fade out; or from too far, which causes
      adjacent bars to blur together.

      Our task is to take a camera image and extract a valid barcode
      from it. Given such a nonspecific description, it can be hard to
      see how to make progress. However, we can break the big problem
      into a series of subproblems, each of which is self-contained and
      more tractable.

      .. container:: itemizedlist

         -  Convert colour data into a form we can easily work with.

         -  Sample a single scan line from the image, and extract a set
            of guesses as to what the encoded digits in this line could
            be.

         -  From the guesses, create a list of valid decodings.

      Many of these subproblems can be further divided, as we'll see.

      You might wonder how closely this approach of subdivision mirrors
      the actual work we did when writing the code that we present in
      this chapter. The answer is that we're far from image processing
      gurus, and when we started on this chapter we didn't know exactly
      what our solution was going to look like.

      We made some early educated guesses as to what a reasonable
      solution might look like, and came up with the list of subtasks
      above. We were then able to start tackling those parts that we
      knew how to solve, using our spare time to think about the bits
      that we had no prior experience with. We certainly didn't have a
      pre-existing algorithm or master plan in mind.

      Dividing the problem up like this helped us in two ways. By making
      progress on familiar ground, we had the psychological advantage of
      starting to solve the problem, even when we didn't really know
      where we were going. And as we started to work on a particular
      subproblem, we found ourselves able to further subdivide it into
      tasks of varying familiarity. We continued to focus on easier
      components, deferring ones we hadn't thought about in enough
      detail yet, and jumping from one element of the master list above
      to another. Eventually, we ran out of problems that were both
      unfamiliar and unsolved, and we had a complete idea of our
      eventual solution.

      Since we want to work with barcodes, which are sequences of black
      and white stripes, and we want to write a simple decoder, an easy
      representation to work with will be a monochrome image, in which
      each pixel is either black or white.

                     :name: id631116
                     :class: title

         As we mentioned earlier, we'll work with netpbm images. The
         netpbm colour image format is only slightly more complicated
         than the greyscale image format that we parsed in `Chapter 10,
         Code case study: parsing a binary data
         format <code-case-study-parsing-a-binary-data-format.html>`__.
         The identifying string in a header is “P6”, with the rest of
         the header layout identical to the greyscale format. In the
         body of an image, each pixel is represented as three bytes, one
         each for red, green and blue.

         We'll represent the image data as a two-dimensional array of
         pixels. We're using arrays here purely to gain experience with
         them. For this application, we could just as well use a list of
         lists. The only advantage of an array here is slight: we can
         efficiently extract a row.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            type Pixel = Word8
            type RGB = (Pixel, Pixel, Pixel)

            type Pixmap = Array (Int,Int) RGB

         We provide a few type synonyms to make our type signatures more
         readable.

         Since Haskell gives us considerable freedom in how we lay out
         an array, we must choose a representation. We'll play safe and
         follow a popular convention: indices begin at zero. We don't
         need to store the dimensions of the image explicitly, since we
         can extract them using the ``bounds`` function.

         The actual parser is mercifully short, thanks to the
         combinators we developed in `Chapter 10, Code case study:
         parsing a binary data
         format <code-case-study-parsing-a-binary-data-format.html>`__.

            parseTimes 0 _ = identity []
            parseTimes n p = p ==> \x -> (x:) <$> parseTimes (n-1) p

         The only function of note above is ``parseTimes``, which calls
         another parser a given number of times, building up a list of
         results.

         Now that we have a colour image in hand, we need to convert the
         colour data into monochrome. An intermediate step is to convert
         the data to greyscale. There's a simple, widely used
         formula\ :sup:`[`\ `29 <#ftn.id631244>`__\ :sup:`]` for
         converting an RGB image into a greyscale image, based on the
         perceived brightness of each colour channel.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            luminance :: (Pixel, Pixel, Pixel) -> Pixel
            luminance (r,g,b) = round (r' * 0.30 + g' * 0.59 + b' * 0.11)
                where r' = fromIntegral r
                      g' = fromIntegral g
                      b' = fromIntegral b

         Haskell arrays are members of the ``Functor`` typeclass, so we
         can simply use ``fmap`` to turn an entire image, or a single
         scanline, from colour into greyscale.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            type Greymap = Array (Int,Int) Pixel

            pixmapToGreymap :: Pixmap -> Greymap
            pixmapToGreymap = fmap luminance

         This ``pixmapToGreymap`` function is just for illustration.
         Since we'll only be checking a few rows of an image for
         possible barcodes, there's no reason to do the extra work of
         converting data we'll never subsequently use.

                     :class: title

         Our next subproblem is to convert the greyscale image into a
         two-valued image, where each pixel is either on or off.

         In an image processing application, where we're juggling lots
         of numbers, it would be easy to reuse the same numeric type for
         several different purposes. For example, we could use the Pixel
         type to represent on/off states, using the convention that the
         digit one represents a bit that's “on”, and zero “off”.

         However, reusing types for multiple purposes in this way
         quickly leads to potential confusion. To see whether a
         particular “Pixel” is a number or an on/off value, we can no
         longer simply glance at a type signature. We could easily use a
         value containing “the wrong kind of number” in some context,
         and the compiler won't catch it because the types work out.

         We could try to work around this by introducing a type alias.
         In the same way that we declared Pixel to be a synonym of
         Word8, we could declare a Bit type as a synonym of Pixel. While
         this might help readability, type synonyms still don't make the
         compiler do any useful work on our behalf.

         The compiler would treat Pixel and Bit as exactly the same
         type, so it could not catch a mistake such as using a Pixel
         value of 253 in a function that expects Bit values of zero or
         one.

         If we define the monochrome type ourselves, the compiler will
         prevent us from accidentally mixing our types up like this.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            data Bit = Zero | One
                       deriving (Eq, Show)

            threshold :: (Ix k, Integral a) => Double -> Array k a -> Array k Bit
            threshold n a = binary <$> a
                where binary i | i < pivot  = Zero
                               | otherwise  = One
                      pivot    = round $ least + (greatest - least) * n
                      least    = fromIntegral $ choose (<) a
                      greatest = fromIntegral $ choose (>) a
                      choose f = foldA1 $ \x y -> if f x y then x else y

         Our ``threshold`` function computes the minimum and maximum
         values in its input array. It takes these and a threshold
         valued between zero and one, and computes a “pivot” value. Then
         for each value in the array, if that value is less than the
         pivot, the result is ``Zero``, otherwise ``One``. Notice that
         we use one of the folding functions that we wrote in `the
         section called “Folding over
         arrays” <#barcode.fold>`__.

                  :class: title

      Let's step back for a moment and consider what we've done to our
      image when we converted it from colour to monochrome. Here's an
      image captured from a VGA-resolution camera. All we've done is
      crop it down to the barcode.

      .. container:: informalfigure

         .. container:: mediaobject

            |Barcode photo, somewhat blurry and dim.|

      The encoded digit string, 9780132114677, is printed below the
      barcode. The left group encodes the digits 780132, with 9 encoded
      in their parity. The right group encodes the digits 114677, where
      the final 7 is the check digit. Here's a clean encoding of this
      barcode, from one of the many web sites that offer barcode image
      generation for free.

      .. container:: informalfigure

         .. container:: mediaobject

            |Automatically generated image of the same barcode.|

      We've chosen a row from the captured image, and stretched it out
      vertically to make it easier to see. We've superimposed this on
      top of the perfect image, and stretched it out so that the two are
      aligned.

      .. container:: informalfigure

         .. container:: mediaobject

            |Photographic and generated images of barcode juxtaposed to
            illustrate the variation in bar brightness and resolution.|

      The luminance-converted row from the photo is in the dark grey
      band. It is low in contrast and poor in quality, with plenty of
      blurring and noise. The paler band is the same row with the
      contrast adjusted.

      Somewhat below these two bands is another: this shows the effect
      of thresholding the luminance-converted row. Notice that some bars
      have gotten thicker, others thinner, and many bars have moved a
      little to the left or right.

      Clearly, any attempt to find exact matches in an image with
      problems like these is not going to succeed very often. We must
      write code that's robust in the face of bars that are too thick,
      too thin, or not exactly where they're supposed to be. The widths
      of our bars will depend on how far our book was from the camera,
      so we can't make any assumptions about widths, either.

      Our first problem is to find the digits that *might* be encoded at
      a given position. For the next while, we'll make a few simplifying
      assumptions. The first is that we're working with a single row.
      The second is that we know exactly where in a row the left edge of
      a barcode begins.

                     :class: title

         How can we overcome the problem of not even knowing how thick
         our bars are? The answer is to run length encode our image
         data.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            type Run = Int
            type RunLength a = [(Run, a)]

            runLength :: Eq a => [a] -> RunLength a
            runLength = map rle . group
                where rle xs = (length xs, head xs)

         The ``group`` function takes sequences of identical elements in
         a list, and groups them into sublists.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> group [1,1,2,3,3,3,3]
            [[1,1],[2],[3,3,3,3]]

         Our ``runLength`` function represents each group as a pair of
         its length and first element.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> let bits = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]
            ghci> runLength bits
            Loading package array-0.1.0.0 ... linking ... done.
            Loading package containers-0.1.0.1 ... linking ... done.
            Loading package bytestring-0.9.0.1 ... linking ... done.
            [(2,0),(2,1),(2,0),(2,1),(6,0),(4,1),(4,0)]

         Since the data we're run length encoding are just ones and
         zeros, the encoded numbers will simply alternate between one
         and zero. We can throw the encoded values away without losing
         any useful information, keeping only the length of each run.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            runLengths :: Eq a => [a] -> [Run]
            runLengths = map fst . runLength

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> runLengths bits
            [2,2,2,2,6,4,4]

         The bit patterns above aren't random; they're the left outer
         guard and first encoded digit of a row from our captured image.
         If we drop the guard bars, we're left with the run lengths
         ``[2,6,4,4]``. How do we find matches for these in the encoding
         tables we wrote in `the section called “Introducing
         arrays” <#barcode.array>`__?

                     :name: id631784
                     :class: title

         One possible approach is to scale the run lengths so that they
         sum to one. We'll use the Ratio Int type instead of the usual
         Double to manage these scaled values, as Ratios print out more
         readably in **ghci**. This makes interactive debugging and
         development much easier.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            type Score = Ratio Int

            scaleToOne :: [Run] -> [Score]
            scaleToOne xs = map divide xs
                where divide d = fromIntegral d / divisor
                      divisor = fromIntegral (sum xs)
            -- A more compact alternative that "knows" we're using Ratio Int:
            -- scaleToOne xs = map (% sum xs) xs

            type ScoreTable = [[Score]]

            -- "SRL" means "scaled run length".
            asSRL :: [String] -> ScoreTable
            asSRL = map (scaleToOne . runLengths)

            leftOddSRL = asSRL leftOddList
            leftEvenSRL = asSRL leftEvenList
            rightSRL = asSRL rightList
            paritySRL = asSRL parityList

         We use the Score type synonym so that most of our code won't
         have to care what the underlying type is. Once we're done
         developing our code and poking around with **ghci**, we could,
         if we wish, go back and turn the “Score” type synonym into
         Doubles, without changing any code.

         We can use ``scaleToOne`` to scale a sequence of digits that
         we're searching for. We've now corrected for variations in bar
         widths due to distance, as there should be a pretty close match
         between an entry in a scaled run length encoding table and a
         run length sequence pulled from an image.

         The next question is how we turn the intuitive idea of “pretty
         close” into a measure of “close enough”. Given two scaled run
         length sequences, we can calculate an approximate “distance”
         between them as follows.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            distance :: [Score] -> [Score] -> Score
            distance a b = sum . map abs $ zipWith (-) a b

         An exact match will give a distance of zero, with weaker
         matches resulting in larger distances.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> let group = scaleToOne [2,6,4,4]
            ghci> distance group (head leftEvenSRL)
            13%28
            ghci> distance group (head leftOddSRL)
            17%28

         Given a scaled run length table, we choose the best few matches
         in that table for a given input sequence.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            bestScores :: ScoreTable -> [Run] -> [(Score, Digit)]
            bestScores srl ps = take 3 . sort $ scores
                where scores = zip [distance d (scaleToOne ps) | d <- srl] digits
                      digits = [0..9]

                     :name: id631976
                     :class: title

         The new notation that we introduced in the previous example is
         an example of a *list comprehension*, which creates a list from
         one or more other lists.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> [ (a,b) | a <- [1,2], b <- "abc" ]
            [(1,'a'),(1,'b'),(1,'c'),(2,'a'),(2,'b'),(2,'c')]

         The expression on the left of the vertical bar is evaluated for
         each combination of *generator expressions* on the right. A
         generator expression binds a variable on the left of a ``<-``
         to an element of the list on the right. As the example above
         shows, the combinations of generators are evaluated in depth
         first order: for the first element of the first list, we
         evaluate every element of the second, and so on.

         In addition to generators, we can also specify guards on the
         right of a list comprehension. A guard is a Bool expression. If
         it evaluates to ``False``, that element is skipped over.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> [ (a,b) | a <- [1..6], b <- [5..7], even (a + b ^ 2) ]
            [(1,5),(1,7),(2,6),(3,5),(3,7),(4,6),(5,5),(5,7),(6,6)]

         We can also bind local variables using a ``let`` expression.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> let vowel = (`elem` "aeiou")
            ghci> [ x | a <- "etaoin", b <- "shrdlu", let x = [a,b], all vowel x ]
            ["eu","au","ou","iu"]

         If a pattern match fails in a generator expression, no error
         occurs. Instead, that list element is skipped.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> [ a | (3,a) <- [(1,'y'),(3,'e'),(5,'p')] ]
            "e"

         List comprehensions are powerful and concise. As a result, they
         can be difficult to read. When used with care, they can make
         our code easier to follow.

                     :name: id632165
                     :class: title

         For each match in the left group, we have to remember whether
         we found it in the even parity table or the odd table.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            data Parity a = Even a | Odd a | None a
                            deriving (Show)

            fromParity :: Parity a -> a
            fromParity (Even a) = a
            fromParity (Odd a) = a
            fromParity (None a) = a

            parityMap :: (a -> b) -> Parity a -> Parity b
            parityMap f (Even a) = Even (f a)
            parityMap f (Odd a) = Odd (f a)
            parityMap f (None a) = None (f a)

            instance Functor Parity where
                fmap = parityMap

         We wrap a value in the parity with which it was encoded, and
         making it a ``Functor`` instance so that we can easily
         manipulate parity-encoded values.

         We would like to be able to sort parity-encoded values based on
         the values they contain. The ``Data.Function`` module provides
         a lovely combinator that we can use for this, named ``on``.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            on :: (a -> a -> b) -> (c -> a) -> c -> c -> b
            on f g x y = g x `f` g y

            compareWithoutParity = compare `on` fromParity

         In case it's unclear, try thinking of ``on`` as a function of
         two arguments, ``f`` and ``g``, which returns a function of two
         arguments, ``x`` and ``y``. It applies ``g`` to ``x`` and to
         ``y``, then ``f`` on the two results (hence the name ``on``).

         Wrapping a match in a parity value is straightforward.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            type Digit = Word8

            bestLeft :: [Run] -> [Parity (Score, Digit)]
            bestLeft ps = sortBy compareWithoutParity
                          ((map Odd (bestScores leftOddSRL ps)) ++
                           (map Even (bestScores leftEvenSRL ps)))

            bestRight :: [Run] -> [Parity (Score, Digit)]
            bestRight = map None . bestScores rightSRL

         Once we have the best left-hand matches from the even and odd
         tables, we sort them based only on the quality of each match.

                        :class: title

            In our definition of the Parity type, we could have used
            Haskell's record syntax to avoid the need to write a
            fromParity function. In other words, we could have written
            it as follows.

            .. code:: programlisting

               -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
               data AltParity a = AltEven {fromAltParity :: a}
                                | AltOdd  {fromAltParity :: a}
                                | AltNone {fromAltParity :: a}
                                  deriving (Show)

            Why did we not do this? The answer is slightly shameful, and
            has to do with interactive debugging in **ghci**. When we
            tell GHC to automatically derive a Show instance for a type,
            it produces different code depending on whether or not we
            declare the type with record syntax.

            .. code:: screen

               ghci> show $ Even 1
               "Even 1"
               ghci> show $ AltEven 1
               "AltEven {fromAltParity = 1}"
               ghci> length . show $ Even 1
               6
               ghci> length . show $ AltEven 1
               27

            The Show instance for the variant that uses record syntax is
            considerably more verbose. This creates much more noise that
            we must scan through when we're trying to read, say, a list
            of parity-encoded values output by **ghci**.

            Of course we could write our own, less noisy, Show instance.
            It's simply less effort to avoid record syntax and write our
            own fromParity function instead, letting GHC derive a more
            terse Show instance for us. This isn't an especially
            satisfying rationale, but programmer laziness can lead in
            odd directions at times.

                     :class: title

         A common aspect of working with lists is needing to “chunk”
         them. For example, each digit in a barcode is encoded using a
         run of four digits. We can turn the flat list that represents a
         row into a list of four-element lists as follows.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            chunkWith :: ([a] -> ([a], [a])) -> [a] -> [[a]]
            chunkWith _ [] = []
            chunkWith f xs = let (h, t) = f xs
                             in h : chunkWith f t

            chunksOf :: Int -> [a] -> [[a]]
            chunksOf n = chunkWith (splitAt n)

         It's somewhat rare that we need to write generic list
         manipulation functions like this. Often, a glance through the
         ``Data.List`` module will find us a function that does exactly,
         or close enough to, what we need.

                     :name: id632516
                     :class: title

         With our small army of helper functions deployed, the function
         that generates lists of candidate matches for each digit group
         is easy to write. First of all, we take care of a few early
         checks to determine whether matching even makes sense. A list
         of runs must start on a black (``Zero``) bar, and contain
         enough bars. Here are the first few equations of our function.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            candidateDigits :: RunLength Bit -> [[Parity Digit]]
            candidateDigits ((_, One):_) = []
            candidateDigits rle | length rle < 59 = []

         If any application of ``bestLeft`` or ``bestRight`` results in
         an empty list, we can't possibly have a match. Otherwise, we
         throw away the scores, and return a list of lists of
         parity-encoded candidate digits. The outer list is twelve
         elements long, one per digit in the barcode. The digits in each
         sublist are ordered by match quality.

         Here is the remainder of the definition of our function.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            candidateDigits rle
                | any null match = []
                | otherwise      = map (map (fmap snd)) match
              where match = map bestLeft left ++ map bestRight right
                    left = chunksOf 4 . take 24 . drop 3 $ runLengths
                    right = chunksOf 4 . take 24 . drop 32 $ runLengths
                    runLengths = map fst rle

         Let's take a glance at the candidate digits chosen for each
         group of bars, from a row taken from the image above.

                  :name: id632644
                  :class: title

      In an imperative language, the array is as much a “bread and
      butter” type as a list or tuple in Haskell. We take it for granted
      that an array in an imperative language is usually mutable; we can
      change an element of an array whenever it suits us.

      As we mentioned in `the section called “Modifying array
      elements” <#barcode.array.mutable>`__,
      Haskell arrays are *not* mutable. This means that to “modify” a
      single array element, a copy of the entire array is made, with
      that single element set to its new value. Clearly, this approach
      is not a winner for performance.

      The mutable array is a building block for another ubiquitous
      imperative data structure, the hash table. In the typical
      implementation, an array acts as the “spine” of the table, with
      each element containing a list of elements. To add an element to a
      hash table, we hash the element to find the array offset, and
      modify the list at that offset to add the element to it.

      If arrays aren't mutable, to updating a hash table, we must create
      a new one. We copy the array, putting a new list at the offset
      indicated by the element's hash. We don't need to copy the lists
      at other offsets, but we've already dealt performance a fatal blow
      simply by having to copy the spine.

      At a single stroke, then, immutable arrays have eliminated *two*
      canonical imperative data structures from our toolbox. Arrays are
      somewhat less useful in pure Haskell code than in many other
      languages. Still, many array codes only update an array during a
      build phase, and subsequently use it in a read-only manner.

                     :name: id632722
                     :class: title

         This is not the calamitous situation that it might seem,
         though. Arrays and hash tables are often used as collections
         indexed by a key, and in Haskell we use *trees* for this
         purpose.

         Implementing a naive tree type is particularly easy in Haskell.
         Beyond that, more useful tree types are also unusually easy to
         implement. Self-balancing structures, such as red-black trees,
         have struck fear into generations of undergraduate computer
         science students, because the balancing algorithms are
         notoriously hard to get right.

         Haskell's combination of algebraic data types, pattern
         matching, and guards reduce even the hairiest of balancing
         operations to a few lines of code. We'll bite back our
         enthusiasm for building trees, however, and focus on why
         they're particularly useful in a pure functional language.

         The attraction of a tree to a functional programmer is *cheap
         modification*. We don't break the immutability rule: trees are
         immutable just like everything else. However, when we modify a
         tree, creating a new tree, we can share most of the structure
         of the tree between the old and new versions. For example, in a
         tree containing 10,000 nodes, we might expect that the old and
         new versions will share about 9,985 elements when we add or
         remove one. In other words, the number of elements modified per
         update depends on the height of the tree, or the logarithm of
         the size of the tree.

         Haskell's standard libraries provide two collection types that
         are implemented using balanced trees behind the scenes:
         ``Data.Map`` for key/value pairs, and ``Data.Set`` for sets of
         values. As we'll be using ``Data.Map`` in the sections that
         follow, we'll give a quick introduction to it below.
         ``Data.Set`` is sufficiently similar that you should be able to
         pick it up quickly.

         .. note:: A word about performance
           
            Compared to a hash table, a well-implemented purely
            functional tree data structure will perform
            competitively. You should not approach trees with
            the assumption that your code will pay a
            performance penalty.

                     :name: id632817
                     :class: title

         The ``Data.Map`` module provides a parameterised type, Map k a,
         that maps from a key type ``k`` to a value type ``a``. Although
         it is internally a size-balanced binary tree, the
         implementation is not visible to us.

         Map is strict in its keys, but non-strict in its values. In
         other words, the *spine*, or structure, of the map is always
         kept up to date, but values in the map aren't evaluated unless
         we force them to be.

         It is very important to remember this, as Map's laziness over
         values is a frequent source of space leaks among coders who are
         not expecting it.

         Because the ``Data.Map`` module contains a number of names that
         clash with Prelude names, it's usually imported in qualified
         form. Earlier in this chapter, we imported it using the prefix
         ``M``.

            The Map type doesn't place any explicit constraints on its
            key type, but most of the module's useful functions require
            that keys be instances of ``Ord``. This is noteworthy, as
            it's an example of a common design pattern in Haskell code:
            type constraints are pushed out to where they're actually
            needed, not necessarily applied at the point where they'd
            result in the least fingertyping for a library's author.

            Neither the Map type nor any functions in the module
            constrain the types that can be used as values.

            For some reason, the type signatures of the functions in
            ``Data.Map`` are not generally friendly to partial
            application. The map parameter always comes last, whereas it
            would be easier to partially apply if it were first. As a
            result, code that uses partially applied map functions
            almost always contains adapter functions to fiddle with
            argument ordering.

                        :class: title

            The ``Data.Map`` module has a large “surface area”: it
            exports dozens of functions. Just a handful of these
            comprise the most frequently used core of the module.

            To create an empty map, we use ``empty``. For a map
            containing one key/value pair, we use ``singleton``.

            .. code:: screen

               ghci> M.empty
               Loading package array-0.1.0.0 ... linking ... done.
               Loading package containers-0.1.0.1 ... linking ... done.
               fromList []
               ghci> M.singleton "foo" True
               fromList [("foo",True)]

            Since the implementation is abstract, we can't pattern match
            on Map values. Instead, it provides a number of lookup
            functions, of which two are particularly widely used. The
            ``lookup`` function has a slightly tricky type signature,
            but don't worry; all will become clear shortly, in
            `Chapter 14, Monads <monads.html>`__.

            .. code:: screen

               ghci> :type M.lookup
               M.lookup :: (Ord k, Monad m) => k -> M.Map k a -> m a

            Most often, the type parameter ``m`` in the result is Maybe.
            In other words, if the map contains a value for the given
            key, ``lookup`` will return the value wrapped in ``Just``.
            Otherwise, it will return ``Nothing``.

            .. code:: screen

               ghci> let m = M.singleton "foo" 1 :: M.Map String Int
               ghci> case M.lookup "bar" m of { Just v -> "yay"; Nothing -> "boo" }
               "boo"

            The ``findWithDefault`` function takes a value to return if
            the key isn't in the map.

            .. warning:: Beware the partial functions!
               
               There exists a ``(!)`` operator that performs a
               lookup and returns the unadorned value
               associated with a key (i.e. not wrapped in
               ``Maybe`` or whatever). Unfortunately, it is not
               a total function: it calls ``error`` if the key
               is not present in the map.

            To add a key/value pair to the map, the most useful
            functions are ``insert`` and ``insertWith'``. The ``insert``
            function simply inserts a value into the map, overwriting
            any matching value that may already have been present.

            .. code:: screen

               ghci> :type M.insert
               M.insert :: (Ord k) => k -> a -> M.Map k a -> M.Map k a
               ghci> M.insert "quux" 10 m
               fromList [("foo",1),("quux",10)]
               ghci> M.insert "foo" 9999 m
               fromList [("foo",9999)]

            The ``insertWith'`` function takes a further *combining
            function* as its argument. If no matching key was present in
            the map, the new value is inserted verbatim. Otherwise, the
            combining function is called on the new and old values, and
            its result is inserted into the map.

            .. code:: screen

               ghci> :type M.insertWith'
               M.insertWith' :: (Ord k) => (a -> a -> a) -> k -> a -> M.Map k a -> M.Map k a
               ghci> M.insertWith' (+) "zippity" 10 m
               fromList [("foo",1),("zippity",10)]
               ghci> M.insertWith' (+) "foo" 9999 m
               fromList [("foo",10000)]

            As the tick at the end of its name suggests, ``insertWith'``
            evaluates the combining function strictly. This allows you
            to avoid space leaks. While there exists a lazy variant
            (``insertWith`` without the trailing tick in the name), it's
            rarely what you actually want.

            The ``delete`` function deletes the given key from the map.
            It returns the map unmodified if the key was not present.

            .. code:: screen

               ghci> :type M.delete
               M.delete :: (Ord k) => k -> M.Map k a -> M.Map k a
               ghci> M.delete "foo" m
               fromList []

            Finally, there are several efficient functions for
            performing set-like operations on maps. Of these, we'll be
            using ``union`` below. This function is “left biased”: if
            two maps contain the same key, the result will contain the
            value from the left map.

            .. code:: screen

               ghci> m `M.union` M.singleton "quux" 1
               fromList [("foo",1),("quux",1)]
               ghci> m `M.union` M.singleton "foo" 0
               fromList [("foo",1)]

            We have barely covered ten percent of the ``Data.Map`` API.
            We will cover maps and similar data structures in greater
            detail in `Chapter 13, Data
            Structures <data-structures.html>`__. For further
            inspiration, we encourage you to browse the module
            documentation. The module is impressively thorough.

         gives a wonderful and thorough implementor's tour of many pure
         functional data structures, including several kinds of balanced

         the performance of purely functional data structures and lazy
         evaluation.

         We recommend Okasaki's book as essential reading for functional
         programmers. If you're not convinced, Okasaki's PhD thesis,
         [`Okasaki96 <bibliography.html#bib.okasaki96>`__], is a less

      We've got yet another problem to solve now. We have many
      candidates for the last twelve digits of the barcode. In addition,
      we need to use the parities of the first six digits to figure out
      what the first digit is. Finally, we need to ensure that our
      answer's check digit makes sense.

      This seems quite challenging! We have a lot of uncertain data;
      what should we do? It's reasonable to ask if we could perform a
      brute force search. Given the candidates we saw in the **ghci**
      session above, how many combinations would we have to examine?

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> product . map length . candidateDigits $ input
         34012224

      So much for that idea. Once again, we'll initially focus on a
      subproblem that we know how to solve, and postpone worrying about
      the rest.

                     :class: title

         Let's abandon the idea of searching for now, and focus on
         computing a check digit. The check digit for a barcode can
         assume one of ten possible values. For a given parity digit,
         which input sequences can cause that digit to be computed?

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            type Map a = M.Map Digit [a]

         In this map, the key is a check digit, and the value is a
         sequence that evaluates to this check digit. We have two
         further map types based on this definition.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            type DigitMap = Map Digit
            type ParityMap = Map (Parity Digit)

         We'll generically refer to these as “solution maps”, because
         they show us the digit sequence that “solves for” each check
         digit.

         Given a single digit, here's how we can update an existing
         solution map.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            updateMap :: Parity Digit       -- ^ new digit
                      -> Digit              -- ^ existing key
                      -> [Parity Digit]     -- ^ existing digit sequence
                      -> ParityMap          -- ^ map to update
                      -> ParityMap
            updateMap digit key seq = insertMap key (fromParity digit) (digit:seq)

            insertMap :: Digit -> Digit -> [a] -> Map a -> Map a
            insertMap key digit val m = val `seq` M.insert key' val m
                where key' = (key + digit) `mod` 10

         With an existing check digit drawn from the map, the sequence
         that solves for it, and a new input digit, this function
         updates the map with the new sequence that leads to the new
         check digit.

         This might seem a bit much to digest, but an example will make
         it clear. Let's say the check digit we're looking at is ``4``,
         the sequence leading to it is ``[1,3]``, and the digit we want
         to add to the map is ``8``. The sum of ``4`` and ``8``, modulo
         10, is ``2``, so this is the key we'll be inserting into the
         map. The sequence that leads to the new check digit ``2`` is
         thus ``[8,1,3]``, so this is what we'll insert as the value.

         For each digit in a sequence, we'll generate a new solution
         map, using that digit and an older solution map.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            useDigit :: ParityMap -> ParityMap -> Parity Digit -> ParityMap
            useDigit old new digit =
                new `M.union` M.foldWithKey (updateMap digit) M.empty old

         Once again, let's illustrate what this code is doing using some
         examples. This time, we'll use **ghci**.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> let single n = M.singleton n [Even n] :: ParityMap
            ghci> useDigit (single 1) M.empty (Even 1)
            fromList [(2,[Even 1,Even 1])]
            ghci> useDigit (single 1) (single 2) (Even 2)
            fromList [(2,[Even 2]),(3,[Even 2,Even 1])]

         The new solution map that we feed to ``useDigits`` starts out
         empty. We populate it completely by folding ``useDigits`` over
         a sequence of input digits.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            incorporateDigits :: ParityMap -> [Parity Digit] -> ParityMap
            incorporateDigits old digits = foldl' (useDigit old) M.empty digits

         This generates a complete new solution map from an old one.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> incorporateDigits (M.singleton 0 []) [Even 1, Even 5]
            fromList [(1,[Even 1]),(5,[Even 5])]

         Finally, we must build the complete solution map. We start out
         with an empty map, then fold over each digit position from the
         barcode in turn. For each position, we create a new map from
         our guesses at the digits in that position. This becomes the
         old map for the next round of the fold.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            finalDigits :: [[Parity Digit]] -> ParityMap
            finalDigits = foldl' incorporateDigits (M.singleton 0 [])
                        . mapEveryOther (map (fmap (*3)))

         (From the ``checkDigit`` function that we defined in `the
         section called “EAN-13
         encoding” <#barcode.encode>`__, we
         remember that the check digit computation requires that we
         multiply every other digit by ``3``.)

         How long is the list with which we call ``finalDigits``? We
         don't yet know what the first digit of our sequence is, so
         obviously we can't provide that. And we don't want to include
         our guess at the check digit. So the list must be eleven
         elements long.

         Once we've returned from ``finalDigits``, our solution map is
         necessarily incomplete, because we haven't yet figured out what
         the first digit is.

                     :class: title

         We haven't yet discussed how we should extract the value of the
         first digit from the parities of the left group of digits. This
         is a straightforward matter of reusing code that we've already
         written.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            firstDigit :: [Parity a] -> Digit
            firstDigit = snd
                       . head
                       . bestScores paritySRL
                       . runLengths
                       . map parityBit
                       . take 6
              where parityBit (Even _) = Zero
                    parityBit (Odd _) = One

         Each element of our partial solution map now contains a
         reversed list of digits and parity data. Our next task is to
         create a completed solution map, by computing the first digit
         in each sequence, and using it to create that last solution
         map.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            addFirstDigit :: ParityMap -> DigitMap
            addFirstDigit = M.foldWithKey updateFirst M.empty

            updateFirst :: Digit -> [Parity Digit] -> DigitMap -> DigitMap
            updateFirst key seq = insertMap key digit (digit:renormalize qes)
              where renormalize = mapEveryOther (`div` 3) . map fromParity
                    digit = firstDigit qes
                    qes = reverse seq

         Along the way, we get rid of the Parity type, and reverse our
         earlier multiplications by three. Our last step is to complete
         the check digit computation.

         We now have a map of all possible checksums and the sequences
         that lead to each. All that remains is to take our guesses at
         the check digit, and see if we have a corresponding solution
         map entry.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
            solve :: [[Parity Digit]] -> [[Digit]]
            solve [] = []
            solve xs = catMaybes $ map (addCheckDigit m) checkDigits
                where checkDigits = map fromParity (last xs)
                      m = buildMap (init xs)
                      addCheckDigit m k = (++[k]) <$> M.lookup k m

         Let's try this out on the row we picked from our photo, and see
         if we get a sensible answer.

         .. code:: screen

            Just [9,7,8,0,1,3,2,1,1,4,6,7,7]

         Excellent! This is exactly the string encoded in the barcode we
         photographed.

                  :name: id634020
                  :class: title

      We've mentioned repeatedly that we are taking a single row from
      our image. Here's how.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
         withRow :: Int -> Pixmap -> (RunLength Bit -> a) -> a
         withRow n greymap f = f . runLength . elems $ posterized
             where posterized = threshold 0.4 . fmap luminance . row n $ greymap

      The ``withRow`` function takes a row, converts it to monochrome,
      then calls another function on the run length encoded row data. To
      get the row data, it calls ``row``.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
         row :: (Ix a, Ix b) => b -> Array (a,b) c -> Array a c
         row j a = ixmap (l,u) project a
             where project i = (i,j)
                   ((l,_), (u,_)) = bounds a

      This function takes a bit of explaining. Whereas ``fmap``
      transforms the *values* in an array, ``ixmap`` transforms the
      *indices* of an array. It's a very powerful function that lets us
      “slice” an array however we please.

      The first argument to ``ixmap`` is the bounds of the new array.
      These bounds can be of a different dimension than the source
      array. In ``row``, for example, we're extracting a one-dimensional
      array from a two-dimensional array.

      The second argument is a *projection* function. This takes an
      index from the new array and returns an index into the source
      array. The value at that projected index then becomes the value in
      the new array at the original index. For example, if we pass ``2``
      into the projection function and it returns ``(2,2)``, the element
      at index ``2`` of the new array will be taken from element
      ``(2,2)`` of the source array.

                  :class: title

      Our ``candidateDigits`` function gives an empty result unless we
      call it at the beginning of a barcode sequence. We can easily scan
      across a row until we get a match as follows.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
         findMatch :: [(Run, Bit)] -> Maybe [[Digit]]
         findMatch = listToMaybe
                   . filter (not . null)
                   . map (solve . candidateDigits)
                   . tails

      Here, we're taking advantage of lazy evaluation. The call to
      ``map`` over ``tails`` will only be evaluated until it results in
      a non-empty list.

      Next, we choose a row from an image, and try to find a barcode in
      it.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
         findEAN13 :: Pixmap -> Maybe [Digit]
         findEAN13 pixmap = withRow center pixmap (fmap head . findMatch)
           where (_, (maxX, _)) = bounds pixmap
                 center = (maxX + 1) `div` 2

      Finally, here's a very simple wrapper that prints barcodes from
      whatever netpbm image files we pass into our program on the
      command line.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch12/Barcode.hs
         main :: IO ()
         main = do
           args <- getArgs
           forM_ args $ \arg -> do
             e <- parse parseRawPPM <$> L.readFile arg
             case e of
               Left err ->     print $ "error: " ++ err
               Right pixmap -> print $ findEAN13 pixmap

      Notice that, of the more than thirty functions we've defined in
      this chapter, ``main`` is the only one that lives in IO.

                  :class: title

      You may have noticed that many of the functions we presented in
      this chapter were short functions at the top level of the source
      file. This is no accident. As we mentioned earlier, when we
      started on this chapter, we didn't know what form our solution was
      going to take.

      Quite often, then, we had to explore a problem space in order to
      figure out where we were going. To do this, we spent a lot of time
      fiddling about in **ghci**, performing tiny experiments on
      individual functions. This kind of exploration requires that a
      function be declared at the top level of a source file, as
      otherwise **ghci** won't be able to see it.

      Once we were satisfied that individual functions were behaving
      themselves, we started to glue them together, again investigating
      the consequences in **ghci**. This is where our devotion to
      writing type signatures paid back, as we immediately discovered
      when a particular composition of functions couldn't possibly work.

      At the end of this process, we were left with a large number of
      very small top-level functions, each with a type signature. This
      isn't the most compact representation possible; we could have
      hoisted many of those functions into ``let`` or ``where`` blocks
      when we were done with them. However, we find that the added
      vertical space, small function bodies, and type signatures make
      the code far more readable, so we generally avoided “golfing”
      functions after we wrote
      them\ :sup:`[`\ `30 <#ftn.id634348>`__\ :sup:`]`.

      Working in a language with strong, static typing does not at all
      interfere with incrementally and fluidly developing a solution to
      a problem. We find the turnaround between writing a function and
      getting useful feedback from **ghci** to be very rapid; it greatly
      assists us in writing good code quickly.

               .. rubric:: Association Lists
                  :name: data.assoc
                  :class: title

      Often, we have to deal with data that is unordered but is indexed
      by a key. For instance, a Unix administrator might have a list of
      numeric UIDs (user IDs) and the textual usernames that they
      correspond to. The value of this list lies in being able to look
      up a textual username for a given UID, not in the order of the
      data. In other words, the UID is a key into a database.

      In Haskell, there are several ways to handle data that is
      structured in this way. The two most common are association lists
      and the Map type provided by ``Data.Map`` module. Association
      lists are handy because they are simple. They are standard Haskell
      lists, so all the familiar list functions work with association
      lists. However, for large data sets, Map will have a considerable
      performance advantage over association lists. We'll use both in
      this chapter.

      An association list is just a normal list containing (key, value)
      tuples. The type of a list of mappings from UID to username might
      be ``[(Integer, String)]``. We could use just about any
      type\ :sup:`[`\ `31 <#ftn.id634459>`__\ :sup:`]`\ for both the key
      and the value.

      We can build association lists just we do any other list. Haskell
      comes with one built-in function called ``Data.List.lookup`` to
      look up data in an association list. Its type is
      ``Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b``. Can you guess how it works
      from that type? Let's take a look in **ghci**.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> let al = [(1, "one"), (2, "two"), (3, "three"), (4, "four")]
         ghci> lookup 1 al
         Just "one"
         ghci> lookup 5 al
         Nothing

      The ``lookup`` function is really simple. Here's one way we could
      write it:

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch13/lookup.hs
         myLookup :: Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b
         myLookup _ [] = Nothing
         myLookup key ((thiskey,thisval):rest) =
             if key == thiskey
                then Just thisval
                else myLookup key rest

      This function returns ``Nothing`` if passed the empty list.
      Otherwise, it compares the key with the key we're looking for. If
      a match is found, the corresponding value is returned. Otherwise,
      it searches the rest of the list.

      Let's take a look at a more complex example of association lists.
      On Unix/Linux machines, there is a file called ``/etc/passwd``
      that stores usernames, UIDs, home directories, and various other
      data. We will write a program that parses such a file, creates an
      association list, and lets the user look up a username by giving a
      UID.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch13/passwd-al.hs
         import Data.List
         import System.IO
         import Control.Monad(when)
         import System.Exit
         import System.Environment(getArgs)

         main = do
             -- Load the command-line arguments
             args <- getArgs

             -- If we don't have the right amount of args, give an error and abort
             when (length args /= 2) $ do
                 putStrLn "Syntax: passwd-al filename uid"
                 exitFailure

             -- Read the file lazily
             content <- readFile (args !! 0)

             -- Compute the username in pure code
             let username = findByUID content (read (args !! 1))

             -- Display the result
             case username of 
                  Just x -> putStrLn x
                  Nothing -> putStrLn "Could not find that UID"

         -- Given the entire input and a UID, see if we can find a username.
         findByUID :: String -> Integer -> Maybe String
         findByUID content uid =
             let al = map parseline . lines $ content
                 in lookup uid al

         -- Convert a colon-separated line into fields
         parseline :: String -> (Integer, String)
         parseline input =
             let fields = split ':' input
                 in (read (fields !! 2), fields !! 0)

         {- | Takes a delimiter and a list.  Break up the list based on the
         -  delimiter. -}
         split :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [[a]]

         -- If the input is empty, the result is a list of empty lists.
         split _ [] = [[]]
         split delim str =
             let -- Find the part of the list before delim and put it in "before".
                 -- The rest of the list, including the leading delim, goes
                 -- in "remainder".
                 (before, remainder) = span (/= delim) str
                 in
                 before : case remainder of
                               [] -> []
                               x -> -- If there is more data to process,
                                    -- call split recursively to process it
                                    split delim (tail x)

      Let's look at this program. The heart of it is ``findByUID``,
      which is a simple function that parses the input one line at a
      time, then calls ``lookup`` over the result. The remaining program
      is concerned with parsing the input. The input file looks like
      this:

      .. code:: programlisting

         root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
         daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh

         jgoerzen:x:1000:1000:John Goerzen,,,:/home/jgoerzen:/bin/bash
             

      Its fields are separated by colons, and include a username,
      numeric user ID, numeric group ID, full name, home directory, and
      shell. No field may contain an internal colon.

                  :class: title

      The ``Data.Map`` module provides a Map type with behavior that is
      similar to association lists, but has much better performance.

      Maps give us the same capabilities as hash tables do in other
      languages. Internally, a map is implemented as a balanced binary
      tree. Compared to a hash table, this is a much more efficient
      representation in a language with immutable data. This is the most
      visible example of how deeply pure functional programming affects
      how we write code: we choose data structures and algorithms that
      we can express cleanly and that perform efficiently, but our
      choices for specific tasks are often different their counterparts
      in imperative languages.

      Some functions in the ``Data.Map`` module have the same names as
      those in the Prelude. Therefore, we will import it with
      ``import qualified Data.Map as Map`` and use ``Map.``\ *``name``*
      to refer to names in that module. Let's start our tour of
      ``Data.Map`` by taking a look at some ways to build a map.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch13/buildmap.hs
         import qualified Data.Map as Map

         -- Functions to generate a Map that represents an association list
         -- as a map

         al = [(1, "one"), (2, "two"), (3, "three"), (4, "four")]

         {- | Create a map representation of 'al' by converting the association
         -  list using Map.fromList -}
         mapFromAL =
             Map.fromList al

         {- | Create a map representation of 'al' by doing a fold -}
         mapFold =
             foldl (\map (k, v) -> Map.insert k v map) Map.empty al

         {- | Manually create a map with the elements of 'al' in it -}
         mapManual =
             Map.insert 2 "two" . 
             Map.insert 4 "four" .
             Map.insert 1 "one" .
             Map.insert 3 "three" $ Map.empty

      Functions like ``Map.insert`` work in the usual Haskell way: they
      return a copy of the input data, with the requested change
      applied. This is quite handy with maps. It means that you can use
      ``foldl`` to build up a map as in the ``mapFold`` example. Or, you
      can chain together calls to ``Map.insert`` as in the ``mapManual``
      example. Let's use **ghci** to verify that all of these maps are
      as expected:

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :l buildmap.hs
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( buildmap.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: Main.

      Notice that the output from ``mapManual`` differs from the order
      of the list we used to construct the map. Maps do not guarantee
      that they will preserve the original ordering.

      Maps operate similarly in concept to association lists. The
      ``Data.Map`` module provides functions for adding and removing
      data from maps. It also lets us filter them, modify them, fold
      over them, and convert to and from association lists. The library
      documentation for this module is good, so instead of going into
      detail on each function, we will present an example that ties
      together many of the concepts we've discussed in this chapter.

                  :name: data.funcs
                  :class: title

      Part of Haskell's power is the ease with which it lets us create
      and manipulate functions. Let's take a look at a record that
      stores a function as one of its fields:

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch13/funcrecs.hs
         {- | Our usual CustomColor type to play with -}
         data CustomColor =
           CustomColor {red :: Int,
                        green :: Int,
                        blue :: Int}
           deriving (Eq, Show, Read)

         {- | A new type that stores a name and a function.

         The function takes an Int, applies some computation to it, and returns
         an Int along with a CustomColor -}
         data FuncRec =
             FuncRec {name :: String,
                      colorCalc :: Int -> (CustomColor, Int)}

         plus5func color x = (color, x + 5)

         purple = CustomColor 255 0 255

         plus5 = FuncRec {name = "plus5", colorCalc = plus5func purple}
         always0 = FuncRec {name = "always0", colorCalc = \_ -> (purple, 0)}

      Notice the type of the ``colorCalc`` field: it's a function. It
      takes an ``Int`` and returns a tuple of ``(CustomColor, Int)``. We
      create two ``FuncRec`` records: ``plus5`` and ``always0``. Notice
      that the ``colorCalc`` for both of them will always return the
      color purple. ``FuncRec`` itself has no field to store the color
      in, yet that value somehow becomes part of the function itself.
      This is called a *closure*. Let's play with this a bit:

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :l funcrecs.hs
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( funcrecs.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: Main.
         ghci> :t plus5
         plus5 :: FuncRec
         ghci> name plus5
         "plus5"
         ghci> :t colorCalc plus5
         colorCalc plus5 :: Int -> (CustomColor, Int)
         ghci> (colorCalc plus5) 7
         (CustomColor {red = 255, green = 0, blue = 255},12)
         ghci> :t colorCalc always0
         colorCalc always0 :: Int -> (CustomColor, Int)
         ghci> (colorCalc always0) 7
         (CustomColor {red = 255, green = 0, blue = 255},0)

      That worked well enough, but you might wonder how to do something
      more advanced, such as making a piece of data available in
      multiple places. A type construction function can be helpful.
      Here's an example:

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch13/funcrecs2.hs
         data FuncRec =
             FuncRec {name :: String,
                      calc :: Int -> Int,
                      namedCalc :: Int -> (String, Int)}

         mkFuncRec :: String -> (Int -> Int) -> FuncRec
         mkFuncRec name calcfunc =
             FuncRec {name = name,
                      calc = calcfunc,
                      namedCalc = \x -> (name, calcfunc x)}

         plus5 = mkFuncRec "plus5" (+ 5)
         always0 = mkFuncRec "always0" (\_ -> 0)

      Here we have a function called ``mkFuncRec`` that takes a
      ``String`` and another function as parameters, and returns a new
      ``FuncRec`` record. Notice how both parameters to ``mkFuncRec``
      are used in multiple places. Let's try it out:

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :l funcrecs2.hs
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( funcrecs2.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: Main.
         ghci> :t plus5
         plus5 :: FuncRec
         ghci> name plus5
         "plus5"
         ghci> (calc plus5) 5
         10
         ghci> (namedCalc plus5) 5
         ("plus5",10)
         ghci> let plus5a = plus5 {name = "PLUS5A"}
         ghci> name plus5a
         "PLUS5A"
         ghci> (namedCalc plus5a) 5
         ("plus5",10)

      Notice the creation of ``plus5a``. We changed the ``name`` field,
      but not the ``namedCalc`` field. That's why ``name`` has the new
      name, but ``namedCalc`` still returns the name that was passed to
      ``mkFuncRec``; it doesn't change unless we explicitly change it.

                    \4   Quit\n\n\
                    \Your selection: "

      This example maintains two maps: one from username to
      ``PasswdEntry`` and another one from UID to ``PasswdEntry``.
      Database developers may find it convenient to think of this as
      having two different indices into the data to speed searching on
      different fields.

      Take a look at the ``Show`` and ``Read`` instances for
      ``PasswdEntry``. There is already a standard format for rendering
      data of this type as a string: the colon-separated version already
      used by the system. So our ``Show`` function displays a
      ``PasswdEntry`` in the format, and ``Read`` parses that format.

                  :name: data.num
                  :class: title

      We've told you how powerful and expressive Haskell's type system
      is. We've shown you a lot of ways to use that power. Here's a
      chance to really see that in action.

      Back in `the section called “Numeric
      Types” <using-typeclasses.html#typeclasses.wellknown.numeric>`__,
      we showed the numeric typeclasses that come with Haskell. Let's
      see what we can do by defining new types and utilizing the numeric
      typeclasses to integrate them with basic mathematics in Haskell.

      Let's start by thinking through what we'd like to see out of
      **ghci** when we interact with our new types. To start with, it
      might be nice to render numeric expressions as strings, making
      sure to indicate proper precedence. Perhaps we could create a
      function called ``prettyShow`` to do that. We'll show you how to
      write it in a bit, but first we'll look at how we might use it.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :l num.hs
         [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( num.hs, interpreted )
         Ok, modules loaded: Main.
         ghci> 5 + 1 * 3
         8
         ghci> prettyShow $ 5 + 1 * 3
         "5+(1*3)"
         ghci> prettyShow $ 5 * 1 + 3
         "(5*1)+3"

      That looks nice, but it wasn't all that smart. We could easily
      simplify out the ``1 *`` part of the expression. How about a
      function to do some very basic simplification?

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> prettyShow $ simplify $ 5 + 1 * 3
         "5+3"

      How about converting a numeric expression to Reverse Polish
      Notation (RPN)? RPN is a postfix notation that never requires
      parentheses, and is commonly found on HP calculators. RPN is a
      stack-based notation. We push numbers onto the stack, and when we
      enter operations, they pop the most recent numbers off the stack
      and place the result on the stack.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> rpnShow $ 5 + 1 * 3
         "5 1 3 * +"
         ghci> rpnShow $ simplify $ 5 + 1 * 3
         "5 3 +"

      Maybe it would be nice to be able to represent simple expressions
      with symbols for the unknowns.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> prettyShow $ 5 + (Symbol "x") * 3
         "5+(x*3)"

      It's often important to track units of measure when working with
      numbers. For instance, when you see the number 5, does it mean 5
      meters, 5 feet, or 5 bytes? Of course, if you divide 5 meters by 2
      seconds, the system ought to be able to figure out the appropriate
      units. Moreover, it should stop you from adding 2 seconds to 5
      meters.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> 5 / 2
         2.5
         ghci> (units 5 "m") / (units 2 "s")
         2.5_m/s
         ghci> (units 5 "m") + (units 2 "s")
         *** Exception: Mis-matched units in add
         ghci> (units 5 "m") + (units 2 "m")
         7_m
         ghci> (units 5 "m") / 2
         2.5_m
         ghci> 10 * (units 5 "m") / (units 2 "s")
         25.0_m/s

      If we define an expression or a function that is valid for all
      numbers, we should be able to calculate the result, or render the
      expression. For instance, if we define ``test`` to have type
      ``Num a => a``, and say ``test = 2 * 5 + 3``, then we ought to be
      able to do this:

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> test
         13
         ghci> rpnShow test
         "2 5 * 3 +"
         ghci> prettyShow test
         "(2*5)+3"
         ghci> test + 5
         18
         ghci> prettyShow (test + 5)
         "((2*5)+3)+5"
         ghci> rpnShow (test + 5)
         "2 5 * 3 + 5 +"

      Since we have units, we should be able to handle some basic
      trigonometry as well. Many of these operations operate on angles.
      Let's make sure that we can handle both degrees and radians.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> sin (pi / 2)
         1.0
         ghci> sin (units (pi / 2) "rad")
         1.0_1.0
         ghci> sin (units 90 "deg")
         1.0_1.0
         ghci> (units 50 "m") * sin (units 90 "deg")
         50.0_m

      Finally, we ought to be able to put all this together and combine

      Everything you've just seen is possible with Haskell types and
      classes. In fact, you've been reading a real **ghci** session
      demonstrating ``num.hs``, which you'll see shortly.

         Let's think about how we would accomplish everything shown
         above. To start with, we might use **ghci** to check the type
         of ``(+)``, which is ``Num a => a -> a -> a``. If we want to
         make possible some custom behavior for the plus operator, then
         we will have to define a new type and make it an instance of
         ``Num``. This type will need to store an expression
         symbolically. We can start by thinking of operations such as
         addition. To store that, we will need to store the operation
         itself, its left side, and its right side. The left and right
         sides could themselves be expressions.

         We can therefore think of an expression as a sort of tree.
         Let's start with some simple types.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/numsimple.hs
            -- The "operators" that we're going to support
            data Op = Plus | Minus | Mul | Div | Pow
                    deriving (Eq, Show)

            {- The core symbolic manipulation type -}
            data SymbolicManip a = 
                      Number a           -- Simple number, such as 5
                    | Arith Op (SymbolicManip a) (SymbolicManip a)
                      deriving (Eq, Show)

            {- SymbolicManip will be an instance of Num.  Define how the Num
            operations are handled over a SymbolicManip.  This will implement things
            like (+) for SymbolicManip. -}
            instance Num a => Num (SymbolicManip a) where
                a + b = Arith Plus a b
                a - b = Arith Minus a b
                a * b = Arith Mul a b
                negate a = Arith Mul (Number (-1)) a
                abs a = error "abs is unimplemented"
                signum _ = error "signum is unimplemented"
                fromInteger i = Number (fromInteger i)

         First, we define a type called ``Op``. This type simply
         represents some of the operations we will support. Next, there
         is a definition for ``SymbolicManip a``. Because of the
         ``Num a`` constraint, any ``Num`` can be used for the ``a``. So
         a full type may be something like ``SymbolicManip Int``.

         A ``SymbolicManip`` type can be a plain number, or it can be
         some arithmetic operation. The type for the ``Arith``
         constructor is recursive, which is perfectly legal in Haskell.
         ``Arith`` creates a ``SymbolicManip`` out of an ``Op`` and two
         other ``SymbolicManip`` items. Let's look at an example:

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> :l numsimple.hs
            [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( numsimple.hs, interpreted )
            Ok, modules loaded: Main.
            ghci> Number 5
            Number 5
            ghci> :t Number 5
            Number 5 :: (Num t) => SymbolicManip t
            ghci> :t Number (5::Int)
            Number (5::Int) :: SymbolicManip Int
            ghci> Number 5 * Number 10
            Arith Mul (Number 5) (Number 10)
            ghci> (5 * 10)::SymbolicManip Int
            Arith Mul (Number 5) (Number 10)
            ghci> (5 * 10 + 2)::SymbolicManip Int
            Arith Plus (Arith Mul (Number 5) (Number 10)) (Number 2)

         You can see that we already have a very basic representation of
         expressions working. Notice how Haskell "converted"
         ``5 * 10 + 2`` into a ``SymbolicManip``, and even handled order
         of evaluation properly. This wasn't really a true conversion;
         ``SymbolicManip`` is a first-class number now. Integer numeric
         literals are internally treated as being wrapped in
         ``fromInteger`` anyway, so ``5`` is just as valid as a
         ``SymbolicManip Int`` as it as an ``Int``.

         From here, then, our task is simple: extend the
         ``SymbolicManip`` type to be able to represent all the
         operations we will want to perform, implement instances of it
         for the other numeric typeclasses, and implement our own
         instance of ``Show`` for ``SymbolicManip`` that renders this
         tree in a more accessible fashion.

         Here is the completed ``num.hs``, which was used with the
         **ghci** examples at the beginning of this chapter. Let's look
         at this code one piece at a time.

            a symbol, a binary arithmetic operation (such as +), or a unary
            arithmetic operation (such as cos)

            Notice the types of BinaryArith and UnaryArith: it's a recursive
            type.  So, we could represent a (+) over two SymbolicManips. -}
            data SymbolicManip a = 
                      Number a           -- Simple number, such as 5
                    | Symbol String      -- A symbol, such as x
                    | BinaryArith Op (SymbolicManip a) (SymbolicManip a)
                    | UnaryArith String (SymbolicManip a)
                      deriving (Eq)

         In this section of code, we define an ``Op`` that is identical
         to the one we used before. We also define ``SymbolicManip``,
         which is similar to what we used before. In this version, we
         now support unary arithmetic operations (those which take only
         one parameter) such as ``abs`` or ``cos``. Next we define our
         instance of ``Num``.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/num.hs
            {- SymbolicManip will be an instance of Num.  Define how the Num
            operations are handled over a SymbolicManip.  This will implement things
            like (+) for SymbolicManip. -}
            instance Num a => Num (SymbolicManip a) where
                a + b = BinaryArith Plus a b
                a - b = BinaryArith Minus a b
                a * b = BinaryArith Mul a b
                negate a = BinaryArith Mul (Number (-1)) a
                abs a = UnaryArith "abs" a
                signum _ = error "signum is unimplemented"
                fromInteger i = Number (fromInteger i)

         This is pretty straightforward and also similar to our earlier
         code. Note that earlier we weren't able to properly support
         ``abs``, but now with the ``UnaryArith`` constructor, we can.
         Next we define some more instances.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/num.hs
            {- Make SymbolicManip an instance of Fractional -}
            instance (Fractional a) => Fractional (SymbolicManip a) where

                recip a = BinaryArith Div (Number 1) a
                fromRational r = Number (fromRational r)

            {- Make SymbolicManip an instance of Floating -}
            instance (Floating a) => Floating (SymbolicManip a) where
                pi = Symbol "pi"

                log a = UnaryArith "log" a
                sqrt a = UnaryArith "sqrt" a
                a ** b = BinaryArith Pow a b
                sin a = UnaryArith "sin" a
                cos a = UnaryArith "cos" a
                tan a = UnaryArith "tan" a
                asin a = UnaryArith "asin" a
                acos a = UnaryArith "acos" a
                atan a = UnaryArith "atan" a

                acosh a = UnaryArith "acosh" a
                atanh a = UnaryArith "atanh" a

         This section of code defines some fairly straightforward
         instances of ``Fractional`` and ``Floating``. Now let's work on
         converting our expressions to strings for display.

         .. code:: programlisting

            {- Show a SymbolicManip as a String, using conventional
            algebraic notation -}

            prettyShow (Number x) = show x
            prettyShow (Symbol x) = x

                let pa = simpleParen a
                    pb = simpleParen b

                    in pa ++ pop ++ pb

                opstr ++ "(" ++ show a ++ ")"

            op2str Minus = "-"
            op2str Mul = "*"
            op2str Div = "/"
            op2str Pow = "**"

            {- Add parenthesis where needed.  This function is fairly conservative
            and will add parenthesis when not needed in some cases.
                
            Haskell will have already figured out precedence for us while building
            up the SymbolicManip. -}
            simpleParen :: (Show a, Num a) => SymbolicManip a -> String
            simpleParen (Number x) = prettyShow (Number x)
            simpleParen (Symbol x) = prettyShow (Symbol x)
            simpleParen x@(BinaryArith _ _ _) = "(" ++ prettyShow x ++ ")"
            simpleParen x@(UnaryArith _ _) = prettyShow x

            {- Showing a SymbolicManip calls the prettyShow function on it -}
            instance (Show a, Num a) => Show (SymbolicManip a) where
                show a = prettyShow a

         We start by defining a function ``prettyShow``. It renders an
         expression using conventional style. The algorithm is fairly
         simple: bare numbers and symbols are rendered bare; binary
         arithmetic is rendered with the two sides plus the operator in
         the middle, and of course we handle the unary operators as
         well. ``op2str`` simply converts an ``Op`` to a ``String``. In
         ``simpleParen``, we have a quite conservative algorithm that
         adds parenthesis to keep precedence clear in the result.
         Finally, we make ``SymbolicManip`` an instance of ``Show`` and
         use ``prettyShow`` to accomplish that. Now let's implement an
         algorithm that converts an expression to s string in RPN
         format.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/num.hs
            {- Show a SymbolicManip using RPN.  HP calculator users may
            find this familiar. -}
            rpnShow :: (Show a, Num a) => SymbolicManip a -> String
            rpnShow i =
                let toList (Number x) = [show x]
                    toList (Symbol x) = [x]
                    toList (BinaryArith op a b) = toList a ++ toList b ++
                       [op2str op]
                    toList (UnaryArith op a) = toList a ++ [op]
                    join :: [a] -> [[a]] -> [a]
                    join delim l = concat (intersperse delim l)
                in join " " (toList i)

         Fans of RPN will note how much simpler this algorithm is
         compared to the algorithm to render with conventional notation.
         In particular, we didn't have to worry about where to add
         parenthesis, because RPN can, by definition, only be evaluated
         one way. Next, let's see how we might implement a function to
         do some rudimentary simplification on expressions.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/num.hs
            {- Perform some basic algebraic simplifications on a SymbolicManip. -}
            simplify :: (Num a) => SymbolicManip a -> SymbolicManip a
            simplify (BinaryArith op ia ib) = 
                let sa = simplify ia
                    sb = simplify ib
                    in
                    case (op, sa, sb) of 
                            (Mul, Number 1, b) -> b
                            (Mul, a, Number 1) -> a
                            (Mul, Number 0, b) -> Number 0
                            (Mul, a, Number 0) -> Number 0
                            (Div, a, Number 1) -> a
                            (Plus, a, Number 0) -> a
                            (Plus, Number 0, b) -> b
                            (Minus, a, Number 0) -> a
                            _ -> BinaryArith op sa sb
            simplify (UnaryArith op a) = UnaryArith op (simplify a)
            simplify x = x

         This function is pretty simple. For certain binary arithmetic
         operations -- for instance, multiplying any value by 1 -- we
         are able to easily simplify the situation. We begin by
         obtaining simplified versions of both sides of the calculation
         (this is where recursion hits) and then simplify the result. We
         have little to do with unary operators, so we just simplify the
         expression they act upon.

         From here on, we will add support for units of measure to our
         established library. This will let us represent quantities such
         as "5 meters". We start, as before, by defining a type.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/num.hs
            {- New data type: Units.  A Units type contains a number
            and a SymbolicManip, which represents the units of measure.
            A simple label would be something like (Symbol "m") -}
            data Num a => Units a = Units a (SymbolicManip a)
                       deriving (Eq)

         So, a ``Units`` contains a number and a label. The label is
         itself a ``SymbolicManip``. Next, it will probably come as no
         surprise to see an instance of ``Num`` for ``Units``.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/num.hs
            {- Implement Units for Num.  We don't know how to convert between
            arbitrary units, so we generate an error if we try to add numbers with
            different units.  For multiplication, generate the appropriate
            new units. -}
            instance (Num a) => Num (Units a) where
                (Units xa ua) + (Units xb ub) 
                    | ua == ub = Units (xa + xb) ua
                    | otherwise = error "Mis-matched units in add or subtract"
                (Units xa ua) - (Units xb ub) = (Units xa ua) + (Units (xb * (-1)) ub)
                (Units xa ua) * (Units xb ub) = Units (xa * xb) (ua * ub)
                negate (Units xa ua) = Units (negate xa) ua
                abs (Units xa ua) = Units (abs xa) ua
                signum (Units xa _) = Units (signum xa) (Number 1)
                fromInteger i = Units (fromInteger i) (Number 1)

         Now it may become clear why we use a ``SymbolicManip`` instead
         of a ``String`` to store the unit of measure. As calculations
         such as multiplication occur, the unit of measure also changes.
         For instance, if we multiply 5 meters by 2 meters, we obtain 10
         square meters. We force the units for addition to match, and
         implement subtraction in terms of addition. Let's look at more
         typeclass instances for ``Units``.

                recip a = 1 / a

         We didn't supply implementations for every function, but quite
         a few have been defined. Now let's define a few utility
         functions for working with units.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/num.hs
            {- A simple function that takes a number and a String and returns an
            appropriate Units type to represent the number and its unit of measure -}
            units :: (Num z) => z -> String -> Units z
            units a b = Units a (Symbol b)

            {- Extract the number only out of a Units type -}
            dropUnits :: (Num z) => Units z -> z
            dropUnits (Units x _) = x
                                                                
            {- Utilities for the Unit implementation -}
            deg2rad x = 2 * pi * x / 360
            rad2deg x = 360 * x / (2 * pi)

         First, we have ``units``, which makes it easy to craft simple
         expressions. It's faster to say ``units 5 "m"`` than
         ``Units 5 (Symbol "m")``. We also have a corresponding
         ``dropUnits``, which discards the unit of measure and returns
         the embedded bare ``Num``. Finally, we define some functions
         for use by our earlier instances to convert between degrees and
         radians. Next, we just define a ``Show`` instance for
         ``Units``.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/num.hs
            {- Showing units: we show the numeric component, an underscore,
            then the prettyShow version of the simplified units -}
            instance (Show a, Num a) => Show (Units a) where
                show (Units xa ua) = show xa ++ "_" ++ prettyShow (simplify ua)

         That was simple. For one last piece, we define a variable
         ``test`` to experiment with.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/num.hs
            test :: (Num a) => a
            test = 2 * 5 + 3

         So, looking back over all this code, we have done what we set
         out to accomplish: implemented more instances for
         ``SymbolicManip``. We have also introduced another type called
         ``Units`` which stores a number and a unit of measure. We
         implement several show-like functions which render the
         ``SymbolicManip`` or ``Units`` in different ways.

         There is one other point that this example drives home. Every
         language -- even those with objects and overloading -- has some
         parts of the language that are special in some way. In Haskell,
         the "special" bits are extremely small. We have just developed
         a new representation for something as fundamental as a number,
         and it has been really quite easy. Our new type is a
         first-class type, and the compiler knows what functions to use
         with it at compile time. Haskell takes code reuse and
         interchangability to the extreme. It is easy to make code
         generic and work on things of many different types. It's also
         easy to make up new types and make them automatically be
         first-class features of the system.

         Remember our **ghci** examples at the beginning of the chapter?
         All of them were made with the code in this example. You might
         want to try them out for yourself and see how they work.

                  :name: data.dlist
                  :class: title

      In an imperative language, appending two lists is cheap and easy.
      Here's a simple C structure in which we maintain a pointer to the
      head and tail of a list.

      .. code:: programlisting

         struct list {
             struct node *head, *tail;
         };

      When we have one list, and want to append another list onto its
      end, we modify the last node of the existing list to point to its
      ``head`` node, then update its ``tail`` pointer to point to its
      ``tail`` node.

      Obviously, this approach is off limits to us in Haskell if we want
      to stay pure. Since pure data is immutable, we can't go around
      modifying lists in place. Haskell's ``(++)`` operator appends two
      lists by creating a new one.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch13/Append.hs
         (++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
         (x:xs) ++ ys = x : xs ++ ys
         _      ++ ys = ys

      From inspecting the code, we can see that the cost of creating a
      new list depends on the length of the initial
      list\ :sup:`[`\ `32 <#ftn.id637094>`__\ :sup:`]` .

      We often need to append lists over and over, to construct one big
      list. For instance, we might be generating the contents of a web
      page as a String, emitting a chunk at a time as we traverse some
      data structure. Each time we have a chunk of markup to add to the
      page, we will naturally want to append it onto the end of our
      existing String.

      If a single append has a cost proportional to the length of the
      initial list, and each repeated append makes the initial list
      longer, we end up in an unhappy situation: the cost of all of the
      repeated appends is proportional to the *square* of the length of
      the final list.

      To understand this, let's dig in a little. The ``(++)`` operator
      is right associative.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :info (++)
         (++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]     -- Defined in GHC.Base
         infixr 5 ++

      This means that a Haskell implementation will evaluate the
      expression ``"a" ++ "b" ++ "c"`` as if we had put parentheses
      around it as follows: ``"a" ++ ("b" ++ "c")``. This makes good
      performance sense, because it keeps the left operand as short as
      possible.

      When we repeatedly append onto the end of a list, we defeat this
      associativity. Let's say we start with the list ``"a"`` and append
      ``"b"``, and save the result as our new list. If we later append
      ``"c"`` onto this new list, our left operand is now ``"ab"``. In
      this scheme, every time we append, our left operand gets longer.

      Meanwhile, the imperative programmers are cackling with glee,
      because the cost of *their* repeated appends only depends on the
      number of them that they perform. They have linear performance;
      ours is quadratic.

      When something as common as repeated appending of lists imposes
      such a performance penalty, it's time to look at the problem from
      another angle.

      The expression ``("a"++)`` is a section, a partially applied
      function. What is its type?

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :type ("a" ++)
         ("a" ++) :: [Char] -> [Char]

      Since this is a function, we can use the ``(.)`` operator to
      compose it with another section, let's say ``("b"++)``.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> :type ("a" ++) . ("b" ++)
         ("a" ++) . ("b" ++) :: [Char] -> [Char]

      Our new function has the same type. What happens if we stop
      composing functions, and instead provide a String to the function
      we've created?

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> let f = ("a" ++) . ("b" ++)
         ghci> f []
         "ab"

      We've appended the strings! We're using these partially applied
      functions to store data, which we can retrieve by providing an
      empty list. Each partial application of ``(++)`` and ``(.)``
      *represents* an append, but it doesn't actually *perform* the
      append.

      There are two very interesting things about this approach. The
      first is that the cost of a partial application is constant, so
      the cost of many partial applications is linear. The second is
      that when we finally provide a ``[]`` value to unlock the final
      list from its chain of partial applications, application proceeds
      from right to left. This keeps the left operand of ``(++)`` small,
      and so the overall cost of all of these appends is linear, not
      quadratic.

      By choosing an unfamiliar data representation, we've avoided a
      nasty performance quagmire, while gaining a new perspective on the
      usefulness of treating functions as data. By the way, this is an
      old trick, and it's usually called a *difference list*.

      We're not yet finished, though. As appealing as difference lists
      are in theory, ours won't be very pleasant in practice if we leave
      all the plumbing of ``(++)``, ``(.)``, and partial application
      exposed. We need to turn this mess into something pleasant to work
      with.

                     :name: id637423
                     :class: title

         Our first step is to use a ``newtype`` declaration to hide the
         underlying type from our users. We'll create a new type, and
         call it DList. Like a regular list, it will be a parameterised
         type.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/DList.hs
            newtype DList a = DL {
                  unDL :: [a] -> [a]
                }

         The ``unDL`` function is our deconstructor, which removes the
         ``DL`` constructor. When we go back and decide what we want to
         export from our module, we will omit our data constructor and
         deconstruction function, so the DList type will be completely
         opaque to our users. They'll only be able to work with the type
         using the other functions we export.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/DList.hs
            append :: DList a -> DList a -> DList a
            append xs ys = DL (unDL xs . unDL ys)

         Our ``append`` function may seem a little complicated, but it's
         just performing some book-keeping around the same use of the
         ``(.)`` operator that we demonstrated earlier. To compose our
         functions, we must first unwrap them from their DL constructor,
         hence the uses of ``unDL``. We then re-wrap the resulting
         function with the DL constructor so that it will have the right
         type.

         Here's another way of writing the same function, in which we
         perform the unwrapping of ``xs`` and ``ys`` via pattern
         matching.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/DList.hs
            append' :: DList a -> DList a -> DList a
            append' (DL xs) (DL ys) = DL (xs . ys)

         Our DList type won't be much use if we can't convert back and
         forth between the DList representation and a regular list.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/DList.hs
            fromList :: [a] -> DList a
            fromList xs = DL (xs ++)

            toList :: DList a -> [a]
            toList (DL xs) = xs []

         Once again, compared to the original versions of these
         functions that we wrote, all we're doing is a little
         book-keeping to hide the plumbing.

         If we want to make DList useful as a substitute for regular
         lists, we need to provide some more of the common list
         operations.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/DList.hs
            empty :: DList a
            empty = DL id

            -- equivalent of the list type's (:) operator
            cons :: a -> DList a -> DList a
            cons x (DL xs) = DL ((x:) . xs)
            infixr `cons`

            dfoldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> DList a -> b
            dfoldr f z xs = foldr f z (toList xs)

         Although the DList approach makes appends cheap, not all
         list-like operations are easily available. The ``head``
         function has constant cost for lists. Our DList equivalent
         requires that we convert the entire DList to a regular list, so
         it is much more expensive than its list counterpart: its cost
         is linear in the number of appends we have performed to
         construct the DList.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/DList.hs
            safeHead :: DList a -> Maybe a
            safeHead xs = case toList xs of
                            (y:_) -> Just y
                            _ -> Nothing

         To support an equivalent of ``map``, we can make our DList type
         a functor.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/DList.hs
            dmap :: (a -> b) -> DList a -> DList b
            dmap f = dfoldr go empty
                where go x xs = cons (f x) xs

            instance Functor DList where
                fmap = dmap

         Once we decide that we have written enough equivalents of list
         functions, we go back to the top of our source file, and add a
         module header.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/DList.hs
            module DList
                (
                  DList
                , fromList
                , toList
                , empty
                , append
                , cons
                , dfoldr
                ) where

                     :class: title

         In abstract algebra, there exists a simple abstract structure
         called a *monoid*. Many mathematical objects are monoids,
         because the “bar to entry” is very low. In order to be
         considered a monoid, an object must have two properties.

         .. container:: itemizedlist

            -  An associative binary operator. Let's call it ``(*)``:
               the expression ``a * (b * c)`` must give the same result
               as ``(a * b) * c``.

            -  An identity value. If we call this ``e``, it must obey
               two rules: ``a * e == a`` and ``e * a == a``.

         The rules for monoids don't say what the binary operator must
         do, merely that such an operator must exist. Because of this,
         lots of mathematical objects are monoids. If we take addition
         as the binary operator and zero as the identity value, integers
         form a monoid. With multiplication as the binary operator and
         one as the identity value, integers form a different monoid.

         Monoids are ubiquitous in
         Haskell\ :sup:`[`\ `33 <#ftn.id637789>`__\ :sup:`]`. The Monoid
         typeclass is defined in the ``Data.Monoid`` module.

                mappend :: a -> a -> a      -- associative binary operator

         If we take ``(++)`` as the binary operator and ``[]`` as the
         identity, lists form a monoid.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/Monoid.hs
            instance Monoid [a] where
                mempty  = []
                mappend = (++)

         Since lists and DLists are so closely related, it follows that
         our DList type must be a monoid, too.

         .. code:: programlisting

            -- file: ch13/DList.hs
            instance Monoid (DList a) where
                mempty = empty
                mappend = append

         Let's try our the methods of the Monoid type class in **ghci**.

         .. code:: screen

            ghci> "foo" `mappend` "bar"
            "foobar"
            ghci> toList (fromList [1,2] `mappend` fromList [3,4])
            [1,2,3,4]
            ghci> mempty `mappend` [1]
            [1]

                  - Although from a mathematical perspective, integers
                     can be monoids in two different ways, we can't
                     write two differing Monoid instances for Int in
                     Haskell: the compiler would complain about
                     duplicate instances.

                     In those rare cases where we really need several
                     Monoid instances for the same type, we can use some
                     ``newtype`` trickery to create distinct types for
                     the purpose.

                     .. code:: programlisting

                        -- file: ch13/Monoid.hs
                        {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}
                                           
                        newtype AInt = A { unA :: Int }
                            deriving (Show, Eq, Num)

                        -- monoid under addition
                        instance Monoid AInt where
                            mempty = 0
                            mappend = (+)

                        newtype MInt = M { unM :: Int }
                            deriving (Show, Eq, Num)

                        -- monoid under multiplication
                        instance Monoid MInt where
                            mempty = 1
                            mappend = (*)

                     We'll then get different behaviour depending on the
                     type we use.

                     .. code:: screen

                        ghci> 2 `mappend` 5 :: MInt
                        M {unM = 10}
                        ghci> 2 `mappend` 5 :: AInt
                        A {unA = 7}

         We will have more to say about difference lists and their
         monoidal nature in `the section called “The writer monad and
         lists” <programming-with-monads.html#monadcase.writer.dlist>`__.

                  - As with the rules for functors, Haskell cannot check
                     the rules for monoids on our behalf. If we're
                     defining a Monoid instance, we can easily write
                     QuickCheck properties to give us high statistical
                     confidence that our code is following the monoid
                     rules.

               .. rubric:: General purpose sequences

                  :class: title

      Both Haskell's built-in list type and the DList type that we
      defined above have poor performance characteristics under some
      circumstances. The ``Data.Sequence`` module defines a Seq
      container type that gives good performance for a wider variety of
      operations.

      As with other modules, ``Data.Sequence`` is intended to be used
      via qualified import.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch13/DataSequence.hs
         import qualified Data.Sequence as Seq

      We can construct an empty Seq using ``empty``, and a
      single-element container using ``singleton``.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> Seq.empty
         Loading package array-0.1.0.0 ... linking ... done.
         Loading package containers-0.1.0.1 ... linking ... done.
         fromList []
         ghci> Seq.singleton 1
         fromList [1]

      We can create a Seq from a list using ``fromList``.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> let a = Seq.fromList [1,2,3]

      The ``Data.Sequence`` module provides some constructor functions
      in the form of operators. When we perform a qualified import, we
      must qualify the name of an operator in our code, which is ugly.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> 1 Seq.<| Seq.singleton 2
         fromList [1,2]

      If we import the operators explicitly, we can avoid the need to
      qualify them.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch13/DataSequence.hs
         import Data.Sequence ((><), (<|), (|>))

      By removing the qualification from the operator, we improve the
      readability of our code.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> Seq.singleton 1 |> 2
         fromList [1,2]

      A useful way to remember the ``(<|)`` and ``(|>)`` functions is
      that the “arrow” points to the element we're adding to the
      ``Seq``. The element will be added on the side to which the arrow
      points: ``(<|)`` adds on the left, ``(|>)`` on the right.

      Both adding on the left and adding on the right are constant-time
      operations. Appending two ``Seq``\ s is also cheap, occurring in
      time proportional to the logarithm of whichever is shorter. To
      append, we use the ``(><)`` operator.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> let left = Seq.fromList [1,3,3]
         ghci> let right = Seq.fromList [7,1]
         ghci> left >< right
         fromList [1,3,3,7,1]

      If we want to create a list from a Seq, we must use the
      ``Data.Foldable`` module, which is best imported qualified.

      .. code:: programlisting

         -- file: ch13/DataSequence.hs
         import qualified Data.Foldable as Foldable

      This module defines a typeclass, Foldable, which Seq implements.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> Foldable.toList (Seq.fromList [1,2,3])
         [1,2,3]

      If we want to fold over a Seq, we use the fold functions from the
      ``Data.Foldable`` module.

      .. code:: screen

         ghci> Foldable.foldl' (+) 0 (Seq.fromList [1,2,3])
         6

      The ``Data.Sequence`` module provides a number of other useful
      list-like functions. Its documentation is very thorough, giving
      time bounds for each operation.

      If Seq has so many desirable characteristics, why is it not the
      default sequence type? Lists are simpler and have less overhead,
      and so quite often they are good enough for the task at hand. They
      are also well suited to a lazy setting, where Seq does not fare
      well.

         :sup:`[`\ `31 <#id634459>`__\ :sup:`]` The type we use for the
         key must be a member of the ``Eq`` typeclass.

      .. container:: footnote

         :sup:`[`\ `32 <#id637094>`__\ :sup:`]` Non-strict evaluation
         makes the cost calculation more subtle. We only pay for an
         append if we actually use the resulting list. Even then, we
         only pay for as much as we actually use.

      .. container:: footnote

         :sup:`[`\ `33 <#id637789>`__\ :sup:`]` Indeed, monoids are
         ubiquitous throughout programming. The difference is that in
         Haskell, we recognize them, and talk about them.
