== TikZiT

TikZiT is a super simple GUI editor for graphs and string diagrams. Its
native file format is a subset of PGF/TikZ, which means TikZiT files can
be included directly in papers typeset using
https://www.latex-project.org/[LaTeX]. Pre-built versions are available
for systems running Windows, Linux, or macOS. <<install, Packages>>
are available for some Linux distributions, or you can

[[install]]

== Install

*Windows:* Click 'Windows (exe)' above to download a zip file and
extract it to a convenient place (e.g. `+C:\tikzit+`). If you wish to
associate `+.tikz+` files with TikZiT, run the included `+.reg+` file
(optional). Note you may need to edit the `+.reg+` file with a text
editor if you place TikZiT in a different location. You can also install
with https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey] via `+choco install tikzit+`.

*Linux:* If you do not wish to https://github.com/tikzit/tikzit[build
from source], click 'Linux (portable binary)' above to download a
tarball and extract it to a convient place (e.g. your home directory).
Then, launch the application with `+~/tikzit/bin/tikzit+` (assuming you
extracted into your home directory). You may wish to add
`+~/tikzit/bin+` to your PATH and install the application launcher and
file associations by running `+./install-local.sh+` from inside the
TikZiT directory.

There are also packages available for several Linux distributions,
maintained by volunteers in the open source community. Here are the ones
I know about:

* https://ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu] 19.10+, Debian
  https://www.debian.org/releases/buster[testing] /
  https://www.debian.org/releases/sid[unstable]: `+apt install tikzit+`
* https://aur.archlinux.org/[arch linux]: `+pacman -S tikzit+`
* https://nixos.org[NixOS]: `+nix-env -i tikzit+`
* https://getfedora.org/[Fedora] 32: `+yum install tikzit+`

If you are a package maintainer for another distro, get in touch and I
will add instructions here.

*macOS:* Click 'macOS (dmg)' above to download a dmg file. Open this
file and copy `+tikzit.app+` to your Applications folder. Depending on
your system settings, the first time you run TikZiT, you may need to
right-click the `+.app+` file and select `+Open+` from the menu to get
the option to run it. After this, you can run TikZiT like a normal
application. You can also install with https://brew.sh/[HomeBrew] by
running `+brew install tikzit+` in a terminal.

NOTE: The version of TikZiT above requires at least macOS version
10.11 (Yosemite). If you are running an older version of macOS
(10.8-10.10), use
https://github.com/tikzit/tikzit/releases/download/v2.0/tikzit-osx-mountain.dmg[this
version] instead. However, to get the latest version of TikZiT, it is
recommended to update your operating system.

[[quickstart]]

== Quickstart

While TikZiT is easy to use, a few things might not be obvious the first
time you run the program. This guide should get you going as quickly as
possible. *For mac users:* throughout this tutorial, substitute
kbd:[ctrl] = kbd:[command] and kbd:[alt] = kbd:[option], as
usual.

This tutorial will cover basic editing all the way up to building a
LaTeX paper with TikZiT figures in it. Create a new, empty folder
somewhere on your computer (which I will refer to as `+tikzpaper+`
throughout this tutorial). Download tikzit.sty and place it in the
folder. Also, create a new sub-directory called `+figures+`, which we
will use later.

[[editing]]

=== Basic node and edge editing

When you open TikZiT for the first time, you will see something that
looks like this:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/fresh.png[images/screenshots/fresh]

The window is divided into two parts: the main part is the *graph
editor* and the part along the side is the *style palette*. For editing
graphs, there are 3 tools: the *select* tool, the add *node* tool, and
the add *edge* tool. These can be selected quickly by pressing
kbd:[s], kbd:[n], or kbd:[e] while the graph editor is in focus.

Pick the *node* tool and click on the graph a few times to add some
nodes. You will notice these appear in TikZiT as dashed circles with a
small dot in the middle. These are called *invisible nodes*. These will
not appear in the actual typeset output. However, they can be labelled
with pieces of LaTeX code (see below), which will appear in your figure,
or used to attach edges. To add edges, select the *edge* tool and click
and drag from one node to another.

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/add-edge.png[images/screenshots/add-edge]

Pick the *select* tool again. You can select individual nodes or edges
by clicking on them. You can select multiple nodes by dragging a box
around the, and you can select multiple nodes or edges by clicking while
holding down the kbd:[ctrl] key.

Selected nodes can be moved by dragging the mouse, or by pressing
kbd:[ctrl] + arrow keys. Nodes are locked on a grid, so they normally
only move in increments of 0.25 in TikZ coordinates. However, they can
be "nudged" by increments of 0.025 by pressing kbd:[ctrl] +
kbd:[shift] + arrow keys. This is convenient e.g. for centering nodes
between others (5 nudges = 1/2 normal grid cell).

Double-clicking a node gives the ability to set a label, which can
contain LaTeX code:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/node-label.png[images/screenshots/node-label]

Clicking on an edge reveals extra controls for bending the edge. There
are two kinds of bend-modes in TikZiT, the _basic bend_ mode (blue
controls). Dragging either of the control points will cause the edge to
bend to the left or the right:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/basic-bend.png[images/screenshots/basic-bend]

Double-clicking the edge will change it to _bezier bend_ mode (green
controls). Now, each of the control points can be dragged independently:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/bezier-bend.png[images/screenshots/bezier-bend]
[[styles]]

=== Adding styles

Before we can create non-invisible nodes, we will need some styles. To
set up styles, we will first create a new *style file*. In the style
palette, click the image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/document-new.png[images/document-new]
button, go to the `+tikzpaper+` folder, and give the new style file a
name, e.g. `+sample.tikzstyles+`. Now, we can edit the style file by
clicking
image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/text-x-generic_with_pencil.png[images/text-x-generic_with_pencil].
This will open the style editor:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/nostyles.png[images/screenshots/nostyles]

On the left side of the window, there is a list of node styles, followed
by a list of edge styles. Currently, both lists contain only a single
style, called "none". Click the "+" under the list of node styles to add
a new node style, and call it `+red dot+`. Set the fill color to red,
the draw color to black, and the shape to "circle". Then, click "+"
again to add a new style called `+green dot+`. Set the fill color to
green, the draw color to black, and again the shape to "circle".

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/node-styles.png[images/screenshots/node-styles]

NOTE: You can optionally set "in TikZiT" versions of the "draw",
"fill", and "shape" properties. This will make nodes or edges look
different in TikZiT, but have no effect on how they are typeset. This is
useful for visually distinguishing similar styles.

NOTE: Arrowhead expressions containing a dash (e.g. `+-+`, `+->+`,
`+<-+`, `+|->+`, `+<->+`) play a special role in TikZiT. If you change
them manually or use them as style names, you might get some strange
behaviour. To customise the appearance of arrow heads/tails, try adding
a property in the style editor called `+>+` or `+<+` and setting it to
`+stealth+`, `+latex+`, etc. (see the
https://www.bu.edu/math/files/2013/08/tikzpgfmanual.pdf[PGF/TiKZ manual]
for possible arrowhead styles).

You may also wish to add some edge styles by clicking the "+" under the
list of edge styles. If you have many styles, you can also organise them
into categories by setting the "Category" field. When you are done
adding styles, click "Save and Close" to return to the graph editor.

Next is the "Properties" box. Here, you can add properties to the style
which will affect the way a node or edge appears when you typeset it,
but may not affect its appearance in the TikZiT GUI. Properties come in
two flavours: normal properties, which have a name and a value (e.g.
`+line width=1pt+`) and atoms, which only have a name (e.g.
`+ultra thick+`). You can add a normal property by clicking "+" under
the Properties box and an atom by clicking "+a".

Any valid PGF/TikZ is fair game for properties, and there are tons of
ways to customise the appearance of nodes and edges this way (e.g.
making them thick or thin, have crazy shapes, gradients, dashes and
dots, brackets, ...). The best way to find what you need is by looking
in the https://www.bu.edu/math/files/2013/08/tikzpgfmanual.pdf[PGF/TiKZ
manual] or finding examples on
https://texample.net/tikz/examples/[texample.net], the
https://tex.stackexchange.com/[TeX StackExchange], etc.

Now, you will see your new styles in the style palette on the right. To
apply a style to a node (or edge), select the node (or edge) it and
double-click on the style. If you create new nodes and edges with a
certain style selected, they will automatically get that style. To turn
nodes these back into invisible nodes, select them and double-click on
the "none" style.

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/fig.png[images/screenshots/fig]

The above figure was created with 5 invisible nodes (2 inputs, 2
outputs, and 1 for the equals sign), 2 "red dot" nodes, and 2 "green
dot" nodes.

[[typesetting]]

=== Typesetting in LaTeX

We can now save the figure we created and include it directly in a
paper. At the beginning of the tutorial, we created a new folder called
`+tikzpaper+` containing nothing but tikzit.sty a sub-directory called
`+figures+`. In TikZiT, click `+File > Save As...+`, navigate to
`+tikzpaper/figures+`, and save or newly-created figure as
`+fig1.tikz+`.

In a tex(t) editor, create a new file in the `+tikzpaper+` folder called
`+paper.tex+`, and add the following tex:

[source,latex]
----
% paper.tex

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikzit}
\input{sample.tikzstyles}

\begin{document}

A tikz picture as an equation:
\begin{equation}
  \tikzfig{fig1}
\end{equation}

A centered tikz picture:
\ctikzfig{fig1}

\end{document}
----

`+tikzfig.sty+` provides two macros for including `+.tikz+` files:
`+\tikzfig+` and `+\ctikzfig+`. They both take as an argument the name
of a figure (without the `+.tikz+` extension), and will search for that
figure either in the same directory or in a subdirectly called
`+figures+` if it exists. Use `+\tikzfig{FIG}+` to include `+FIG.tikz+`
inline or as part of an equation. Use `+\ctikzfig{FIG}+` to include
`+FIG.tikz+` centered on its own line.

NOTE: Inline TikZ figures align the origin (0,0) to the center of the
text line by default, so it's a good idea to always center TikZ pictures
on the origin (as indicated by the slightly darker grid lines). This can
be tweaked by setting the `+baseline+` or `+yshift+` properties of the
TikZ figure, e.g. `+\begin{tikzpicture}[yshift=-1mm] ...+`.

Use `+pdflatex+` to build `+paper.tex+`, and you should get something
that looks like this:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/pdf.png[images/screenshots/pdf]
[[preview]]

=== Previewing diagrams in TikZiT

Starting with TikZiT 2.1, it is possible to preview your figures
directly in TikZiT by pressing kbd:[ctrl + r].

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/preview.png[images/screenshots/preview]

If you get a green checkmark, the preview was generated successfully.
Otherwise, you can click on the `+Output+` tab in the Preview window to
see what went wrong.

NOTE: TikZiT will try to find `+pdflatex+` automatically by first
searching your system path then common installation locations for TeX.
If it fails, you can set the location of `+pdflatex+` manually in
`+Tools > Preferences+` (Windows/Linux) or `+tikzit > Preferences+`
(macOS).

[[custom]]

==== Adding custom LaTeX code to previews

TikZiT automatically includes tikzit.sty and the active `+*.tikzstyles+`
file when it generates its preview. So, in the example above,
`+sample.tikzstyles+` is included automatically. TikZiT will also search
the same directory for a `+*.tikzdefs+` file with the same name as the
active TikZ style file and include it, if it exists. This file can be
used to include extra packages, define macros, set up custom PGF/TikZ
shapes, etc.

For example, if the active TikZ style file is called
`+sample.tikzstyles+`, create a new file called `+sample.tikzdefs+` in
the same directory as `+sample.tikzstyles+` with the following LaTeX
source:

[source,latex]
----
% sample.tikzdefs

\usepackage{bm}
\newcommand{\param}[1]{\ensuremath{\vec{\bm{#1}}}}
----

This file loads the LaTeX package `+bm+` and defines a new macro
`+\param+`, which can be used TikZ pictures. Back in TikZiT,
double-click a node and set the label to, e.g. `+\param{\alpha}+`, and
hit kbd:[ctrl + r] again. TikZiT will automaticall find
`+sample.tikzdefs+` and include it when it makes the preview:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/preview-macro.png[images/screenshots/preview-macro]

To make this macro available in your paper, as well as the preview, add
`+\input{sample.tikzdefs}+` to the preamble:

[source,latex]
----
% paper.tex

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikzit}
\input{sample.tikzstyles}
\input{sample.tikzdefs}

\begin{document}

% ...
----

NOTE: The use of `+*.tikzstyles+` and `+*.tikzdefs+` files in the
preview replaces the 'Custom Preambles' feature from TikZiT 1.

[[export]]

==== Exporting images

After you generate a preview, you can export the image to a file or the
clipboard by right-clicking on the preview itself and selecting the
appropriate option.

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/export.png[images/screenshots/export]

If you select `+Export Image...+`, the Export Image dialog will be
shown, where you can choose where to save the file, as well as its size
and format. For the format, you can choose to save either PNG, JPG, or
the original PDF file generated by `+pdflatex+`. To obtain SVG output,
it is recommended that you export to PDF, then use a vector graphics
utility such as https://inkscape.org/[Inkscape] to convert to SVG.

[[tips]]

== Tips and Tricks

There are quite a few tricks to getting things to look nice in TikZiT,
usually using a combination of PGF/TikZ hackery and invisible nodes.
Here are a quick tips:

* Right-clicking on blank space with the `+Select+` tool active will
create a node. Right-clicking and dragging between nodes will create
edges.
* To get dashed edges, add the atom "dashed" to an edge style. That is,
select an edge style in the style editor, click "+a" under properties
and change the text "new atom" to "dashed".
* For very large or unusual shapes, sometimes it is easier to just draw
the shape with invisible nodes and bezier edges.
* Hold down kbd:[shift] while moving the mouse wheel or two-finger
scrolling to pan and hold down kbd:[ctrl] to zoom. If your mouse wheel
only scrolls vertically, hold down kbd:[alt + shift] while
moving the wheel to scroll horizontally.
* TikZiT style files can be edited in a text editor. The format is very
simple: just a list of commands of the form
`+\tikzstyle{NAME}=[PROPERTIES]+` (see below). This is convenient for
bulk editing or merging sets of styles. After you edit a style file,
click image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/refresh.png[images/refresh] in the style palette to
refresh the styles.
* You can mix math and TikZ figures on the same line, e.g.
`+\[ \tikzfig{fig-lhs} \ =\ \tikzfig{fig-rhs} \]+`. This is useful if
you have long strings of equalities or re-use figures many times.
* To scale a whole TikZ figure up or down uniformly (including text),
wrap the `+\tikzfig+` command in a `+\scalebox+`. To just scale
coordinates, use the `+scale+`, `+xscale+`, or `+yscale+` TikZ
properties.

The following sections give some more detailed tips.

[[paths]]

=== Paths and filled shapes

Sometimes it is useful to treat a sequence of adjacent edges as one
continuous path. For example, dashes and dots may look strange if they
are applied to adjacent edges that are not part of a single path.
Suppose we create an edge style called `+big dashes+` in the style
editor with the following properties:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/big-dashes-style.png[images/screenshots/big-dashes-style]

Then, we can make a complex shape using blank nodes and edges.
Unfortunately the output doesn't look so good:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/path-bad.png[images/screenshots/path-bad]

Yuck! The super-long dashes happen because TikZ doesn't know these edges
are all part of one path. To fix this, select all of the edges by
holding the `+CTRL+` key and clicking each of them, then go to
`+Edit > Path > Make Path+` or hit `+CTRL+P+`. Now, you should notice
two things. First, if you click on any of the edges, the whole path
becomes selected. Second, the output looks a lot better:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/path-good.png[images/screenshots/path-good]

Perhaps more importantly, you can use edge styles to create *filled
paths*. To do this, go to an edge style in the style editor, uncheck
`+none+` next to fill colour, and set the colour just like you would for
a node:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/edge-fill.png[images/screenshots/edge-fill]

The fill colour is shown in the bottom half of the edge style's icon in
the style palette. If we save the style and preview again, this is the
result:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/path-fill.png[images/screenshots/path-fill]

If you want to split a path back into individual edges, go to
`+Edit > Path > Split Path+` or hit `+CTRL+SHIFT+P+`. Note that if a
fill colour is set, it may still appear under curved edges in the
output, even though it doesn't show up in TikZiT.

[[bend]]

=== Keyboard shortcuts for edge bending

If you select an edge and hold down the kbd:[ctrl] key, you will
notice a `+<>+` symbol appear above one endpoint of the edge. If you use
the left and right arrow keys, this adjust the in-angle of the edge. If
you hold kbd:[ctrl + shift], the other end of the edge will
highlight and you can adjust the out-angle similarly. In either case,
the up and down arrows adjust the looseness of the edge.

[[source]]

=== Editing TikZ source (e.g. node and edge properties)

With a node/edge selected, press kbd:[ctrl + j] to jump to
that line of the TikZ source.

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/tikz-source.png[images/screenshots/tikz-source]

You can edit this by hand, and press kbd:[ctrl + t] to update
the graph editor with the new TikZ code. You need to be a bit careful,
since TikZiT only understands a subset of TikZ, but adding and removing
TikZ properties on nodes or edges works just fine. For this, the
http://www.texample.net/media/pgf/builds/pgfmanualCVS2012-11-04.pdf[PGF/TikZ
manual] is your friend.

If you can't get the TikZ code to parse again, or you decide you didn't
want to make a change after all, you can revert your changes to the TikZ
code by pressing kbd:[ctrl + alt + t].

[[label]]

=== Adding labels next to nodes

Normally labels added by double-clicking a node will appear inside the
node. However, you can add a label next to a node by selecting the node,
pressing kbd:[ctrl + j] and adding a `+label+` property to the
node in the TikZ source. Once you set a label this way, it will be shown
above the node in TikZiT:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/outer-label.png[images/screenshots/outer-label]

The label property is typically given in the form
`+label={POSITION:TEXT}+`, where `+TEXT+` can be any LaTeX code, just
like with normal labels. The label property in the example above is set
to `+label={above:1}+`. This places the text `+1+` directly above the
node. Possiblities for `+POSITION+` include `+above+`, `+below+`,
`+left+`, `+right+`, and `+auto+` (see the PGF manual for details). Note
the `+POSITION+` only affects where the label will be typeset. For
simplicity, TikZiT always shows the label above the node.

[[merge]]

=== Merging nodes

Press kbd:[ctrl + m] to merge selected nodes with any nodes
that are at the same location. A particularly handy use-case is in
making symmetric figures. For example, suppose we want to make a box
with two, symmetric input wires. Make the first input wire, then select
the box and the first input:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/merge1.png[images/screenshots/merge1]

Then, make a copy of this part of the diagram using the clipboard, and
vertically with kbd:[alt + ▼]:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/merge3.png[images/screenshots/merge3]

Drag the duplicated part into place, and press kbd:[ctrl + m]:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/merge4.png[images/screenshots/merge4]

...and we have one node with 2 inputs. Note that you might not visually
see any change when you merge, but jumping to the TikZ source, we see
there is indeed only one node in the middle.

[[boxes]]

=== Making boxes with multiple input/output wires

For string diagrams, flowcharts, etc. one often wants to create boxes
with multiple input and output wires. While TikZ has a notion of
"anchors" which support this, I find the following technique more
convenient.

TikZiT always draws nodes on top of edges, so to draw boxes with
multiple inputs and outputs, first create one or more node styles for
boxes. To get large boxes, click the "+" button under the property list
and set the `+minimum width+` and `+minimum height+` properties.
(Double-click a property or its value to change it.)

For example: a medium-sized box (2-3 inputs and outputs), drawn
horizontally, looks pretty good with `+minimum width+` set to `+0.75cm+`
and `+minimum height+` set to `+1cm+`.

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/box.png[images/screenshots/box]

Now, add nodes with the `+medium box+` style where you wish to put
boxes. For example, here are two such boxes, labeled `+$f$+` and
`+$g$+`:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/nowires.png[images/screenshots/nowires]

Then, create invisible nodes for inputs and outputs and draw edges to
wire them together, getting a figure that looks like this:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/wires.png[images/screenshots/wires]

The final typeset figure will then come out like this:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/typeset-boxes.png[images/screenshots/typeset-boxes]

While it might seem a bit awkward to create styles for every possible
size, in practice this isn't too bad, for 2 reasons:

. If you need a custom size as a one-off, you can use the kbd:[ctrl + j] 
trick from before to set the property on a single node.
. Having only a few sizes to choose from (e.g. `+small box+`,
`+medium box+`, `+large box+`) imposes some discipline on how you make
your figures, and creates more consistent-looking papers overall. (This
made a big difference http://cambridge.org/pqp[here]!)

Suppose later on we come to our senses and decide to draw figures from
bottom-to-top rather than left-to-right. To do this, first swap the
minimum height/width values in the style editor. That is, set
`+minimum width+` to `+1cm+` and `+minimum height+` to `+0.75cm+`. Then,
with our figure open, hit kbd:[ctrl + a] to select everything
and kbd:[alt + shift + ◂] to rotate counter-clockwise.
Then we get this:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/boxfig-ccw.png[images/screenshots/boxfig-ccw]

which typesets as:

image:https://tikzit.github.io/images/screenshots/typeset-boxes2.png[images/screenshots/typeset-boxes2]

Then, suppose _even_ later on our annoying co-author insists figures go
from top-to-bottom rather than bottom-to-top. To fix this, hit
kbd:[ctrl + a] to select everything again and kbd:[alt + ▼] to flip 
vertically. Then we get a new TikZ figure, which typesets as:

=== Using texopen.py to open TiKZ from PDFs

Many PDF readers have a _reverse lookup_ feature, which enables you to
jump to a line of Tex code when e.g. double-clicking a point in the
generated PDF document. Normally, you want the line of TeX to be
displayed in your main text editor or LaTeX editor, but if you click on
a part of the PDF which came from a `+\tikzfig+`, it is convenient for
this to open directly in TikZiT.

This can be done via the following python script, texopen.py:

[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys
import subprocess

if len(sys.argv) >= 3:
  file = sys.argv[1]
  line = sys.argv[2]

  print(file)
  print(line)

  if file.endswith('.tikz'):
    subprocess.call(['tikzit', file])
  else:
    subprocess.call(['subl', file + ':' + line])
----

Note this script uses https://www.sublimetext.com[Sublime Text] as the
default editor (hence `+subl+` in the last line above). Obviously you
can customise this to use your preferred editor.

To use this script, place it somewhere that your PDF viewer can find,
and set it up as your 'editor'. For example, in Okular, go to
`+Settings > Configure Okular...+`. Click on the Editor tab, select
'Custom Text Editor' and add the following as the command:
`+texopen.py %f %l+`. Here, the `+%f+` is a placeholder for the active
file, and `+%l+` the line of code.

Configuration in other popular PDF editors (e.g. Preview, Skim, Sumatra)
should be similar. On Windows systems, you will probably want to set the
editor as something like
`+C:\path\to\python.exe C:\path\to\texopen.py %f %l+`.

For reverse lookups to work, make sure you are building with synctex
enabled. This happens automatically if you are using a tool like
https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html[Latexmk] or various GUI LaTeX
editors or plugins. You will typically see a file with an extension like
`+*.synctex.gz+` being generated when you build.

== File Formats

TikZiT's `+.tikz+` and `+.tikzstyle+` file formats are both subsets of
PGF/TikZ's TeX-based format. TikZ style files have a very simple format.
They are just a list of `+\tikzstyle+` commands. Here is the full
grammar:

[source,xml]
----
<tikzstyles>   ::= ("\tikzstyle" DELIMITED_STRING "=" "[" <properties> "]")*

<properties>   ::= "[" <property> ("," <property>)* "]"

<property>     ::= <value> "=" <value> | <value>

<value>        ::= SIMPLE_STRING | DELIMITED_STRING
----

Where `+SIMPLE_STRING+` means a string consisting of letters, numbers,
and whitespace and `+DELIMITED_STRING+` means a string inside of curly
braces. The latter can contain nested curly braces, provided they occur
in matched pairs.

TikZ figure files consist of a `+{tikzpicture}+` environment, in which
there is a list of `+\node+` commands, followed by a list of `+\edge+`
commands. Nodes and edges, as well as the figure as a whole can have
properties. Here is the full grammar:

[source,xml]
----
<tikzpicture>  ::= "\begin{tikzpicture}" <properties>?
                   <expression>*
                   "\end{tikzpicture}"

<expression>   ::= <ignore> | <node> | <edge> | <boundingbox>

<ignore>       ::= "\begin{pgfonlayer}" DELIMITED_STRING |
                    "\end{pgfonlayer}"

<properties>   ::= "[" <property> ("," <property>)* "]"

<property>     ::= <value> "=" <value> | <value>

<value>        ::= SIMPLE_STRING | DELIMITED_STRING

<node>         ::= "\node" <properties>? <nodename>
                      "at" <coords> DELIMITED_STRING ";"

<nodename>     ::= "(" (SIMPLE_STRING) (".center")? ")"

<coords>       ::= "(" NUMBER "," NUMBER ")"

<edge>         ::= "\draw" <properties>? <nodename>
                      "to" <edgenode>? (<nodename> | "()") ";"

<edgenode>     ::= "node" <properties>? DELIMITED_STRING

<boundingbox>  ::= "\path" "[use as bounding box]" <coords>
                      "rectangle" <coords> ";"
----

NOTE: TikZiT 2.x currently does not use the bounding box command, but
it is allowed for compatibility with TikZiT 1 files.
