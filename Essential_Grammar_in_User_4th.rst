To the student (working without a teacher)
-------------------------------------------

   This is a grammar book for elementary students of English. There are 115 units
   in the book and each unit is about a different point of English grammar.
   There is a list of units at the beginning of the book (Contents).

   Do not study all the units in order from beginning to end. It is better to choose
   the units that you need to do. For example if you have a problem with the
   present perfect (/ have been, he has done etc.), study Units 15-20.

   Use the Contents or the Index (at the back of the book) to find the unit
   (or units) that you need.

   If you are not sure which units you need to study, use the Study guide
   at the back of the book.

   Each unit is two pages. The information is on the left-hand page and the exercises 
   are on the right:

   Study the left-hand page (information); and then do the exercises on the right-hand page.

   Use the Key to check your answers. The Key is on pages 283-309.

   Study the left-hand page again if necessary.

   Don't forget the seven Appendices at the back of the book (pages 243-251).
   These will give you information about active and passive forms; irregular
   verbs, short forms; spelling and phrasal verbs.

   There are also Additional exercises at the back of the book (pages 252-270).

   There is a list of these exercises on page 252.

To the teacher
--------------

   The most important features of this book are:

   - It is a grammar book. It does not deal with other aspects of the language.
   - It is for elementary learners. It does not cover areas of grammar which are not normally taught at elementary level.
   - It is a reference book with exercises. It is not a course book and is not organised progressively.
   - It is addressed to learners and intended for self-study.

Organisation of the book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   There are 115 units in the book, each one focusing on a particular area of grammar. The material is organised
   in grammatical categories, such as tenses, questions and articles. Units are not ordered according to difficulty,
   and should therefore be selected and used in the order appropriate for the learner(s). The book should not
   be worked through from beginning to end. The units are listed in the Contents and there is a comprehensive
   Index at the end of the book.

   Each unit has the same format consisting of two facing pages. The grammar point is presented and explained
   on the left-hand page and the corresponding exercises are on the right. There are seven Appendices (pages
   243-251) dealing with active and passive forms, irregular verbs, short forms (contractions), spelling and phrasal
   verbs. It might be useful for teachers to draw students' attention to these.

   At the back of the book there is a set of Additional exercises (pages 252-270). These exercises provide 'mixed'
   practice bringing together grammar points from a number of different units (especially those concerning verb
   forms). There are 35 exercises in this section and there is a full list on page 252.

   Also at the back of the book there is a Study guide to help students decide which units to study - see page 271.
   Finally, there is a Key (pages 283-309) for students to check their answers to all the exercises in the book. An
   edition without the Study guide and Key is available for teachers who would prefer it for their students.

Level
~~~~~

   The book is for elementary learners, i.e. learners with very little English, but not for complete beginners. It is
   intended mainly for elementary students who are beyond the early stages of a beginners' course. It could also
   be used by low-intermediate learners whose grammar is weaker than other aspects of their English or who
   have problems with particular areas of basic grammar.

   The explanations are addressed to the elementary learner and are therefore as simple and as short as possible.
   The vocabulary used in the examples and exercises has also been restricted so that the book can be used at
   this level.

Using the book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The book can be used by students working alone (see To the student) or as supplementary course material.
   In either case the book can serve as an elementary grammar book.

   When used as course material, the book can be used for immediate consolidation or for later revision or
   remedial work. It might be used by the whole class or by individual students needing extra help and practice.
   In some cases it may be desirable to use the left-hand pages (presentation and explanation) in class, but it
   should be noted that these have been written for individual study and reference. In most cases, it would
   probably be better for teachers to present the grammar point in their preferred way with the exercises being
   done for homework. The left-hand page is then available for later reference by the student.

   Some teachers may prefer to keep the book for revision and remedial work. In this case, individual students or
   groups of students can be directed to the appropriate units for self-study and practice.

         ===============================  ==================================

      They read / he likes / 1 work etc. = the present simple:

      ============== ========================================
      I/we/you/they  read like work live watch do have
      he/she/it      reads likes works lives watches does has
      ============== ========================================

      Remember:

      he works / she lives / it rains etc.

      *  I work in a shop. My brother works in a bank. My brother work)
      *  Lucy lives in London. Her parents live in Scotland.
      *  It rains a lot in winter.

      I have → he/she/it has:

      *  Joe has a shower every day.

      Spelling (→ Appendix 5):

      ::

         -es after -s / -sh / -ch:  pass → passes    finish → finishes  watch → watches
                        -y → ies:  study → studies      try → tries
                           also:      do → does          go → goes


   B

      We use the present simple for things that are true in general, or for things 
      that happen sometimes or all the time:

      *  I `like` big cities.
      *  Your English is good. You `speak` very well.
      *  Tom works very hard. He `starts` at 7.30 and `finishes` at 8 o'clock in the evening.

      *  Sue `always gets` to work early, (not Sue gets always)
      *  I `never eat` breakfast, (not I eat never)
      *  We `often go` away at weekends.

         | ``like    want   know   understand  remember``
         | ``prefer  need   mean   believe     forget``

      Use only the present simple with these verbs (I want / do you like? etc.):

      * I'm tired. I want to go home, (not I'm wanting)
      * 'Do you know that girl?' 'Yes, but I don't remember her name.'
      * I don't understand What do you mean?

      | They `watch`   TV every evening.     (present simple)
      | They `watched` TV yesterday evening. (past simple)

      `watched` is the past simple:

      +---------------+----------+
      | I/we/you/they |          |
      +---------------+ watched  |
      | he/she/it     |          |
      +---------------+----------+

   B

      The past simple is often -ed (regular verbs). For example:
      ::

         work  → worked    dance → danced
         clean → cleaned    stay → stayed
         start → started    need → needed

      * I clean my teeth every morning. This morning I cleaned my teeth.
      * Terry worked in a bank from 2005 to 2011.
      * Yesterday it rained all morning. It stopped at lunchtime.
      * We enjoyed the party last night. We danced a lot and talked to a lot of people.
        The party finished at midnight.

      Spelling (→ Appendix 5):
      ::

         try  → tried     study → studied
         stop → stopped    plan → planned
         copy → copied

   C

      Some verbs are irregular (= not regular). The past simple is not -ed. 
      Here are some important irregular verbs (see also Appendix 2-3):

      Regular verbs The past participle is -ed (the same as the past simple):

         ``clean → I have cleaned      finish → we have finished     start → she has started``

      Irregular verbs The past participle is not -ed.

      Sometimes the past simple and past participle are the same:

         ``buy → I bought / I have bought       have → he had / he has had``

      Sometimes the past simple and past participle are different:

         ``break → I broke / I have broken      see → you saw / you have seen``
         ``fall  → it fell / it has fallen      go  → they went / they have gone``

   C

      We use the present perfect for an action in the past with a result now:

      *  I've lost my passport. (= I can't find my passport now)
      *  'Where's Rebecca?' 'She's gone to bed.' (= she is in bed now)
      *  We've bought a new car. (= we have a new car now)
      *  It's Rachel's birthday tomorrow and I haven't bought her a present. 
         (= I don't have a present for her now)
      *  'Bob is away on holiday.' 'Oh, where has he gone?' (= where is he now?)
      *  Can I take this newspaper? Have you finished with it? (= do you need it now?)

      Regular verbs

      The past simple and past participle of regular verbs is -ed:

      ``clean → cleaned   live → lived   paint → painted   study → studied``

      Past simple (→ Unit 11)

         *  I `cleaned` my room yesterday.
         *  Chris `studied` engineering at university.

      Past participle

         have/has + past participle (present perfect → Units 15-18):

         *  I `have cleaned` my room.
         *  Tina `has lived` in London for ten years.

         be (is/are/were/has been etc.) + past participle (passive → Units 21-22):

         *  These rooms `are cleaned` every day.
         *  My car `has been repaired`.

   B

      Irregular verbs

      The past simple and past participle of irregular verbs do not end in -ed:

      +-------------------+------+--------+-----+
      |                   | make | break  | cut |
      +-------------------+------+--------+-----+
      | past simple       | made | broke  | cut |
      +-------------------+------+--------+-----+
      | past participle   | made | broken | cut |
      +-------------------+------+--------+-----+

      Sometimes the past simple and past participle are the same. For example:

      +-------------------+------+--------+--------+-----+
      |                   | make | find   | buy    | cut |

      *  I `have made` some coffee, (past participle - present perfect)
      *  Butter `is made` from milk, (past participle - passive present)

      |                 | break  | know   | begin  | go   |
      +-----------------+--------+--------+--------+------+

      +-----------------+--------+--------+--------+------+
      | past participle | broken | known  | begun  | gone |

      I might = it is possible that I will:

      * I `might go` to the cinema this evening, but I'm not sure. (= it is possible that I will go)
      * | A: When is Rebecca going to phone you?
        | B: I don't know. She `might phone` this afternoon.
      * Take an umbrella with you. It `might rain`.

      * | A: Are you going out tonight?
        | B: `I might`. (= I might go out)

      Study the difference:

      *  | I'm playing tennis tomorrow, (sure)
         | `I might` play tennis tomorrow, (possible)
      *  | Rebecca `is going to phone` later, (sure)
         | Rebecca `might phone` later, (possible)

      *  I `might not go` to work tomorrow. (= it is possible that I will not go)
      *  Sue `might not come` to the party. (= it is possible that she will not come)

   D

      may

      You can use may in the same way. I may = I might:

      *  I may go to the cinema this evening. (= I might go)
      *  Sue may not come to the party. (= Sue might not come)

      May I ... ? = Is it OK to ... ? / Can I ... ?:

      *  `May I` ask a question? (= is it OK to ask / can I ask?)
      *  'May I sit here?' 'Yes, of course.'

      In these examples, it is not necessary to repeat some words ('he is tired',

      注意，most 可以作为副词修饰形容词表示最高比较级，作为代词使用表示其中的大部分。基本用法： 

      ================================== ============================================ ======================
      as pronoun: most `plural noun`     Who do you think will get (the) most votes?  你认为谁会获得最多票？
      as pronoun: most of the `Noun`     I spent most of the winter on the coast.     我冬天大部分时间在海滨度过。

      as adverbs: most of `noun phrases` I donated most of my books to the library.   我捐赠了大部分书给图书馆。
      ================================== ============================================ ======================

      这句子中 most 修饰所有想要的选择“of all”，这些选择本身。例如 most people 或者 most of them。
      但没不使用 most of people 这样的用法，注意 people 本身是复数名词（Plural Nouns），可以
      使用 most of the people。

   We use `much` in questions and negative sentences:

      *  Do you drink much coffee?
      *  I don't drink much coffee.

   But we do not often use `much` in positive sentences:

      *  I drink `a lot of` coffee, (not I drink much coffee)
      *  'Do you drink much coffee?' 'Yes, a lot.' (not Yes, much)

Unit 97 and but or so because
-----------------------------

   and but or so because
   We use these words (conjunctions) to join two sentences. They make one longer sentence from two
   shorter sentences:
   sentence A The car stopped. — — The driver got out. sentence B
   The car stopped and the driver got out.
   and/but/or
   sentence A sentence B
   We stayed at home and (we)* watched television.

   He doesn't like her, and she doesn't like him.
   1 bought a sandwich, but 1 didn't eat it.
   It's a nice house, but it doesn't have a garden.
   Do you want to go out, or are you too tired?
   * It is not necessary to
   repeat we' and she'.
   In lists, we use commas (,). We use and before the last thing:
   *  I got home, had something to eat, sat down in an armchair and fell asleep.
   Karen is at work, Sue has gone shopping and Chris is playing football.
   so (the result of something)
   sentence A
   It was very hot,
   Joe does a lot of sport,
   They don't like travelling,
   sentence B
   I opened the window,
   he's very fit.
   they haven't been to many places.
   because (the reason for something)
   sentence A sentence B
   1 opened the window because it was very hot.
   Joe can't come to the party because he's going away.
   Lisa is hungry because she didn't have breakfast.
   Because is also possible at the beginning:
   *  Because it was very hot, I opened the window.
   In these examples there is more than one conjunction:
   *  It was late and I was tired, so I went to bed.

Appendix 4 Short forms (he's / I'd / don't etc.)
------------------------------------------------

   In spoken English we usually pronounce 'I am' as one word. The short form (I'm) is a way of writing
   this:
   I am → I'm o
   it is → it's o
   they have -4 they've o
   etc.
   When we write short forms, we use' (an apostrophe):
   IX m —H'm he^-^he's you Mve → you've she Mil -4 she'll
   am → 'm I'm
   is → 's he's she's it's
   are → 're we're you're they're
   have → 've I've we've you've they've
   has → 's he's she's it's
   had 'd I'd he'd she'd we'd you'd they'd
   will → 'II I'll he'll she'll we'll you'll they'll
   would → 'd I'd he'd she'd we'd you'd they'd
   *  I've got some new shoes.
   *  We'll probably go out this evening.
   *  It's 10 o'clock. You're late again.
   's = is or has:
   *  She's going out this evening, (she's going = she is going)
   *  She's gone out. (she's gone = she has gone)
   'd = would or had:
   *  a : What would you like to eat?
   b: I'd like a salad please. (I'd like = I would like)
