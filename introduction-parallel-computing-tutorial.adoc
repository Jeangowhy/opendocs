[[Abstract]]
=== Abstract

This is the first tutorial in the "Livermore Computing Getting Started"
workshop. It is intended to provide only a brief overview of the
extensive and broad topic of Parallel Computing, as a lead-in for the
tutorials that follow it. As such, it covers just the very basics of
parallel computing, and is intended for someone who is just becoming
acquainted with the subject and who is planning to attend one or more of
the other tutorials in this workshop. It is not intended to cover
Parallel Programming in depth, as this would require significantly more
time. The tutorial begins with a discussion on parallel computing - what
it is and how it's used, followed by a discussion on concepts and
terminology associated with parallel computing. The topics of parallel
memory architectures and programming models are then explored. These
topics are followed by a series of practical discussions on a number of
the complex issues related to designing and running parallel programs.
The tutorial concludes with several examples of how to parallelize
several simple problems. References are included for further self-study.

[[Overview]]
=== Overview

[[Whatis]]
==== What Is Parallel Computing?

===== Serial Computing

Traditionally, software has been written for *_serial_* computation:

* A problem is broken into a discrete series of instructions
* Instructions are executed sequentially one after another
* Executed on a single processor
* Only one instruction may execute at any moment in time

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/serialProblem.gif?itok=ddQFpgF2[Serial computing example,width=604,height=250]

*For example:*

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/serialProblem2.gif?itok=gaoiADHZ[Serial computing problem example diagram ,width=604,height=250]

===== Parallel Computing

In the simplest sense, *_parallel computing_* is the simultaneous use of
multiple compute resources to solve a computational problem:

* A problem is broken into discrete parts that can be solved concurrently
* Each part is further broken down to a series of instructions
* Instructions from each part execute simultaneously on different processors
* An overall control/coordination mechanism is employed

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/parallelProblem.gif?itok=u4OKbOB5[Parallel computing example,width=660,height=359]

*For example:*

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/parallelProblem2.gif?itok=QDDf-ACl[Parallel computing problem example diagram,width=660,height=359]

* The computational problem should be able to:
** Be broken apart into discrete pieces of work that can be solved simultaneously;
** Execute multiple program instructions at any moment in time;
** Be solved in less time with multiple compute resources than with a single compute resource.
* The compute resources are typically:
** A single computer with multiple processors/cores
** An arbitrary number of such computers connected by a network

===== Parallel Computers

* Virtually all stand-alone computers today are parallel from a hardware perspective:
** Multiple functional units (L1 cache, L2 cache, branch, prefetch,
   decode, floating-point, graphics processing (GPU), integer, etc.)
** Multiple execution units/cores
** Multiple hardware threads

(L2),title="     IBM BG/Q Compute Chip with 18 cores (PU) and 16 L2 Cache units (L2)",width=450,height=453]

* Networks connect multiple stand-alone computers (nodes) to make larger
parallel computer clusters.

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/nodesNetwork.gif?itok=TBqDQmx0[Nodes network,width=660,height=228]

* For example, the schematic below shows a typical LLNL parallel computer cluster:
** Each compute node is a multi-processor parallel computer in itself
** Multiple compute nodes are networked together with an Infiniband network
** Special purpose nodes, also multi-processor, are used for other purposes

* The majority of the world's large parallel computers (supercomputers)
  are clusters of hardware produced by a handful of (mostly) well known
  vendors.

[[WhyUse]]
==== Why Use Parallel Computing?

===== The Real World Is Massively Complex

* In the natural world, many complex, interrelated events are happening
  at the same time, yet within a temporal sequence.
* Compared to serial computing, parallel computing is much better suited
  for modeling, simulating and understanding complex, real world
  phenomena.
* For example, imagine modeling these serially:

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/realWorldCollage1.jpeg?itok=szSeHXG0["Real world" events that can be modeled with parallel computing,width=660,height=191]

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/realWorldCollage2.jpeg?itok=Ftb544lp["Real world" events that can be modeled with parallel computing,width=660,height=200]

===== Main Reasons for Using Parallel Programming

====== SAVE TIME AND/OR MONEY

* In theory, throwing more resources at a task will shorten its time to
  completion, with potential cost savings.
* Parallel computers can be built from cheap, commodity components.

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/timeMoney2.jpeg?itok=3CQXTb3R[Tasks are completed faster with more resources, as shown with several people constructing a house and several plows on a field.,width=600,height=182]

====== SOLVE LARGER / MORE COMPLEX PROBLEMS

* Many problems are so large and/or complex that it is impractical or
  impossible to solve them using a serial program, especially given
  limited computer memory.
* Example: "Grand Challenge Problems"
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Challenges[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Challenge])
  requiring petaflops and petabytes of computing resources.
* Example: Web search engines/databases processing millions of
  transactions every second

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/biggerProblems.jpeg?itok=XJInr2Eg[Bigger problems,width=600,height=180]

====== PROVIDE CONCURRENCY

* A single compute resource can only do one thing at a time. Multiple
  compute resources can do many things simultaneously.
* Example: Collaborative Networks provide a global venue where people
  from around the world can meet and conduct work "virtually."

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/collaborativeNetworks.jpeg?itok=EgqqJUs8[COllaborative networks connecting people globally ,width=600,height=182]

====== TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NON-LOCAL RESOURCES

* Using compute resources on a wide area network, or even the Internet
  when local compute resources are scarce or insufficient.
* Example: SETI@home
  (http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/[setiathome.berkeley.edu]) has over 1.7
  million users in nearly every country in the world (May, 2018).

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/SETILogo.jpeg?itok=zJXpFxIZ[SETI@home logo,width=600,height=122]

====== MAKE BETTER USE OF UNDERLYING PARALLEL HARDWARE

* Modern computers, even laptops, are parallel in architecture with
  multiple processors/cores.
* Parallel software is specifically intended for parallel hardware with
  multiple cores, threads, etc.
* In most cases, serial programs run on modern computers "waste"
  potential computing power.

units,title="Intel Xeon processor with 6 cores and 6 L3 cache units",width=600,height=321]

===== The Future

* During the past 20+ years, the trends indicated by ever faster
  networks, distributed systems, and multi-processor computer
  architectures (even at the desktop level) clearly show that
  *_parallelism is the future of computing_*.
* In this same time period, there has been a greater than *500,000x*
  increase in supercomputer performance, with no end currently in sight.
* *_The race is already on for Exascale Computing - we are entering
  Exascale era_*
** Exaflop = 10^18^ calculations per second

=== Concepts and Terminology

[[Neumann]]
==== von Neumann Computer Architecture

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_4_up/public/vonNeumann2.jpeg?itok=PN6P0JBZ[John von Neumann circa 1940s ,title="John von Neumann circa 1940s ",width=260,height=338]

* Named after the Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann who first
  authored the general requirements for an electronic computer in his 1945
  papers.
* Also known as "stored-program computer" - both program instructions
  and data are kept in electronic memory. Differs from earlier computers
  which were programmed through "hard wiring".
* Since then, virtually all computers have followed this basic design:

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_2_up/public/vonNeumann1.gif?itok=Nl0QDamp[Diagram of a basic computer design, based on vn Neumann's requirements,width=293,height=277]

* Comprised of four main components:

. Memory
. Control Unit
. Arithmetic Logic Unit
. Input/Output

* Read/write, random access memory is used to store both program instructions and data
* Program instructions are coded data which tell the computer to do something
* Data is simply information to be used by the program
* Control unit fetches instructions/data from memory, decodes the
  instructions and then *_sequentially_* coordinates operations to
  accomplish the programmed task.
* Arithmetic Unit performs basic arithmetic operations
* Input/Output is the interface to the human operator

Parallel computers still follow this basic design, just multiplied in
units. The basic, fundamental architecture remains the same. More info
on his other remarkable accomplishments:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann

[[Flynn]]
==== Flynn's Classical Taxonomy

* There are a number of
  link:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/parallelClassifications_0.pdf[different ways]
  to classify parallel computers. Examples are available in the
  references.
* One of the more widely used classifications, in use since 1966, is
  called Flynn's Taxonomy.
* Flynn's taxonomy distinguishes multi-processor computer architectures
  according to how they can be classified along the two independent
  dimensions of *_Instruction Stream_* and *_Data Stream_*. Each of these
  dimensions can have only one of two possible states: *_Single_* or
  *_Multiple_*.
* The matrix below defines the 4 possible classifications according to Flynn:

===== Single Instruction, Single Data (SISD)

* A serial (non-parallel) computer
* *Single Instruction:* Only one instruction stream is being acted on by
  the CPU during any one clock cycle
* *Single Data:* Only one data stream is being used as input during any
  one clock cycle
* Deterministic execution
* This is the oldest type of computer
* Examples: older generation mainframes, minicomputers, workstations and
  single processor/core PCs.

===== Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)

* A type of parallel computer
* *Single Instruction:* All processing units execute the same instruction at any given clock cycle
* *Multiple Data:* Each processing unit can operate on a different data element
* Best suited for specialized problems characterized by a high degree of
  regularity, such as graphics/image processing.
* Synchronous (lockstep) and deterministic execution
* Two varieties: Processor Arrays and Vector Pipelines
* Examples:
** Processor Arrays: Thinking Machines CM-2, MasPar MP-1 & MP-2, ILLIAC IV
** Vector Pipelines: IBM 9000, Cray X-MP, Y-MP & C90, Fujitsu VP, NEC SX-2, Hitachi S820, ETA10
* Most modern computers, particularly those with graphics processor
  units (GPUs) employ SIMD instructions and execution units.

[[Terminology ]]
==== General Parallel Computing Terminology

* Like everything else, parallel computing has its own jargon. Some of
  the more commonly used terms associated with parallel computing are
  listed below. Most of these will be discussed in more detail later.

====== CPU

Contemporary CPUs consist of one or more cores - a distinct execution
unit with its own instruction stream. Cores with a CPU may be organized
into one or more sockets - each socket with its own distinct memory .
When a CPU consists of two or more sockets, usually hardware
infrastructure supports memory sharing across sockets.

====== Node

A standalone "computer in a box." Usually comprised of multiple
CPUs/processors/cores, memory, network interfaces, etc. Nodes are
networked together to comprise a supercomputer.


image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/nodeSocketCores.jpeg?itok=XbICq4rh[Diagram of nodes, each of which contains multiple CPUs with multiple cores,width=480,height=225]

====== Task

A logically discrete section of computational work. A task is typically
a program or program-like set of instructions that is executed by a
processor. A parallel program consists of multiple tasks running on
multiple processors.

====== Pipelining

Breaking a task into steps performed by different processor units, with
inputs streaming through, much like an assembly line; a type of parallel
computing.

====== Shared Memory

Describes a computer architecture where all processors have direct
access to common physical memory. In a programming sense, it describes a
model where parallel tasks all have the same "picture" of memory and can
directly address and access the same logical memory locations regardless
of where the physical memory actually exists.

====== Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP)

Shared memory hardware architecture where multiple processors share a
single address space and have equal access to all resources - memory,
disk, etc.

====== Distributed Memory

In hardware, refers to network based memory access for physical memory
that is not common. As a programming model, tasks can only logically
"see" local machine memory and must use communications to access memory
on other machines where other tasks are executing.

====== Communications

Parallel tasks typically need to exchange data. There are several ways
this can be accomplished, such as through a shared memory bus or over a
network.

====== Synchronization

The coordination of parallel tasks in real time, very often associated
with communications.

Synchronization usually involves waiting by at least one task, and can
therefore cause a parallel application's wall clock execution time to
increase.

====== Computational Granularity

In parallel computing, granularity is a quantitative or qualitative
measure of the ratio of computation to communication.

* *_Coarse:_* relatively large amounts of computational work are done
between communication events
* *_Fine:_* relatively small amounts of computational work are done
between communication events

====== Observed Speedup

Observed speedup of a code which has been parallelized, defined as:

....
        wall-clock time of serial execution
        -----------------------------------
        wall-clock time of parallel execution
....

One of the simplest and most widely used indicators for a parallel
program's performance.

====== Parallel Overhead

Required execution time that is unique to parallel tasks, as opposed to
that for doing useful work. Parallel overhead can include factors such
as:

* Task start-up time
* Synchronizations
* Data communications
* Software overhead imposed by parallel languages, libraries, operating system, etc.
* Task termination time

====== Massively Parallel

Refers to the hardware that comprises a given parallel system - having
many processing elements. The meaning of "many" keeps increasing, but
currently, the largest parallel computers are comprised of processing
elements numbering in the hundreds of thousands to millions.

====== Embarrassingly (IDEALY) Parallel

Solving many similar, but independent tasks simultaneously; little to no
need for coordination between the tasks.

====== Scalability

Refers to a parallel system's (hardware and/or software) ability to
demonstrate a proportionate increase in parallel speedup with the
addition of more resources. Factors that contribute to scalability
include:

* Hardware - particularly memory-cpu bandwidths and network communication properties
* Application algorithm
* Parallel overhead related
* Characteristics of your specific application

==== Potential Benefits, Limits and Costs of Parallel Programming

===== Amdahl's Law

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_3_up/public/amdahl2_0.gif?itok=F0RaZ2bZ[Graph demonstrating the limits of parallelization.,width=352,height=270]

* Amdahl's Law states that potential program speedup is defined by the
  fraction of code (P) that can be parallelized:

....
                         1
        speedup   =   --------
                       1  - P
....

* If none of the code can be parallelized, P = 0 and the speedup = 1 (no speedup).
* If all of the code is parallelized, P = 1 and the speedup is infinite (in theory).
* If 50% of the code can be parallelized, maximum speedup = 2, meaning
  the code will run twice as fast.
* Introducing the number of processors performing the parallel fraction
  of work, the relationship can be modeled by:

....
                           1 
        speedup   =   ------------
                        P   +  S
                       ---
                        N
....

* where P = parallel fraction, N = number of processors and S = serial fraction.
* It soon becomes obvious that there are limits to the scalability of
  parallelism. For example:

....
                           speedup
              -------------------------------------
        N     P = .50   P = .90   P = .95   P = .99
      -----   -------   -------   -------   -------
         10      1.82      5.26      6.89      9.17
        100      1.98      9.17     16.80     50.25    
      1,000      1.99      9.91     19.62     90.99
     10,000      1.99      9.91     19.96     99.02
    100,000      1.99      9.99     19.99     99.90
....

* *"Famous" quote:* _You can spend a lifetime getting 95% of your code
  to be parallel, and never achieve better than 20x speedup no matter how
  many processors you throw at it!_

* However, certain problems demonstrate increased performance by
  increasing the problem size. For example:

....
        2D Grid Calculations    
        Parallel fraction        85 seconds 85%   
        Serial fraction          15 seconds   15%   
....

* We can increase the problem size by doubling the grid dimensions and
  halving the time step. This results in four times the number of grid
  points and twice the number of time steps. The timings then look like:

....
        2D Grid Calculations 
        Parallel fraction         680 seconds 97.84%   
        Serial fraction           15 seconds    2.16%   
....

* Problems that increase the percentage of parallel time with their size
  are more *_scalable_* than problems with a fixed percentage of parallel
  time.

===== Complexity

* In general, parallel applications are  more complex than corresponding
  serial applications. Not only do you have multiple instruction streams
  executing at the same time, but you also have data flowing between them.
* The costs of complexity are measured in programmer time in virtually
  every aspect of the software development cycle:
** Design
** Coding
** Debugging
** Tuning
** Maintenance
* Adhering to "good" software development practices is essential when
  developing  parallel applications.

===== Portability

* Thanks to standardization in several APIs, such as MPI, OpenMP and
  POSIX threads, portability issues with parallel programs are not as
  serious as in years past. However...
* All of the usual portability issues associated with serial programs
  apply to parallel programs. For example, if you use vendor
  "enhancements" to Fortran, C or C++, portability will be a problem.
* Even though standards exist for several APIs, implementations will
  differ in a number of details, sometimes to the point of requiring code
  modifications in order to effect portability.
* Operating systems can play a key role in code portability issues.
* Hardware architectures are characteristically highly variable and can
  affect portability.

===== Resource Requirements

* The primary intent of parallel programming is to decrease execution
  wall clock time, however in order to accomplish this, more CPU time is
  required. For example, a parallel code that runs in 1 hour on 8
  processors actually uses 8 hours of CPU time.
* The amount of memory required can be greater for parallel codes than
  serial codes, due to the need to replicate data and for overheads
  associated with parallel support libraries and subsystems.
* For short running parallel programs, there can actually be a decrease
  in performance compared to a similar serial implementation. The overhead
  costs associated with setting up the parallel environment, task
  creation, communications and task termination can comprise a significant
  portion of the total execution time for short runs.

===== Scalability

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_3_up/public/strongWeakScaling.gif?itok=326V4FJ2[Strong scaling vs. weak scaling,width=352,height=501]

* Two types of scaling based on time to solution: strong scaling and weak scaling.
* *Strong scaling (Amdahl):*
** The total problem size stays fixed as more processors are added.
** Goal is to run the same problem size faster
** Perfect scaling means problem is solved in 1/P time (compared to serial)
* *Weak scaling (Gustafson):*
** The problem size _per processor_ stays fixed as more processors are
  added. The total problem size is proportional to the number of
  processors used.
** Goal is to run larger problem in same amount of time
** Perfect scaling means problem Px runs in same time as single processor run
* The ability of a parallel program's performance to scale is a result
  of a number of interrelated factors. Simply adding more processors is
  rarely the answer.
* The algorithm may have inherent limits to scalability. At some point,
  adding more resources causes performance to decrease. This is a common
  situation with many parallel applications.
* Hardware factors play a significant role in scalability. Examples:
** Memory-cpu bus bandwidth on an SMP machine
** Communications network bandwidth
** Amount of memory available on any given machine or set of machines
** Processor clock speed

* Parallel support libraries and subsystems software can limit
  scalability independent of your application.

[[MemoryArch]]
=== Parallel Computer Memory Architectures

[[SharedMemory]]
==== Shared Memory

===== General Characteristics

* Shared memory parallel computers vary widely, but generally have in
  common the ability for all processors to access all memory as global
  address space.
* Multiple processors can operate independently but share the same
  memory resources.
* Changes in a memory location effected by one processor are visible to
  all other processors.
* Historically, shared memory machines have been classified as *_UMA_*
  and *_NUMA_*, based upon memory access times.

===== Uniform Memory Access (UMA)

* Most commonly represented today by *_Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP)_* machines
* Identical processors
* Equal access and access times to memory
* Sometimes called CC-UMA - Cache Coherent UMA. Cache coherent means if
  one processor updates a location in shared memory, all the other
  processors know about the update. Cache coherency is accomplished at the
  hardware level. +
+
image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/shared_mem.gif?itok=C5AQPSuI[Diagram of shared memory (UMA) ,width=414,height=285]

===== Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)

* Often made by physically linking two or more SMPs
* One SMP can directly access memory of another SMP
* Not all processors have equal access time to all memories
* Memory access across link is slower
* If cache coherency is maintained, then may also be called CC-NUMA -
  Cache Coherent NUMA

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/numa.gif?itok=Yj_iK2pi[Diagram of shared memory (NUMA),title="Shared Memory (NUMA)",width=484,height=196]

===== Advantages

* Global address space provides a user-friendly programming perspective
  to memory
* Data sharing between tasks is both fast and uniform due to the
  proximity of memory to CPUs

===== Disadvantages

* Primary disadvantage is the lack of scalability between memory and
  CPUs. Adding more CPUs can geometrically increases traffic on the shared
  memory-CPU path, and for cache coherent systems, geometrically increase
  traffic associated with cache/memory management.
* Programmer responsibility for synchronization constructs that ensure
  "correct" access of global memory.

[[DistributedMemory]]
==== Distributed Memory

===== General Characteristics

* Like shared memory systems, distributed memory systems vary widely but
  share a common characteristic. Distributed memory systems require a
  communication network to connect inter-processor memory.
* Processors have their own local memory. Memory addresses in one
  processor do not map to another processor, so there is no concept of
  global address space across all processors.
* Because each processor has its own local memory, it operates
  independently. Changes it makes to its local memory have no effect on
  the memory of other processors. Hence, the concept of cache coherency
  does not apply.
* When a processor needs access to data in another processor, it is
  usually the task of the programmer to explicitly define how and when
  data is communicated. Synchronization between tasks is likewise the
  programmer's responsibility.
* The network "fabric" used for data transfer varies widely, though it
  can be as simple as Ethernet. +
+
image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/with_sidebar_1_up/public/distributed_mem.gif?itok=8x6tqlFl[Diagram of a distributed memory system,width=484,height=196]

===== Advantages

* Memory is scalable with the number of processors. Increase the number
  of processors and the size of memory increases proportionately.
* Each processor can rapidly access its own memory without interference
  and without the overhead incurred with trying to maintain global cache
  coherency.
* Cost effectiveness: can use commodity, off-the-shelf processors and
  networking.

===== Disadvantages

* The programmer is responsible for many of the details associated with
  data communication between processors.
* It may be difficult to map existing data structures, based on global
  memory, to this memory organization.
* Non-uniform memory access times - data residing on a remote node takes
  longer to access than node local data.

[[HybridMemory]]
==== Hybrid Distributed-Shared Memory

===== General Characteristics

* The largest and fastest computers in the world today employ both
  shared and distributed memory architectures.

|===

* The shared memory component can be a shared memory machine and/or
  graphics processing units (GPU).
* The distributed memory component is the networking of multiple shared
  memory/GPU machines, which know only about their own memory - not the
  memory on another machine. Therefore, network communications are
  required to move data from one machine to another.
* Current trends seem to indicate that this type of memory architecture
  will continue to prevail and increase at the high end of computing for
  the foreseeable future.

===== Advantages and Disadvantages

* Whatever is common to both shared and distributed memory
  architectures.
* Increased scalability is an important advantage
* Increased programmer complexity is an important disadvantage

[[Models]]
=== Parallel Programming Models

* There are several parallel programming models in common use:
** Shared Memory (without threads)
** Threads
** Distributed Memory / Message Passing
** Data Parallel
** Hybrid
** Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD)
** Multiple Program Multiple Data (MPMD)
* **Parallel programming models exist as an abstraction above hardware and memory architectures.**
* Although it might not seem apparent, these models are *NOT* specific
  to a particular type of machine or memory architecture. In fact, any of
  these models can (theoretically) be implemented on any underlying
  hardware. Two examples from the past are discussed below.

==== SHARED memory model on a DISTRIBUTED memory machine

Kendall Square Research (KSR) ALLCACHE approach. Machine memory was
physically distributed across networked machines, but appeared to the
user as a single shared memory global address space. Generically, this
approach is referred to as "virtual shared memory".

|===

==== DISTRIBUTED memory model on a SHARED memory machine

Message Passing Interface (MPI) on SGI Origin 2000. The SGI Origin 2000
employed the CC-NUMA type of shared memory architecture, where every
task has direct access to global address space spread across all
machines. However, the ability to send and receive messages using MPI,
as is commonly done over a network of distributed memory machines, was
implemented and commonly used.

|===

* *Which model to use?* This is often a combination of what is available
  and personal choice. There is no "best" model, although there certainly
  are better implementations of some models over others.
* The following sections describe each of the models mentioned above,
  and also discuss some of their actual implementations.

[[ModelsShared]]
==== Shared Memory Model (without threads)

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_3_up/public/sharedMemoryModel.gif?itok=RXgMD-yQ[Shared memory model ,width=352,height=326]

* In this programming model, processes/tasks share a common address
  space, which they read and write to asynchronously.
* Various mechanisms such as locks / semaphores are used to control
  access to the shared memory, resolve contentions and to prevent race
  conditions and deadlocks.
* This is perhaps the simplest parallel programming model.
* An advantage of this model from the programmer's point of view is that
  the notion of data "ownership" is lacking, so there is no need to
  specify explicitly the communication of data between tasks. All
  processes see and have equal access to shared memory. Program
  development can often be simplified.
* An important disadvantage in terms of performance is that it becomes
  more difficult to understand and manage *_data locality_*:
** Keeping data local to the process that works on it conserves memory
  accesses, cache refreshes and bus traffic that occurs when multiple
  processes use the same data.
** Unfortunately, controlling data locality is hard to understand and
  may be beyond the control of the average user.

*Implementations*

* On stand-alone shared memory machines, native operating systems,
  compilers and/or hardware provide support for shared memory programming.
  For example, the POSIX standard provides an API for using shared memory,
  and UNIX provides shared memory segments (shmget, shmat, shmctl, etc.).
* On distributed memory machines, memory is physically distributed
  across a network of machines, but made global through specialized
  hardware and software. A variety of SHMEM implementations are available:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHMEM[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHMEM].

[[ModelsThreads]]
==== Threads Model

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_3_up/public/threadsModel2.gif?itok=ZTC8AHdz[Threads Model diagram,width=350,height=550]

* This programming model is a type of shared memory programming.
* In the threads model of parallel programming, a single "heavy weight"
  process can have multiple "light weight", concurrent execution paths.
* For example:
** The main program *a.out* is scheduled to run by the native operating
  system. *a.out* loads and acquires all of the necessary system and user
  resources to run. This is the "heavy weight" process.
** *a.out* performs some serial work, and then creates a number of tasks
  (threads) that can be scheduled and run by the operating system
  concurrently.
** Each thread has local data, but also, shares the entire resources of
  *a.out*. This saves the overhead associated with replicating a program's
  resources for each thread ("light weight"). Each thread also benefits
  from a global memory view because it shares the memory space of *a.out*.
** A thread's work may best be described as a subroutine within the main
  program. Any thread can execute any subroutine at the same time as other
  threads.
** Threads communicate with each other through global memory (updating
  address locations). This requires synchronization constructs to ensure
  that more than one thread is not updating the same global address at any
  time.
** Threads can come and go, but *a.out* remains present to provide the
  necessary shared resources until the application has completed.

*Implementations*

* From a programming perspective, threads implementations commonly comprise:
** A library of subroutines that are called from within parallel source code
** A set of compiler directives imbedded in either serial or parallel source code

In both cases, the programmer is responsible for determining the
parallelism (although compilers can sometimes help).

* Threaded implementations are not new in computing. Historically,
  hardware vendors have implemented their own proprietary versions of
  threads. These implementations differed substantially from each other
  making it difficult for programmers to develop portable threaded
  applications.
* Unrelated standardization efforts have resulted in two very different
  implementations of threads: *_POSIX Threads_* and *_OpenMP._*

====== POSIX Threads

* Specified by the IEEE POSIX 1003.1c standard (1995). C Language only.
* Part of Unix/Linux operating systems
* Library based
* Commonly referred to as Pthreads.
* Very explicit parallelism; requires significant programmer attention
  to detail.

====== OpenMP

*  Industry standard, jointly defined and endorsed by a group of major
  computer hardware and software vendors, organizations and individuals.
* Compiler directive based
* Portable / multi-platform, including Unix and Windows platforms
* Available in C/C++ and Fortran implementations
* Can be very easy and simple to use - provides for "incremental
  parallelism". Can begin with serial code.
* Other threaded implementations are common, but not discussed here:
** Microsoft threads
** Java, Python threads
** CUDA threads for GPUs

[[ModelsMessage]]
==== Distributed Memory / Message Passing Model

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_3_up/public/msg_pass_model.gif?itok=8-UWuj_m[Distributed memory/message passing model diagram,width=352,height=245]

* This model demonstrates the following characteristics:
** A set of tasks that use their own local memory during computation.
  Multiple tasks can reside on the same physical machine and/or across an
  arbitrary number of machines.
** Tasks exchange data through communications by sending and receiving
  messages.
** Data transfer usually requires cooperative operations to be performed
  by each process. For example, a send operation must have a matching
  receive operation.

*Implementations:*

* From a programming perspective, message passing implementations
  usually comprise a library of subroutines. Calls to these subroutines
  are imbedded in source code. The programmer is responsible for
  determining all parallelism.
* Historically, a variety of message passing libraries have been
  available since the 1980s. These implementations differed substantially
  from each other making it difficult for programmers to develop portable
  applications.
* In 1992, the MPI Forum was formed with the primary goal of
  establishing a standard interface for message passing implementations.
* Part 1 of the *Message Passing Interface (MPI)* was released in 1994.
  Part 2 (MPI-2) was released in 1996 and MPI-3 in 2012. All MPI
  specifications are available on the web at
  http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/.
* MPI is the "de facto" industry standard for message passing, replacing
  virtually all other message passing implementations used for production
  work. MPI implementations exist for virtually all popular parallel
  computing platforms. Not all implementations include everything in
  MPI-1, MPI-2 or MPI-3.

* May also be referred to as the *Partitioned Global Address Space
  (PGAS)* model.
* The data parallel model demonstrates the following characteristics:
** Address space is treated globally
** Most of the parallel work focuses on performing operations on a data
  set. The data set is typically organized into a common structure, such
  as an array or cube.
** A set of tasks work collectively on the same data structure, however,
  each task works on a different partition of the same data structure.
** Tasks perform the same operation on their partition of work, for
  example, "add 4 to every array element".
* On shared memory architectures, all tasks may have access to the data
  structure through global memory.
* On distributed memory architectures, the global data structure can be
  split up logically and/or physically across tasks.

*Implementations:*

* Currently, there are several parallel programming implementations in
  various stages of developments, based on the Data Parallel / PGAS model.
* *Coarray Fortran:* a small set of extensions to Fortran 95 for SPMD
  parallel programming. Compiler dependent. More information:

* A hybrid model combines more than one of the previously described
  programming models.
* Currently, a common example of a hybrid model is the combination of
  the message passing model (MPI) with the threads model (OpenMP).
** Threads perform computationally intensive kernels using local,
  on-node data
** Communications between processes on different nodes occurs over the
  network using MPI
* This hybrid model lends itself well to the most popular (currently)
  hardware environment of clustered multi/many-core machines.
* Another similar and increasingly popular example of a hybrid model is
  using MPI with CPU-GPU (graphics processing unit) programming.
** MPI tasks run on CPUs using local memory and communicating with each
  other over a network.
** Computationally intensive kernels are off-loaded to GPUs on-node.
** Data exchange between node-local memory and GPUs uses CUDA (or
  something equivalent).
* Other hybrid models are common:
** MPI with Pthreads
** MPI with non-GPU accelerators

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_3_up/public/spmd_model.gif?itok=oNHuHggk[SPMD model diagram,width=352,height=98]

* SPMD is actually a "high level" programming model that can be built
  upon any combination of the previously mentioned parallel programming
  models.
* SINGLE PROGRAM: All tasks execute their copy of the same program
  simultaneously. This program can be threads, message passing, data
  parallel or hybrid.
* MULTIPLE DATA: All tasks may use different data
* SPMD programs usually have the necessary logic programmed into them to
  allow different tasks to branch or conditionally execute only those
  parts of the program they are designed to execute. That is, tasks do not
  necessarily have to execute the entire program - perhaps only a portion of it.
* The SPMD model, using message passing or hybrid programming, is
  probably the most commonly used parallel programming model for
  multi-node clusters.

===== Multiple Program Multiple Data (MPMD)

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_3_up/public/mpmd_model.gif?itok=6VwXCz5b[MPMD model diagram,width=352,height=98]

* Like SPMD, MPMD is actually a "high level" programming model that can
  be built upon any combination of the previously mentioned parallel
  programming models.
* MULTIPLE PROGRAM: Tasks may execute different programs simultaneously.
  The programs can be threads, message passing, data parallel or hybrid.
* MULTIPLE DATA: All tasks may use different data
* MPMD applications are not as common as SPMD applications, but may be
  better suited for certain types of problems, particularly those that
  lend themselves better to functional decomposition than domain
  decomposition (discussed later under Partitioning).

[[Designing]]
=== Designing Parallel Programs

[[DesignAutomatic]]
==== Automatic vs. Manual Parallelization

* Designing and developing parallel programs has characteristically been
  a very manual process. The programmer is typically responsible for both
  identifying and actually implementing parallelism.
* Very often, manually developing parallel codes is a time consuming,
  complex, error-prone and iterative process.
* For a number of years now, various tools have been available to assist
  the programmer with converting serial programs into parallel programs.
  The most common type of tool used to automatically parallelize a serial
  program is a parallelizing compiler or pre-processor.
* A parallelizing compiler generally works in two different ways:

====== Fully Automatic

* The compiler analyzes the source code and identifies opportunities for
  parallelism.
* The analysis includes identifying inhibitors to parallelism and
  possibly a cost weighting on whether or not the parallelism would
  actually improve performance.
* Loops (do, for) are the most frequent target for automatic
  parallelization.

====== Programmer Directed

* Using "compiler directives" or possibly compiler flags, the programmer
  explicitly tells the compiler how to parallelize the code.
* May be able to be used in conjunction with some degree of automatic
  parallelization also.
* The most common compiler generated parallelization is done using
  on-node shared memory and threads (such as OpenMP).
* If you are beginning with an existing serial code and have time or
  budget constraints, then automatic parallelization may be the answer.
  However, there are several important caveats that apply to automatic
  parallelization:
** Wrong results may be produced
** Performance may actually degrade
** Much less flexible than manual parallelization
** Limited to a subset (mostly loops) of code
** May actually not parallelize code if the compiler analysis suggests
  there are inhibitors or the code is too complex
* The remainder of this section applies to the manual method of
  developing parallel codes.

[[DesignUnderstand]]
==== Understand the Problem and the Program

Programs = algorithms + data + (hardware)

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_2_up/public/hotspotBottleneck2.jpeg?itok=M6jbDySu[Visual representations of hotspots and bottlenecking to be identified in programs.,width=400,height=500]

* Undoubtedly, the first step in developing parallel software is to
  first understand the problem that you wish to solve in parallel. If you
  are starting with a serial program, this means understanding the
  existing code also.
* Before spending time in an attempt to develop a parallel solution for
  a problem, determine whether or not the problem is one that can actually
  be parallelized.
** Example of an easy-to-parallelize problem:

**Calculate the potential energy for each of several thousand independent
conformations of a molecule. When done, find the minimum energy
conformation.**

This problem is able to be solved in parallel. Each of the molecular
conformations is independently determinable. The calculation of the
minimum energy conformation is also a parallelizable problem.

* Example of a problem and algorithm with little-to-no parallelism:

**Calculation of the first 10,000 members of the Fibonacci series
(0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...) by use of the formula:** +
 +
*F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)*

The calculation of the F(n) value uses those of both F(n-1) and F(n-2),
which must be computed first.

An example of a parallel algorithm for solving this problem (using
Binet's formula):

\[ F_n = \frac{\varphi^n - (-\varphi)^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}} 
       = \frac{\varphi^n - (-\varphi)^{-n}}{2\varphi - 1}.\]

where

\[ \varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.61803 39887...\]

link:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_2_up/public/2021-10/formula2.png?itok=6ykKC9XA[formula 2,width=536,height=68]


* Identify the program's *_hotspots_*:
** Know where most of the real work is being done. The majority of
  scientific and technical programs usually accomplish most of their work
  in a few places.
** Profilers and performance analysis tools can help here
** Focus on parallelizing the hotspots and ignore those sections of the
  program that account for little CPU usage.
* Identify *_bottlenecks_* in the program:
** Are there areas that are disproportionately slow, or cause
  parallelizable work to halt or be deferred? For example, I/O is usually
  something that slows a program down.
** May be possible to restructure the program or use a different
  algorithm to reduce or eliminate unnecessary slow areas
* Identify inhibitors to parallelism. One common class of inhibitor is
  _data dependence_, as demonstrated by the Fibonacci sequence above.
* Investigate other algorithms if possible. This may be the single most
  important consideration when designing a parallel application.
* Take advantage of optimized third party parallel software and highly
  optimized math libraries available from leading vendors (IBM's ESSL,
  Intel's MKL, AMD's AMCL, etc.).

[[DesignPartitioning]]
==== Partitioning

* One of the first steps in designing a parallel program is to break the
  problem into discrete "chunks" of work that can be distributed to
  multiple tasks. This is known as decomposition or partitioning.
* There are two basic ways to partition computational work among
  parallel tasks: *_domain decomposition_* and *_functional
  decomposition_*.

===== Domain Decomposition

In this type of partitioning, the data associated with a problem is
decomposed. Each parallel task then works on a portion of the data.

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/domain_decomp.gif?itok=G9jZZ6KH[Domain decomposition diagram,width=388,height=216]

There are different ways to partition data:

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/distributions.gif?itok=PoIx_-Ov[Varying data distributions,width=502,height=386]

===== Functional Decomposition

In this approach, the focus is on the computation that is to be
performed rather than on the data manipulated by the computation. The
problem is decomposed according to the work that must be done. Each task
then performs a portion of the overall work.

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/functional_decomp.gif?itok=ebU6SxnD[Functional decomposition diagram,width=587,height=353]

Functional decomposition lends itself well to problems that can be split
into different tasks. For example:

====== Ecosystem Modeling

Each program calculates the population of a given group, where each
group's growth depends on that of its neighbors. As time progresses,
each process calculates its current state, then exchanges information
with the neighbor populations. All tasks then progress to calculate the
state at the next time step.

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/functional_ex1.gif?itok=i1XuhWZh[Ecosystem modeling diagram,width=567,height=221]

====== Signal Processing

An audio signal data set is passed through four distinct computational
filters. Each filter is a separate process. The first segment of data
must pass through the first filter before progressing to the second.
When it does, the second segment of data passes through the first
filter. By the time the fourth segment of data is in the first filter,
all four tasks are busy.

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/functional_ex2.gif?itok=BXzioZP-[Signal processing diagram,width=680,height=263]

====== Climate Modeling

Each model component can be thought of as a separate task. Arrows
represent exchanges of data between components during computation: the
atmosphere model generates wind velocity data that are used by the ocean
model, the ocean model generates sea surface temperature data that are
used by the atmosphere model, and so on.

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/functional_ex3.gif?itok=pSV_k5_k[Climate modeling diagram,width=372,height=257]

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/climateModelling.png?itok=-Ybvup9U[Climate Modelling,width=680,height=661]

* Combining these two types of problem decomposition is common and natural.

[[DesignCommunications]]
==== Communications

===== Who Needs Communications?

The need for communications between tasks depends upon your problem:

====== You DON'T need communications

* Some types of problems can be decomposed and executed in parallel with
  virtually no need for tasks to share data. These types of problems are
  often called *_embarrassingly parallel_* - little or no communications
  are required.
* For example, imagine an image processing operation where every pixel
  in a black and white image needs to have its color reversed. The image
  data can easily be distributed to multiple tasks that then act
  independently of each other to do their portion of the work.

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/black2white.gif?itok=95RBONGV[Example of an "embarrassingly parallel" problem as described
above.,width=300,height=301]

====== You DO need communications

* Most parallel applications are not quite so simple, and do require
  tasks to share data with each other.
* For example, a 2-D heat diffusion problem requires a task to know the
  temperatures calculated by the tasks that have neighboring data. Changes
  to neighboring data has a direct effect on that task's data.

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/heat_partitioned.gif?itok=SxPYllVV[2-D heat diffusion problem as described above,width=300,height=301]

===== Factors to Consider

There are a number of important factors to consider when designing your
program's inter-task communications:

====== Communication overhead

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/commOverhead.jpeg?itok=N2aTtw22[telephone wires,width=500,height=332]

* Inter-task communication virtually always implies overhead.
* Machine cycles and resources that could be used for computation are
  instead used to package and transmit data.
* Communications frequently require some type of synchronization between
  tasks, which can result in tasks spending time "waiting" instead of
  doing work.
* Competing communication traffic can saturate the available network
  bandwidth, further aggravating performance problems.

====== Latency vs. bandwidth

* *_Latency_* is the time it takes to send a minimal (0 byte) message
  from point A to point B. Commonly expressed as microseconds.
* *_Bandwidth_* is the amount of data that can be communicated per unit
  of time. Commonly expressed as megabytes/sec or gigabytes/sec.
* Sending many small messages can cause latency to dominate
  communication overheads. Often it is more efficient to package small
  messages into a larger message, thus increasing the effective
  communications bandwidth.

====== Visibility of communications

* With the Message Passing Model, communications are explicit and
  generally quite visible and under the control of the programmer.
* With the Data Parallel Model, communications often occur transparently
  to the programmer, particularly on distributed memory architectures. The
  programmer may not even be able to know exactly how inter-task
  communications are being accomplished.

====== Synchronous vs. asynchronous communications

* Synchronous communications require some type of "handshaking" between
  tasks that are sharing data. This can be explicitly structured in code
  by the programmer, or it may happen at a lower level unknown to the
  programmer.
* Synchronous communications are often referred to as *_blocking_*
  communications since other work must wait until the communications have
  completed.
* Asynchronous communications allow tasks to transfer data independently
  from one another. For example, task 1 can prepare and send a message to
  task 2, and then immediately begin doing other work. When task 2
  actually receives the data doesn't matter.
* Asynchronous communications are often referred to as *_non-blocking_*
  communications since other work can be done while the communications are
  taking place.
* Interleaving computation with communication is the single greatest
  benefit for using asynchronous communications.

====== Scope of communications

* Knowing which tasks must communicate with each other is critical
  during the design stage of a parallel code. Both of the two scopings
  described below can be implemented synchronously or asynchronously.
* *_Point-to-point_* - involves two tasks with one task acting as the
  sender/producer of data, and the other acting as the receiver/consumer.
* *_Collective_* - involves data sharing between more than two tasks,
  which are often specified as being members in a common group, or
  collective. Some common variations (there are more):

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/collective_comm.gif?itok=0kyAvP3_[Examples of collective communication: broadcast, scatter, gather and reduction.,width=680,height=448]

====== Efficiency of communications

* Oftentimes, the programmer has choices that can affect communications
  performance. Only a few are mentioned here.
* Which implementation for a given model should be used? Using the
  Message Passing Model as an example, one MPI implementation may be
  faster on a given hardware platform than another.
* What type of communication operations should be used? As mentioned
  previously, asynchronous communication operations can improve overall
  program performance.
* Network fabric—different platforms use different networks. Some
  networks perform better than others. Choosing a platform with a faster
  network may be an option.

====== Overhead and complexity

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/helloWorldParallelCallgraph.gif?itok=XpJHZXvB[Example of parallel Communications and Complexity: actual callgraph from the
simple parallel "hello world" program shown.,width=680,height=370]

Finally, realize that this is only a partial list of things to consider!

[[DesignSynchronization]]
==== Synchronization

* Managing the sequence of work and the tasks performing it is a
  critical design consideration for most parallel programs.
* Can be a significant factor in program performance (or lack of it)
* Often requires "serialization" of segments of the program.

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/sychronization2.jpeg?itok=-t8FDWg1[Synchronization example,width=468,height=312]

===== Types of Synchronization

====== Barrier

* Usually implies that all tasks are involved
* Each task performs its work until it reaches the barrier. It then stops, or "blocks".
* When the last task reaches the barrier, all tasks are synchronized.
* What happens from here varies. Often, a serial section of work must be
  done. In other cases, the tasks are automatically released to continue
  their work.

====== Lock / semaphore

* Can involve any number of tasks
* Typically used to serialize (protect) access to global data or a
  section of code. Only one task at a time may use (own) the lock /
  semaphore / flag.
* The first task to acquire the lock "sets" it. This task can then
  safely (serially) access the protected data or code.
* Other tasks can attempt to acquire the lock but must wait until the
  task that owns the lock releases it.
* Can be blocking or non-blocking.

====== Synchronous communication operations

* Involves only those tasks executing a communication operation.
* When a task performs a communication operation, some form of
  coordination is required with the other task(s) participating in the
  communication. For example, before a task can perform a send operation,
  it must first receive an acknowledgment from the receiving task that it
  is OK to send.
* Discussed previously in the Communications section.

[[DesignDependencies]]
==== Data Dependencies

===== Definition

* A *_dependence_* exists between program statements when the order of
  statement execution affects the results of the program.
* A *_data dependence_* results from multiple use of the same
  location(s) in storage by different tasks.
* Dependencies are important to parallel programming because they are
  one of the primary inhibitors to parallelism.

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/dependencies1.jpeg?itok=761Xt8eY[Data dependencies,width=321,height=319]

===== Examples

====== Loop carried data dependence

....
    DO J = MYSTART,MYEND
       A(J) = A(J-1) * 2.0
    END DO
....

* The value of A(J-1) must be computed before the value of A(J),
  therefore A(J) exhibits a data dependency on A(J-1). Parallelism is
  inhibited.
* If Task 2 has A(J) and task 1 has A(J-1), computing the correct value
  of A(J) necessitates:
** Distributed memory architecture - task 2 must obtain the value of
  A(J-1) from task 1 after task 1 finishes its computation
** Shared memory architecture - task 2 must read A(J-1) after task 1 updates it

====== Loop independent data dependence

....
    task 1        task 2
    ------        ------

    X = 2         X = 4
      .             .
      .             .
    Y = X**2      Y = X**3
....

* As with the previous example, parallelism is inhibited. The value of Y
  is dependent on:
** Distributed memory architecture - if or when the value of X is
  communicated between the tasks.
** Shared memory architecture - which task last stores the value of X.
* Although all data dependencies are important to identify when
  designing parallel programs, loop carried dependencies are particularly
  important since loops are possibly the most common target of
  parallelization efforts.

===== How to Handle Data Dependencies

* Distributed memory architectures - communicate required data at
  synchronization points.
* Shared memory architectures -synchronize read/write operations between
  tasks.

[[DesignLoadBalancing]]
==== Load Balancing

* Load balancing refers to the practice of distributing approximately
  equal amounts of work among tasks so that all tasks are kept busy all of
  the time. It can be considered a minimization of task idle time.
* Load balancing is important to parallel programs for performance
  reasons. For example, if all tasks are subject to a barrier
  synchronization point, the slowest task will determine the overall
  performance.

|===

===== How to Achieve Load Balance

====== Equally partition the work each task receives

* For array/matrix operations where each task performs similar work,
  evenly distribute the data set among the tasks.
* For loop iterations where the work done in each iteration is similar,
  evenly distribute the iterations across the tasks.
* If a heterogeneous mix of machines with varying performance
  characteristics are being used, be sure to use some type of performance
  analysis tool to detect any load imbalances. Adjust work accordingly.

====== Use dynamic work assignment

* Certain classes of problems result in load imbalances even if data is
  evenly distributed among tasks:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",]

|===

* When the amount of work each task will perform is intentionally
  variable, or is unable to be predicted, it may be helpful to use a
  *_scheduler-task pool_* approach. As each task finishes its work, it
  receives a new piece from the work queue.

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/schedulerTaskPool.gif?itok=12VZ0qW5[scheduler-task pool diagram,width=680,height=267]

* Ultimately, it may become necessary to design an algorithm which
  detects and handles load imbalances as they occur dynamically within the
  code.

[[DesignGranularity]]
==== Granularity

===== Computation / Communication Ratio

* In parallel computing, granularity is a qualitative measure of the
  ratio of computation to communication.
* Periods of computation are typically separated from periods of
  communication by synchronization events.

===== Fine-grain Parallelism

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_3_up/public/granularity2.gif?itok=K0D-17Mm[Fine-grain parallelism,width=290,height=214]

* Relatively small amounts of computational work are done between
  communication events.
* Low computation to communication ratio.
* Facilitates load balancing.
* Implies high communication overhead and less opportunity for
  performance enhancement.
* If granularity is too fine it is possible that the overhead required
  for communications and synchronization between tasks takes longer than
  the computation.

===== Coarse-grain Parallelism

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_3_up/public/granularity3.gif?itok=BMppgttv[Coarse-grain parallelism,width=290,height=214]

* Relatively large amounts of computational work are done between
  communication/synchronization events
* High computation to communication ratio
* Implies more opportunity for performance increase
* Harder to load balance efficiently

===== Which is Best?

* The most efficient granularity is dependent on the algorithm and the
  hardware environment in which it runs.
* In most cases the overhead associated with communications and
  synchronization is high relative to execution speed so it is
  advantageous to have coarse granularity.
* Fine-grain parallelism can help reduce overheads due to load imbalance.

[[DesignIO]]
==== I/O

===== The Bad News

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_1_up/public/memoryAccessTimes.gif?itok=dbD8WfBx[Memory hierarchy,width=555,height=258]

* I/O operations are generally regarded as inhibitors to parallelism.
* I/O operations require orders of magnitude more time than memory operations.
* Parallel I/O systems may be immature or not available for all platforms.
* In an environment where all tasks see the same file space, write
  operations can result in file overwriting.
* Read operations can be affected by the file server's ability to handle
  multiple read requests at the same time.
* I/O that must be conducted over the network (NFS, non-local) can cause
  severe bottlenecks and even crash file servers.

===== The Good News

* Parallel file systems are available. For example:
** GPFS: General Parallel File System (IBM). Now called IBM Spectrum Scale.
** Lustre: for Linux clusters (Intel)
** HDFS: Hadoop Distributed File System (Apache)
** PanFS: Panasas ActiveScale File System for Linux clusters (Panasas, Inc.)
** And more - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_systems#Distributed_parallel_file_systems
* The parallel I/O programming interface specification for MPI has been
  available since 1996 as part of MPI-2. Vendor and "free" implementations
  are now commonly available.
* A few pointers:
** Rule #1: Reduce overall I/O as much as possible.
** If you have access to a parallel file system, use it.
** Writing large chunks of data rather than small chunks is usually
  significantly more efficient.
** Fewer, larger files performs better than many small files.
** Confine I/O to specific serial portions of the job, and then use
  parallel communications to distribute data to parallel tasks. For
  example, Task 1 could read an input file and then communicate required
  data to other tasks. Likewise, Task 1 could perform write operation
  after receiving required data from all other tasks.
** Aggregate I/O operations across tasks - rather than having many tasks
  perform I/O, have a subset of tasks perform it.

[[DesignDebug]]
==== Debugging

* Debugging parallel codes can be incredibly difficult, particularly as
  codes scale upwards.
* The good news is that there are some excellent debuggers available to assist:
** Threaded - pthreads and OpenMP
** MPI
** GPU / accelerator
** Hybrid
* Livermore Computing users have access to several parallel debugging
  tools installed on LC's clusters:
** TotalView from RogueWave Software
** DDT from Allinea
** Inspector from Intel
** Stack Trace Analysis Tool (STAT) - locally developed at LLNL
* All of these tools have a learning curve associated with them.
* For details and getting started information, see:

[[DesignPerformance]]
==== Performance Analysis and Tuning

* As with debugging, analyzing and tuning parallel program performance
  can be much more challenging than for serial programs.
* Fortunately, there are a number of excellent tools for parallel
  program performance analysis and tuning.
* Livermore Computing users have access to several such tools, most of
  which are available on all production clusters.
* Some starting points for tools installed on LC systems:

* This example demonstrates calculations on 2-dimensional array
  elements; a function is evaluated on each array element.
* The computation on each array element is independent from other array
  elements.
* The problem is computationally intensive.
* The serial program calculates one element at a time in sequential order.
* Serial code could be of the form:

....
    do j = 1,n
      do i = 1,n
        a(i,j) = fcn(i,j)
      end do
    end do
....

* Questions to ask:
** Is this problem able to be parallelized?
** How would the problem be partitioned?
** Are communications needed?
** Are there any data dependencies?
** Are there synchronization needs?
** Will load balancing be a concern?

===== Parallel Solution 1

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_3_up/public/array_proc2.gif?itok=Cict07K0[Array processing with elements evenly distributed,width=297,height=247]

* The calculation of elements is independent of one another - leads to
  an embarrassingly parallel solution.
* Arrays elements are evenly distributed so that each process owns a
  portion of the array (subarray).
** Distribution scheme is chosen for efficient memory access; e.g. unit
  stride (stride of 1) through the subarrays. Unit stride maximizes
  cache/memory usage.
** Since it is desirable to have unit stride through the subarrays, the
  choice of a distribution scheme depends on the programming language. See
  the link:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/distributions_0.gif[Block - Cyclic
  Distributions Diagram] for the options.
* Independent calculation of array elements ensures there is no need for
  communication or synchronization between tasks.
* Since the amount of work is evenly distributed across processes, there
  should not be load balance concerns.
* After the array is distributed, each task executes the portion of the
  loop corresponding to the data it owns.
* For example, both Fortran (column-major) and C (row-major) block
  distributions are shown:

Column-major:

....
do j = mystart, myend 
  do i = 1, n 
    a(i,j) = fcn(i,j) 
  end do 
end do
....

Row-major:

....
for i (i = mystart; i < myend; i++) { 
  for j (j = 0; j < n; j++) { 
    a(i,j) = fcn(i,j); 
  }
}
....

* Notice that only the outer loop variables are different from the
serial solution.

====== One possible solution:

* Implement as a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) model - every task
  executes the same program.
* Master process initializes array, sends info to worker processes and
  receives results.
* Worker process receives info, performs its share of computation and
  sends results to master.
* Using the Fortran storage scheme, perform block distribution of the
  array.
* Pseudo code solution: [.text-danger]#red# highlights changes for
  parallelism.

....
    find out if I am MASTER or WORKER
      
    if I am MASTER
      
      initialize the array
      send each WORKER info on part of array it owns
      send each WORKER its portion of initial array
      
      receive from each WORKER results
      
    else if I am WORKER
      receive from MASTER info on part of array I own
      receive from MASTER my portion of initial array

      # calculate my portion of array
      do j = my first column,my last column
        do i = 1,n
          a(i,j) = fcn(i,j)
        end do
      end do

      send MASTER results

    endif
....

===== Parallel Solution 2: Pool of Tasks

* The previous array solution demonstrated static load balancing:
** Each task has a fixed amount of work to do
** May be significant idle time for faster or more lightly loaded
  processors - slowest tasks determines overall performance.
* Static load balancing is not usually a major concern if all tasks are
  performing the same amount of work on identical machines.
* If you have a load balance problem (some tasks work faster than
  others), you may benefit by using a "pool of tasks" scheme.

====== Pool of tasks scheme

* Two processes are employed

Master Process:

* Holds pool of tasks for worker processes to do
* Sends worker a task when requested
* Collects results from workers

Worker Process: repeatedly does the following

* Gets task from master process
* Performs computation
* Sends results to master

* Worker processes do not know before runtime which portion of array
  they will handle or how many tasks they will perform.
* Dynamic load balancing occurs at run time: the faster tasks will get
  more work to do.
* Pseudo code solution: [.text-danger]#red# highlights changes for
  parallelism.

....
    find out if I am MASTER or WORKER

    if I am MASTER

      do until no more jobs
        if request send to WORKER next job
        else receive results from WORKER
      end do

    else if I am WORKER

      do until no more jobs
        request job from MASTER
        receive from MASTER next job

        calculate array element: a(i,j) = fcn(i,j)

        send results to MASTER
      end do

    endif
....

====== Discussion

* In the above pool of tasks example, each task calculated an individual
  array element as a job. The computation to communication ratio is finely
  granular.
* Finely granular solutions incur more communication overhead in order
  to reduce task idle time.
* A more optimal solution might be to distribute more work with each
  job. The "right" amount of work is problem dependent.

[[ExamplesPI]]
==== PI Calculation

image:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/styles/no_sidebar_3_up/public/pi1.gif?itok=Ntytsna3[Pi,width=352,height=455]

* The value of PI can be calculated in various ways. Consider the Monte
  Carlo method of approximating PI:
** Inscribe a circle with radius *r* in a square with side length of *2__r__*
** The area of the circle is *Πr2* and the area of the square is *4r2*
** The ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square is: +
 +
*Πr2 / 4r2 = Π / 4*
** If you randomly generate *N* points inside the square,
approximately +
 +
*N * Π / 4* of those points (*M*) should fall inside the circle.
** *Π* is then approximated as: +
 +
*N * Π / 4 = M +
 +
Π / 4 = M / N +
 +
Π = 4 * M / N*
** Note that increasing the number of points generated improves the
  approximation.
* Serial pseudo code for this procedure:

....
    npoints = 10000
    circle_count = 0

    do j = 1,npoints
      generate 2 random numbers between 0 and 1
      xcoordinate = random1
      ycoordinate = random2
      if (xcoordinate, ycoordinate) inside circle
      then circle_count = circle_count + 1
    end do

    PI = 4.0*circle_count/npoints
....

* The problem is computationally intensive—most of the time is spent
  executing the loop
* Questions to ask:
** Is this problem able to be parallelized?
** How would the problem be partitioned?
** Are communications needed?
** Are there any data dependencies?
** Are there synchronization needs?
** Will load balancing be a concern?

* Another problem that's easy to parallelize:
** All point calculations are independent; no data dependencies
** Work can be evenly divided; no load balance concerns
** No need for communication or synchronization between tasks
* Parallel strategy:
** Divide the loop into equal portions that can be executed by the pool of tasks
** Each task independently performs its work
** A SPMD model is used
** One task acts as the master to collect results and compute the value of PI
* Pseudo code solution: [.text-danger]##red ##highlights changes for parallelism.

* Most problems in parallel computing require communication among the
  tasks. A number of common problems require communication with "neighbor" tasks.
* The 2-D heat equation describes the temperature change over time,
  given initial temperature distribution and boundary conditions.
* A finite differencing scheme is employed to solve the heat equation
  numerically on a square region.
** The elements of a 2-dimensional array represent the temperature at
  points on the square.
** The initial temperature is zero on the boundaries and high in the middle.
** The boundary temperature is held at zero.
** A time stepping algorithm is used.
* The calculation of an element is *_dependent_* upon neighbor element values:

* This problem is more challenging, since there are data dependencies,
  which require communications and synchronization.
* The entire array is partitioned and distributed as subarrays to all
  tasks. Each task owns an equal portion of the total array.
* Because the amount of work is equal, load balancing should not be a concern
* Determine data dependencies:

  belonging to a task are independent of other tasks
** link:https://hpc.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/heat_edge.gif[border elements] are
  dependent upon a neighbor task's data, necessitating communication.
* Implement as an SPMD model:

  collect results from all workers
** Worker processes calculate solution within specified number of time
  steps, communicating as necessary with neighbor processes

==== 1-D Wave Equation

* In this example, the amplitude along a uniform, vibrating string is
  calculated after a specified amount of time has elapsed.
* The calculation involves:
** the amplitude on the y axis
** i as the position index along the x axis
** node points imposed along the string
** update of the amplitude at discrete time steps.

* The equation to be solved is the one-dimensional wave equation:

....
    A(i,t+1) = (2.0 * A(i,t)) - A(i,t-1) + (c * (A(i-1,t) - (2.0 * A(i,t)) + A(i+1,t)))
....

where c is a constant

* Note that amplitude will depend on previous timesteps (t, t-1) and
  neighboring points (i-1, i+1).
* Questions to ask:
** Is this problem able to be parallelized?
** How would the problem be partitioned?
** Are communications needed?
** Are there any data dependencies?
** Are there synchronization needs?
** Will load balancing be a concern?

===== 1-D Wave Equation Parallel Solution

* This is another example of a problem involving data dependencies. A
  parallel solution will involve communications and synchronization.
* The entire amplitude array is partitioned and distributed as subarrays
  to all tasks. Each task owns an equal portion of the total array.
* Load balancing: all points require equal work, so the points should be
  divided equally
* A block decomposition would have the work partitioned into the number
  of tasks as chunks, allowing each task to own mostly contiguous data
  points.
* Communication need only occur on data borders. The larger the block
  size the less the communication.
