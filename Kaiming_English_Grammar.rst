   林语堂，一位学贯中西、博古通今的大学者。他用英文创作的《京华烟云》《吾国与吾民》《生活的艺术》
   等系列作品曾经轰动欧美文坛，一度蝉联美国畅销书排行榜首，并多次再版，影响深远，其中有的被美国
   大学选为教材。其作品将旷怀达观、隐情遣兴、高雅唯美的中国人生价值观传达给西方世界，改变了西方
   人过去认为中国是落后愚昧的传统看法和偏见。

   林语堂早年留学美国、德国，获哈佛大学文学硕士，莱比锡大学语言学博士。回国后在清华大学、北京大学、
   厦门大学任教。1945 年赴新加坡筹建南洋大学，任校长。曾任联合国教科文组织美术与文学主任、国际笔
   会副会长等职。林语堂于1940年和1950年先后两度获得诺贝尔文学奖提名。曾创办《论语》《人世间》
   《宇宙风》等刊物，作品包括小说《京华烟云》《啼笑皆非》。散文和杂文文集《人生的盛宴》《生活的艺术》
   以及译著《东坡诗文选》《浮生六记》等。1966 年定居台湾，1967 年受聘为香港中文大学研究教授，主持
   编撰《林语堂当代汉英词典》，林语堂视此为写作生涯巅峰之作。

   2015年7月， 《光明日报》刊登了一篇报道，标题是“林语堂英译《红楼梦》原稿在日本被发现”。
   2014年，南开大学的一位从事《红楼梦》日文翻译研究的博士从资料中了解到，1973年，日本翻译家
   佐藤亮一曾收到林语堂寄给他的《红楼梦》英译原稿，并在几个月后又收到了修改稿。佐藤亮一将林语堂
   英译《红楼梦》转译成日文并于 1983 年在日本出版。顺着这条线索，几经辗转，这位南开的博士终于
   在日本的一家图书馆看到了这份珍贵的原稿，包括林语堂的解说、序章以及 64 章译文。林语堂的英译不是
   完整翻译，而是对《红楼梦》全本 120 回的编译。

   原稿用打字机单面打印，共 859 页，厚约 9cm。稿纸上有林语堂在不同时期用黑、蓝、红笔对稿件
   所作的大量修改笔记，还有两页英文手写稿。原稿的第一页是英文书名“The Red Chamber Dream”；
   书名下是副标题“A Novel of a Chinese Family”，并注明“By Tsao Hsueh-chin”、
   “Translated and Edited by Lin Yutang”。

   20 世纪初，林语堂从圣约翰大学毕业到清华大学任教。初到北京，他发觉自己因为上教会学校，把国文
   忽略了，“结果是中文仅仅半通”。为此，他开始在中文上下功夫：“首先，我看《红楼梦》，借此学北京话。
   袭人和晴雯的语言之美，使多少想写白话的中国人感到脸上无光。”

   My Country and My People《吾国吾民》一书中，林语堂是这样向外国读者介绍《红楼梦》的：

      I regard the Red Chamber Dream as one of the world's masterpieces. 
      Its character-drawing, its deep and rich humanity, its perfect finish 
      of style and its story entitle it to that. Its characters live, 
      more real and more familiar to us than our living friends, and each 
      speaks an accent which we can recognize. 

   林语堂认为《红楼梦》人物鲜活，展现了深刻而丰富的人性，加之完美的风格和动人的故事，完全当得起
   世界级名著。小说中的人物比我们身边的朋友还要真实和熟悉，我们甚至能够分辨出他们讲话的口音和腔调。

   林语堂对《红楼梦》中的人物也有极富个人色彩的分析：

      Taiyu and Paots'a have become the nation's sweethearts, and a number 
      of other types are there, too: the impetuous Ch'ingwen, the feminine 
      Hsijen, the romantic Hsiangyun, the womanly T'anch'un, the garrulous 
      Fengchieh, the talented Miaoyu, all there for one to settle one's 
      choice upon, each representing a different type. The easiest way to 
      find out a Chinaman's temperament is to ask him whether he likes 
      Taiyu more or Paots'a more. If he prefers Taiyu, he is an idealist, 
      and if he prefers Paots'a, he is a realist. If he likes Ch'ingwen, 
      he will probably become a good writer, and if he likes Hsiangyun, he 
      should equally admire Li Po's poetry. 

   在林语堂看来，《红楼梦》中的林黛玉和薛宝钗属于大众情人，此外，还有性情刚烈的晴雯，女人味十足的
   袭人，浪漫的湘云，少女情怀的探春，能说会道的凤姐，才情过人的妙玉.....。林语堂还能据此来判断人
   的性情。如果一个人喜欢黛玉，他就是理想主义者，如果他喜欢宝钗，那就是现实主义者。这种判断方法简
   单易行，但未必准确。按照这个逻辑，如果两个都喜欢，那就是“理想的现实主义者”，或者是“现实的理想
   主义者”；但如果两个都不喜欢，那这个人可就不好办了，neither here nor there， 必是个缺乏个性，
   寡淡无味之人！当然，林语堂是用最为简捷的语言和方法向外国人介绍《红楼梦》，这样可能更容易为西方
   读者所接受，我们也不必过于较真儿。

   林语堂在《红楼梦》上是下了大功夫的。1943 年出版的《无所不谈合集》中，关于《红楼梦》的专题论文
   就有十二篇之多。如：《说晴雯的头发兼论红楼梦后四十回》、《续论红楼后四十回问题》、《说高鹗手定
   的红楼梦稿》、《红楼梦人物年龄与考证》、《新发现曹雪芹订百二十回红楼梦本》、《再论红楼百二十回
   本》、《平心论高鹗》等。此外，他还单独翻译并发表了林黛玉的《葬花吟》。我想这些应该是林语堂为翻
   译《红楼梦》所做的准备。

   林语堂翻译了《红楼梦》，却看不到英译本，很是遗憾，那就先看看他翻译的《葬花吟》吧。

   黛玉的《葬花吟》是一首长古，七言为主，对仗、平仄和押韵的要求不似七律诗那样严格，但由于篇幅较长，
   更易于叙事和抒情。林语堂没有拘泥于字句，而是采用了意译的方式，还原了原诗的缠绵伤感的情绪。

      花谢花飞飞满天，红消香断有谁怜？

      游丝软系飘春榭，落絮轻沾扑绣帘。

      FLY, FLY, ye faded and broken dreams

      Of fragrance, for the spring is gone!

      Behold the gossamer entwine the screens,

      And wandering catkins kiss the stone.

   一个 fly 不够，林语堂连用了两个来对应原诗中的“飞满天”，把“红消香断”译成 faded and broken 
   dreams of fragrance, 意思是“春花残梦”，“有谁怜”三字没有翻译，代之以 for spring is gone
   （因为春天已经过去）。faded, broken, gone,  一句话里三个很无奈的过去分词叠加在一起，向读者
   传递暮春的气氛。太多伤感，太多无奈，仿佛李后主的“林花谢了春红，太匆匆！” 
   
   “香榭”和“绣帘”没有直译，林语堂用了 screens 和 stone, 回避了外国读者不易明白的 fragrant 
   pavilion 和 embroidered curtain, 也使译文不至于太冗长，影响诗的形态结构，最后的 stone
   还能与前面的 gone 押韵。


Editor's Note
-------------

   The present volume is a slightly abridged reprint of
   Lin Yutang's original work, which first appeared in 1933
   under the imprint of Kaiming Shudian and ran into ten editions 
   within less than fifteen years. The only justification that can
   be offered for bringing out a new edition of an old book such
   as this is that it has retained to this day much of its original
   novelty in the light of some latest developments in the
   methodology of forign language teching.

   This is a book based on notional principles. Here grammar is 
   regarded as a science of expression, and not as a dry-as-dust
   collection of categorical rules plus equally categorical
   exceptions. In the treatment of English grammatical facts the
   principle adopted is to processed from the inner meaning to
   the outward form, and not the other way round.

   It will be seen that the principles lying back of this grammar
   have very much in common with those of the communicative approach,
   notional or functional syllabus, etc., which have caught the 
   imagination of so many applied linguists and language teachers. 
   A review of the Kaiming English Grammar makes one feel that all
   these innovations are not so very new after all. One is even 
   tempted to think that Lin Yutang's book, with its lucid explanations 
   and copious illustrative examples, eompares rather favourably of 
   notions and their ways of expression given in these books are often 
   about as interesting as the menu of an English restaurant.

   Nor was Lin Yutang the originator of the new concept of 
   teaching grammar. As was acknowledged, he owed it to the
   works of Benedetto Croce, Ferdinand Brunot, Henri Frei, and
   more specifically of Otto Jespersen, notably his Philosophy of 
   Grammar and Modern English Grammar, whose influence is evident 
   in many papges of the present work.

   It is interesting to note that in 1933, about three years
   after Lin Yutang had finished working on this grammar,
   Jespersen himself produced a one-volume grammr embodying
   the principle explained in The Philosophy of Grammar, entitled
   Essentials of English Grammar, A comparison of Jespersen's
   book with the Kaiming English Grammar will show that
   foreign students of English may derive as much, if not more,
   benefit from that latter as from the former.

   Compared with many foreign-published English grammars,
   Lin Yutang's book has one extra merit to recommentd itself to
   Chinese students of English. it not only explains how English
   differs from Chinese in the way of expressing the same notions,
   but goes deeper to show how speakers of the two languages
   often differ in their very notions and introduces the student
   to the English way of thinking that is new to him. The book
   might be counted as one of the first serious attempts at 
   practical comparative or contrastive grammar of English and
   Chinese, the need for which has been felt for so long.

   Despite the "modernity" of the idea behind the book, the 
   Kaiming English Grammar suffers from some obvious drawbacks,
   as is to be expected for a book written nearly half
   a century ago.

   Although the illustrative examples are mostly given in
   idiomatic English, many of them having been cuded from
   standard English works, the language used would appear
   a bit old-fashioned in some cases according to present-day
   standard. This applies to an even greater extent to the 
   Chinese examples, which would often seem rather odd to today's 
   readers. Some definitions and explanations would also need 
   reformulating.

   But the most serious drawback of all is to be found in the
   "notions" expressed in quite a few of the examples given in
   the book, which are at times irritatingly trivial and in some 
   cases downright harmful. This defect detracts from the value of the book.

   As this is an English grammar intended for teachers and
   students at advanced levels, no attempt has been made to
   do away with all such examples in this edition. The editor
   has done little more than leaving out the more glaring
   ones besides correcting noticed errors, typographical and otherwise.
   The old system of transliterating Chinese characters
   originally used has also been kept intact, partly to serve as a 
   reminder that this is an old book republished for the read
   to make a judicious use of.

Preface
-------

   **The Science of Expression**

   The Kaiming English Grammar represents the application of a 
   new philosophy of grammar to the teaching of English grammar
   to Chinese students. It regards all grammatical forms and
   constructions as merely means of expressing notions, and
   grammar itself as a science of expression. Instead of starting 
   from the outward form to the inner meaning, it starts from the 
   outward form to the inner meaning to the outward form, from the
   notions to the expression of these notions. Consequently, 
   instead of concerning itself with the definitions and analysis 
   of word-froms and formal changes, it goes deeper into the psychology 
   of the speaker's mind which he is trying to express, and by
   what grammatical means he expresses them. Grammar,
   therefore, concerns itself with (1) the notions, and (2)
   the expression of these notions. To these questions all 
   grammatical changes and constructions are related and made
   subordinate. This emancipated view of grammar is made
   possible through the ideas of Benedetto Croce, and, more 
   specifically, through the epoch-making works of Otto Jespersen
   (The Philosophy of Grammar, 1924) and Ferdinand Brunot  
   (La pensée et la langue, 1922).

   **Chinese and English Compared**

   In a way, the Kaiming English Grammar contains within
   its covers the adumbrations of a new comparative grammar
   of the English and the Chinese language. This, again,
   reduces itself to a compariion of the English and Chinese
   notional categories and the different means employed to
   express these notions. The points mentioned, however, are
   strictly of a practical, rather than theoretical, nature,
   and are made in order to help the Chinese students overcome 
   certain psychological difficulties. Many common grammatical 
   mistakes can be corrected very easily by this psychological 
   method, and by no other way. Where there are 
   national differences in the notions themselves, the obvious
   way is of course to train the Chinese students in the new
   way of thinking. And where common notions exist in
   both languages, as in the majority of grammatical categories,
   the most interesting thing would be to show how 
   differently the two languages express these notions. English 
   grammar, presented in this way, therefore, teaches the 
   English ways of thinking and expression. The student is
   constantly made to ask himself this question: If have a 
   given idea, how shall I express it in English?

   **Why Mistakes Are Made**

   The distinction between notions and their expressions
   is merely a logical, not a real, one. There is no thinking
   which is not a way of expression, and no expression which
   is not a way of thinking. We think while we talk, and
   many ladies talk in order to find out what they think. The
   ways of thinking and expression are really inseparably bound
   up with each other. Consequently, there can be no grammar
   claiming to teach the expressions which does not at the
   same time teach the ways of thinking. When grammatical
   mistakes are made, it is because the ways of thinking 
   and habits of expression are wrong. Mistakes are of two
   kinds: those due to foreign ways of thinking, found naturally
   among the foreign students of a language, and those due
   to other psychological causes, like conflict of ideas, change
   of mind, human forgetfulness, influence of near-by words,
   etc. Mere knowledge of rules does not prevent eigher the
   foreign student or the native speaker from making mistakes.
   The only sensible way of teaching grammar and making it 
   effective is, therefore, to regard it as the science of expression 
   and build up certain correct, idiomatic habits of thinking
   and expression through repeated and systematic drills.

   **Grmmar or No Grammar?**

   The failure of the teaching of grammatical rules to 
   ensure correctness of expression has caused many people to
   throw grammar contemptuously aside, and advocate progressive 
   and assimilative reading to take the place of conning
   over grammatical paradigms. So far as this method emphasizes
   the building of unconscious habits rather than rigmarole
   grammar, it is quite sound. The advocate of progressive 
   reading, however, is labouring under a fear-complex,
   regarding grammar as the student's bugaboo. There is no
   reason why this should be so, when grammar is regarded, as
   it should be regarded, as merely a series of systematic drills
   on classes of expressions which every speaker must employ.
   No sane advocate of the reading-without-grammar method
   would deny that the value of such reading lies really in
   picking up turns of expression in living contexts, and that
   by arranging these turns of expression in notional classes and
   providing systematic drills, the picking up of such expressions
   can be made much easier and more pleasant. There is 
   no gainsaying the fact that coming across a lone expression
   here and there and finding its parallels after long intervals
   is less effective and less convincing than having that lone
   example immediately reinforced by a dozen other examples 
   of the same class and construction. Put in this way,
   there can be no argument against grammar.

   **The Bugaboo of Rules**

   I should have mentioned a third cause of grammatical
   mistakes, that due to efforts at "correctness" and fear of
   breaking grammatical rules. This fear can be carried so
   far as to override all natural idioms. The poor boy who 
   begins to say "Whom are you?" after having learnt grammar 
   at a night-school, or the Ziegfeld Follies girl who
   says "between you and I" with some sort of conscious pride
   is really only labouring under a confusion of mind engendered
   by the subtle rules of grammar. Even among foreign
   students, this type of grammar with so many "don'ts" and
   "shall-nots" is more likely to make the school-boy feel he
   is treading treacherous ground in a room full of traps and
   secret doors rather than using plain English to express his
   ideas. Such abominations as "if war will break out next week"
   and "I had been sick before yesterday noon" are
   only the products of this type of grammar teaching. 
   Psychologically speaking, correctness is the enemy of natural
   expressiveness, and the teaching of grammar, instead of 
   increasing the student's power of expression, can actually become
   the nightmare which makes all natural expressiveness impossible.

   **All Grammatical Rules Leak**

   But there is a deeper logical reason for the futility of
   rules. It is Edward Sapir, the gifted philologist, who says
   that all grammatical rules leak. There is nothing harder to
   bear than the college graduate who has learnt or taught a
   little grammar, and who, always armed with rules of tense
   sequence or syntax in much the same sense as a professional
   layer is armed with the articles of a criminal code,
   jumps upon your "let alone ..." into a "letting alone ...", 
   insisting that it must be a participial phrase, or changing your
   "the boat sails next Monday" into "the boat will sail, etc."
   If the incidental remarks contained in this book can help to 
   shake the teacher's faith in rules and reveal the more 
   intimate phases of an Englishman's speech, it will have 
   served some purpose.

   **A Grammar without Rules**

   It is time that we replace the categorical rules and
   equally categorical exceptions with more observation of the
   living facts of the language. The power of expression can be 
   trained only by learning the expressive, ever-changing idioms,
   and not by putting on the grammatical strait-jacket. 
   Grammar, as the science of expression, should be more subtle and
   less rigid; it should address itself more to the speaker's 
   intentions and less to the rules and definitions. It should be
   more concrete and wallow less in the terms of Latin origin.
   It should also be more positive and less like a criminal code.
   It has been the effort of the present author to replace such
   categorical rules by observations on the preset usage. The
   English language is a living thing, and this is the only way to 
   deal adequately with it. It is hoped that, through this means,
   the student will form a more intimate acquaintance with modern
   English usage than is otherwise possible.

   It remains only to acknowledge my great debt to all
   previous writers on the subject who take the same views of
   grammar as I do. My debt to Prof. Jespersen and his 
   Mordern English Grammar and Philosophy of Grammar will
   be evident to all users of the said books. I have incorporated 
   his views and examples in this book on many points,
   although, naturally, I have not dared to go quite as far
   in the matter of new terminology in a book that is intended
   for general school use. Thus, I have managed to keep all
   the eight parts of speech intact, for instance. Above all, I
   have derived courage from him, as well as from Prof. Ferdinand
   Brunot and M. Henri Frei, for this somewhat heretical
   venture. Thanks are also due to the authors of the
   Concise Oxford Dictionary and Mordern English Usage for 
   enlightening articles and examples.

Ch I The Science of Expression
------------------------------

   (This chapter may be omitted for less advanced classes;
   the contents, however, must be fully explained to the students
   by the teacher, so that they will get a new way of looking
   at grammar.)

   1.10. Something to Say and Way of Saying It. 一 You
   have already studied English for three or four years. You
   know already something about the parts of speech and the
   forms and relations of words, like singular and plural,
   subject and predicate, etc. Now we want to make a more
   general study of the different forms and relations, and this
   we call the study of English grammar.

   Probably you have heard that grammar is dificult and
   dry. This is not true. It is difficult and dry if you study
   it in the wrong way, if you try only to remember the rules
   and definitions. It should not be difficult or uninteresting,
   if you study the many living idioms and forms of expressions, 
   and find out how an Englishman would express an
   idea which you have in mind. To study how the English
   people express an idea, and compare it with the Chinese way
   is always useful, and sometimes highly interesting.

   In everything we say, there are always (1) something to
   say, and (2) the way of saying it. We shall call the former
   the notions, and the latter the expression of these notions.
   We must understand that grammar has nomeaning for us
   except to teach us about these notions and the ways of
   expressing them. In studying English grammar in this book,

.. _P002:

   we shall always ask ourselves this question: If we have this
   idea, how shall we express it?

   1.11. We must understand that all grammatical forms
   and constructions are simply ways of expressing notions. If
   we have the idea that it's raining outside, we express this
   in Chinese by saying hsia—yu la (下雨了), or perhaps t'ien
   hsia—yu la (天下雨了), and in English by saying It rains.
   But It rains means the same thing as hsia—yu la, although
   the way of saying it is different.

   If we look closely, we see the English expression has
   a subject it, which is absent in the Chinese sentence. We
   find also the letters (pronounced [z]) added to the word
   rain, which is also not found in Chinese. But the 
   construction with it and —s is really only a means of expressing
   an idea or notion. In the following, we shall fnd the English 
   language has different grammatical forms for the general 
   idea It rains::

      It rains.              下雨了。
      Does it rain?          下雨了吗？
      Is it raining?         正在下雨吗？
      It is going to rain.   要下雨了。
      Has it rained?         下过了雨吗？
      Did it rain?           (昨天)下了雨吗?

   You see the changes in Is it —ing? Has it —ed? Did it—?
   are not useless changes of form merely, but are the means
   of expressing notions. Again take the sentences::

      He strikes me. I strike him.

   In Chinese, we would simply say::
   
      Ta ta wo（他打我)。 Wo ta fa (我打他)。



.. _P003:

   English uses the forms `me` and `him` to express the persons
   that are objects of the verb strike. But in Chinese, we express 
   the same idea just as clearly by always putting the object 
   behind the verb. This word-order in Chinese has the
   same grammatical value or purpose as the English distinction
   between I and me, he and him. Sometimes, this object-notion 
   is expressed in Chinese by the use of pa, as in pamen
   t'ui k'ai (把门推开, push open the door), pajen ta ssǔ（把
   人打死，kill the man), and pa ch'ien ch'iang tsou (把钱抢走,
   rob his money). The use of pa to introduce the object, therefore, 
   may be regarded as a Chinese grammatical means for
   expressing the object--notion.

   1.20. Grammar as the Science of Expression.--In the
   above, we have seen already that two languages may express
   the same notion or idea by different grammatical means. That
   is why the study of a foreign grammar should be very interesting, 
   because it teaches us to compare the two languages,
   and helps us to express our ideas in the correct foreign way.
   Take, for instance, the group of notions called “Number.”
   We find there are notions of indefinite number, like more than
   sixty, or 六十多，六十余. Some Chinese students often
   make the mistake of saying sixty more, whereas the correct
   English way is to say over sixty, or sixty--odd. The old-style
   grammars do not teach this, because the old-style grammars
   are interested only in the forms of singular and plural, like girl,
   girls | child, children. They do not bother about the rest when
   there is no change in word-form. We have to study this
   expression over sixty, because we start from the notion we
   wish to express, and here is an English expression that we
   must learn. Again, the old-style grammars teach us that
   there are three degrees of comparison, like hot, hotter, 

.. _P004:

   hottest | early, earlier, earliest, because there are these three 
   changes in word--form. As a matter of fact, there are not only
   three, but a thousand varying degrees, and as many ways of
   expressing them, like less hot, not so very hot, rather hot,
   just hot enough, too hot, hot enough to burn your fingers, so
   hot that you can hardly breathe, as hot as a furnace, etc. All
   these expressions are as much a part of English grammar
   as the expressions hot, hotter, hotest. Again, among the
   notions of number, there is the Chinese notion of ch'eng(成)
   or tenths and there is the English notion of percentage: the
   correct English expression for pa-ch'eng-wu (八成五) is simply 
   eighty--five per cent. If we thus proceed form one group
   of notions to another, we shall soon learn all the important
   English forms of expression for the chief kinds of ideas and
   relationships.*

   We shall thus study many things that are not found
   in the old-style grammar books. And in the study of the
   changes in form, like It rains, It rained, It has rained, it has
   been raining, etc., which are found in the old-style grammars,
   we shall study them not as empty forms to be repeated and
   memorized, but as means of expressing some ideas which we
   have in our mind.

   [*] Of course we cannot study all the expressions in the language,
   which is the work of the dictionary. The difference between a book
   of grammar and a dictionary or book of phrases is that grammar
   deals with only the types or classes of expressions, and the dictionary
   deal; with particular expressions. According to Sweet, grammar deals
   with the general facts of language, lexicology with special facts.(Henry
   Sweet, Collected Papers, quoted by Jespensen, The Philesophy of
   Grammar, p. 32)

.. _P005:

   1.30. National Differences in Notions and Their Expressions.
   All languages differ in their ways of expressing notions, 
   and no one can say which language is right and which
   is wrong. All expressions are coirect that serve to express
   our ideas clearly and adequately. It rains, with a false subject, 
   is as correct English as hsia-yu la, without any subject
   whatsoever, is correct Chinese. The English and Chinese
   languages differ both in notions and in their expressions.
   For instance, in Chinese, we can use the word pai both as
   an adjective and a noun, as in pai ma chi pai (白马之白,
   Mencius), but in English, we have to say the whiteness of a
   white horse. On the other hand, in speaking of rich people
   and poor people, we may simply say the poor, the rich in
   English, but in Chinese we have to say p'in cheh, fu cheh
   (贫者, 富者) besides pin-min, fi--hu(贫民, 富户). Again, it
   is perfectly all right to say I'a p'a (他怕, literarily,“He
   afraid") in Chinese, but in English, we have to add the con-
   necting verb and say He is afraid. These are differences in
   ways of expression.

   1.31. Not only are English and Chinese expressions
   different, sometimes the notions themseives differ in the two
   languages. Thus the vague idea expressed by should in I
   should think so is absent in Chinese, and to learn this expression, 
   the Chinese student of English has first to learn the
   notion itself. This goes back to the English distinction 
   between fact and fancy, and is a way of avoiding stating I
   think so too definitely as a fact. There is the same notional
   distinction between It is all right and It would be all right,
   the latter being a more polite and less cocksure way of
   saying the former. Many Chinese students can never learn
   to use these expressions, because they are never taught this

.. _P006:

   English distinction between fact and fancy.

   On the other hand, we can think of Chinese notions
   which are not found in English. Thus the Chinese tentative
   action, as in ta-i-ta (打一打), or hsi-i-hsi (洗一洗), is difficult
   to express in English, because the English genearally do not
   have this notion, although they sometimes express it in saying
   take a look, have a taste (=看一看, 尝一尝). Our Chinese
   ideas of family relationships with a very sharp sense (or
   notion) of superiority and inferiority and sex distinction, as
   in the different ranks of brothers, cousins, nephews, uncles
   and aunts（哥哥, 弟弟, 表妹, 堂姊, 外甥, 侄女, 舅, 丈, 蛉, 姨) 
   are difficult to express in English, because the
   English people generally do not make much of such distinctions. 
   In English, the wife's brother, the husband's brother,
   the elder sister's husband, and the younger sister's husband
   are all called brothers-in-law.

   1.32. English grammar should, therefore, teach us the
   English ways of thinking and expression. We should learn
   to say the whiteness of a white horse (not white of white horse),
   over sixty (not sixty more), in three minutes (not three minutes 
   more), I should think so (not always I think so), It would
   be all right (not always It is all right) and the poor and the
   rich (not always poor people and rich people). It should
   teach us always to say He is afraid (not He afraid), He becomes 
   tired (not He tired), and always to say It rains, instead 
   of the Chinese Rain already. To learn these English
   ways of thinking and expression is the object of our study
   of English grammar.

   1.40. Formal and Notional Grouping of Grammatical
   Facts.--There are two ways of arranging the facts of 
   grammar and of studying them. One is the old way, and that

.. _P007:

   is to study the parts of speech one by one, first the nouns,
   then the pronouns, etc., and learn how each part of specch
   may be changed in form. Thus we study, for instance, first
   the changes in nouns due to gender (tiger--tigress, ox-cow),
   or number (child---children, mouse--mice), then the changes in
   pronouns due to case (he---his--him) or number (this---these,
   that--those), then the changes in adjectives (hot--hotter-
   hottest), the changes in verbs (I go, you go, he goes), etc.
   This way may be called the formal way of grouping grammatical 
   facts, where we chiefly study the changes in form
   and their meaning. This is looking at grammar from the
   outside: we start from the outer form to the inner meaning,
   from the expression to the content.

   Another and better way is to look at grammar from
   the inside, and start from the idea we wish to express to
   its expression, from inner meaning to outer form. We thus
   group all the grammatical means of expression according to
   the class of notions or ideas which they express, like number
   and quantity, weight and value, modification, comparison and
   degree, time of action, fact and fancy, relationships, etc.
   Under each group, we study how these ideas are expressed
   in English. All means of expressing the same class of notions 
   are studied together, whether they are adjectives, adverbs, 
   pronouns or conjunctions. Thus, under the notion of
   “Time," we study all the ways of expressing time, including
   the tenses of the verbs (come, came, shall come), the adverbs
   of time (always, never, soon, three times a week, etc.) and the
   conjunctions regarding time (until, since, as soon as), etc.
   Under the notion “Modification,” we study at the same
   time all the kinds of modifiers, whether they be adjectives
   (good work), adverbs (well done), nouns,(an inch wide), infinitives

.. _P008:

   (nothing to do), participles (boiling water), or word--
   groups (Sunday afternoon concert). This may be called a
   notional grouping, and the different chapters are arranged
   according to notional groups or categories.

   In this way, we study the changes of different parts of
   speech also, but only in connexion with the notions which
   these changes help to express. For instance, we do not
   learn the expression He has returned just as a form in the
   “indicative mood, present perfect, third person singular”
   (as in the old grammars), but as a form expressing a condition,
   and contrast it with He returned as expressing an action. He
   has returned means the same thing as He is at home now,
   while He returned expresses a totally different notion, viz.
   that He took the journey home, or He turned back. Thus we
   learn in each case how to use the grammatical form studied.

   1.41. Outline of the Course.--In this book, we shall
   follow the second or new way, which is according to notional
   groups. We shall first study the parts of speech and see how
   words used in different parts of speech (nouns used as 
   adjectives, adjectives used as nouns, etc.) are changed. This
   gives us a general idea of the relationship between word--
   class (part of speech) and word-form, and makes us acquainted
   with the formal endings like -cy, -ness, -ly (secrecy, 
   goodness, decidedly: Ch. II). Next we shall study the different
   moods of sentences, and learn the various ways of making
   statements or denials, asking questions, giving commands,
   expressing doubts and hopes, etc. (Ch. III). Nextunder the
   general notion of “Things”(Ch. IV), we learn the English
   distinctions of persons and things, abstract and concrete
   things, mass-words, personification and gender (Ch. IV).

.. _P009:

   Then we go on to study the English notions of number, quantity 
   (much, many, seven per cent), weight, value (pound, shilling),
   distance (yard, mile, within call), position and shape (Chs.
   V-VI). Then under “Representation” (Ch. VII), we shall
   study how words may be used to take the place of other words
   (chiefly covering the pronouns, but including also other ways
   of representation, as I told him to, for I told him to take the
   cover off). Then comes the group of expressions for determining 
   things, as which one? the one you saw, second, either...
   or, any old thing, etc. (Ch. VIII). In Chapter IX, we shall
   learn all the ways by which words are used to describe or 
   modify other words, and the relations between the modifiers and
   the modified. In the next chapter (Ch. X), we shall study
   the different expressions of degree. We come then (Ch. XI)
   to a discussion of the ideas of “Action”, and first come the
   notional classes called “Aspects of Action” (as begin to read,
   keep on reading, make one read, etc). These ideas must be
   made clear before we can use the English verbs properly.
   Then follows a chapter on “Transitive Action” (Ch. XII:
   relations between subjects and objects, use of active and 
   passive, action of objects, etc.) and next a chapter on “Time of
   Action” (Ch. XIII: present, past, future, coming after,
   coming at the same time, etc.). Chapter XIVis devoted
   to a discussion of the English distinction between fact and
   fancy (the verbal moods) which is so strange to the Chinese
   ways of thinking. In Chapter XV, we shall learn the different 
   ways of expressing relationships (chiefly dealing with
   conjunctions and prepositions, as since, because, instead of,
   including, unless, in accordance with, in order that). We 
   discuss in this chapter also the use of punctuation marks to
   indicate such relationships. Finally (Ch. XVI, Economy of

.. _P010:

   Expression), we shall bring together all the English ways of
   simplifying expressions which often make our sentences easier, 
   more natural and more idiomatic.

   1.42. Living Grammar.--By following this plan of study,
   we shall cover all the material usually found in grammar
   books, and more besides, but always in close connexion with
   the English thoughts and expressions. English grammar is
   thus made living and full of meaning for us. Under the
   notional head in each chapter, we shall have plenty of time
   to get acquainted with all the English ways of thinking and
   expression connected with it, and thus we shall gradually learn
   to think in English and express ourselves as an Englishman
   would in his native language.

Ch II Parts Of Speech And Change Of Function
--------------------------------------------

The Eight Parts of Speech
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   2.10. The Eight Parts of Speech or Word-Classes.

   ::

      (1) Nouns .........  dog, book, table, school, John, China, water,
                           sound, work, idea, kindness, strength, anger, 
                           danger, order.
      (2) Pronouns ......  I, you, he, her, who, this, those, which.
      (3) Verbs .........  cut, strike, see, think, breathe, feel, know,
                           grow, be, become, must, will, dare.
      (4) Adjectives ....  good, bad, hot, red, lazy, kind, strong, angry,
                           dangerous, orderly.
      (5) Adverbs .......  how, when, why, where, well, poorly, now,
                           never, soon, suddenly, here, already.
      (6) Prepositions...  in, out, above, under, against, toward, with,
                           without, at, during, by.
      (7) Conjunctions ..  and, or, because, although, unless, since, both
                           and, if, then, while.
      (8) Exclamations ..  oh! what! ah! there! look! heavens! fire! help!
                           my purse! what a liar!

   The above are the so-called Parts of Speech, or eight
   grammatical classes of words. A part of speech simply
   means a class of words. There are classes of words, just
   as there are classes of animals or plants. Thus the words
   dog, book, China belong to one class, and cut, strike, breathe
   belong to another, just as we put rats, rabbits and squirrels
   in one class, and dogs, wolves and foxes in another.

.. _P012:

   2.11. Definitions.--The purpose of a definition is to help
   us decide what a thing is and what it is not. The definitions 
   of the parts of speech are to help us decide to what
   part of speech a word belongs. Such definitions are not
   easy to find, and are often as inaccurate as grammatical
   rules. But practically we do feel there are eight classes of
   words, and the following definitions will be found generally
   useful. We can best decide to what class a word belongs by
   looking at its grammatical function, i. e., the work it does in
   the sentence.

   (1) Nouns denote things.

      A thing may or may not be visible (as table, sound,
      grammar); it may be living or dead (man, dog, pencil); it
      may be an action or event (a fall, a flood, a dinner, a meeting),
      or a condition or an invisible quality (sickness, beauty,
      cunning, danger, poverty).

   (2) Pronouns take the place of nouns.

      Thus in "John speaks to his mother, but she does not hear
      him", the word `she` takes the place of his mother, and `him`
      takes the place of John. In "Take this book, don't take that",
      the word `that` is a pronoun taking the place of that book.

   (3) Verbs tell what people or things do. (But the
       words is, can, must, will, have, etc. are also called verbs.)

      There is not one definition of the verb which is perfect. 
      Generally a verb is the important word which says
      something and gives life to the sentence. In "a good man",
      the meaning is dead, for we say nothing about the good
      man, but in "He is a good man", or "The man is good", the verb
      is at once gives life to the sentence.

.. _P013:

   (4) Adjectives modify nouns.
   
      They tell what people or things are like. Both in a
      sick man and The man is sick, the word sick modifies man,
      and shows what the man is like.

   (5) Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.

      Adverbs generally tell how, when, where or why a thing
      is done. Thus in He is running fast, He is running now,
      He is running there, the adverbs fast, now, there modify the
      verb is running. In very red and very soon, the adverb very
      modifies the adjective red and the adverb soon respectively.

   (6) Prepositions with the nouns following them form
       prepositional phrases which modity other words. The 
       preposition itself always shows some kind of relation。

      There is no preposition which is not followed by a noun
      or its equivalent, or which does not form a prepositional
      phrase. In He is in the house, we have the prepositional
      phrase in the house, with the preposition in. But in He is
      in (meaning “in the house”), the word in is regarded as an
      adjective because it does not have the prepositional function.
      In the house is a phrase modifying he. In He tallks like mad
      (like a mad man), the prepositional phrase like mad modifies
      the verb talks. All prepositional phrases are used either as
      adjectival or adverbial phrases.

   (7) Conjunctions join words or groups of words.

      In he and I, this or that, the words and, or are conjunctions. 
      In You may come this way or that way | You may
      come or you may go | I will not come until you go away, the
      words or, until join groups of words.

   (8) Exclamations (also called interjections) are words which we exclaim.

      We make exclamations when we are frightened, angry,
      or otherwise excited. He a gentleman! (meaning he is not)
      is as much an exclamation as oh! ah! what!

.. _P014:

   Exercise 1. (I) Give proper adjectives for describing students, 
   a lesson, a dress, eyes, song, food, face, as a lazy student,
   etc. See who can give the best adjectives.

   (II) Give some verbs to show what the following persons
   or things do: child, mother, teacher, student, dog, cat, ship,
   water, machine, lamp.

   (III) Use some verbs to show what you do in the morning
   before breakfast, after lunch, after school is over, after supper
   and before going to bed.

   (IV) Use the following adverbs in good, short sentences,
   and tell what they modify: now, quickly, never, always, already,
   yet, slowly, carefully, suddenly.

   (V) Use the following prepositional phrases, and show what
   they modify. Are they used as adjectives or as adverbs?
   ::

      1. in the garden        12. along the coast
      2. into the water       13. outside the school
      3. at once              14. after the class
      4. before long          15. during dinner
      5. for ever             16. at school
      6. at sunrise           17. under the bed
      7. near the desk        18. on the tree
      8. behind the wall      19. at the beginning
      9. for this purpose     20. to the end
      10. in what way?        21. by no means
      11. for this reason     22. in a hurry

   2.12. Grammatical Function.-You see from the above that 
   we determine the part of speech of a word by its grammatical 
   function, or by what it does in the sentence. Of course 
   a word may serve different functions at diffenent times,

.. _P015:

   just as a father may serve also as a family-doctor, or a wife
   may work also as a secretary. Thus we see the words `sleep`,
   `before` and `back` are used in different functions in the following
   sentences.
   ::

      He sleeps.                                        (as a vb.)
      He talks in his sleep.                            (as a n.)
      He walked before.                                 (as an adv.)
      He walked before me.                              (as a prep.)
      He had walked a mile before he came to the house. (as a conj.)
      At the back of the house.                         (as an.)
      Back parlour. Back pay.                           (as adjj.)
      Stand back!                                       (as an adv.)
      To back up a friend.                              (as a vb.)

   In fact, a word may serve a double function at the same
   time. In I bought a new hat which you saw this morning, the
   word `which` is at once used as a pronoun taking the place of
   hat, and as a conjunction connecting up the words you saw
   this morning with hat.

   2.13. Chinese and English Compared.--In Chinese, most
   words may serve in different functions without any change
   of form. Thus we use t'ien as a n. in 青天 (blue sky), as
   an adj., in 天资, 天堂(natural gift, heavenly palace), as an
   adv. in 天天 (everyday), as an excl. in 天啊! (Heavens!), as
   a vb. in 失其所天, when speaking of a woman who has lost
   her husband (literally, "loses what she heavens"), and as a
   substitute for the pron. your in 天颜, when we really mean
   your (or Your Majesty's) face in speaking to an emperor.
   In these various functions, the word t'ien itself remains 
   unchanged. Compare also the following uses of the word pai
   (white): as adj. and n. in 白马之白 (the whiteness of a white
   horse), as a vb. in 自白其志 (to explain one's mind), as verbal

.. _P016:

   adj. in 得大白于天下 (to have made clear one's position before 
   the public), as an adj. in the adv. phrase 白昼见鬼 (to
   see ghosts in broad daylight), and finally as an adv. in 
   白受损失 (to meet a loss without compensation). Sometimes, we do
   change the form of the word, as luan for disorderly as adj,
   and luan--tse in nao luan--tse (闹乱子) for creating disturbance,
   or making a scandal as a n.

   But in English, as a rule, the words change their form
   with the change in function. E. g.. we have admire, vb., 
   admiration, n., admirable, admiring, adiji, and admirably, 
   admiringly, advv. Hence, the Chinese student of English must
   learn to feel a sense of the different parts of speech before
   he can use the different forms correctly.

   Sense of Function

   2.14. Sense of Function.--There are five points in the
   sense of grammatical function which must be learnt by anybody
   who wants to speak correct English without difficulty. They
   are (1) the sense of thing (for nn.), (2) the sense of action
   (for vbb.), (3) the sense of quality (for adjj.), (4) the sense of
   manner and aspect (for advv. and adjj.), and (5) the sense of
   prepositional force (for prepp.). These feelings have not been
   trained in the Chinese student, because the Chinese language
   does not demand a vivid feeling of these grammatical differences. 
   For instance, whether a word is a vb. or an adj.
   generally makes no difference in Chinese grammar, but the
   Englishman feels the difference between He fears (vb.) and
   He is afraid (adj.). The Chinese student must therefore feel
   the same way as the Englishman does before he can handle 
   the parts of speech correctly and without difficulty.

.. _P017:

   Through the following exercises, the student will learn to
   feel the difference between nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs,
   and prepositions. The other three parts of speech, pronouns,
   conjunctions and exclamations are easy to recognize and are
   not so very different from the Chinese. When these are learnt,
   the student will find it easy to recognize the part of
   speech of any word he hears or reads.

   2.15. Sense of Thing.--A concrete thing, like table or
   chair, is regarded as a n. either in English or in Chinese.
   But actions (人事), invisible qualities (品性), and conditions
   (情况) regarded as nn. have peculiar forms which are strange
   to the Chinese mind. Study the following, and see how the
   nn, of action and the nn. of quality or condition are used
   exactly like other nn.
   ::

                                     NOUNS OF ACTION

      I love books.                           I love reading.
      Have you learnt this?                   Have you learnt swimming?
      The geography lesson is difficult.      Breathing under water is difficult.
      A pocket-knife is useful.               Letter-writing is useful.
      He stopped the car.                     She stopped singing.
      I teach grammar.                        You teach dancing.
      The boy slept during the class.         He slept also during the meeting.
      Then he slept before seven o'clock.     Then he slept before going to bed.
      He is like his father in his laziness.  This is like playing with fire.

      He is poor, but he enjoys his poverty.

      Lovers are blind, but never mind the blindness of the lovers, so
      long as love lasts.

      He is a good man, but his goodness cannot help him to pay debts.
      
      “Goodness""is such a variable term. According to the servant,
      a “good”master is one who gives five-dollar tips. A cat that
      catches mice is a "good” cat for men, but a very bad one
      for the mice.

      His handwriting was so small. I was surprised at the smallness
      of his handwriting.

      Cleanliness is as important in a cook as beauty in women.

      his strength.

      Honesty is the best policy in business, but the worst in war and
      politics.

   2.16. Sense of Action and Quality.--In English, the distinction 
   between vbb. and adjj. is vividly felt. This is the
   difference between “to do” and “to be,” to do an action,
   and to be a quality.
   ::

      Action                       Quality
      He studies hard.             He is diligent.
      He works hard.               He is hard--working,

      He fears me.                 He is afraid of me.
      He likes to sleep.           He is sleepy.
      He wakes up.                 He is awake.
      He grows up.                 He is big.
      He laughs.                   He is happy.

      He enjoys.                   He is pleased w'h it.

      Something hurts.             It is painful..
      Action offends.              It is offensive.

.. _P019:


   You see with the verbs, we always feel a sense of motion 
   or action, while with the adjectives, we feel a sense of
   quality, although the two may express the same general idea.

   Exercise 2. The teacher will give the sentences with the vbb.
   and let the students try to give the corresponding sentences with
   the adi. (Notice that we always use is, or some form of the verb
   to be, before the adj. in the above sentences. The word be must
   be added after must, will, can, etc. before adjj. If to be is not used,
   some other verb like feel, become, grow, get must be used in the
   predicate, as feel sorry, become poor.) E.g.一
   ::

      You must take care.              You must be careful.
      You have nothing to eat.         You must be (or: feel) hungry.
      He has gone.                     He has been away.
      Don't work too hard.             Don't be too diligent.
      I shall prepare everything.      I shall be (or: get) ready。

   Exercise 3. Put the proper words in the blanks before adjj.一

   1. I shall go soon, or I shall soon ______ away.
   2. You must prepare, or you must ______ ready.
   3. Has he had many things to do, or has he ______ busy?
   4. You mustn't forget your things, or you mustn't______forgetful.
   5. He had done too much work and he ______ very tired.
   6. Let us enjoy ourselves and ______ happy.
   7. Please _____ more careful next time.
   8. He has always _____ late.
   9. Learn to come in time, or learn to _____ punctual.

.. _P020:

   2.17. Sense of Aspect and Manner.--The sense of manner (情状) 
   which is expressed by adverbs is not new to Chinese. 
   The Chinese expressions with jan practically always
   express the same adverbial function. Thus we have 茫然
   (vaguely, in a lost state), 孑然（alone), 漠然（coldly)，欣然
   (glad, gladly), 霍然 (suddenly), 寂然(silently), 哑然（with a
   roar of laughter), 悚然, 凛然（with a feeling of awe), etc.
   But the sense of aspect (方面) is rather new: it is now expressed 
   in modern Chinese with the particles 上 and 的. For
   instance, we speak of the inequality of the sexes, but we
   may ask in what respect are they unequal, physically, mentally, 
   legally, or economically? This is now expressed in Chinese 
   by 体力上，智力上，法律上，经济上的不平等. We can
   also think of a person as physically and spiritually unclean
   (心邪形秽), and of a girl as attractive in appearance and
   intelligent in mind (秀外慧中). If a child's father is a great
   scholar but ugly-looking, while his mother is a silly pretty-
   looking doll, it makes a great difference in what respect the
   child resembles his father or mother. He may resemble his
   father in his brains and his mother in his looks, or he may
   be like the father in looks and like the mother in brains.
   Adverbs and adverbial phrases of aspect answer the question:
   in what regard? in regard to what? or in what way? This
   notion of aspect is quite important, because it makes our
   ideas more exact.(Adjectives may also express the same aspect 
   notion.)

   You want to be independent---how? Financially or spiritually?

   In what respect are men and women unequal? Physically, 

.. _P021:

   mentally, socially, legally, or economically? Are they equal in
   brains, in looks, in courage, in patience, in jealousy, in interest,
   in babies?

   The Chinese are superior to the English in patience, and the
   English are superior to the Chinese in political organization.

   Po--liang is better than Chung-ing in arithmetic, but Chunging 
   is better than Po-liang in old Chinese.

   Teh-lin is the best boy in studies in this class, Fu-ch'u is best
   in uthletics, and Kuo-fan is best in character.

   There is physical courage, and there is moral courage, the
   courage to say what one believes.

   A man who dare not say what he believes is a moral coward.
   The student is physically weak, but mentally strong.
   Miss B---- is desirable as a friend, but not as a wife.
   Playing the violin is good as a pastime, but not as a profession. 
   Exercise 4. Learn to use the following expressions:--
   ::

      1. in what respect?                16. useful as a servant
      2. in what way better?             17. kind in heart
      3. in many ways worse              18. kind in manners
      4. in some way useful              19. rich in wealth
      5. spiritual progress              20. rich in knowledge
      6. intellectual laziness           21. quick in thinking
      7. (laziness in thinking)          22. slow in action
      8. bodily strong                   23. charming in appearance
      9. financially independent         24. attractive in style
      10. politically fre                25. doubtful in character
      11. economically equal             26. laughable in conduct
      12. legally right                  27. great in ideas
      13. morally wrong                  28. pleasing in tone
      14. pleasant as a friend           29. good at mathematics
      15. good as a pastime              30. great at telling lies

   Of course most adverbs express manner, time and place.
   The adverbs of aspect are less common. but are comparativly
   new to the Chinese as a grammatical notion.

   2.18. Sense of Prepositional Force.
   ::

      Go with him.                       Walk behind me.
      Go without him.                    He comes for his hat.
      Sing for me.                       He recites without any mistake.
      Sing for money.                    She died because of love.
      Look at her.                       He died because of her.
      Listen to me.                      Get away from them.
      Away with it.                      Fight against them.
      Run after him.                     Shoot at it.
      Goacross the street.               He scolded me for no reason.
      Sitnear the fire.                  I am opposed to his coming.
      Lean upon the chair.               They parted without saying good bye,
      Stand against the door.            Are you afraid of being found out?
      Walk through the house.            He could not come on account of illness.
      Look through the key-hole.         
      Say good--bye before leaving       I have not seen him since that time.
      He talks without thinking.         You will be punished for doing this.
      I am tired of repeating this.      We shall fight against opium.

   In English, the class of words called prepositons are
   bound up in idea with the nn. following them, very much
   as transitive verbs are bound up in idea with their objects.
   ::

      I fear him.       I am afraid of him.
      Fight them.       Fight against them.

   We should read of him as one word, dropping the accent 
   entirely in him, just as in fear him. Chinese students
   often read him, them too clearly. In grammar, we say the
   first him and them are objects of verbs, and the second him
   and them are objects of prepositions. We say the prepositions
   “govern” their objects, just as transitive verbs govern their
   objects also. If what follows the preposition is a verb or
   an adjective, it is at once turned into a noun, as “without
   saying good-bye,""before leaving,""by his kindness.”

.. _P023:

   (In prepositional phrases like for ever, at once, before
   long, in short, from abroad, by far, like mad, the words ever,
   once, etc. are considered nn. by some grammarians, See
   also §2.50.)

   Exercise5. Learn to pronounce the following correctly, and
   make sentences with them. Fill in nn, after the prepp. in “e."
   ::

      (a) before him (drop tone)                 without knowing
          against them                           before beginning
          over them                              after listening

          because of her                         by working hard

Change of Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   2.20. Change of Function.--We have seen (§2.13) that
   in English words often change their form when their function

.. _P024:

   is changed, as had, badly, badness, or admire, admiration,
   admiringly. Since this is new to the Chinese student, he
   must learn how and when these changes are made. Sometimes, 
   of course, no change is necessary just as in Chinese, e. g., 
   he sleeps, and he talks in his sleep, and it would be bad
   English to say in his sleeping.

   2.21. Nouns Used as Adjectives.*--The use of nouns
   as adjectives without any change is more common than
   most of us realize. In this respect, English is quite like
   Chinese. Study the foltowing:--
   ::

      stone wall                 kitchen door
      cannon ball                carriage driver
      air castle paper           mill
      orange juice               Jeather factory
      straw hat                  book company
      cloth cover                table-cloth
      book-case                  sea bath
      silk handkerchief          honey-bee
      country road               milkmaid
      dog Latin (incorrect)      newspaper man
      horse-laugh (coarse)       mail man
      mouse-trap                 home country
      fly-paper                  hill-path
      middle-school student      fire brigade

      West Lake Exhibition       student days
      Chen brothers              bread--and-butter question
      clubfee Pacific            Mail Steamship Co.
      journey expenses           quinine tablet
      cable address              University of London graduate
      motor boat                 North--China Herald Office Building
      motor road                 

   *Really nn. used as “modifiers.” See Chap. IX.

.. _P025:

   In these phrases the preceding n. is always used as an
   adj, to modify the following n. The relation between them
   is quite various: stone wall means wall made of stone, honeybee 
   means bee producing honey, food problem means the problem 
   of food, and fire brigade means a brigade for fighting
   fire. One should Jearn this kind of expressions because it
   is simpler, and helps to make simpler sentence constructions
   possible. Thus it is easier and more natural to say the nine-o'clock 
   arithmetic class than to say the class in arithmetic which
   comes at nine o'clock, and it is easier to say the Pacific Mail
   Steamship Co. (or Co.'s) sailing schedule than to say the
   schedule for sailing of the Pacific Mail Steamship Co. It is
   better English to say He owns a paper mill than to say He
   owns a mill for manufacturing paper. It is more idiomatic to
   say motor roads than to say motor-car roads or roads for
   motor cars. A motor road is perhaps less exact, logically
   speaking, because the road is not run by motors, but it is
   better English.

   In this way, English is so much like Chinese. We say
   journey expenses for 旅费, China tea for 中国茶, fly-paper
   for 苍蝇纸 and Nanyang College President for 南洋公学校长.
   Moreover, this is often the only logical way. It would be
   wrong to say fiery brigade, watery pipe, geographical class
   and tubercular doctor for fire brigade, water-pipe, geography
   class and tuberculosis doctor. The pipe is not watery, and
   the class is not geographical, nor is the doctor suffering from
   tuberculosis himself. In other cases, both forms may be used:

.. _P026:

   college student or collegiate student, China tea or Chinese
   tea, Japan tour or Japanese tour, and South China or Southern 
   China. The use of the adjectival form tends to describe
   a quality of the object rather than the object itself.

   2.22. Nouns Changed into Adjectives.---Besides the above
   highly convenient way of using nn. as adjj, there are regular
   adjj. which are formed from nn. by adding certain endings
   or suffixes. Following are some of the common forms of
   adjj. made from nn.
   ::

      gold........... golden (colour)            ghost...... ghostly (voice)
      wood............wooden (bowl)              fog......... foggy (morning)
      earth............earthen (ware)            storm...... stormy (sea)
      oak............ oaken (chest)              cloud...... cloudy (sky)
      person......... personal (use)             wind...... windy (day)
      verb............ verbal (adjective)        rain ...... rainy (weather)
      nation......... national (custom)          drama ... dramatic (literature)
      nature......... natural (beauty)           partiot... patriotic (heart)
      pig ..........piggish (nature) 贪欲        Socrates...Socratic (dialogue)
      sheep ......... sheepish (face) 赧颜       bearded man
      child............childish (idea)           nine--headed brid 九头鸟
      girl ............ girlish (complexion)     round-eyed baby
      boy ............ boyish (fun)              three--legged cat
      self ........... selfish (inotive)         beautiful girl
      man............manly (appearance)          powerfulman
      woman ...... woman/y (grace)               fearful disorder
      gentleman... gentlemanly (conduct)         hopeful appearance
                                                 shameful look
      day ...........daily (experience)          skilful work
      week .......... weekly (visit)             powerless chief
      month.........monthly (test)               fearless enemy
      coward.........cowardly (thought)          hopeless case
      miser............niserly (habits)          shameless conduct

      Exercise6. Make sentences with some of the above phrases.

.. _P027:

   2.23. Noums Used as Verbs.-Some nn. can be used as
   vbb. without change of form.
   ::

      They stoned him to death.
      The gun was fired.
      Hand the money to me.
      We must back him up with money.
      We must face the problem squarely.
      He elbowed his way into the hall.
      Mr. Holmes eyed him for a moment.
      The party has been well photographed.
      The judge questioned the witness.
      He is named Peter after his father.

   The above examples include only words which usually
   serve as nn. This verbal use of regular nn. generally comes
   in to help express an idea which cannot be well expressed
   by the usual vbb. To “eye” a man (院视) is to look at
   him steadily for a moment with curiosity, anger, or suspicion. 
   To “knife” a man (暗计伤人) means also using some
   underhand method to injure a person. To “doctor” a news
   despatch (改窜电报) means to change many of its words so
   as to deceive the reading public. To “monkey” (耍弄) with
   a watch is to play with it like a monkey, with the possibil-
   ity of spoiling its machine, and to “ape” (效颦) a man
   means to imitate him as the ape imitates man.

   Besides the above, there are of course a great many words
   which commonly serve both as vbb and nn., as a cover, to
   cover up | a quick cure, to cure people | some trouble, to trouble
   a person| no desire, to desire, etc.

Verbs Used as Nouns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   2.30. Verbs Used as Nouns.---We have already learnt
   (§2.15) that actions are often regarded as nn. and that vbb.
   so used generally have an -ing added to them. This is the
   most common, but not the only way... We may say Talking

.. _P028:

   is easier than acting or To talk is easier than to act. The
   form with to is called the infinitive of a vb. “Infinitive” means
   “not limited”: it is so called because it expresses a general
   action and does not “belong” to any subject. It is opposed
   to the “finite” or limited vbb., which are limited by their
   subjects, as goes in He goes, and barks in A dog barks.

   It is very common, however, to use the infnitive in a
   sentence beginning with it. Instead of To talk is easier,
   we may say It is easier to talk. Here we seem to say It is
   easier, and then, as if to answer the question What is easier?
   add to talk. In fact, it is often easier and more idiomatic
   to say It requires a lot of money to build a fine house than to
   say To build a fine house requires a lot of money. Thus we
   get three ways of expressing the action as a n.

   A. Talking is easier than acting.
   B. To talk is easier than to act.
   C. It is easier to talk than to act.

   Exercise 7. Change the way of expressing the following sentences 
   according to the models “A,” “B,” “C” given above:一

   1. Learning English is not difficult, if you know how.
   2. It is not reading that is difficult; it is speaking that is difficult.
   3. Studying immediately after lunch is not good for digestion.
   4. Walking in the sunshine is good for health.
   5. Fishing is pleasant for lovers even when there is no fish.
   6. Going to town is enjoyable when one has plenty of money.
   7. To have nothing to do is sometimes a nuisance.
   8. Telling a lie is more difficult than telling the truth.
   9. It is difficult to remember the last lie that you told.
   10. There is nothing more awful than telling a lie to one who believes in you.
   11. There is nothing finer than to chat with your old friends around a fire.
   12. To call oneself a revolutionist is one thing; to be one is an- other.

   The most common form for vbb. used as nn. is still
   the form with -ing, especially after prepp., as after seeing,
   before leaving, etc.

   2.31. Verbs Changed into Nouns.--Besides the above
   general way of turning any vb. into a n., there are some
   regular nn. which are made from vbb. or are closely related
   to vbb. Can you give the vbb. for the following nn, and 
   spell them correctly?
   ::

      preparation         development     supper
      dictation           movement        speech

   2.32. Pairs of Nouns and Verbs.--Many of the commonest 
   vbb. can be used as nn. without any change, and it is
   important to notice these, because sometimes it would be
   bad English to use the form with -ing in the wrong place.
   ::

      make a promise                have a talk with one
      go for a walk                 have a quarrel
      during his sleep              have a hearty laugh
      in yourstudies                give one a surprise

      give a blow (strike)          tell a lie
      need more practice            has no push (魄力) in him
      the monthly test              has no pull (势力) behind him
      take some exercise            have nosay (发言权) in the matter
      dream a dream                 
      pay a visit                   in full swing (上轨道)

   Exercise9. Take some of the above words and make separate
   sentences, using them now as nn., now as vbb.

   There is a group of pairs of nn, and vbb. which slightly
   differ from one another in pronunciation, the end--consonant
   being soft or voiced in the vbb. and hard or voiceless in the
   nn. In the case of [f--v], this difterence may be seen in the
   spelling, but in the case of [s--z], and [a—-el, the difference
   is usually not indicated.

   The pronunciation with [-z] is most clearly seen in such
   phrases as using, use it ['ju:ziŋ, 'ju:zit], the housing ['hauziŋ]

   n., observed by careful writers, is only an orthographic
   distinction: the pronunciation is the same for both words.

   Another common distinction between nn. and vbb. is
   by the shifting of accent. In some pairs of words, this is
   quite generally accepted already. Following are some common

   2.33. Verbs Used as Adjectives: Participles.---You have
   probably already learnt about the two forms of vbb. called
   present and past participles. A participle simply means a word
   serving in two functions, as vb. and as adj. We can turn any
   vb. into an adj. by the use of these participial forms.

   The present participle is always formed by adding -ing
   to the vb. The past participle is formed by adding -ed for
   the regular vbb. and is quite various for the irregular vbb.

   The present participle expresses active or incomplete action,
   while the past participle expresses passive or complete action.
   Boiling water means hot water that is still boiling, while
   boiled water means water that has been boiled, which may
   or may not be hot. We can have iced boiled water, but we
   can never have iced water that is still boiling. In the same
   way, a drowning man is just going down the water and not
   dead yet, while a drowned man has already been drowned.
   We can hear cries for help from a drowning man, but not
   from one who is already drowned. Similarly, a stirring
   speech is a speech that stirs people, and an excited crowd is a
   crowd that has been excited or stirred by the speaker's exciting 
   speech. Compare the difference in the following phrases
   and sentences:--

   then use expressions with relative clauses and let the students turn

   dent) a flesh--eating animal.

   words ending in -e in the infinitive, and “D” contains some
   special cases.

   2.35. Verbs Changed into Adjectives.--Some regular adjj.
   are formed from vbb. The most common ending is -able, or
   sometimes -ible, which gives adjj. similar in meaning to Chinese 
   adjj. 可爱的, 可憎的, 可怜的, etc. Examples of adjj。
   with the -able and -ive endings are:

.. _P036:
   ::

      eatable lovable, loveable active
      unthinkable laughable talkative
      unbelievable terrible possessive
      desirable permissible relative
      allowable visible[可看见] suggestive [含意猥亵]
      excusable audible[可闻见] extensive[广~大]
      changeable| legible [可读得] impulsive[躁急]

   All these adjj. may be changed again into advv. by
   adding -ly, or changing -le into -ly (see §2.42).

Adjectives Changed into Nouns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   2.40. Adjectives Changed into Nouns.--We have seen
   (§2.15) that nn., like blindness, kindness, strength, poverty may
   be formed from the adjj. blind, kind, strong, poor. We thus
   think of these invisible qualities as independentnn. We must
   learn these nn. because nn. often enable us to make shorter
   sentences, which are more easily pronounced. I have no
   fear of his power is a shorter and more comfortable way of
   saying than I am not afraid although he is so powerful. And
   I do not know its length is simpler than I do not know how
   long it is. Also I was impressed by her kindness saves us the
   trouble of saying by her kind words, by her kind tone, by her
   kind looks, or by her kind treatment, all of which probably do
   not exactly express what I mean. Probably I really mean
   that I was impressed by the fact that she was so kind, and
   certainly this is better and more easily expressed by using
   the phrase by her kindness.

   8. I cannot understand why he is absent for so long.
   9. He is so generous that he is famous for it.
   10. What we want is that we should all be united.

   2.41. The Poor, the Dead, etc.--The English language
   has a way of using expressions like the poor, the rich, the
   strong, the oppressed to denote a class of things or persons.
   This also saves us the trouble of stating exactly what the
   objects are, and this way of stating a whole class is likely
   to be more accurate. When we say the oppressed, we mean
   all that are oppressed, whether they are farmers, rickshaw
   coolies, small shop-keepers, or newspaper editors. Some
   examples of these expressions are:--
   ::

      The living and the dead.            The oppressors and the oppressed.
      The rich and the poor.              Turn to the right, to the left.
      The false and the true.             A search for the unknown.
      The righteous and the wicked.       The young ought to be housed and fed.
      The meek and the humble. 
      The lame, the halt and the blind.   None but the brave deserve the fair.
      The modifiers and the modified.     You are trying the impossible.

.. _P038:
   
   These expressions mean the samething as those that are
   poor, those that are living, etc., and are very convenient to
   use. The same ideas are often expressed with the help of
   the word one, as the young ones, the fatones, etc. They
   correspond to the Chinese notion of 者 in 强者，弱者，贫者，
   富者，生者，死者，etc.

   Sometimes, some adjj. are used as nn. without any change,
   as Chinese for the Chinese language or the Chinese people.
   You are a dear is more expressive than You are dear. I may
   also mention the unmentionables by which some English ladies 
   mean trousers. Other instances are:--
   ::

      eatables [食物]                   sweets [糖食]
      drinkables [饮料]                 the French [法人]
      valuables [贵重物品]                the English [英人]]
      the ancients [古人]               the whites and blacks [白种人与黑种人]
      the moderns [现代人]               the white of an egg [蛋白]
      (im)movables  [(不)动产」           — the white of the eyes [眼白]
      the immortals [不朽者]             the green [公共草地]

   2.42. Adjectives Changed into Adverbs: the Ending -ly.一
   In English, adjj. are changed into advv. generally by adding
   -ly. Thus we say complete ignorance (adj.--n.), but completely 
   ignorant (adv.--adj.); unusual luck (adj.--n.), but unusually
   lucky (adv.--adj.). We also say beautiful singing, but She

.. _P039:

   sings beautifully. Thus the ending -ly becomes a general sign
   for advv. (compare, however, §2.22, man-manly, etc.). The
   student should remember to make this change when using such
   adverb modifiers. A good writer generally knows how to
   use his advv. Compare the following:--
   ::

      Adjj. + Nn.                        Advv. + Adjj.
      fearful dirt                       fearfully dirty
      awful noise                        awfully noisy
      total ignorance                    totally ignorant
      sudden illness                     suddenly ill
      great surprise                     greatly surprised
      unspeakable joy                    unspeakably joyful
      supreme happiness                  supremely happy
      gradual increase                   gradually increasing
      fatal wound                        fatally wounded
      moral responsibility               morally responsible
      blissfulignorance                  blissfully ignorant
      rightful place                     rightfully there
      wrong accusation                   wrongly accused

   The words hard, dead and fast may be used as advv.
   without adding -ly, as run fast, dead tired, dead asleep, work
   hard. Hardly (adv.) has a totally different meaning equal to
   "almost not." Its meaning is really negative: I can hardly
   hear you means I almost cannot hear you and you must talk
   louder.
   ::

      That is hardly enough         (=not quite enough).
      I hardly think so             (=I almost do not think so).
      I can hardly believe it       (=it is diffcult to believe).
      There's hardly a soul there   (=-almost no one there)。

   Scarcely means the same as hardly.

   Exercise 12. Make sentences with the following:--

.. _P040:
   ::

      1. think clearly               13. am dead aganist [极力反对]
      2. act quickly                 14. dead drunk [烂醉]
      3. feel keenly                 15. dead tired [疲极」
      4. walk slowly                 16. scarcely enough
      5. turn quickly                17. hopelessly ill
      6. can hardly believe          18. desperately poor
      7. hardly believable           19. entirely wrong
      8. utterly useless             20. greatly mistaken
      9. certainly right             21. awfully busy
      10. easily the first           22. terribly busy
      11. probably there             23. divinely beautiful
      12. possibly true              24. shockingly bad

   2.43. Knowingly, Decidedly, etc.--Participles, too, may
   form advv. with the ending -ly. Study the following:
   ::

      You are undoubtedly right.
      He is decidedly wrong.
      Cases of malaria are becoming increasingly frequent.
      He answered knowingly (=in a knowing manner)。
      He is admittedly (or: confessedly) a thief,
      We saw an amazingly clever magician
      The people were all talking confusedly.
      Eatsparingly (=don't eat too much).
      The letter was surprisingly well written (=I did not think he
         could write it so well).
      The King then reputedly sent him a cheque for £ 17,200!

   The “e" is pronounced in the -edly combination, although
   it may not be pronounced in the participles: thus confused
   [-zd] and marked {-kt], but confusedly [-zidlil and markedly
   [{-kidlil, as in markedly different.

   2.50. Prepositions Used as Adjectives.--In English, the
   short words called prepositions are very useful, and one
   should learn to use them in order to make one's language

.. _P041:

   idiomatic. Thus put the dress on is more idiomatic than
   wear the dress, and put the light out is more commonly used
   than extinguish the light. Following are examples of prepp.
   used as adjj.--
   ::

      The light is out.
      The ganne is on (=being played now).
      The meeting is off (=cancelled).
      His mind is off (=crazy)。
      We are off at last.
      Is he in (=in the house)?
      No, he is out (=not at home).
      Dinner is over (=finished).
      I am through with you (=I will have no more to do with you).
      She is up (=She has got up from bed).
      Is the meeting over (=finished) now?

   There are also some adjj. which are often used like
   prepp. We may say in cannot do it like you, and do not
   talk like that, the word like is a prep. and like that, like you
   are prepositional phrases used in adverbial functions. Yet
   in It looks like going to rain and He is like his father, the
   word like still has a very clear adjective function. We may
   call like in these cases a prepositional adjective, or an adjective 
   with the prepositional power of governing a noun.* Also
   the word near is often used as an adj. (He is nearer to us)
   and as a prepositional adj. (The man near her, He is nearer
   us).* On the other hand, far can never be used as a preposition 
   (far from here, far from it, but never far it). This shows
   that language is the product of usage and not of logical deductions, 

   [*] See Fowler: Modern English Usage, p. 325, and Pocket Oxford Dictionary, under like.

   [*] See Pocket Oxford Dictionary under near.

.. _P042:

   and that, in the study of grammar, our work should be 
   based on a careful observation of the many living facts of
   the language, rather than on a foolish belief in abstract
   grammatical rules.

   2.51. Adverbs and Prepositions Used as Nouns.

   The ups and downs (=rises and falls) of fortune or landscape,
   Have a down (=prejudice or dislike) on a person.

   Know all the ins and outs (=true details).

   Gointo whys and wherefores (=reasons) of it.

   We know neither our whence nor our whither (origin and des tiny).

   Compare the pros and cons (Latin prepp. = for and against)。

   Once is enough. For this once.

   The outside. The inside. The above.

   Notice also phrases like for ever, at once, before long, in.
   short, by far, from above, from under with the words ever,
   long, etc. treated like nn. (§2.18).

   2.52. Adverbs, Prepositions and Conjunctions.--In English, 
   the parts of speech prepositions, conjunctions and exclamations 
   (and generally adverbs also), do not change
   their form. Hence in these words, the change in function
   does not involve a change in form.
   ::

      He walked before.(adv.)
      He walked before me (prep.)
      He had walked a mile before he came to the house. (conj.)

   Here the meaning and form of before remain the same.
   Only by looking at its function can we see a difference in its
   usage in the three sentences. Many advv. and prepp. may
   be used interchangeably, while a few may serve also as conjunctions. 

.. _P043:

   As there is no change in word-form, this should
   give the Chinese students no trouble.

      | He stood outside the door. He stood outside.
      | Mr. P---- was sitting above. He was sitting above me.
      | Soon the ship went under. She went under the water.
      | Mr. Y---- was walking in front of me. He was walking in front.
      | He has left since. He has left since Monday morning. He has
        left since a message came for him,

   2.60. Some Interesting Compound-Words.--While we are
   studying the change in the function and formation of words,
   it is interesting to notice certain compound-words. In such
   compound-words, the whole combination may be treated as
   one word serving one definite grammatical function, without
   any change in the different parts themselves. This is another
   point where English is so much like Chinese. Thus we speak
   of a three-foot ladder, or a go-to-meeting coat or a happy-
   go-lucky policy. Here the words happy, go and lucky are joined
   in a manner which is impossible in ordinary combinations.
   Other extreme instances are the never-to--be-forgotten affair,
   with an I-turn-the-crank-of-the-Universe air (as if I were
   the lord of the universe), and a comfortable as-it-was-in-
   the-beginning-is-now-and-ever-shall-be feeling (a feeling of
   blessed security), and the-dog-in-the-manger attitude (keeping
   everything for oneself). Thus we have pickpocket and tooth-pick 
   just like Chinese 扒手，牙签, well-to-do （adj.) and ne'er-do-wells (n.) 
   just like Chinese 小康,无赖,and bread-and-butter marriage, like 
   Chinese 酒肉朋友,柴米夫妻. In fact, 
   such combinations can be made even more freely in English
   than in Chinese.

Ch III Sentence Moods
---------------------

What is a Sentence?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   3.10. What is a Sentence?--When we say `a red rose`,
   this is not a sentence, because we feel there is only a group
   of words which does not say anything. What about the
   red rose? If we say, however, The rose is red, we feel we
   do say something and the meaning is complete. We say,
   therefore, that a red rose is not a sentence, but The rose
   is red is a sentence. Similarly, in Here's a red rose, The red
   rose smells sweet, or Her face is like a red rose, we feel
   each is a sentence, because each says something and the
   meaning is complete in itself. If we look carefully, we find
   it is always the verb (smells, is) that gives life to the whole
   sentence. On the other hand, in a red rose, the meaning is
   dead, because there is no verb.

   But suppose a man should tell you suddenly that your
   house has been burnt down, you naturally exclaim “What!”
   There is no verb in the exclamation, and yet don't we feel
   What! is a complete expression expressing a complete meaning?
   The man who first sees the fire would most probably exclaim
   “Fire!” and the man upstairs in the house, on hearing the
   cry, would also cry out “Help!” All these are complete and
   independent expressions. They express their meaning fully
   and clearly. We should not say Fire! or What? is not a
   sentence because there is no verb in it. Grammar is made for
   language and not language for grammar. Living language

.. _P047:

   is not always like a school exercise. In actual speech, we
   do often use expressions that contain no verbs in them, and
   yet the meaning is as complete as in any sentence. Sometimes
   the verb is understood (not expressed), but this is not always
   true. We may say, for the sake of grammar, that Fire! is
   really There is a fire shortened. But this is psychologically
   not true: when we cry out “Fire!", we really only want to
   call people's attention to the fire. We may mean There is
   a fire, but we may also mean Let everybody go and fight the
   fire or we may mean Oh! now my property is all gone, and
   what shall I do? Our real meaning is just that word fire.
   Also, ordinarily, a red rose is not a sentence, but in answer
   to the question “What have you got in your hand?", “A red
   rose” is a good, clear and complete answer. Again, after
   arranging with a friend to meet again on Saturday morning,
   we may say before parting:--
   ::

      All right. Or---
      All right. Saturday morning at ten. Or--
      All right. Saturday morning at ten in the North Sation and no mistake.

   All this is perfectly good English, although in written English,
   we generally try to put in the proper verb. In the same way,
   we have the following colloquial expressions:--
   ::

      Your turn. (=Now it is your turn.)
      Next! (=Next boy, stand up, etc.)
      Splendid! (=That's good! Well done!)
      How so? (=How can it be?)
      A drink? (=Do you want a drink?)
      Nothing doing. (= I will never do it.)
      My mistake. (=It's my mistake: it's not your fault.)
      Light, please. (=Please turn on the light.)
      Danger ahead! (=Drive slowly.)
      The idea! (=How can you, he, etc. think of such a thing?)

.. _P048:

   Since there are such colloquial expressions, we must say that
   a sentence is simply a complete and independent expression.
   Any complete and independent expression may be called a
   sentence.

   3.11. Importance of Finite Verb. --The above cases, however, 
   are exceptions. Generally, a sentence must have
   a verb in it. In answer to the question “What have you got
   there?”, the answer “A red rose” is quite complete. But usually,
   a red rose says nothing and cannot be called a sentence.
   Likewise, Soochow-Nanking is not a sentence, but only a
   group of words. I go from Soochow to Nanking is a sentence,
   because here the finite verb (2.30) gives life to the sentence
   and connects the parts into a whole.

   We must remember to use a verb in every sentence, because 
   this is an important English habit, and because Chinese 
   students often forget it. Adjectives and participles. (vbb.
   changed into adjj.) alone cannot say anything. We can say
   He dies (vb.), but not He dead (adj.). We must say He is
   dead. Nor can we say The man playing in the garden as a
   sentence, but we must say The man is playing, etc.

   Exercise 13. Supply vbb. like is, feel, become, get, grow, etc.
   in the following sentences:---

   1. _____ you fifteen years old?
   2. I _____ sick for a long time.
   3. My father _____ very angry with me.
   4. Soon we _____ very tired.
   5. The baby cries when it _____ hungry.
   6. The students _____ returning from schooi.
   7. Her sister _____ more beautiful than she.
   8. The girl's toy _____ broken, and she _____ very sorry.
   9. She _____ weaker and weaker on account of illness.

Sentence, Phrase and Clause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   3.20. Subject, Predicate and Principal Verb.--If we analyze 
   any sentence, we find we have a subject and a predicate.
   The subject is what we talk about, and the predicate is what
   we say about the subject. Thus in The rose is red, rose is
   the subject of the sentence, and is red is the predicate. In
   Open your books, the subject you is understood, and open
   your books is the predicate. The important word in the
   predicate is always the principal verb.

   Exercise 14. Find the predicate and principal vb. in the
   following:-

   1. The kite flies in the air. (The answer to the question “What
      about the kite?” gives the pred.)
   2. What makes the steam-enginc run?
   3. George O'Brien knocked the fellow down.
   4. Please show him the way.

   3.21. Direct and Indirect Objects.--Some predicates
   contain objects of the principal verbs. In the first sentence
   above, the vb. flies has no object. In the second, steam-engine 
   is the object of the vb. makes. In the third, fellow is
   the object of the vb. knocked. And in the fourth sentence,
   we have two objects, (show) him, and (show) the way. Here
   the meaning is the same as Please show the way to him. A
   person (or sometimes a thing) for whom or to whom a thing
   is done is called the indirect object of the vb. Find out the
   direct and indirect objects in the following:--

.. _P050:

   1. Give me that book, please.
   2. Tell your mother everything you have done.
   3. Will you return me the money I lent you?
   4. Miss Yang paid her friend a visit last month.
   5. Will you do me a favour?
   6. His father bought him a new hat.
   7. My brother made me a kite.

   3.22. Sentence Structure: Modifiers and Conjunctions.一
   We have seen that the important parts in a sentence are the
   subject, the principalvb., and sometimes also the object.
   This is clear and easy to remember. All sentences are made
   up this way, no matter how long they are. They are sometimes 
   very long because we add words or groups of words to
   modify the subject, the vb. or the object, and join these groups
   by conjunctions. So we can classify all parts of a sentence
   into these five kinds:(1) subject, (2) principal verb, (3)
   object, (4) modifiers, and (5) conjunctions. The sentence:--

      “The dirty boy plucked a beautiful red rose in your garden
      this morning, and was caught."

   may be analyzed as follows:--

      | Subject----boy.
      | First verb----plucked.
      | Second verb----was caught.
      | Object of 1st verb----rose.
      | Modifier of subject----the, dirty.
      | Mofifier of 1st verb----in your garden, this morning.
      | Modifier of object----a, beautiful, red.
      | Conj. joining the 2 vbb.----and.

   It will be remembered that adi, adv., and prepositional
   phrases are always used as modifiers. Exclamations are regarded 

.. _P051:

   as independent parts in the sentence, as Ah! here
   he is. The structure of the English sentence is really as
   simple as this, and if we remember these five kinds of 
   sentence parts, we can understand the structure of English 
   sentences better.

   Exercise 15. Find out the subject, principalvb., object, modifiers, 
   and conij.(if any), in the following sentences, and show what
   the modifiers modify. In The carpenter paints the door. red, red
   modifies the object door. In My uncle grew angry, angry modifies the
   subject uncle, and in He was considered lost (They considered him
   lost, lost modifies the subject he. So words inside the predicate may
   modify the subject.

   1. Columbus discovered America by luck,
   2. Magellan sailed around the world,
   3. Magellan made the first sailing trip around the world.
   4. He got angry with me, and called me an impossible fool.
   5. The sunrises in the morning and sets in the evening.
   6. He left home for a long time, and was considered dead by his family.
   7. Spell your words correctly, and copy them with ink, not with pencil.
   8. Meet me at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.
   9. I saw him crossing the street.
   10. He was seen walking with Miss C---.
   11. The detective came too late, and found the thief gone and
       the room quite empty.

   3.23. Phrase and Clause.--Parts of a sentence which
   have a subject and predicate are called clauses, and those
   which don't are called phrases. A clause is thus like an
   independent sentence in structure; it is in fact a sentence
   within a sentence. A phrase is simply a group of words
   without any finite verb. A clause is always connected with

.. _P052:

   the rest of the sentence by some conj. Study the following
   clauses in italics, and notice the conij, introducing them.

   1. `If you do not find him`, come back and tell me.
   2. He was on his way back `when he met Mr. Atkinson`.
   3. I shall always remember `how he treated me, as long as I live`.
   4. `That he was killed` is certain,
   5. `Why he went away` nobody knows.

   Find out the subject and principal vb. in each of the above clauses.

   A phrase may be a prepositional phrase (beginning
   with a prep., as in the garden, by his family), an infinitive
   phrase (“to” followed by a vb., as to see it, to be seen), a
   participial phrase (beginning with a participle, as crossing
   the street, singing a song), or any combination of words that
   does not contain a finite vb. For instance, we have the
   phrases as soon as (conj.), once upon a time (adv.), on account
   of (prep.), etc.

   Phrases and clauses are used as nn., adjj., or advv. just. like
   single words. Generally they are used as nn. or as modifiers (adij.
   or advv.). The noun clause will be studied in Chapter XII, while
   all the important phrases and clauses used as modifiers (the infinitive,
   prepositional and participial phrases and the relative clause)
   will be studied in the important chapter on Modification (Ch. IX)。

Sentence Moods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   3.30. Sentence Moods.--One way of studying the English 
   sentence is to learn how the various sentence moods are
   expressed, such as the moods of questioning, affirming, denying, 
   commanding, and those expressing doubt, hope, wish,
   promise, ete. It is hard to say exactly how many sentence

.. _P053:

   moods there are: they vary as much as our moods or feelings
   vary. But, for the sake of convenience, we may say there
   are the following five main kinds:（1) Affirmation,（2）
   Negation,（3)Interrogation,(4) the Potential Moods (of
   command, wish, promise, etc.), and(5)Emotional Utterances
   (or exclamations). The study of these sentence moods teaches
   us,(1) how to state a fact,(2) how to deny,(3) how to
   ask questions,(4) how to express a wish, a supposition or
   anything that may or may not be fact, and (5) how to make
   exclamations in English under the stress of emotion.

   3.31. Chinese and English Compared: Chinese Modal Particles.
   A foreigner studying the Chinese language would
   have also to study the various Chinese sentence moods. He
   would find that the Chinese largely use modal particles (or
   particles expressing a mood, a kind of “empty words” or
   “form-words” 虚字, es against “substance-words” 实字) to
   express the different sentence moods, which are expressed in
   English largely by the verbs. Thus we use ma(吗) to express 
   the questioning mood, ni (呢) to express the question of
   unbelief, refutation, or disagreement, la (了) to express the
   sense of completion, pa (罢,吧) to express final decision or
   command, etc. These particles always come at the end of the
   sentence. Sometimes these moods are expressed by conjj.
   or advv. in the beginning or middle of the sentance, as nan
   tao (难道) for expressing disbelief, chueh (却) for expressing
   admission, liao-hsiang (料想) or tsung (总) for expressing a
   supposition or conjecture, etc.

   The folowing are examples:--
   ::

      你也要去吗?        Are you going, too? .................... (Question)
      他何必这样呢?      Then why should he do so? .............. (Refutation)
      十二点了。         It's twelve o'clock already ............ (Completion)
      我早已知道了。     I knew it long ago ..................... (Past)
      走罢。             Let's go. Be gone! ..................... (Decision)
      算了罢。           Have done with it!...................... (Finishing off)
      难道他没看见我么？ Could it be that he didn't see me?...... (Disbelief)
      他却有点难过。     He did feel a little ashamed............ (Admission)
      料想他总不至如此罢。 I don't think he is as bad as that...... (Conjecture) 

.. _P054:

Affirmation
~~~~~~~~~~~

   3.40. Affirmation: I Do, I Am.--Afirming, or stating
   a fact, is the most general form of a sentence. Thus in such
   simple sentences as He goes, It rains, The king is pleased, or
   I have been away, we are making an affirmation or a state
   ment. In English, the verb is the important word used in
   making a statement. Thus, in He is a thief, the real important 
   word that affirms is the word is, and in He sells his
   house, the affirming word is the vb. sells. The vbb. is and
   sells represent the two big classes of vbb. from the point of
   view of afirmation, viz. (1) the vbb. of doing, and （2) the
   vbb. of being. In fact, almost all English vbb. are considered
   as vbb. of doing, and only the various forms of the vb. “to
   be” (is, was, are, were) are considered as vbb. expressing
   “being.” This is quite an English way of thinking, new to
   the Chinese student. Thus, we may substitute the vb. “do*
   (with its various forms, did and does) for almost any vb.
   "E.g., in answer to the question “Does he sell his house?", we
   usually say, "Yes, he does." And the same may be applied
   to any vb. of doing. Study the following statements:一

   (A) THE VBB. OF DOING:

      | I believe in him. Indeed I do.

.. _P055:

      | Tsu-fah comes to borrow money again. He always does.
      | You wear a straw hat in winter. You ought to know that
        it is not proper to do that. You never see people doing
        it except yourself.
      | Did you meet him?----Yes, I did.
      | Did you speak to him?----No, I didn't.
      | Shall I bring you today's papers?-----Please do.
      | I don't like geography. Really I don't.
      | You are the only one that likes my writing. Others don't.
      | Do you promise to take her for your wife?----I do.

   (B) THE VB.“TO BE”(followed by adjj. or participles):

      | Do you think he is a real scholar?----I don't think he is.
      | Some of them are asleep, and some are not.
      | I suspected that he was in love, and now I know he is.
      | You say that she is the daughter of a cook. Well, what if she is?
      | I admire great speakers. I like to be one myself.

   Exercise 16. Read the above sentences again and again. Then
   the teacher will say the first part, and let the students supply the
   second part orally.

   3.41. Can, Will, Have, Must, etc.--From the above, we
   see already that the words “do”and “be”are the words we
   use in order to make an affirmation, a denial, or an interrogation.
   “To do" and “to be" are called auxiliary or helping
   verbs. In fact, we chiefly depend upon these helping vbb. in
   forming all sorts of affirmative, negative and interrogative
   sentences. There are other helping vbb. like have, will, can,
   may, must, dare, need, etc, and these, too, are often used for
   the same purpose as do and be. Repeat the following sentences 
   with the words can, must, etc. stressed:--

.. _P056:

      | Can he or can he not get the things ready?---Yes, he can.
      | My wife does not want me to go, but I must.
      | You are free to go. You may if you want to.
      | He thinks I have not yet prepared my lesson, but I have.
      | "You shall not come this way." “But I will.” 

   3.42. Affirmative Replies.-- We generally use “yes” in
   affirmative answers. But it is often desirable to make better
   answers than the blunt “yes.” Every language has various ways
   of expressing agreement, and politeness requires that we say
   something more than a mere “yes” when answering to any
   request. Following are some examples:-

      | May I see this book? ............................... Certainly. Of course.
      | Can I have a cigarette? ............................ Why, certainly.
      | May I smoke here? .................................. Please do.
      | Could you let me talk with you for a moment? ....... With pleasure.
      | Shall I shut the door? ............................. If you please.
      | So I have to take care of her? ..................... Quite so.
      | Am I to hand in the exercises tomorrow? ............ Exactly,
      | You will do everything I wish?...................... Absolutely.
      | And she is your sister's daughter ?................. Quite right. You are right.
      | Does he know you are living here? .................. I think so.
      | Can I stay in school during the spring vacation? ... Yes, if you like.
      | Shall I tell her to come and see you?............... By all means. Yes, if she wants to.

   Exercise 17. The teacher will give some questions, and let the
   students use some of the above phrases for answers.

   3.43. Qualified Assertion.--Both politeness and  care
   for exactness of expression require that we often qualify our

.. _P057:

   assertions with I think, I am afraid, it seems, etc. What
   you think is a bad man is quite different from just a bad
   man, and what seems to be all right may not be all right.
   The phrases, it seems, I think, I believe (and the American
   I guess) are often inserted into the sentence as qualifying
   phrases, either at the beginning, the middle, or the end.

      | I think I can do it myself.
      | This can do you good, I think.
      | That is, I think, too much for me.
      | I don't think she will come by six.
      | He is gone, I believe.
      | I believe he is gone.
      | I believe I'd better go.
      | Then you don't believe it is true?
      | It seems she is unhappy.
      | She is unhappy, it seems.
      | She seems to be unhappy.
      | It seems to me that she is unhappy.
      | You seem to think .........
      | It doesn't seem to be of any use to any one.
      | They seem to like each other.
      | Apparently, they like each other.
      | How old do you think I am?-----You are eighteen, I suppose?
      | Can you come to dine with us?-----No, I am afraid I can't.
      | You have been to Nanking, if I am not mistaken.

   Exercise 18. Make some sentences with some of the above phrases.

   3.44. Emphatic Assertion.---Sometimes we want to emphasize 
   a statement or assertion. This may be done by a
   special use of the vb. do; by the use of certain advv., by
   double negatives (§3.45) and by a method of interrogative
   affirmation(§3.46). I do feel sorry for him is an emphatic

.. _P058:

   way of saying that I feel sorry for him, Other examples are:--

      | Do tell me everything you know; otherwise I cannot help you.
      | 'Tisn't (=It isn't) that he doesn't know it. He does know it, but
        he does not want to let people know.
      | You need not lie to me. You did go to that place, and many
        people saw you there.

   The word do or did is always stressed in these places. Ladies
   are especially fond ofusing this form of emphasis even when
   no great emphasis is meant. E. g.一

      | Please do write me often.
      | I do hope that you will quit drinking.
      | I do fear something is wrong, dear.
      | Do be kind to this poor little boy.

   Sometimes we show emphasis by merely stressing the verb.
   Sometimes various advv. are used. The force of I am sure
   is already weakened by constant use, so that I am sure you
   will find him is actually less assertive than the short categorical
   statement You will find him. Generally the shorter a statement 
   is, the more forceful it is. I dare say is even weaker,
   and simply means “It is quite possible,” or “You are probably
   right.” The Americans are very fond of using you bet, or you
   bet your life or sure (with long-drawn-out pronunciation
   like sh-oo-r) as a means of assertion or affirmation.

      | You are funny.(Emphasis by stress or accent.)
      | Do I look like a banker only? I am a banker.(Said by a self-
        satisfied merchant.)

      | You ask me whether I am going to see the show? You bet I am.
        (Or, one of the following forms:) Why, of course, I am.
        Certainly I am. Sure I am.

.. _P059:

      | You are indeed funny. You are really funny.
      | May I have your dictionary for a moment?--(1) Why, certainly. (2) Certainly. (3) Of course.
      | I am sure you will like the book.

      ::

         No doubt,             ─╮
         There is no doubt,     │
         Undoubtedly,           │
         Beyond a doubt,        ├─ he is the greatest living author in China.
         Beyond any doubt,      │
         Beyond all question,   │
         Without any question, ─╯

      As sure as eggs is eggs. (=Undoubtedly.) (common form of assertion)

   Exercise 19. Make sentences with some of the following advv.
   or adv. phrases:undoubtedly, unquestionably, decidedly, no doubt,
   beyond any question, indeed, certainly, I am sure, etc.

   3.45. English Reticence and Double Negatives.--The
   English are a reticent nation, and they have reserved forms
   of saying things which in other languages might be expressed
   by rather strong adv. Not half bad is what Americans would
   express by Isn't that lovely?, Isn't it grand? or what a Frenchman 
   would express by ravissant (ravishing, delightful), and
   is the equivaient of Chinese hao chila (好极了). According to
   a great authority on the English language, She is rather good-looking 
   (literally, 还好看) is the strongest praise you can draw
   from an Englishman for a woman's looks. And where a
   Frenchman would say extremely or infinitely(extremement,
   infiniment), an Englishman says only very or rather or pretty.*
   The use of double negatives is often one of these reserved

   [*] Otto Jespersen: Growth and Siructure of the Einglish Language, p. 2.

.. _P060:

   forms of showing emphasis. By no means bad means rather
   good indeed, and not half a bad fellow means quite a nice
   fellow. He didn't half swear means He swore violently. A
   not undistinguished guest means a very distinguished guest and
   He was by no means unwelcome means He was greatly welcome. 
   See if you can use the following phrases:一

   1. there is no one but knows (=every one knows)
   2. not inferior (=quite up to the mark)
   3. spent no small amount (=spent a great deal)
   4. was not indifferent to (=did care for)
   5. a not too clean shirt (=dirty shirt)
   6. none too kind (=rather unkind)
   7. none too good for him (=rather bad for him)

   The Chinese language has also expressions like 未可厚非
   (not to be blamed too much, or quite excusable), or 不为无故
   (not without reason, with good reason). This use of double
   negatives is sometimes quite expressive and useful, but is
   after all rather roundabout, and may sometimes seem affected
   or unnatural. For I ain't got nothing, see §3.56.

   3.46. Afirmation by a Retort Question.--This way of
   asserting a thing by asking an obvious question is quite 
   common in all languages. A. may ask B. “Do you love her?”
   The most emphatic answer B. could give would be, “Do I
   love her?" The force of his retort question is “Is it necessary
   to ask? Do I love myself?" Very often, too, we put the assertion 
   or affirmation in the form of a simple question, as
   Isn't it pretty?, meaning How pretty it is! This kind of question
   is really a kind of exclamation. The word why, added to
   the beginning of a sentence, is also only a means of emphasis,
   meaning of course, naturally, it is not necessary to ask, why
   do you ask that question?

.. _P061:

   If he should lose, why, he has millions in the foreign banks, and
   can go and live in the foreign concessions.

   If the other generals accuse me of “squeeze,” why, don't they do the same?

   Why, of course. Take all you want. I would be only too glad to help you.

   Why does he ask about me? Doesn't he know me?

   (Amother may say:) Haven't I nursed him from his childhood,
   fed him, cared for him, and brought him up, and given him
   a chance in life? Haven't I sacrificed my whole life for him?
   And now you ask, “Do I love him?"

   How dare you say such a thing against your own mother?
   Am I the boss, or is he the boss?(How dare he interfere with
   my business?)

Negation
~~~~~~~~

   3.50. Negation.--Like afirmation, English negation largely 
   depends on the use of the helping vbb. dio, be, can, shall,
   may, must, etc. with the adv. not. Even more than the affirmative 
   sentence, the negative sentence depends on the word
   do. In fact do not (with did not, does not) is the commonest
   form used. Chinese students should learn from the very beginning 
   to use this form, instead of saying He not knows, on
   He not comes, which is aliterary transiation of Chinese 他不知,
   他不来. The difficulty lies in remembering to use the word
   do, and in the changes in the vb. which go with it. Thus
   we have一

.. _P062:
   ::

      AFFIRMATION                   NEGATION
      I come (go, play).            I do not come (go, play).
      I came (went, played).        I did not come (go, play).
      He comes (goes, plays).       He does not come (go, play).

   The forms cannot, are not, will not, must not, etc. offer no
   difficulty. Can not is the emphatic from of cannot. The
   changes came and did come, comes and does come occur also
   in the question, so that we can have the following forms
   for practice:--
   ::

      PRESENT                       PAST
      (A) He comes.                 (A) He came。
      (B) Does he come?             (B) Did be come?
      (C) He does not come.         (C) He did not come.

   Notice also that we say (1) He need not come, He dare not
   come, but (2) He needs to come, He dares to come, and(3)
   Dare (Need) he come? or Does he dare (need) to come?

   Exercise 20. Practise the following orally, until you can do it
   naturally and without mistake. Vary the sentences according to
   the three forms “A,” “B,” and “C”:--

   1. He knows that I am here.
   2. They saw me on Nanking Road,
   3. He heard the shot.
   4. You spoke to that fellow on the way.
   5. They all ran away when the police came.
   6. The teacher saw me, but did not see him. (The teacher did
      not ---- me, but ---- him).

   3.51. Aren't, Isn't Mustn't etc.--Regarding the pronunciation 
   of helping words plus not, some practice is necessary.
   Some students have learnt English for many years without

.. _P063:

   knowing how to pronounce these short forms correctly, and
   thus make their pronunciation unnecessarily complicated.
   The word not, when not contracted with the helping vbb.
   is never slurred, but always retains the “shorto”pronuncia-
   tion. Ain't for is not, are not, am not, have not (as shown
   below in the last example) is, however, not accepted in the
   language of educated people.
   ::

      mustn't    ['mʌsnt]     ['mʌsn]   You mustn't say so.
      dont       [dount]      [doun]    I don't know.
      doesn't    ['dʌznt]     ['dʌzn]   That doesn't matter.
      isn't      ['iznt]      ['izn]    That isn't true.
      wasn't     ['wɒznt]     ['wɒzn]   I wasn't there.
      aren't     [a:nt]       [a:n]     They aren't so bad.
      weren't    [wə:nt]      [wən]     We weren't going to do it.
      can't      [ka:nt]      [ka:n]    I can't doit.([kænt] in American speech)
      won't      [wount]      [woun]    He won't tell me
      shan't     [ʃa:nt]      [ʃən]     You shan't go away yet,
      neednt     ['ni:dnt]    [ni:nn]   You needn't be afraid.
      didn't     ['didnt]     [dinn]    That didn't do any good.
      wouldnt    ['wudnt]     [wunn]    It wouldn't be wise to take such a step.
      shouldn't  ['ʃudnt]     [ʃunn]    Why shouldn't he go?
      couldn't   ['kudnt]     [kunn]    That couldn't be done.
      ain't      [eint]       [ein]     “I ain't done nothing wrong by
                                       speaking to the gentleman,” said
                                       Liza, the flower girl.

   To say mustn't ['masn], as in You mustn't do a thing like
   that is easier and nicer than to say must not. It is very
   important, therefore, that one should learn to pronounce these
   contracted forms.

   Exercise 21. Practise on the pronunciation of the following--

   1. She won't ask me for money.
   2. It couldn't be true that he was a traitor.

.. _P064:

   3. I shan't do it, anyhow.
   4. Repetition is good, but you mustn't repeat mistakes.
   5. You can write poems, can't you?
   6. Isn't he your bosom friend?
   7. They needn't go to his office now.
   8. Didn't your brother tell you so?
   9. Some boys are studying, and some aren't.
   10. Wasn't it a good idea to go to the Taishan Mountains and
       look at the sunrise there?
   11. Miss Wang doesn't want to play volley-ball.
   12. You like to have a sea bath, don't you?

   3.52. No, Not a, Not Any, Nothing, etc.--We generally
   say There is no one, but There is not any one, and I have no
   money, but I cannot pay. No is thus used as an adj. before
   nn., and not is used as an adv. When there is a noun, it
   is better to use no. It is better to say There is no one than
   to say There is not any one. The form with no is often more
   emphatic. Thus That is no easy task is more emphatic than
   That is not an easy task. In this way, we get the common
   expressions, no good, no fun, no use.
   ::

      The pen is no good.        It is no use talking (or to talk).
      That's no fun.             Talking is no use.
      This camera is no use.     It's no go (= nothing can be done).

   This Camera is no use is more expressive than This camera
   is not of any use. Some careful writers like to say This camera 
   is of no use, but they never say That's of no fun. Instead
   of saying I do not know anything, or I do not know anybody,
   we can say, of course, I know nothing, or I know nobody.
   It is shorter and easier.

   Exercise 22. Use no, nobody, nothing, none in the following
   sentences and change them in any way youlike:--

.. _P065:

   1. I have not received any answer from him.
   2. I have not seen any Chinese in this city.
   3. They do not know any way to soive the problem,
   4. He doesn't have money to pay me.
   5. I tell you I do not have any lover.
   6. I asked him but he could not tell me anything.
   7. Don't tell this to anybody (any one).
   8. This fountain pen cannot be of any use to me.
   9. Is this watch any good? (Answer in the negative.)
   10. Does any one know of your coming? (Answer in the negative.)

   3.53. Few, a Few, Little, a Little.--In English, the meaning 
   of few and little is negative, while that of a few and a
   little is affirmative. When you come to borrow money from
   me, and I say “I have little money," that means I am not
   going to lend it to you. But when I say “Yes, I have a
   little." this means I am willing to lend you what little I have.
   I have little time for you means I have not much time, or
   even practically the same as I have no time for you. He
   talks a little English should be translated as 他会讲一点英文,
   but He talks little English means 他英文不大会讲. Study the
   following:--

      | You have little time left. You'd better hurry up.
      | I have a little time left. What can I do for you?
      | He knows a little French, but does not talk about it,
      | She knows little, but she talks a whole lot.
      | There is little use talking. He will never listen to you.
      | Oh, it has a little use. It will make him know that I do not approve.
      | I saw a few people there, and had a good talk with them.
      | I saw few people there, as most of them had gone away.

   3.54.“No”in Negative Answers.--It is a petuliar English
   habit that, when the sentence itself is negaive, we must use

.. _P066:

   no in the beginning, even when in Chinese yes would be
   the proper word to use. Whenever we use not in the sentence, 
   we must also use no, and not yes. A sentence like Yes,
   he will not come is highly unidicmatic in English.

      | Q. Isn't he your brother?
      | A. (Yes, he is.) No, he is not.
      | Q. Haven't you got your book?
      | A. (Yes, I've got it.) No, I haven't.
      | Q. You are not going away tomorrow, are you?
      | A. No, I am not going.(Never say: Yes, I am not going)
      | Q. And you don't mind missing this trip?
      | A. No, I don't mind.(Never Say: Yes, I don't mind.)

   3.55. Emphatic Negation.--There are various ways of
   making strong negatives by the use of certain phrases, by
   a retort question (as in emphatic affirmation), or sometimes
   by an obviously impossible statement. As a strong negative 
   is often very useful, one should learn at least some of
   these phrases. Some of the commonest ones are seen in the
   following :

      | Tsung-chang feels not the least bit sorry for his brother's death.
      | He is not at all sorry.
      | He is by no means sorry.
      | Far from it. (He is far from being sorry.)
      | Most certainly not.
      | Absolutely not.
      | He does not remember at all when or how the watch was lost.
      | I cannot possibly allow you to do that.
      | That watch has no earthly use for me.
      | He hasn't got a blessed penny.
      | Not a single man remained.
      | He didn't understand a single word of it.
      | There is none whatsoever.
      | None of your impudence!
      | None of your nonsense!
      | He is not a bit ashamed.

.. _P067:

   Exercise 23. Make sentences with some of the above phrases
   Sometimes an obviously untrue question is used for negation, as—-

      | He a gentleman? (What nonsense that is!)
      | Am I my brother's keeper? (Is that my duty?)
      | Chang failed in mathematics? (Chang is the best student in mathematics.)
      | Chiang an honest man? (You know jolly well he isn't.)
      | Can the Dragon King be short of treasures? (He is famous for his treasures.)

   Some apparently affirmative sentences have really a negative
   force, especially the common I should worry, meaning What
   do I care? (That does not worry me). Catch me going to the
   church also implies that you will never find me there. This
   is similar to the Chinese 你听他的话 (literally, You listen to
   that fellow's words), meaning Don't believe what he says, or
   我怕他：(literally, I afraid of him!), meaning I am not afraid.

   3.56. “I ain't got nothing.”--In English vulgar speech, it
   is quite common to hear expressions like I ain't got nothing,
   I don't never want no help from nobody, He can't do nothing
   without my help. It would seem that the meaning from the
   combination of two negatives would be positive or affirmative, 
   but actually this is only an English way of emphasizing
   the negative. He can't do nothing really means He can do
   nothing. In repeating these negatives, the speaker is only
   taking pains to make his negative meaning clear and unmistakable, 

.. _P068:

   for fear that one negative alone might not be heard.*
   This use of repeated negatives is not allowed in the speech
   of higher-class society.

   On the other hand, the repetition of not in separate
   phrases is quite necessary to make the meaning clear. We
   say, for instance, He wouldn't come to your house, not even
   the King himself should ask him to | He would never take opium,
   not even as a medicine | He would not take a bath, not even
   if you offer him all the chocolates in the world. In the same
   way, we use neither...nor as being probably clearer than
   either... or in the following, although either...or would be also
   correct: He cannot write a single decent Chinese essay, neither 
   in pai-hua, nor in the literary language.

   3.57. Conditional Negation.--The repetition of not in
   negative clauses or phrases discussed in the preceding paragraph 
   is quite often used in English. If a man asks you if
   you could write an English letter for him, and you do not
   mean to refuse him entirely, although you are too busy at
   the present moment, your answer should be “Not now, I am
   afraid” (cf. Pekingese 现在不). This may be called conditional
   negation or partial negation. Following are some more
   examples:--

      (Question asked on a September morning:) Who will come and
      take a sea bath with me?---Not I.(=Others may go, but not I.)

      Didn't he give the fellow some money also?-----Not he! (=He is a miser.)

      Are you going on the same boat with him?---Not if I can help
      it. (=I will not go on the same boat, if I can avoid it.)
      Hasn't he published a book of poems?--—-Not any that I know

   [*] Otto Jespersen: The Philosophy of Grammar, p. 333.

.. _P069:


      Will the foreigners never be friendly to China?---Some of
      them, yes, but not all. Or: Not unil you show them a big navy.
      
      Will Japan ever stop her aggressions on China?----No, no,
      not until we take measures of actual resistance.

      Are you never going to take a little vacation?-----Not until I
      finish this book of mine.

      Let us start the bonfire now.-----Not so soon. Wait till the guests
      have all come.

   Exercise 24. Make sentences with some of the phrases: not
   now, not I, not so soon, not if, not that, not until.

   The case of All that glitters is not gold is quite peculiar
   to English. It really means Not all that glitters is gold.

Interrogation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   3.60. Interrogation.--In our study of English affirmative
   and negative sentences, we have learnt that the question is
   often used as a form of emphatic assertion or denial. It has
   also been shown (§3.50) that the forms He came and Did
   he come? require some special practice. Now there are five
   main types of questions: (1) by simple inversion of word-
   order between vb. and subject, (2) by addition of helping vbb.,
   (3) by the use of interrogative pronn, or advv. (who, what, which,
   when, where, why and how), (4) by the tag-question, and
   (5) by mere questioning tone without change of word-order
   or interrogative words.* In all except the last type, the verb-

   [*] It would be foolish to force the students to remember these five
   types as so many convenient pills to swallow. Grammar becomes

.. _P070:

   before-subject word-order (or “inverted word-order") is used.

   (1) Knowest thou that I am the King of Persia?
   (2) Do you know that the president has resigned?
   (3) When did he resign? What president?
   (4) So he has resigned, has he?
   (5) He has resigned? (With rising tone at the end.)

   The first type, so much used in Old English is now replaced
   by the modern second type. With the helping vbb. can,
   must, etc., we simply use can you' must I? etc. (i.e., according
   to Type One).

   3.61. Will You? Won't You?--It is natural that we
   expect a negative answer with an affirmative question and an
   affirmative answer with a negative question. This is especially
   true of the negative question and it applies to all languages.
   In Chinese, 是不是 implies 是, and 岂有此理 implies 决无此理.
   But the actual usage of these negative questions varies with
   different languages. Thus won't you? is much more commonly 
   used in English than in Chinese. We say Won't you
   sit down? in English as an invitation to sit down, whereas
   the Chinese 不坐一会吗? is praclically a gentle suggestion for
   the man to leave. Thus, it is quite common to hear expressions 
   like Won't you have some cake? Won't you come with
   me? Won't you be so kind as to, etc.? Of course will you? is the
   usual form used in these sentences.

   [*] uninteresting the moment this spirit of learning formulas and dead
   enumerations enters. It is much more important that the students
   know how each form is used to express our ideas. No Englishman is
   ever conscious of these five types. Nor is the knowledge of these types
   of any use to him: the use consists in his ability to employ them to
   express his living roeaning.

.. _P071:

   Exercise 25. Make sentences with the following:--
   ::

      1. Won't you...?                  9. Didn't I tell you...?
      2. Can't you see that...?        10. Didn't you see...?
      3. Don't you know that...?       11. How is it that...?
      4. Didn't he say that...?        12. Why isn't he...?
      5. Why don't you...?             13. Couldn't you...?
      6. Why did you...?               14. Why hasn't she...?
      7. How could you...?             15. Can't the letter...?
      8. Aren't you ever...?           16. Didn't it...?

   3.62. The Tag-Question.--The “tag-question” is found
   both in Chinese and English. You are ffteen years old, aren't
   you? is psychologically and grammatically the same as the
   Chinese? 你十五岁,是不是? This is really a question following 
   a statement (alfirmative or negative). Psychologically, it
   implies that I believe more or less already that you are
   fifteen years old, but that I am not quite sure about it. He
   has arrived already, hasn't he? implies that I know already he
   has arrived, only I am not positive about it; it is, therefore,
   quite different from Has he arrived yet? Sometimes this is
   used as a gentle command, as Take this away, will you? Sometimes 
   it is used sarcastically, as So you think you are going
   to get away with it, don't you? (you need not think you will
   get away so easily); or So you killed your husband quite innocently, 
   didn't you? (I don't believe in your innocence).

   Two important points, however, must be observed. (1)
   the auxiliary or helping vb. used in the tag-question must be
   the same as the one used in the preveding statement. He
   has arrived already, isn't it? (for hasn't he?) in analogy to the
   Chinese 他来了，是不是？ would be quite wrong.（2）If the
   preceding statement is afirmative, the tag-question must be

.. _P072:

   in the negative, and vice versa.

   Exercise 26. Put tag-questions to the following sentences:--

   1. You are going to town this afternoon,..............?
   2. They have told you about my coming,.............?
   3. You wouldn't want to be late,..............?
   4. You don't mind my seeing this letter,.............?
   5. You will keep this secret,.............?
   6. He can come by himself,...............?
   7. She may decide for herself,...............?
   8. You were together with him at colleg,..............?
   9. He suggested this idea to you,...............?
   10. You are not going to publish this,...............?

   3.63. Tonal Interrogation and the Questioning Tone.--
   Another form of question usually expressing surprise is to
   keep the usuat form of the affirmative or negative sentence,
   and give it a rising questioning tone at the end of the sentence. 
   The president has resigned? (with rising tone) implies some
   surprise at the news. In other cases, it shows only an attentive 
   or affectionate attitude. Yes? or Well? means go ahead
   and tell me what you are going to say. Oh, papa, you are
   going to buy me a sailing boat? Really? Yes? No? is a form
   of asking that is difficult to resist.

   In English questions, the tone generally rises toward
   the end. Are you there? is pronounced are (low) you (highest)
   there (starting low and gradually rising). There are some
   exceptions, however. First, in questions with interrogative
   words, like What is it all about? the tone at the end drops
   as in other statements. Secondly, questions ending with an
   or not keep the rising tone until the last or not, when the tone
   drops: Will you pay me or not? Thirdly, statements followed

.. _P073:

   by a tag-question have the usual dropping tone of other
   statements, while the tag-question itself has the regular 
   questioning tone.

   I. What do you want (drop)?
   II. Do you want anything (rising)?
   III. You want something (drop), don't you (rising)?
   IV. Do you want something (rising) or not (drop)?

   3.64. The Indirect Question and Noun Clauses.--Very
   often we want not really to ask a question, but only to state
   a question, as He asked mewhy I came late. In such indirect
   questions, we do not invert the order between subject and vb.

      | Who are you? ................ know who you are.
      | Where is he? ................ I don't know where he is.
      | Why didn't he come? ......... The teacher asked why he didn't come.
      | What did he say? ............ I didn't hear what he said.
      | What shall I do? ............ The student asked what he should do.
   
   In this way we get many noun clauses beginning with such
   interrogative words as what, who, why, how, where, when. We
   often also use the word whether or if, as in He asked
   whether (if) he might join us | I wish to find out whether (if)
   he is still there. These noun clauses are used like single
   words as far as their grammar is concerned, i.e., they are
   treated as one noun. E.g.

      He has done it. How he did it does not concern us.

      Whether we are going to have a good or bad government depends
      on ourselves entirely.

      How old she is is not for me to ask.

   In Find out what is the trouble (what the trouble is), we may

.. _P074:

   consider the word-order as normal (not inverted) with what
   as subject and is as vb. (cf. Find out who is there). But a
   sentence like Find out how is that to be done (instead of how
   that is), or How old is she is not for me to ak is strictly not
   correct, although many English writers often make this mistake.

   Rarely we find an indirect question put in the form of
   a direct question:—

      The servant opened the door and told me his master was out.
      He said the master had left word to say that he would be at
      the club from four to half past five this afternoon, and would
      I be willing to go and meet him there.

   Exercise 27. Make sentences with the following phrases and
   noun clauses:---

   1. Ask whether.
   2. I don't know if.
   3. I don't see how.
   4. Go and see if.
   5. Can't understand why.
   6. He can't remember when.
   7. Don't know why.
   8. How or when he escaped.
   9. Who has broken the window.
   10. Who is in the room.
   11. What that fellow's name is.
   12. How long this meeting will be.
   13. When the train is to arrive.
   14. When the boat is leaving.
   15. Whether this is true or not.
   16. If the rain has stopped.
   17. If dinner is ready.

.. _P075:

The Potential Moods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   3.70. Potential Moods.---There are a class of sentences
   which express a command, a wish, or a conjecture, and state
   what may be true rather than what is true, or what the speaker 
   wishes to be done rather than what is done. These involve 
   the use of such helping words as may, can, must, will,
   shall, dare, need, ought, etc. Some of these have already been
   studied in the preceding sections (Afirmation, Negation and
   Interrogation). It is also not meant that these potential sentences 
   are not affirmative or negative sentences. But actualiy
   there is this class of sentences which must be studied. The
   distinction between what is true and what may betrue is
   quite important, and the student should avoid stating as actual 
   fact what is only a wish or a possibility. These sentences 
   are called “potential" in this book, because they all
   express what may happen or what is possible. Sometimes a
   Chinese student says I hope you come. He makes this mistake
   because he has not learnt that the form You come expresses
   a real act, while what he hopes for is only You will come,
   i.e., a potential fact.

   3.71. Command， Request, Suggestion, etc.--Sometimes
   we wish somebody to do something. This may not always
   be a command; it may be a humble request, a friendly
   advice, or a pious wish. Of course, the simplest form is
   the direct command, as Go and fetch water! This is always
   addressed to the hearer, and the word you is generally, 
   although not always, omitted. We add the you especially when
   there are several persons receiving the order, as You wash

.. _P076:

   the floor, and you (pointing to another) clean the window. When
   the persons commanded are still more numerous or different,
   we generally use shall, should, is to, etc. Thus, The third-
   year boys are to come in first and take the front rows, the
   second-year boys shall march in when the bell rings and the
   first-year boys will follow after them. When the speaker himself 
   is involved, the usual form is let us (let's), as Let's have
   a game, or more gently, Let's have a game, shall we?

   Actually, however, we seldom use the direct command,
   and prefer to put it in a milder form, even when speaking to
   a servant. Thus it is difficult to draw a sharp distinction
   between a command, a request or a gentle suggestion. We
   may say to a servant Will you bring me some cold water? or
   Will you look after the baby? Will you? and will you please?
   are probably the commonest forms. But even will you?
   is already too much like a command, when we wish to ask
   a doctor to come to our house: we generally say can you?,
   or even better (because more indirect), Could you come to
   my house now?

   As friendly advice, the commonest form is probably
   you had better (go). It is always more indirect and sounds
   less like a command when we use the subjunctive forms
   should, might, could. An extremely indirect way is to use
   I should, as I shouldn't reply to him at all, (if I were you)!

   Exercise 28. Learn to use the following phrases in sentences
   expressing a command, a request or an advice:---

   1. will you? 
   2. will you please? 
   3. you + vb.
   4. will some of you?
   5. may I trouble you to?
   6. would you care to？
   7. can you?
   8. could you?
   9. you should
   10. you ought to
   11. the boy shall
   12. you had (you'd) better (plus infinitive without to)
   13. will you be so kind as to?
   14. try to

.. _P077:

   3.72. “Shall” and “Will."_-The use of shall and will
   may cause some difficulty to some students, although this is
   really quite simple. The whoe difficulty lies only in these two
   facts：

   (1) I shall, We shall are used for simple future.
   (2) He will, It will, You will are used also for simple future
       (as well as for expressing a wish).

   It will rain simply means It is going to rain, with no idea of
   wish, and I shall be very busy simply means I am going to
   be very busy. Otherwise shall always expresses a command,
   and will always expresses a wish. Nobody will save me and
   I shall be drowned is the thought of a man who falls into
   the water, whereas Nobody shall save me; I will be drowned
   is a thought properly belonging to one committing a suicide.
   We have, then, the following scheme:—-
   ::

      +----------------------------+----------------------+
      | Simple Future              |      Command:        |
      | I shall     We shall       | Always use “shall.”  |
      | You will    You will       |       Wish:          |
      | He will     They will      | Always use “will.”   |
      +----------------------------+----------------------+

   Chinese students should learn to see I shall, we shall, shall
   I? more often. E.g.--

      | I shall be too tired to write this evening.
      | I am afraid I shall be late.
      | We shall not be back for supper.
      | Shall I show you how it is done?
      | Shall I bring you a hot water bag?
      | Shall we go and ask him?


.. _P078:

   A question with will I? will be meaningless, for we seldom
   need to ask ourselves if we are willing.

   However, as a form of command, you will is sometimes
   even stronger than you shall, as You will pack out at once
   (=给我滚蛋). Here you will implies I know you are going to
   (does I say), and that I will not be disobeyed. Also, Englishmen 
   often use I'll instead of I shall in many places because 
   of economy of expression, as I'll (really I shall) not be
   able to go.

   Exercise 29. Put will and shall in the following sentences
   instead of going to, want to, 'wish to, etc.

   1. I am going to tell you everything.
   2. I do not want to be disobeyed.
   3. It is going to be Thursday tomorrow.
   4. We are going to stay until midnight.
   5. They are going to stay till morning.
   6. Are we going to have plenty to eat?
   7. Am I going to have my pay this seek-end?
   8. I told him not to go, but he wants to go.

   3.73. Hope and Wish.--In English, there is a slight
   distinction between hope and wish. Generally, we hope for
   what may or will happen, but wish for something which is
   quite untrue, but which might or could be true. Thus hope
   is usually followed by will, may, can, while wish is followed
   by were, could, would or by a vb. in the subjunctive past,
   I hope you will come.

.. _P079:

      | I hope you will be satisfied.
      | I hope they can agree with us.
      | I wish I were dead (but I am alive).
      | I wish I could help you (but I can't).
      | I wish you would not talk like that.
      | Do you know who sent the letter?----I wish I knew (i.e, I don't know.)
      | I wish you could see him fighting against the whole bunch of them.
      | I hope it isn't true.
      | I wish it were true (but it is not).

   Of course in I wish to and I hope to, both words are followed
   by the infinitive.

   The English way of thinking makes a sharp distinction
   between what is a fact and what is a mere wish or desire.
   In case of a wish, we always use the vb. in the infinitive,
   even when a past form or an added －s is usually required.
   Thus, we have He commanded that the witness tell (not told)
   everything he knew before the court, and Our wish was that
   he leave (not left) this city at once. So also we have God
   save the king! (not saves), and Long live the Republic! (not
   lives). Another common English way of expressing a wish is
   to use may in such sentences as May God bless you! and May
   you live to repent this! A wish for what has not happened
   is often expressed by an exclamation with if: If I only had
   more money! | If I could only see her face once more! | If I
   only knew!

   3.74. Permission, Prohibition, Obligation, etc.—-The English 
   expression of allowing (permission) and not allowing
   (prohibition) is rather simple and similar to Chinese. Both
   may and can are used to express permission and prohibition,
   but where the idea of allowed to, not allowed to is strictly meant,
   we should use may and not can.

      | May (Can) I go out, sir?
      | May (Can) I go now?
      | You may (can) go.
      | You may not (=are not ailowed to) tell it to others.
      | Passengers may not (zzare not allowed to) smoke in their cabins.
      | Students may (=are allowed to) pay their tuitions in instalments.

   Various ideas of obligation are expressed by must, have to,
   should, is to, is supposed to, is expected to and ought to. Ought
   (from “owe”) expresses more the idea of duty, but it also
   often expresses a theoretical assumption (论理该当如是) or a
   conjecture. Following are some examples of the usage of the
   various words:--

      | You must (not) tell him.
      | Must you go now? Do you have to go?
      | Must you tell him everything? (It is unnecessary and foolish to do so.)
      | You should be more careful.
      | You ought to tell him (which you don't).
      | Mr. Ellis ought to know (he is an expert).
      | I thought that ought to be all right (but it turned out to be otherwise).

.. _P081:

      | You ought to be ashamed of yourself (but you are not).
      | You are not supposed to talk in class.
      | He is to (=is expected to) arrive tomorrow.
      | You ure expected to hand in your compositions.
      | You are to go and fetch him.

   He is supposed to be here already (but he is late).
   You are not supposed to know (but I tell you secretly).
   It is an interesting thing that the idea of obligation is
   now more commonly expressed by the phrases is to (am to,
   etc.) and has to (have to, etc.), especially in the past and 
   future tenses. We do not Say He must go yesterday, but He
   had to go, and we never say He will must go, but He will have
   to go. Is to means is expected to or is supposed to, and often
   refers to something to be done in the future. We have then
   the forms:--

      | Past. He had to pay. We were to meet that day.
      | Pres. He has to (=must) pay. We are to meet often.
      | Fut. He will have to pay. Weare to meet this afternoon.

   The Prince was to visit the Capital on the 12th means that at
   that time the Prince had not yet visited the city, but it had
   been arranged for him to do so on the 12th.

   Exereise 31. Make a few sentences using had to, has to, will
   have to, are supposed to, is expevted to, ought to, was to, were to,
   is to. Make some sentence with must and change it into the past
   or future tense, and see how you will have to change the expression.

   3.75. Conjecture and Possibility.--May, can and must
   are also used in a different sense, that of conjecture. 
   Suppose something has been lost, we may hear the following
   conjectures about the thief:--

.. _P082:

      | 　Who can it be?
      | 　It cannot be Mr. Ｙ-----, for he was not in the room.
      | 　Can it be the cook?
      | 　It may be the cook's nephew who was here alone.
      | 　It may be he, or it may be a burglar.
      | 　No, it cannot be the cook or his nephew, and there were no burglars here. 
         It must be the policeman.

   Thus we have the three forms, can it be? (with it cannot
   be), it may be and it must be. Compare in this connexion
   the use of huei (=can) in Chinese in 会不会是他? and i-ting
   (=must) in 一定是巡警. Must is very often used in this sense.
   E.g.--

      | You must be very hungry now.
      | He must be dying now.
      | That must be the real reason why he came here.
      | If C----is your father's class--mate, he must be well over forty now.
      | I will go and take his place. He must be getting tired now.
      | I think they must be brother and sister, for they look very much alike.
      | We didn't wait for you long. I knew something must have kept you.

   The expressions “possibility” and “probability”are quite
   new to the Chinese language, as we can see from the new
   expression “~之可能,” (“probability” remains untranslatable
   yet). It is important, however, that the student of English
   learn early to use such expressions.

   Exercise 32. (I) Make sentences with the following phrases:--

      | It may or it may not be ...............
      | You may or may not ................
      | It is possible that .......................
      | It is probable that  ..............
      | Probably. Possibly.
      | The people are likely to ...

.. _P083:

      (I) Dicuss the possible reason why some one is absent from
      class, using the phrases Can it be that? It may be that, It
      must be because.

      (III) Use must in some sentence in the sense of a conjecture.

   3.76. Pure Suppostion:Would, Should, Could, Might.--
   The words would, should, could, might are supposed to be the
   past forms of will, shall, can and may. But in reality they
   express an entirely different class of notions. If you put your
   finger in the fire, what would happen? Your finger would
   get burnt, wouldn't it? This is true at any time. We may,
   therefore, call such a statement a general supposition.
   Whenever we think of a thing as a general or purc supposition, 
   we use might, should, could and would. He can
   do it means definitely that he can (a fact), but He could do
   it means I suppose that he can do it, although he has not
   done it. China is not strong, but China could be strong, if,
   etc. You have not burnt down the whole house this time,
   but you might have, so next time be more careful. All these
   express pure suppositions and not facts. A supposition could,
   of course, be true. If I say “Mr. P---- may be sick,” I am
   stating it as a possible fact. But if I say “Mr. P--- might
   be sick, for I haven't seen him for the last few days,” I am
   stating a pure supposition of mine. The difference between
   may and might, therefore, chiefly depends, not on the facts
   of the situation, but on the intention of the speaker.

   This distinction between fact and fancy (see fuller treatment 
   in Chapter XIV) is very important to learn, because
   there is nothing like it in Chinese grammar. Many Chinese

.. _P084:

   students fail to learn the use of such highly idiomatic expressions 
   as I should think, I should like, would you? could you?
   because they do not know the idea of general supposition or
   pure supposition. And yet the proper use of I should like,
   could you? etc. is one of the first conditions of speaking good
   English. Simple people like to make blunt statements of facts,
   whereas more educated people are never too sure about what
   they do not quite know. It is often more refined to say
   “It would be all right” than to say “It is all right.” Could
   you come to my house? is also more polite and gentle than
   Can you, etc? because it seems to say Could you come, if I
   should ask you? as a matter of supposition. It is less direct
   than asking Can you come or can you not? as a question of fact.

      | What will you do now? (What are you going to do?)---A question of fact.
      | What would you do (if you were in my place)?---A suppo- sition.
      | Can you do it?(Are you able to do it?)---A fact.
      | Could you do it (if I should ask you)?---A supposition。
      | Suppose you put water over the fire, what would happen? Would the fire get wet?
      | Suppose you put oif into the fire, what would happen? 
        You might burn down the whole house, might you not?
      | Look out! you may fall down. Answer: But I don't (fall down). Reply: But you might.
      | I should like to see you try.(I suppose I like.)
      | I should think he feels rather ashamed of it.
      | Would you have tea or coffee? What would you rather have, tea or coffee? (Gentle question.)
      | Why don't you do it? Answer: I suppose I could do it, but I don't want to.

.. _P085:

      | Will you help him? He is short of money. Answer: I would if I could 
        (but the fact is, I can't)。
      | You should help him if you could. And I believe you could if you would.
        (You will not, that's why you say you can't).

   3.77. The Subjunctive Ciause.-We often use the word
   if to express a condition, as if it rains, if he comes, etc. Just
   as there is a difference between can you come? and could you
   come?, so there is a dificrence between if he comes and if he
   should come.

      | Tell him to wait if he comes.(It is quite possible that he will come.)
      | Tell him I am not at home, if he should come.(He seldom comes, 
        and I don't wish to see him).
      | If he is there, tell hin to come at once.(He may be there.)
      | If he should be there again, bring him to me.(He has been there once, 
        and I have told him not to go there again, but if he should do so, bring him to me.)
      | If I am elected, send me a telegram.
      | If I were (should be) you, I would resign at once.

   So much, then, depends on what the speaker means, whether
   he considers it as a possible fact or as a pure supposition.
   The forms if...is, if...comes, etc, are thus used for more
   likely suppositions, while the form if...should is used for more
   theoretical suppositions. There are, besides, the forms if
   he come (not comes), if you be (not are) in which the verts
   are said to be in the subjunctive mood; their meaning is the
   same as if he should come, if you should he. And then, when a
   supposition is known to be untrue, we even use the past
   form of the verb, as if I knew, if I were (i.e., I don't know
   and I am not). We have, then, the following:--
   ::

      1. If he comes.         If I am.
      2. If he come.          If I be.
      3. If he should come.   If I should be.
      4. Should he come.      Should I be.
      5. If he came.          If I were.

.. _P086:


   The forms “2” to “4” are really identical in meaning. For
   a more detailed study of the changes in vbb. (if he had come,
   etc.), see Chapters XII and XIV.

   It is peculiar to English that we could use the if-clause
   at the end of a sentence. Up till a few years ago when we
   started this “Europeanized Chinese” (欧化语体) business, we
   could not do so in a Chinese sentence. Now we can say,
   for instance, 此人野心很大, 倘是我的推料不错 (“This man
   has great personal ambition, if I am not mistaken in my
   judgment”). This comes with the colloquial style. The if-clause 
   comes as an after-thought; it is more easy and familiar 
   and more like our thinking, because we often do not think
   of the if-clause until the end of the statement.

   Exercise 33. Should is very often used ofter if. Make a number 
   of sentences with the if...should construction. Generally, if
   this is used, we also use would in the other part of the sentence.

Emotional Utterances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   3.80. Emotional Utterances.---All words have an emotional 
   power, and the power varies with the speaker, the person 
   spoken to, the situation and tone in which it is spoken,
   etc. Oh, Johnny! from a loving wife after a six months’
   absence may say a thousand things beyond the power of the
   most finished public speaker, and at times, it may reform a
   drunkard where a Saivation Army man has failed with his

.. _P087:

   volumes ofeloquence. Emotional utterances, therefore, have
   a value which has nothing to do with the length of the sentence 
   or its grammatical perfection. They are usually short,
   to the point, and present many grammatical peculiarities.

   In the hour of excitement, we generally say the few
   words that are uppermost in our minds. Oh! | Ah! | Amen! |
   Well! | What? are such common expressions. The soldier in
   the trench seeing the coming of the deadly poison gas and
   wishing to give his fellow-soldiers warning, can only shout
   Gas! Gas! Other exclamations with one noun are: An iceberg! |
   A whale! | A shark! | Hot cross buns! | The police! | The proctor! | 
   A great idea! | My pistol! Exclamations of verbs without subjects
   are: Forward march! | Halt!| Shoot! | Raining! and of subjects with
   the verb omitted are: Well, I never! (heard of or saw such a
   thing) He dead? Still others may express an adj. or an adv.
   alone, as How silly! | Excellent! | Fine: | Gorgeous! | Marvellous! |
   Now! | Never again! Others may express a situation or a short
   phrase, as A man in the water.! | The pity of it! | One a penny! Some
   exclamations may by mere sounds, like Tut! | Pshaw! | La, la! |
   Hurrah! Whoop! | Z---Z---z---z, etc.

   Some special grammaticai forms used in exclamations
   may be noticed here: those beginning with that, to, if, and
   those with interrogative words (without change of subject--
   verb word-order):—-

   (1) | That you, too, should turn against me!
       | Oh, God! that bread should be so dear!
       | And flesh and blood so cheap!
   (2) | To think that I shall never see you again!
       | To think you could be so ungrateful!
   (3) | If the rain would only stop!
       | If I could go to see him now!
   (4) | How beautiful! How beautiful that is!
       | What fun! What happiness!
       | What a sight! What a poet!
       | What to do? What to say?

.. _P088:

   3.81. Swear-Words.--English people swear as much as
   Chinese do, although they swear differently. Swear-words
   often express meanings which cannot be as forcefully conveyed
   by other means. An English Major-General swearing at his
   soldiers with “You pack of consumptive littie Maltese monkeys!” 
   generally gets himself obeyed. To call a man “a dirty
   dog" or a woman “a cat”(spiteful woman) may save us the
   trouble of using mang long adjectives. The important thing to
   observe is to swear at the right person and in the right atmosphere.

   Swearing could be very vulgar, although, in Chinese,
   vulgar swearing is indulged in by our perfectly respectable
   uncles and aunts. An English student, however, should learn
   at least some effective and comparatively respectable forms
   of swearing. Some convenient and not too mild swear-words
   are: Bother! Botheration! Dash it! The cursed ----! You blasted
   fool! I'm blowed (dammed) if I know! That blessed son of yours!
   By (St.) George! and By Jove! (Jupiter) are quie inoffensive to
   Christian ears, as also Ye gods! and Great Heavens! Ladies
   may use milder forms like Dear me! Oh dear! Oh my! My
   good-ness! or Good gracious! The word damned (a damned
   thing, damn it!) with its slang form darned should generally be
   avoided before the ladies, although it may be quite the thing
   in certain classes of society, and although St. Paul used it
   frequently in the Bible. In very familiar circles, sometimes
   a little liberty with the popular damned may be allowed. As

.. _P089:

   a substitute for damn, we may use dash, and as a substitute
   for bloody (bloody nuisance, all bloody fine, bloody quick) we
   may use blessed (not a blessed cent, but awful nuisance, awfully
   good).

   The taboo on swear-words varies from time to time and
   according to people's changing beliefs. Now that people's fear
   of hell-fire is disappearing, it is quite all right to use “To the
   hell with ----!” because it no longer hurts. Swearing by
   God is generally not allowed, although the longest example
   of this form of swearing is to be found in the Roman
   Catholic official curse or anathema used in excommunicating
   people from the church.

Ch IV Persons, Things And Their Gender
--------------------------------------

Classes of Things
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   4.10. Classes of Things.--In this chapter, we shall study
   the English notions regarding the classes of things that are
   expressed by the nouns. We have seen already (§2.15) that
   the English nouns may denote visible things (tables, chairs),
   invisible things (air, noise, possibility, power), or half visible
   and half invisible things (government, applause, happiness,
   middle, end). They may denote a concrete thing (table, chair),
   an action or event (promotion examination, the fall of a government), 
   or a condition (poverty, danger, prosperity) or a quality
   (kindness, stupidity, thinness). All these are regarded as nouns
   from the English grammatical point of view. To these we
   must add also the noun clauses, such as That he is dead (is
   certain), How much he took (nobody knows). They thus include 
   more than the Chinese notion of 事物 (or “things and
   events"), for 事物 cannotinclude the abstract qualities（品性，
   as kindness, thinness).

   These nouns have been classified in different ways by
   different grammarians, chiefly according to their meaning,
   such as “common nn.,” “proper nn.,” “material nn,” We
   shall soon see that such hard and fast distinctions are by no
   means easy to establish or strictly logical. Still, without
   trying to put all the nn. into any one system of classification,
   we can, and Englishmen do, consider the nn. as belonging to
   different classes expressing different notions. The following
   distinctions must be made clear in the student's mind.

.. _P091:

   (1) Process and Result...... heating: heat.
   (2) Abstract and Concrete... food: food-stuffs | money: coins.
   (3) Common and Proper..... people:Chinese、
   (4) Collectives ................ army, clergy, class.
   (5) Mass-Words ............. paper, water, milk.
   (6) Persons and Things ...... writer: inkstand.

   Each of these notional distinctions must be studied by
   the Chinese student, if he wants to use his nn. correctly.

Process and Result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   4.20. Process and Result.--In a phrase like the building
   of a building, or the painting of a painting, the first word
   building or painting denotes a process, while the second denotes 
   the result of that process. The one implies a sense of
   action or motion, the other implies no such sense ofmotion.
   Compare the Chinese 他所画的画 and 佩带(＝君子所佩, “what
   a gentleman carries,” i.e, jade, girdle, sword, etc.). There
   are many such distinctions in the English vocabulary, and
   one should make sure whether the noun denotes a process or
   action, or whether it denvtes merely a thing, condition or
   quality (which may or may not be the result of the process).
   Compare the following:一
   ::

      ACTION                                 NOT ACTION 
                                 (things, qualities and conditions)
      wedding day ......................... his marriage (result)
      heating ............................. heat
      allowing ............................ allowance (=money allowed)
      immunization ........................ immunity from disease
      differentiation, distinction ........ dif erence
      presentation ........................ present (=thing presented)
      identification ...................... identity of a person
      impregnation ........................ pregnancy (a condition)
      conception, conceiving .............. oncept (=idea)
      deception ........................... deceit
      toleration .......................... tolerance
      recording ........................... record (=what is recorded)
      investigation ....................... findings (results of investigation)

.. _P092:

   4.21. Process-Words Denoting Results.---It is very natural, 
   however, that the word denoting a process is often
   used to denote the result of that process. From the improvement 
   (improving) of the country, it is natural to transfer
   the meaning to the improvement actually made, as I noticed
   many improvenents (things added, etc.). And from the destination 
   (destining) of a boat's voyage, it is natural to shift the
   meaning to the port to which the boat sails or is destined,
   as The destination is Amoy. Because the skin of roast duck
   or roast pig crackles in the mouth, we now call such skin
   crackling, and because the lining of a long gown is used for
   fining the inside, we call it lining. Further examples are:--
   ::

      PROCESS-WDS.      RESULTS DENOTED EXAMPLES
      washing ......... things to be washed (this week's wasking)
      gathering........ crowd gathered (a large gathering)
      following ....... group of followers (a large following)
      division ........ an army unit (the division commander)[师长]
      distinction ..... lame and honour (a man of distinction)
      description ..... type, kind (people of every description)
      information ..... informed news (information leaked out)

   This change of meaning is very common and offers no
   grammatical difficulties to the student. But the student
   should observe the difference. When the heating of a
   house is bad, we should not say The heat is bad, nor should

.. _P093:

   we condemn the song because the singing is atrocious.

   Exercise 34. Find out whether action or no action is directly
   meant in the italicized words:一

   1. During Wilson's second administration, America entered the World War.
   2. You lack imagination (=imaginative power).
   3. A lady's accomplishments are: tinkling the pianc and speaking a few French phrases, etc.
   4. Supply is influenced by consumption (=consuming).
   5. He is a victim of consumption (=tuberculosis),
   6. Fertilization--fertility.  Communication--community.
      Imprisonment--prison.      Education---knowledge.

Abstract and Concrete Nouns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   4.30. Abstract and Concrete Nouns.—-Abstract nn. are
   those representing abstract ideas. Thus the Chinese conceptions 
   of “good fortune,”“oflicial position,’ and “tongevity”
   (福,磙,寿) are abstract ideas (抽象的), while“having a
   hunderd children and a thousard grandchildren,”“being prime
   ministers at court and generals in the field"and “living to
   seventy years of age (百子千孙, 出将入相, 年逾古稀) are the
   corresponding concrete ideas (具体的). We may change the
   concrete idea and still retain the abstract notion; thus people
   nowadays no longer identify “having a hundred children and
   a thousand grandchildren” with “good fortune”; they will
   most likely consider having to educate seven sons and seven
   daughters with fifty dollars a month a curse and a form of
   divine punishment.

   The Chinese language is highly concrete in its notions
   and imagery, and many Chinese students therefore fail to

.. _P094:

   learn the abstract notions of English nouns. Compared
   with the Chinese, English abounds in abstract words. Thus,
   we have nien-ling (年龄, year-year) for “age,” but the
   abstract idea of “size” is expressed by the more concrete words
   ta-hsiao（小大, big-small)。 The ending hsing（性) for abstract
   nn., as in shen-so-hsing（伸缩性，extend-shrink-character，
   “elasticity”), k'o-fen-hsing（可分性，may-divide-character 
   “divisibility"), is a modern innovation of very recent date, due to
   western influence. Thus many Chinese students can never
   learn to say, “The essay is perfect in form und content” 
   (abstract form and content), but must always say “Its form and
   contents are perfect” (concrete form and contents). This is
   often as dificult for the Chinese students to grasp as it is
   well-nigh impossible for most people to distinguish between
   the church (concrete) and religion (abstract). They would never
   think it possible for Jesus to stand outside the church window,
   calling to the young worshippers inside,“Suffer the little children 
   to come unto me.”

   In the following, we use italics to indicate abstract ideas
   and bold face to indicate concrete ones.

      | A rosy cheek is the sign of good health.
      | Eating three bowls is surely good appetite.
      | This young man is full of ideas, but he lacks experience. I had
        once a very funny experience with him. We went together
        to see his uncle and get some money from him, and when
        we arrived, he told his uncle to go to the devil.
      | China is backward in communication. She should have more
        roads, railways and aeroplanes.
      | You have too many churches, but no religion.
      | You cannot have iustice, when there are too many clever
        lawyers.

.. _P095:

      | Our politicians have nostatesmanship, and our diplomats do not
        understand diplomacy, They may be busy the whole day
        attending luncheons, dinners, and making high-sounding,
        silly speeches, but luncheons and dinners are not statesmanship, 
        and fine speeches are not diplomacy.
      | Maurice Maeterlinck is against warin principle (in the abstract),
        but he fought in the war against Germany, when the latter
        invaded Belgium.
      | You do not love me (the invisible self), you love only my
        money.

   4.31. Abstract-Words with Concrete Meaning.--In English, 
   the same word has often two meanings, one concrete
   and the other abstract. Study the following:一
   ::

      ABSTRACT                                 CONCRETE
      She has both youth and beauty.           Our youths (=young men) are corrupt.
      That's the beauty of the poem.           Isn't she a beauty (=beautiful woman)？
      Life is short.                           Many lives have been lost.
      We love the teacher for her kindness.    Thank him for his kindnesses (acts of kindness).
      That man has no brains (=He is stupid).  He has a big brain(=He has a big head)。
      She is proud of her looks.               She gave him a look.
      He is keen in observation.               He makes this observation.
      With an air of satisfaction.             The fresh country air.

   As abstract nn. can seldom be counted, we may often
   noticeby the use of singular that an abstract, rather than
   a concrete, idea is meant. Thus, we sometimes say, “Dr.

.. _P096:

   Lin has many systems, but no system," the second word
   referring to an abstract systematic habit of doing things.
   Similarly, we have the following plurals, which show that they
   are here used to express concrete ideas:--
   ::

      Impurities in the wate ............... inpure substances.
      The pleasures of an old mian ......... orms of pleasure.
      Accused of cruelties to his wife ..... cruel acts.
      Several possibilities exist .......... possible ways.
      Youthful follie.s .................... Foolish acts, habits.
      Communication facilities ............. railways, trains, boats,

   4.32. A Piece of Folly, a Fit of Anger, etc.--Not all
   abstractnn., however, can be used to denote concrete things.
   Whenever in doubt, one can always use another way to
   express the corresponding concrete idea. We cannot talk of
   three furnitures, but we can always say three pieces of 
   furmiture, and we cannot speak of two infections, but we can say
   two cases of infection. It would seem strange to Chinese
   minds that we could speak of a piece of good luck (一块福气),
   but the Englishman does often use this to express a lucky
   event or accident. The use of piece, bit, case, form, act, etc.
   plus some abstract n, should be studied carefully:--

      | A piece of good luck, learned nonsense, folly.
      | Some bits of scandal, information, news.
      | A fit of fever, hysteria, anger.
      | A sudden attack of madness, fever.
      | Several cases of theft, malaria, typhoid, criminal neglect.
      | This strange form of pleasure, punishment, corruption,
      | His acts of kindness, cruelty, generosity.
      | A stroke of good fortune.
      | An instance (example) of his selfishness, pride, carelessness.

.. _P097:

   Exercise 35. Use the words case, example, act,, form, instance,
   piece, etc. plus some abstract noun in some sentences.

Common and Proper Nouns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   4.40. Common and Proper Nouns.--The most common
   classification of nn, is the division into common nn. and
   proper nn. Examples of proper nn. are Ningpo, Mencius,
   Chinese, Arnold Bennett, and examples of common nn. are
   hook, table, story, ciry. According to some grammars, a
   proper n. is defined as the name of one particular person
   or thing, and a common n. is defined as that of a whole
   class of persons or things. Any table may be called a table
   and any city may be called a city, whereas only one city is
   called Ningpo and only one man was called Mencius. This
   distinction is practically useful, but we should know that it
   is really impossible to draw a sharp line between the two.
   May not any negro be called a negro? Is the word negro a
   common or proper noun? Certainly the word Chinese can be
   applied to a whole class of persons, and certainly there are
   many Lins in China. And yet Chinese and Lin are considered
   proper nn. And if Chinese is considered a proper name, why
   is the yellow race considered a common noun? Are the moon,
   the sun and the earth common nouns or propernouns? And
   if summer and winter (spelt with small letters) are considered
   commonnn., because there are many summers and many
   winters, why are January, February and Monday, Tuesday
   written with capital letters at the beginning like proper nn.?

.. _P098:

   The distinction between common and proper nn. is. only
   a relative one. The proper n. is felt to be more exact, more
   specific and more artificial, while the common n. is felt. to
   be less exact, less specific and less artificial.(It should be
   remembered that all names are artificial.) The cigarette I smoke
   is called Craven “A”; there is no reason why it may not be
   called Creighton “X.” The name is, therefore, quite artificial,
   The phrase China sea may be a common name, but when we
   decide to call the sea on the east of China the China Sea
   (with capital letters), we give it both a more exact name and
   a more exact meaning. When I call this book the Kaiming
   English Grammar, I am giving a comparatively exact, specific
   and artificial name to the book.

   4.41. Proper Nouns and Capital Letters.--Proper nn.
   must begin with capital letters in writing. We may write
   the kings of Europe or a college dean, but when we refer to
   the King of England or the Dean as a proper name, we begin
   it with a capital letter. When it is uncertain whether it is a
   common or proper name, usage also differs. We use capitals 
   when we regard a name as a proper name, otherwise we
   use small letters. Thus we write North China, but northern
   China or Northern China, the far East or the Far East, western 
   Europe or Western Europe, the orient or the Orient, Chinese 
   classics or the Chinese Classics. Many words which
   were originally proper names have now become common
   names and are written with small letters, as china (porcelain),
   champagne (wine), italics (type), boycott* (movement), cynic
   (man). Adjj. and vbb. made from proper narnes are generally

   [*] From Captain Boycott who was boycotted by the Irish peasants.

.. _P099:

   also written with capital letters: Chinese, European, Anglicize,
   Romianize (also romanize).

Collectives and Mass--Words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   4.50. Collectives or Group-Names.--There are a class
   of nn., which denote a group of things or persons taken together, 
   and which may be called collectives or collective nn.
   Collectivenn, may be considered as singular (one group) or
   as plural (many individuals). Thus, we may say the Government 
   have or has... I There is or are a flock of sheep I The whole
   staff resign or resigns. For some collectives we have no proper 
   Chinese equivalent, as the crew of a ship (船中机师水手之总称), 
   the faculty of a departmet (一系之全体教员), the staff
   of a company (全体职员). We also speak of a person's hair
   (meaning all the pieces of his hair) and the shot (meaning all
   the little lead balls discharged at one shot of the gun). Other
   examples are: people, nation, troop, army, clergy, family, clan,
   society, library, cattle, sheep, fish. For the grammatical number
   of these words, see §5.22.

   4.51. Mass-Words.*--The words air, copper, wood, alcohol, 
   milk, etc. form a class by themselves. They can never

   [*] The term “mass-word'" was first proposed by Jespersen, and is
   a convenient distinction from the collective with which it has usually
   been confused. According to Jespersen, the essential difference is that
   collectives are both singular and plural, while masswords are neither
   singular nor plural. The Jespersenian classification seems to be made
   with reference to number. In this book, however, I do not use this
   term to include abstract nouns ("immaterial mass-words") such as
   health and happiness, because health and happiness have no “mass"’to
   speak of, and because number is not the sole basis of classification here

.. _P100:

   be counted, for they are neither singular nor plural. Among
   the concrete nn., these words are most like the abstract nn.
   (politeness, wealth) in not having number and in often being
   used without any article, a or the. Thus we say simply Milk
   is heathy food or You should take milk and not a milk, justas
   we say Health is happiness or That gives me happiness and
   not a happiness. Of course we can use the before mass-words
   when we mean something definite, as the air, the milk, just as
   wt sepeak of the health or the happiness of the family. For
   the “number” of these words, see §5.11.

Things, Persons and Personification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   4.60. Things and Persons.--A very important distinction 
   in English grammar is that between persons and things.
   One would think that the distinction between animate and
   inanimate things (thus putting the animals in the same class
   with persons) would be more logical, but, apparently, in
   English, we have chosen to regard man as the all-important
   thing in the universe and have put him in a class by himself.
   Things, whether animate or inanimate, may then occasionally
   be honoured with a “personification” and thus by a figure of
   speech be put on a level with human beings.

   The clearest and commonest examples of this distinction
   between personal and impersonal objects are the pronn. he,
   she, him, her for persons and it, its for animals and things.
   Much depends also on personal interest. A child we do not
   know much about or are little interested in is referred to as
   it, but the child's own mother seldom does so. In the same
   way, the master who lives in close relation with his cat or
   dog generally refers to the cat or dog with he or she, and

.. _P101:

   not with it. Further examples are:--
   ::

      For persons:   who, somebody, anybody, everybody, nobody,
                     some one, any one, every one, no one (or Spelt
                     as someone, anyone, everyone, no-one).
      For things:    what (pron.), which (pron), something, anything,
                     everything, nothing.

   Some words may be used for both persons and things.
   E.g, the pronn. all, each, one, none and the adjj. what,
   which.
   ::

      PERSONS                       ANIMALS & THINGS
      All are dead.                 All is lost.
      I know all of them.           I know all (=everything).
      Each goes his own way.        Each has a tail. [(apples).
      The clever ones keep silent.  The bird eats all the good ones
      None of them was there.       There is none left.
      What a singer!                What nonsense!
      Which person do you mean?     Which story is most interesting?

   4.61. “Who,” “Which” and “That."--The relative pronn.
   are used differently. Who (with whom) is used only for
   persons, which is used only for things, and that is used for
   both. That is, therefore, always safe to use, as one cannot
   make a mistake with it.

   Exercise 36. (I) Make some sentences with:--
   ::

      1. all who              7. the house which
      2. those who            8. the book which
      3. people who           9. the things that (which)
      4. every one who        10. the horse that (which)
      5. any one who          11. the men that (who)
      6. anything which       12. the boys that (who)


.. _P102:

   (II) Substitute who (whom) and which in the following Sentences for that :--

   1. The man that says this is a liar.
   2. Those that are afraid need not come.
   3. I like fried fish that looks brown and crisp.
   4. I like a girl that dresses neatly.
   5. A wife may fail you, but a good cigarette (is one that) never fails.
   6. Your friends may fail you, but a good wife (is one that) never fails.
   7. The man that fishes is called a fisherman.
   8. The line and hook that the fisherman uses is called a fishingline.
   9. A rubber is the thing that is used to rub off pencil marks.
      It means sometimes a person that does the rubbing.
   10. A robber is one that robs, and a thief is one that steals.
   11. The person that you see sitting next to Mr. Y----- is my cousin.

   4.62. “Whose”and “Of Which.”--Like who and which,
   whose is generally used for persons and of which for things.
   Some writers would never allow whose to be used for other
   objects than persons. But this restriction is neither a help to
   clearness or convenience, nor historically correct.* The use
   of of which often requires a very troublesome, unclear and
   unpleasant construction, as This is a place the people, customs
   and geographical position of which I know nothing aboyt. Certainly 
   it is clearer and easier to say This is a country whose
   people, customs and geographical position I know nothing about.
   The first form is grammatically correct, but stylistically some-
   what objectionable. We should say, therefore, that at least
   both forms may be used.

   [*] See Modern English Usage, pp. 727-728.

.. _P103:

   Exercise 37. Substitute whose for of which, of whom in the fol-
   lowing sentences:--

   1. The detective picked up a small, square box, the cover of
      which was made of fine wrought-silver, and the inside of
      which bore the initials “B. W. H.”*
   2. I was introduced to a man the name of whom was familiar to me.
   3. The cripple was made the referee of the games the rules of
      which he was entirely ignorant of.
   4. We then entered the old castle the walls of which were
      moss-grown and covered withivy.
   5. I received a letter the handwriting of which looked like that
      of my dead brother.
   6. I got a book the corner of the cover of which was slightly damaged.

   4.63. Personification.--Personification, or considering an
   animal or a thing as a person, is of various kinds and is
   more common than we suspect. (a) When Laotse says
   “Heaven-and-earth is unkind: it (he?) treats the creation like
   dummy-dogs. The sage is unkind: he treats the people like
   dummy-dogs” (i.e, dummies made of hay used for the sacrifices) 
   (天地不仁，以万物为刍狗.圣人不仁，以百姓为刍狗)，
   he is there personifying heaven-and-earth, regarding it as capable 
   of being kind or unkind, like the sage himself. The 
   English people, too, often personify Nature, Heaven, Fate,
   the Furies, Fortune, Justice, Liberty, etc. Some of these examples 
   go back to Greck tradition, and the English people often
   actually have the image of a goddess in their minds, when
   they speak of Justice or Liberty. That it should be a goddess
   rather than a god may seem strange to Chinese minds.*

   [*] Compare, however, Laotse, 有名万物之母 “The Named is the
   mother (and not father) of all things.”

.. _P104:

   Some older authors, too, are fond of writing Knowledge,
   Hope, Despair, Humanity, Courage, Patience with capital
   letters, but this has become out-of-fashion in modern times.
   More common and more useful are the following forms
   of personification. (b) The use of she and her in speaking
   of a nation or a ship. (c) The use of personal vbb. like know,
   regret, remember, agree with words like the world, the people,
   posterity, China's womanhood as singular subjects. (d) The
   use of the personal possessive form (with 's) in connexion
   with non-personal objects, as the clock's hands, the river's
   mouth instead of the hands of the clock, the mouth of the
   river or the river mouth, and the cloud's colour instead of the
   colour of the cloud. This last form should generally be avoided,
   except in special phrases, as “China's sorrow” (the Yellow
   River), out of harm's way, for convenience' sake (cf. for my
   sake), the day's work, a good night's sleep, at a minute's (or
   moment's) notice. The last examples are really convenient
   phrases made for economy of expression, like the whose
   discussed above, and have little suggestion of personification.

   (a) | 1. As Fate would have it, he came home that evening to meet his death.
       | 2. Fortune smiled on him, and he became the most popular novelist of the day.
   (b) | 3. France was asking America to cancel her war debts.
       | 4. She (the ship) was going at 12 knots an hour.
   (e) | 5. The world shall long remember what the people lived through during the Great War.
       | 6. China's womanhood is taking the matter very much in her own hands.
   (d) | 7. Mr. H----- was lying at death's door.
       | 8. Let us say, for argument's sake, that he was cheated by others,

.. _P105:

   Exercise 38. Make some sentences with the following phrases:--

   1. For convenience' sake. 5. For goodness' sake.
   2. Tomorrow's work. 6. China's foreign debts.
   3. The day's earnings. 7. His heart's desire.
   4. Five minutes' rest. 8. The whole world knows.

   (One should not use personification unless he is sure
   it is quite right, because personification is difficult to use and
   too much of it is bad taste. Instead of the mountain's top,
   the car's wheels, the river's mouth and the road's corner, one
   should use the simpler mountain top, car wheels, river mouth
   and road corner. And instead of China's army, one could
   more easily and safely say the Chinese army. The use of she
   and her should especially be restricted.)

Sex and Gender
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   4.70. Sex and Gender.--Gender is the grammatical distinction 
   of sex in language. Natural sex and grammatical
   gender need not always be the same, and the gender of words
   may vary in different periods and different languages. Thus,
   in German, the words for muiden and woman (das Madchen,
   das Weib) belong to the neuter gender, and in old English,
   the word girl could be used for young people of both sexes.
   In German today, the sun is still considered as feminine and
   the moon as masculine, exactly contrary to the Chinese conceptions 
   of 太阳, 太阴. It is strange also that, while the
   Chinese talk so much about sex distinctions (男女有别), they
   have not developed a distinction between he and she in their
   language, while the European people who talk so much about
   sexual equality should insist on this he-she distinction. The
   Chinese character for “she” (她) dates back only to 1917.

.. _P106:

   With this new character, written Chinese can express even a
   feminine plural (她们, feminine “they”), which cannot be
   expressed in English. Among the European languages, the
   English is most like the Chinese in sweeping away all useless
   gender distinctions (such as Old English for mouth masculine,
   tongue feminine, eye neuter, and similar nonsense in modern
   French and German, as German for coffee mas., milk ferm.,
   and knife neu.), the meaning of which the best grammarians
   of today are not able to find out.

   4.71. Masculine, Feminine, Common and Neuter Genders.--
   A word may be masculine(male) or feminine (female), or
   it may belong to the common gender (both sexes), or it may
   belong to neuter (neither sex). It should be noticed that
   things like stone, paper, pencil, water may be regarded of
   course as having no sex, while frogs, teachers, workers and
   students should be regarded as being of both sexes, although
   this makes no difference in English grammar. It should also
   be noticed that all the pronn, except he (e.g, we, they, I,
   you) can be used without any sex distinction, and that the
   common gender is really the most convenient of all to use.
   While more and more women are coming to be senators,
   judges and parliament members, the best cooks and tailors are
   men, and not women, so that it is best to leave these words
   in the common gender. Whenever a distinction is desirable, we
   can always add some distinguishing word, as in male cook,
   female cook, man-servant, maidservant, boy student, girl student,
   boy friend, girl friend, woman governor, female judge, lady
   teacher, etc. The word man, representing all human beings,
   may be used in the common gender, as her part in man's
   (mankind's) history of progress and No man can tell. Further

.. _P107:

   examples of common gender are: cousin, parent, relative, lover,
   author (although authoress may also be used for a woman
   author), worker, journalist, reporter, editor, doctor (doctress
   is chiefly in jocular use), missionary, nurse (there are male nurses), 
   fool, neighbour, barber, hair-dresser, secretary, scientist,
   chairman (besides the modern chairwoman), etc. The word
   woman can always be added to these words (woman doctor,
   woman worker), while the word lady is limited to the higher
   classes (lady doctor, lady teacher, lady scientist). Likewise
   girl is used for young girls, as in girl reporter, girl worker.

   4.72. Animals and Persons of Different Sex.--It is natura!
   that we have different words for animals and persons of different 
   sex. In the case of animals, we do not trouble to distinguish 
   the sex of frogs, snakes, flies, and grasshoppers by
   different words, while we have different words for animals
   which are closer to us, as bull, cow, cock, hen. When we
   want to include both sexes with these one-sex words, the only
   way is to use both, as ten brothers and sisters (7 brothers and
   3 sisters, or 3 brothers and 7 sisters, or any other combination). 
   Some commoner examples are:一
   ::

      Mas.        Fem.        Mas.           Fem.
      king        queen       landlord       landlady
      father      mother      prince       > princess
      brother     sister      count (earl) > countess
      uncle       aunt        duke         > duchess
      nephew      niece       baron        > baroness
      gentleman   lady        Jew          > Jewess
      master    > mistress    gander         goose
      actor     > actress     ram            ewe
      god       > goddess     stallion       mare
      beir      > heiress     lioness      > lioness

.. _P108:
   ::

Ch V Number And Quantity
------------------------

The Notions of Number and Quantity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   5.10. The Notions of Number and Quantity.--There are
   things that can be numbered or counted (boy, book, ship,
   school), and things that cannot be numbered or counted
   (water, air, fame, honesty). This applies to all languages.
   It would be nonsense to say “one water,” “two water” either
   in Chinese or in English. For things that cannot be counted,
   however, we can express their quantity or amount, as “much
   water,” “a little water,” “a great deal of water,” and “a
   basin (or basinful) of water.” The difference expressed by one
   boy, two boys is called number (数), while the difference 
   expressed by nuch water, little water is called quantity (量).
   This distinction between number and quantity, however,
   is not kept in the Chinese notion of to (多) and shao (少).
   Thus, we say in Chinese 僧多粥少, disregarding the fact that
   monks can be counted, but congee cannot. In English, we
   have to say “many monks” (not “much monks”), but “little
   congee” (not “few congee”).
   ::

      NUMBER                     QUANTITY
      many dollars, cents        much money 
      many weeks, days           much tine
      mnany books, stories       much reading   
      many heads                 much thinking
      three more chances         little chance (possibility)         
      too fewlessons             too little grammar
      a few sick men             a little pain, sickness
      two or three dishes        not much food
      many good qualities        a great deal of pride
      a number of cups           a big quantity of tea
      a large number of letters  a big quantity of mail
      three volumes, copies      a little history, poetry

.. _P110:

   But even the English language does not observe this
   distinction in some words. The words some, a lot, more, no
   can be applied to both classes of words. Thus we have:--
   ::

      some days, weeks           some time
      some rooms                 some space
      some books, lessons        some knowledge, grammar
      some chances               some possibility, chance
      some good dishes           some food
      a lot of showers           a lot of rain
      lots of tables             lots of wood
      more ships                 more speed
      less shipwrecks            less danger
      no lamp                    no light

   Exercise 39. Make some sentences with the following material:一
   ::

      many, too many,               not ink, rain, sunshine,
      many, not much, a             chances, beautiful
      great deal of, no little,     girls, noise, pride,
      a great number                bowls, food, money,
      of, a good deal of, a         kindness, good luck,
      little less, some more        harm, danger, light.

   5.11. Mass-Words: Grain of Sand, Bushel of Rice, etc.--
   Besides the things that can be counted and are usually counted, 
   there is a group of things that can be counted, but usually
   are not counted. Thus we say You eat a great deal of rice!
   She has beautiful hair | There's a large quantity of sand. We
   never trouble to count the rice we eat, or the hairin a woman's 

.. _P111:

   head, or the sand a child is playing with. When we
   want to count it, or express the number, we can say a grain
   of rice, a piece of hair, three grains of sund. These may be
   called countable mass-words.

   Then, we have the masswords that really cannot be
   counted, but can only be measured by measures of quantity.
   Sometimes, we can count the drops of rain and drops of water,
   but nobody can count the drops of water in a basin or a
   river. We can, however, measure water, as we can also measure 
   the countable mass-words such as sand, fruit and rice.
   Thus we can say a bushel of rice or sand, and a pint of
   water. The following expressions of quantity are useful:--

      One pint (about two tumblerfuls) = 品脱（流质量名约二玻璃杯额)。

      One gallon (8 pints) 加仑(八品脱)。

      A picul = 担,石。 A bushel = 斗.

      Three inches of snowfalf or rainfalf = 雪积三（英）寸，雨量三(英)寸之高.

      One ampere (electric current orflow) = 安培.

      One volt (electro-motive force or strength: a 100-volt current
      cannot make a 220-volt lamp bright enough, because the
      force or strength is not sufficient)＝伏特.

      One watt (electro-motive power as measured by work done: a
      220-volt bulb means a bulb suitable for an electric force of
      220 volts, but a 70-watt bulb means a bulb that can give so
      much light, about 100 candle-powers. Thus bulbs in the
      same city generally must have the same voltage, but may
      have different degrees of lighting power) =瓦,瓦特。

      Thirty-two candle power(s)(speaking of lights) ＝三十二支光(烛力)

      Fifteen horse-power(s) =十五马力 (h.p.)(one h.p. = the power to
      lift 550 pounds a foot high during a second).

      A package of things -包                   A tin of tomato soup 一罐
      A packet of presents 一捆                 A bag of clothing 一袋
      A sack of flour 一袋                      A jar of honey 一瓶
      A wilderness of sweets（遍野)极多         A pack of letters 一束
      A world of trouble 极多,无穷              A pot oftea 一壶
      A mouthful of water 一口                 A bunch of grapes 一束

   Many of these words can of course beused for countable
   things also, as a bag of letters, beans or fruits. We can say
   a lot of, a pile of, an ocean of, or lots of, piles of, oceans of
   with practically no difference in meaning. For collective
   words, sees §5.23. See also §6.20. for expressions of weight,
   and §6.40 for expressions of size and distance.

   Exercise 40. Try to use the expressions “a number of”and
   “a quantity of" in several sentences and show the contrast in
   meaning.

   5.12. Abstract Nouns: Piece of Luck.--We have seen
   already (§4.22) that abstract nn. can be made concrete by the
   addition of words like case, instance, form, piece, bit, act, etc.
   Thus we cannot count abstract “information,” but we can count
   the “pieces of information”. Also, we cannot count “foolishness” 
   or “malaria," but we can count the “acts of foolishness
   (or folly)” and “cases of malaria." Otherwise, abstract nn. are
   used like mass--words, as a great deal of kindness, much kindness,

.. _P113:

   no little care, no little trouble, etc.

   Exercise 41. Try to use the words instances, cases, forms,
   acts, piece, bit in connexion with abstract words like punishment,
   pleasure, theft, typhoid fever, nonsense, trouble, divorce, marriage,
   jealousy, poverty, disloyalty, dishonesty.

Singular and Plural
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   5.20. The Pural Endings -s and -es.--In English, we
   distinguish between singular (one thing) and plural (more
   than one). As remarked above, mass-words and abstract
   nn. have no number but only quantity, and so are not included
   here in the study of number. Most English nn. now have
   come to use the ending -s as a sign of the plural number. We
   may call these plurals in -s (or -es) regular plurals, while
   other plurals not so formed may be called irregular plurals,

   This -s ending is normally or usually pronounced as
   [z]. Only after p, i, k do we have the pronunciation [-ps,
   -ts, -ks], because p, t, k have no voice but only breath, and
   it is unnatural to put in voice again with a [z]. After the
   sounds [s, z, ʃ, ʒ, t5, dʒ], we say [iz] and spell the ending
   with -es, because it is difficult to pronounce s-z, ch-z, j-z,
   etc. together. Practise pronouncing the following words
   correctly:--
   ::

      [-z]               songs               rows
      fees               things              days
      eyes.              dames               boys
      rickshas           dimes               tins
      twos               wives               hens
      heroes             buibs               dogs
      potatoes           sobs                legs
      faws               tubs                girls

.. _P114:
   ::

      pails              moments             causes

      ropes              classes             Churches
                         boxes               matches

      seats              voices              watches
      hats               bases               
      rats               pieces              [-dʒiz]
      cats                                   ages
      carts              [-ziz]              edges
      streets            noses               pages

      students           phrases             bridges

   With nn. ending in [s, θ, f] sounds, these sounds are
   often (but not always) changed into [z, ð, v], due to the
   influence of the voiced [z]. This change in pronunciation
   is sometimes indicated in the spelling, and sometimes not.
   [ð] is pronounced like th in this, thee, quite akin to [z].
   ::

              [-s -- -ziz]               [-θ -- ðz]
            house -- houses             bath -- baths
                                        path -- paths

.. _P115:
   ::

             oath -- oaths             self  -- selves
            mouth -- mouths            shelf -- shelves
           wreath -- wreaths           calf  -- calvcs
      cloth[-ɔː-] -- clothes [-ou-]    leaf  -- leaves
              [-f -- -vz]              thief -- thieves
             wife -- witcs              loaf -- loaves
             life -- lives      staff [-a:-] -- staves [-ei-]

   The plurals clothes, staves (piece of clothing, wooden strip
   in a tub) have developed meanings different from the singular.
   The change in pronunciation dees not occur in all words of
   the same endings. Thus we have:--
   ::

      [-siz]   in horses, cases, races, courses.
      {-ts]    in hearths [ha:bs], heaths, months, tenths.
      [-fs]    in roofs, proofs, chiefs, safes, strifes.

   In truths and ear ths, usage still varies: both [ðz] and [θs]
   are used.

   5.21. Boys, Ladies, Pianos, Potatoes.--Nn. ending in y
   and o are sometimes written with _ys,-os, and sometimes
   -ies, -oes in their plural forms. There is a fairly good rule
   for nn, in-y, but there is nothing but utter confusion in
   the case of the nn. in -o, and the best advice is to look up
   the dictionary whenever in doubt.
   ::

           “-ys” [y after vowel]:   boys, toys, days, trays.(also pulleys, whys).
      “-ies” [y after consonant]:   ladies, stories, kiddies, flies, duties, armies.
           “-os” [o after vowel]:   bamboos, Hindoos, taboos, folios,
                                    curios, embryos, portfolios.
                    [long words]:   generalissimos, archipelagos, manifestos, negritos.
         [foreign-looking words]:   pianos, solos, photos, grottos, fiascos, albinos.
                  [proper names]:   Romeos, Galileos, Neros.
   “-oes”[some familiar plurals]:   potatoes, heroes, negroes, mosquitves, buffaloes.

.. _P116:

   English spelling is here unreasonable, as usual, but there
   is nothing else to do except following the usage.

   5.22. Irregular Plurals: Fish, Dozen and Alumni.--The
   plurals dealt with in the preceding sections may be considered 
   regular plurals. There are some English plurals which
   do not add an -s, or which add nothing at all.

   (a) Irregular Changes::

      tooth--teeth       mouse--mice      brother--brethren (brothers)
       foot--feet           ox--oxen        child--children
      goose--geese

   (b) No Change::

      3,000 cattle.
      450 sheep.
      A lot of fish, salmon, trout.
      Keep fowl, sheep, swine.
      Shoot 20 snipe, wild duck, deer.
      Three dozen [adj.] apples.
      Three dozen [n.] of apples.----but: dozens of them, did it
         dozens of times, pack it in dozens.
      Three score and ten (==seventy).
      Three hundred [adi.] bottles.
      Take three hundred [n.].----but: have seen hundreds of
         them, hundreds and thousands.

   Most of these keep the singular form because they are fegarded 
   as collectives (cattle as a whole, fish as a whole, three
   dozen as a whole), or as mass-words (snipe, duck, deer

.. _P117:

   hunted because of their fish, which is a mass-word). When
   these words are not so regarded, we can use the pluralforms
   with -s (some fishes, ducks or fowls in the backyard). In
   our human selfishness, we often think of the fish in the hunted 
   animals, and forget that they are individual beings. This
   is especially clear in the phrase “fish, fiesh and fowt” (鱼,
   肉,鸡鸭等). Cattle, swine and sheep are never used with -s
   as collective nn. Dozen, score, hundred, thousand generally do
   not take an -s when used after words of number (five dozen,
   a few hundred, but dozens and hundreds).

   (c) Foreign Plurals::

                Latin                        seraph -- ceraphim 
          alumnus -- alumni                            (or: seraphs)
            datum -- data
           medium -- media                         Greek
          stratum -- strata                analysis -- analyses
        bacterium -- bateria                 ihesis -- theses
           genius -- genii                   crisis -- crises
            larva -- Jarve               hypothesis -- hypotheses
          formula -- forniulse           phenomenon -- phenomena
                     (or: formulas)       criterion -- criteria
            index -- indices                           (or: criterions)
                     (or: indexes)
         appendix -- appendices                   French
                     (or: appendixes)        burcau -- bureux
           series -- series                monsieur -- messieurs
          species -- species               madam(e) --  mesdames
        apparatus -- apparatus
                     (or:apparatuses)             Russian
                                          Bolshevik -- Bolsheviki
                Hebrew                                 (or:Bolsheviks)
           cherub -- cherubim             Menshevik -- Mensheviki
                     (or :cherubs)                     (or:Mensheviks)

.. _P118:

   5.23. Collectives: Government Have and Government Has.--
   We have seen already (§4.50) that collective nn. can
   be considered as singular (one group) or as plural (many
   individuals). Of course, collective nn. may have plurals also,
   as “the different nations,” “all the classes," “the European
   Governments.” The peculiar thing is that the singular collective 
   may be used both as singular and as plural. Thus, we
   say There are, or is, a group of boys, all depending on whether 
   we are thinking of the group or of the boys. It is
   better to say The class elect him as representative than The
   class elects him as representative, because it is the class 
   members who do the electing. On the other hand, it is better to
   say The class is represented by him rather than The class are
   represented by him, because we mean the class as a whole is
   represented. Study also the following :—-
   ::

      The train (dead thing) arrives (never arrive),
      The fibrary (dead thing) was burnt (not were).
      There are (or is) a class of words called“collectives.”
      The family have (or has) moved out.
      The Jewish tribe are (or is) a wandering race.
      The people are standing in the rain.
      Look at the crowd. They must number over 10,000.
      If you let the other class know, they will laugh at you.
      One thousand people. Twelve clergy. Twenty police. Six hundred sheep.

   What one must remember is to be consistent. We
   should not say,“The Cabinet has decided at their last meeting,”
   or “The Cabinet have decided at its last meeting,” although
   this is a natural and common mistake, due to change of
   mind or carelessness. It always makes for clearness to use

.. _P119:

   the words the members of, when we mean the separate individuals 
   in the group.

   Exercise 42. Try to use the following collective words and
   expressions:--

   1. The members of the class.
   2. The members of the church.
   3. The members of the family.
   4. A group of people, students, children.
   5. A flock of sheep, geese.
   6. A herd of cattle.
   7. A pack of thieves, fools, rascals, monkeys, hounds,

   5.24. Psychological Intent: Three Weeks Is Heaps of Time.--
   When we say “Five dollars is too dear,” or “Ten
   minutes is enough,” or “Three years is too long for an engagement,” 
   we are really using a “collective” meaning, so the
   vb. in the singular is quite right, and English commonsense
   has triumphed over grammatical nonsense. Similarly, we can
   say:--

      | Three weeks is heaps of time.
      | Another three days was wasted.
      | Every five minutes he dropped in once.
      | Take any three of them.
      | Before three days was passed, the landlord came again.
      | Take that three dollars and buy yourself a new straw hat.
      | Their honeymoon lasted only seventeen days. But that won-
         derfultwo weeks and half (or: two-weeks-and-half) was the
         happiest time of her life.

.. _P120:

   In the expression “mother and child”(母女俩儿) the concep-
   tion is really “collective”although we seldom use a singulair
   vb. with it. Similarly, we have the following:--

      | They are a second Romeo and Juliet (pair of sweethearts).
      | Hs is a second (Dr.) Jekyll and (Mr.) Hyde (double personality).
      | The husband and wife look like brother and sister.
      | This ball and socket is broken.
      | He was riding in a coach-and-four (horses).
      | Hand me that cup and saucer.
      | Bread and butter is a kind of food.
      | The whole bug and baggage was thrown out into the street.
      | Peace and security is what we want.
      | Sympathy and understanding is (or: are) required.
      | Six and six is (or: are) twelve.

   5.25. The Generic Singular.--When we say “Man is
   mortal," we are using man as a class-word, meaning“All
   men are mortal.” We make the singular man represent all members 
   of mankind. Generally we use the article the in this
   connexion, but a may also be used with the same meaning.
   Study the following:一

.. _P121:

      There is nothing to be proud of for the teacher to cram ever so
      many grammatical rules and definitions into the student's head.

      The Chinese student of English is often misled by the English
      spelling.

      The student often remembers nis marks and forgets about his
      studies.

      Everything has been done for the comfort of the traveller.
      The policeman is supposed to be courteous to the publte.

      The King Ching of Ch'i [齐景公] says, “If the king is not like
      a king, the minister is not like a minister, the father is not
      like a father, and the son is not like a son, how am I going
      to get anything to eat, even if the people have rice?” [信如君
      不君,臣不臣,父不父,子不子,虽有粟,吾得而食诸?]

      Mencius says,“If the ruler regards the minister (or: ministers)
      as dust and grass, then the minister (or: ministers) will regard
      the ruler as his (or:their) enemy,”[君之视臣如土芥，臣则视君如寇罐了]

      The life of the Chinese daughter-in--law was a pretty hard one.
      The fox is a night prowling animal.

   Exercise 43. Learn to use some of the following expressions
   referring to whole classes:-
   ::

      1. a (or:the) son's duty            7. the student's studies
      2. the smoker's throat              8. the use of the diploma
         (irritation due to smoking)      9. the ass's ['æsiz] ears
      3. an (or: the) actor's life        10. the cat's-paws
      4. a (cr: the) child's teeth        11. the foreigner in China
      5. the scientist's method           12. the modern girl
      6. the Englishman in China          13. the rickshaw coolie

   5.26. Natural Plurals.--There are objects which naturally 
   go in pairs (as trousers, scales, scissors), or in greater

.. _P122:

   number (as mneasles, ashes, suds), and it is natural that we
   use these habitually in the plural form with -s. When such
   pairs or sets of things can be easily separated, then of course
   the singular is also occasionaily used, as a shoe (but not a
   trouser), and a wave, a bubble (but not a sud). All this is
   vcry natural. In referring to them as one thing, we generally
   say a pair of scissors, a pair of breeches, etc. Further examples 
   are:--
   ::

      pincers 钳子                 preparations 部署,筹备     proceeds 贏利
      forceps  外科钳子            embers 灰炉                earnings 收入
      tongs  火钳                  remains 遗骸               belongings 所有物件
      bellows  风箱                arms 兵器                  surroundings 周围
      compasses  圆规              colours 大旗               grounds 宅地
      spectacles  眼鏡             bowels 肠肚                contents 内容
      cross--roads  十字街         intestines 肠              assets 资产
      arrangements  准备,接洽      lungs 肺脏                 odds and ends 零碎杂物

   We seldom say the preparation or arrangement for a departure,
   but the preparations or arrangements, because naturally there
   are many things to prepare. (On the other hand, we may
   say the arrangement of the room and the preparation for 
   tomorrow's lesson, because the meaning is clearly singular). A
   person's earnings, belongings, and a company's assets are
   also generally plural in number, so the use of plural is quite
   natural.

   Notice also the natural use of plurals in the following:—
   ::

      shake hands with =握手
      change places with =易地而居
      be (or make) friends with =交友
      be quits with =两相抵消，两无负欠
      rub shoulders with =耳鬓晰磨

.. _P123:

   Usage varies with regard to the names of the sciences
   ending in _ics, as physics, mathematics, ethics, classics, metaphysics, 
   esthetics. These nn. may be used both as singulars
   and as plurals (Mathematics is or are). But, generally, it is
   better to use them as singulars when referring to the sciences,
   and as plurals when referring to a more general meaning.
   E.g.一

      Physies is changing our conceptions of the universe.

      Mathematics is easy to teach when you can make it interest-
      ing to the students.

      His mathematics (figures and counting) are all wrong.

      The acoustics (resonance of sound) of the hall are very bad.

      The ethics of the play are above criticism.

      Even here no hard and fast rule can be laid down, and
      a great deal of freedom is allowed--and taken.

   5.27. Differentiated Plurals.--It is also natural that the
   plurals of a good many words develop definite meanings which
   are different from the singulars. Arms means the different
   weapons, such as rifles, swords and bayonets, and goods
   means things sold or bought by merchants. Study the following:一
   ::

      Sing.                Plur.
      custom 风俗           *customs 关税

      work 工作             works 工厂，作品

.. _P124:

   It should be noticed that (a) words marked * have also
   the meaning of the corresponding singular or plural, as an
   air of contempt, a state paper, the customs of the country;
   (b) means and news are used both as singulars and plurals;
   and (c) the singular forms wage and tiding are very seldom
   used. Examples of the use of these plurals are:--
   ::

      Take great pains (=take trouble) to...
      Have received advices not to ship the goods.
      The Prince's living quarters.
      He has no guts in him.
      The paper works. The works of an author.
      Must find a means to reach him.
      Received this news yesterday
      He has no manners.
      She is proud of her looks.
      The news was published in the papers.

   5.28. Some Special Cases: Sons-in-Law, the Miss Rogers, etc.--
   There are some special cases which may be mentioned here. 
   These are (a) compound words where the -s
   must be added to the principal words, (b) compound words
   with no clear principal words, (c) proper names, (b） letters
   and figures, (e) words or phrases quoted, and (f) phrases

Numerals
~~~~~~~~

   5.30. Numerals, Fractions and Multiples.--The greatest
   difficuty in English counting for the Chinese student is the
   expression of the Chinese idea of wan (万), which is “ten
   thousand” in English. When the student wishes to express
   his idea of wan in terms of thousands, he must remember to
   muitiply it by ten. The next thing to remember is that a hundred 
   wan makes a “milion," and hence a thousand wan is
   simply “ten milion." No end of confusion has been caused
   by this difference in notion.
   ::

             one wan=ten thousand            10,000.
             ten wan=hundred thoutand       100,000.
         hundred wan=one million          1,000,000.
        thousand wan=ten million         10,000,000.
         ten wan wan=one billion      1,000,000,000.

   The English way of counting is really very clear through
   its division into threes in the reading of long sums; thus
   1,001,000 is easily seen to be one million and one thousand,
   while 10,010,000 is ten million and ten thousand. Also there
   is fmore regard for accuracy in English statements of number;

.. _P127:

   thus a meeting of “over one wan people" in Chinese is really
   the equivalent of a meeting of “filieen thousand people" or so
   in English.

   The expressions fifteen hundred or seventeen hundred fifty
   (for 1,500 or 1,750) are quite common for figures below two
   thousand. The year “1930” should therefore be read as
   nineteen (hundred) thirty, which is better than the clumsy one
   thousand nine hundred thirty.

      27. I have seen scores and scores (hundreds and hundreds) of
          such cases.(Cf. Three score and ten is the age of man.)
      28. Some hundreds. Some dozens. Sometens.

   (6) A number of, any numberof (多少,多,少):--

      29. I have a number of things [多少事] to do,
      30. There are a number of students outside.
      31. A few friends. A great many friends. A good many friends.
         Not a few friends. A lor of friends. Lots of friends, Many,

      33. He has I don't know how many friends (i.e., very many)。
      34. I have told you this I don't know how many times [已经告诉你不知多少次].

Confict of Number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   5.40. Conflict of Number.--There are cases where it
   may be hard to decide whether a singular or a plural should
   be used. Such troubles never arise in the Chinese language
   because we do not distinguish the singular and pluralendings.
   English usage, however, has established certain unwritten rules
   which must be noticed here.
   ::

      (a) One or two days. One or two cases.
          (Cf. a week or two, a case or two.,)
      (b) Many a man thinks, etc.
          More than one person (for thevb, see next paragraph “f”).
      (c) An upper and a lower shelf.
          The upper and the lower shelf.
            (But: the upper and lower shelves).
          Both the old and the new dress.
            (But: the old and new dresses.)
          We welcome the new, and say good-bye to the old year.

.. _P132:

   When a or the is repeated, we use the singular, because in
   the upper and the lower shelf, we seem to have the word shelf
   understood already after the upper: the upper (shelf) and
   the lower shelf. Similarly, We welcome the new (year), etc.

   (d) In the case of one thing which belongs to several
   persons, the case may be quite clear when we mean their
   house or their houses, their (common)journey, but their 
   (separate) wives (unless they have a common wife). But it may
   not be so clear when we have a more abstract meaning.
   Shall we say their meaning or their meanings? and They have
   made up their mind or minds? Generally when we have a
   more abstract meaning, we use the singular (§4.30), otherwise, 
   we use the plural. Thus we may say “Their heads
   (脑袋) look alike,” but “They don't use their head” (abstract
   singular=用头脑，用脑力). Also, in regular phrases, we
   usually keep the singular, as “They came on foot (by walking),”
   “They took a fancy to her.” Thus:-
   ::

      They have no use (abstract).
      The uses (separate) of the different parts.
      The soidiers appeared in uniform (phrase).
      The men appeared in formal dress (phrase).
      The women wore bright-coloured dresses (some in green, some in lavender, etc.).
      The life (abstract) of the peasants.
      The lives (separate) of great men.
      Those three had also a hand (abstract,-- a share) in the matter.
      We must wash our faces (or even face, regarding “washing
         face” as a regular phrase). But: We must tell them this to
         save our face (abstract,=honour, good name [面子]).
      All of them are in trouble (phrase). But: All of them are in
         troubles of some sort or other (separate).
      The foreigners can leave our internal wars alone; they need
         not put their foot in it (=they need not interfere; not feet, them).
      This happened right under the nose (not noses) of the authorities.
      We must keep an eye on that young girl(=watch her and keep
         her from going wrong).
      Opium-smokers always have a bad digestion.
      People who want to preserve our “old morality” generally have
         a bad conscience.
      People who oppose the emancipation of women generally lead
         an immoral life (or immoral lives,=have concubines, seduce
         young girls, etc).
      Men of bad temper, strong determination, good health, poetic
         imagination (all abstract words).
      Words of different gender, number, meaning, case, etc.

.. _P133:

   We even often say those kind of things, those kind of people
   (besides that kind and those kinds).

   5.41. Number in Verbs.--The English language still
   distinguishes have and has, is and are, comes and come,
   although it does not distinguish the singular and plural of
   had, did, came (but was and were). This has given rise to
   many unnecessary difficulties, over which the best writers from
   Shakespeare, Milton, Swift to Shelley, Thackeray and Macaulay 
   often stumble.* The case is quite clear when you have
   A boy goes, Two boys go, but in What China needs are good
   roads, the best minds often get confused and become helpless.

.. _P134:

   Many of these difticulties are due to psychological causes 
   (forgetfulness, unpreparedness, change of mind, influence of the
   nearest words, etc.). One should try to avoid these errors
   by keeping a sharp look-out.

   (1) Subject and complement in different number： follow the subject.
   ::

      My only pleasure is the movies.
      The movies are my only pleasure.
      All that is simply ways of deceiving the people.
      The Greeks were a wonderful race.
      Our only guide is the stars.
      The stars are our only guide.
      His food was fruit and goat-milk.
      Fruit and goat--milk were his food.

   (2) One of those is, one of those who are: see what you
   mean.--We say “One of the boys is sick," but “He is one
   of the boys who are sick. "In the latter case, there are evidently 
   many sick boys. It is easy to forget this, when the
   phrase is longer. It the following, the real logical subjects
   are indicated with bold face.

      The meeting of so many strangers of so many nationalities
      broadens his mind.

      The puting together of so many incongruous colours is displeasing to the eye.

      is too much for him.

      The apples grown on this hill have a special flavour of their own.

      The results of the examination show that you have been making
      considerable progress.

      One (1) of his concubines (2), who all have (2) their lovers,
      runs (1) away with hers.

      This is one of the best games that are ever played in Shanghai.

      One of the books he bought yesterday is torn.(He bought
      many, but one is torn).

      He is one of those who always forget their engagements.

.. _P135:

   (3) Subjects of mixed number: use plural verbs,---Here
   we can have several possibilities:-

      (1) Mother and child were kidnapped.
      (2) Mother and children were kidnapped.
      (3) Mother or child was kidnapped.
      (4) Mother or children were kidnapped.

      Only the last case calls for attention. Examples are:--

      | One or, two examples have to be given.
      | There are one or two things that you must remember.

   (4) Verbs before subjects: think of your subject before-hand.--
   The most common form is a sentence beginning with
   there is, as There is one thing, but There are a number of
   things. The difficulty is, we may begin by thinking of one
   thing, and then later on think of other things: There is
   a big pearl and (ofter-thought) a number of smaller ones
   (are should be used). Mistakes of this kind are practically 
   impossible to avoid in speaking, because the afterthought
   actually comes after the phrase there is is spoken already,
   and they are to be found in the writings of the best authors.
   Consequently, there is some justification for it even in 
   writing. A lady whose attenticn is captivated and whose soul
   is set on fire by the sight of a big pearl naturally says--

      There is a big pearl of wonderful roundness and lustre and a
      number of smaller ones in her necklace.

.. _P136:

   and it is hard to condemn her for her bad grammar. A
   punctilious writer would even purposely write:--

      There is a big pearl of wonderful roundness and lustre in her
      necklace, and a number of smaller ones, besides.

   Here is is better than are because the expression is rounded
   off by in her necklace for the first part, and the second
   part can be regarded as elliptical with there are understood.*
   Except in such constructions, however, one should generally
   think of his subject before he uses the verb. Following are
   correct examples:--

      In the room are a table, a bed, and a piano.

      Now come all trials and experiences that can happen to a man.

      Under this roof are gathered today the most distinguished
      names of the country.

      Under “university students”are included both post-graduates
      and under-graduates.

      In this city are to be found both the most renowned scholars
      and the worst scoundrels of the country.

      Here are the papers he left for you to read.

      There are a full-page coloured illustration and many smaller
      ordinary ones in this book.

      Where's your manners? is also quite idiomatic.

   (5) Pronouns of common number: see which is meant.---
   The pronn. who, what, which, none, any, more may refer to
   singular or plural. They are therefore singular or plural 
   according to the circumstances: Who is my friend? but Who are my
   friends? The same is true of the relative pronn, who, which
   and that: the thing that angers me, the things that anger me,
   those who are too lazy, etc.

      None but the brave deserves the fair (but a prep.).

      |  This is what seems to be the reason for his resignation.
      |  The paper will publish what are considered the best essays on the subject.

   In the case of a noun clause beginning with what, one should
   always treat it as singular:--

      |  What you say is quite true.
      |  What China needs is good roads (cf. examples adove),
      |  What angered him was the personal attacks.
         (Cf. The personal attacks were what angered him)

   (6) Each, as well as, many a, more than one.--These
   are special cases. Each, many a and more than one with nn.
   in the singular almost always take the singular verb. The
   noun following as well as should be entirely excluded in the
   consideration of the number of the vb.

Ch VI Weight, Value, Size, Shape And Position
---------------------------------------------

National Differences in These Categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   6.10. National Differences in These Categories.--The
   English expressions of weight, value, size, distance, position
   and shape differ quite considerably from the Chinese. One
   should learn to use these expressions correctly and to know
   their exact meaning.

Expressions of Weight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   6.20. Expressions of Weight.--There are in measures of
   weight, as in measures of size and distance, two systems, one
   the old English system which is in generaluse, and the other
   the so-called “metric” system, more in scientific use. The
   metric system is quite simple. Both gram and gramme may
   beused in all these words.
   ::

           gram = about 15 Troy grains
       decagram = 10 grams
      hectogram = 100 grams
       kilogram = 1,000 grams
       decigram = 10th of 1 gram
      centigram = 100th of 1 gram
      milligram = 1,000th of 1 gram

   The most common term is kilogram which is about 2.2
   ordinary pounds. In the old English system, there are again
   two series of weight measures: one the common weight, or
   avoirdupois (pr. [ˌævədəˈpɔɪz]) weight, and the other used by
   gold- and silversmiths, called Troy weight. The avoirdupois
   pound is heavier than the Troy pound, and is equal to 12

.. _P140:

   Chinese ounces. Study the following equivalents (the abbreviations 
   are put in brackets):--
   ::

      Common Weight (avoir.)
          16 drams = 1 ounce (0z.)
         16 ounces = 1 pound (Ib.)= 7,000 grains
      112 poundsme = hundredweight (cwt.)
      2,240 pounds = 1 ton
         14 pounds = 1 stone (used in speaking of a man's weight)

      Troy Weight
            24 grains = 1 pennyweight (dwt.)
      20 pennyweights = 1 ounce (oz.)
            12 ounces = 1 pound (1b.) = 5,760 grains

   Both pounds, ounces and pound, ounce are used for the
   plural, but now it is much more common to say pounds,
   ounces, while stone is more common than stones for the plural
   (He weighs twelve stone I a man of twelve stone).

   Notice that in all expressions of weight, size, value,
   distance, we use the terms of measure immediately after the
   vbb. weigh, measure, cost and the adj. worth.
   ::

      The package weighs a pound and helf.
      It costs three dollars.
      It is worth the money.
      It is not worth sixpence.
      The bed measures six feetlong.

   Compare also expressions of time and number like It
   lasts seven minutes, The troops munbered fifteen thousand and
   also the expressions, weighs heavy, weighs much, weighs little,
   is worth much, is worth little, cost dear, measure long, measure
   short, etc.

Expressions of Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   6.30. Expressions of Value.--In English, there are two

.. _P141:

   different ways of counting money, the English and the American way. 
   The English way is really as complicated as and
   only a little less crazy than, the Chinese way of counting dollars 
   and taels and “big money” and “small money.” However,
   there are only three chief units to learn, as follows:---
   ::

           1 penny = about 2 gold cents
          12 pence = I shilling = about 25 cts. Gold
      20 shillings = 1 poundzs about $5.00 Gold

   Crown and sovereign are names of English coins.
   ::

      1 crown = S shillings
      1 halfcrown =- 2 shillings and sixpence
      1 sovereign  I pound

   The symbols used are:-
   ::

         £. s. d. = pound--shilling--pence
       £. 6.10.6. = six pound ten and six (ten shillings and sixpence)
             £. 3 = three pounds
             10/6 = ten and six (ten shillings and sixpence)
              4/- = four shillings
              1/- = one shilling
      8d. or -/18 = eightpence

   The terms pound and penny require special notice.
   ::

      five pounds (-s usual)
      five pound ten (without -s)
      five pounds sterling (sterling used only with exact sums of
      pounds, as f 500 stg,, but not “five pound ten stg.")
      pennies (plural as regards coins)
      pence (plural as regards sum or value)
      halfpenny (pr. [ˈheɪpənɪ))
      twopence (pr. [ˈtʌpənɪ])
      threepence (pr. [ˈθrepəns)
      twopenny piece 
      threepenny piece 
      fourpence to elevenpence and twentypence written together
      (pr [-pns])--otherwise written separately (pr. [pens]), e.g.,
      thirteen pence

.. _P142:

   The American dollar-and-cents system is like the Chinese.
   ::

      100 cents (cts,) = 1 dolar ($1.00)
              10 cents = 1 dime
               5 cents = 1 nickel

   For the following symbols read as follows:--
   ::
   
      $1.00 (U. S.): one dollar U. S. currency
      $1.00 G.     : one dolfar gold
      $1.50        : dollar fifty, or dollar and half
      $3.75        : three (dollars) seventy-five (cents)

   The English terms for the Chinese currency are as follows:-
   ::

      $ 1.00 (Mex.)  : one dollar Mex.(or Mexican)
      $ 25 or 25 tls.: twenty-five taels
      10 Hk.tls.     : ten Haikwan taels
      $ 0.03         : three tael cents
      23 cop.or cops.: twenty-three coppers
                cash = 文；现洋
           big money = 大洋
         small money = 小洋

   Among the non-English foreign currencies, we may
   mention here the German mark (=25 cents Gold) and the
   French franc(=20 cents Gold). We speak also of paper
   mark, gold mark and paper franc, gold franc. Notice also 
   expressions like a dollar's wurth of salt-eggs, fifteen-cents' worth
   of sugar, a dollar note (banknote) and a five-pound note.

.. _P143:

Expressions of Size and Distance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   6.40. Expressions of Size and Distance.--There are also
   two systems here, the old English system and the metric
   system. In the metric system, the meter here is used as the
   basis, and the other names have prefixes like deca-, kilo-,
   deci-, milli-, which have the same meaning as in the “gram”
   series (cf. §6.20). The practically useful words here are:--
   ::

            meter = 39 inches, a little over a yard
        kilometer = 1,000 meters, about two--thirds of a mile
       centimeter = 100th of a meter, about 1/3 of an inch

   In the old system, there are the following expressions:
   ::

             inch = 英寸, about 0.73 Chinese in.
             foot = 12 inches, about 8.7 Chinese in,
             yard = 3 feet = 2.6 Chinese ft.
             mile = 1,760yds., about 3.3 Chinese li
          furlong = 220 yds., or 8th of a mile
           fathom = 6 ft. or 2 yds. (especially in measuring depth of water)
            5' 4" = five feet four inches

   For the plural, we almost always add an -s to these terms,
   except when they are used as modifiers, as in a five-foot shelf,
   a two-yard stick, three inch (or inches) wide. Learn also the
   following expressions of size, and surface and cubic measures:-
   ::

      four square feet (4 sq. ft.) me four squares, each of which is
      one foot long and one foot wide; three sq. ft.e three
      such squares =三方英尺
      four feet squarezz a square whose sides are all four feet
      long = 四英尺见方
      square mile =方英里
      acre -- 4,840 sq. yds. =英亩 (the Chinese mu is a highly shifting measure)
      three feet long by four feet wide, or three by four (often written 3'×4')
      four cubic feet= 四立方英尺
      twenty cubic centimeters

.. _P144:

   Notice that we can say a thing is the size of ..., is twice
   (half) the size of... Notice also that we very commonly say
   A man is a hundred yards off,. The water is four inches deep,
   using a hundred yards and four inches as adverb phrases, and
   the word off as an adjective.

   Exercise 44. Learn to use the following expressions:--

   1. five feet high                      14. within a bowshot
   2. five feet four                      15. within an earshot
   3. three inches deep (thick)           16. by a long way
   4. eight by ten                        17. near at hand
   5. a few steps from here               18. about a hundred yards off
   6. a hundred paces from                19. three blocks further (cross three streets)
   7. quarter of a mile                   20. the size of a pea
   8. miles and miles away                21. the height of a lamp-post
   9. a long (short) way off              22. the thickness of this book
   10. a long (short) distance from       23. about an hour's walk from
   11. within sight                       24. ten minutes' ride from
   12. within call                        25. near (close) by a place
   13. at a stone's throw

Expressions of Shape: English Shape-Blindness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   6.50. Expressions of Shape: English Shape-Blindness.一
   A great difference is noticeable when we compare the English
   and Chinese notions of shape. Whereas the Chinese seem
   unable to think of a thing without calling up its shape also,
   the English language, looked at from the purely Chinese point
   of view, seems to be spoken by a race of shape-blind people.
   This is another instance of the highly concrete and synthetie
   way of Chinese thinking.

.. _P145:

   English suffices with a fish, a table, a bookcase, an ox,
   etc. But in Chinese, we have, for instance:--,
   ::

      一条鱼 i tiau yu (one “strip”fish)
      一张桌子 i chang chuo-tse (one “flat piece” table)
      一架书橱 i chia shu-ch'u (one “shelf”book--case)
      一头牛 i t'ou niu (one “head”ox)
      一座山 i tsuo shan (one “seat”hill)
      一把刀 i patao (one “grip”knife)
      一管笔 i kuan pi (one “tube”brush)
      一盏灯 i chan teng(one “small-cup”Jamp)
      一湾溪水 i wan ch'i-shui (one “curve”river)
      一钩新月 i kou hsin--yueh (one “hook”’new moon)

   There are times when this shape-notion is carried so
   far as to apply to abstract things even, as in the following:---
   ::

      一门亲事 i men ch'in shi(one “door” marriage)
      一团晦气 i tuan huei-ch'i (one “Jump” depressedspirit)
      一腔热诚 i chiang jeh-ch'eng (one “throat” enthusiasm)
      一场恶梦 i ch'ang o meng (one “scene” bad dream)
      一股勇气 i ku yung-ch'i (one “bunch” courage)
      一道命令 i taoming-ling (one “path” official order)

   This way of thinking, however, although not common
   in English, is not entirely absent in that language. When a
   chorus girl,* under the fire of the prosecutor's questions in a
   court trial, cries out in desperation:“Oh, won't you leave me
   one shred of my reputation?!" she is using there a phrase 
   implying a very vivid shape-notion. Notice also the following:--
   ::

      a cake of soap                   a piece of mutton, hair, paper, luck
      a bar of seap                    a strip of land, cloth, paper
      a ball of cotton yarn            a ray of hope
      d sheet of paper                 a shower of criticism
      a drop of water                  a sea of trouble
      a grain of sand, rice, justice   an expanse of water
      a cloud of arrows                a bit of water, honey, food, paper
      an ear of corn                   a slice of bread
      a lump of sugar                  20 head of cattle

   Compare also the expressions for collective nn. and mass-words, 
   as a bunch of grapes, a suit of clothing, a jar of honey,
   etc.(see §5.11, §5.23).

Expressions of Position
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   6.60. Expressions of Position.--Position is usually indicated 
   in English by prepp. and advv., as well as by adjj.

   It should be remembered, however, that the relationship between 
   prepp. and advv. is very close and the distinction between 
   them is often purely arbitrary:--
   ::

      [Adj.]  He is in.
      [Adv.]  He goes in.
      [Prep.] He is in the house.

   There are few prepp, that cannot otherwise serve as adjj. or
   advv. in identical or similar senses:
   ::

      Prep.                   Adj.                 Adv.
      up the river            he is up             going up
      off the coast           mind is off          goes off
      by his side             by-path              passes by
      inside the room         people inside        goes inside
      above your head         man above            stay above
      below him               man below            look below
      under the water         under-dog            go under (sink）
      between them            a layer between      came between
      over the top            meeting is over      talk it over
      about this point        is about to          turn about

.. _P147:

   In up train, man below (above), we may regard the words
   up and below as originally advv. used as adij, like then in
   the then (reigning) king. We say also “His visits home are
   few and far between”: the advv. home and between are here
   used as adjj. It is important, therefore, that we recognize the
   close relationship between prepp. and advv. and adjj. of place
   or position. Study how the words far, near, with, without,
   besides, beside, away are used. Can all of them be used as
   prepp.？

   It is even clearer that all prepositional phrases are used
   in adj. or adv. functions. These phrases are called “prepositional 
   phrases” as regards their form (beginning with a prep.),
   and “adj.” or “adv. phrases” as regards their function:--

      | He came into the house (adv. modifying came).
      | Heis in the house (adj. modifying he).

   It is also interesting to note that (a) adjj. of position
   are often used as nn. and that we often have (b) a prep.
   +an adv, or (c.) an adv. + a prep, or prep + prep. 
   (=compound prep.), the distinction between adv. and prep. here
   being, as we have said, arbitrary. Up to, down in, on to,
   e.g, are clearly compound prepp. like upon, into, unto.
   ::

      (A)                     (B)
      the above               over herc
      the next                over there
      the last                round here
      the rear                to the right from above
      the front               from on high (=from above)
      the east                from abroad
      the west                up from slavery
      on the left             in between them

      (C)
      down in the room        away with the old
      jump on to the stage    on to the new
      get down from the car   from within
      run up to the house     fiom behind the forest
      look up to the man      out from a place
      look down upon him      get on with a fellow
      on with it (开始进行)   up to the present

.. _P148:

   Notice also such common pairs as the following:一
   ::

      over and above            here and there
      around and above us       round and round
      to and fro                on and on
      back and forth            in and out
      right and left            off and on

   All of these are usually used as adv. phrases.

   6.61. Peculiar Use of Prepositions.--One of the greatest
   difficulties for a foreign student of English is the use of proper
   prepositions. This is so because, perhaps more than any
   other class of words, the use of prepositions depends on usage
   alone. This usage varies from word to word, and from
   language to language. It is quite clear that we should say
   “The ship floats on water," but it is not so clear why we
   should say “The house is on fire," and not “in fire.” Usage
   alone determines this, and usage varies in the different languages. 
   We say “in bed” in English, but tsaich'uang shang
   (“on bed”) in Chinese.

   In English, vbb. and adjj. often require definite prepp.
   in particular senses. These prepp. combine with their preceding 

.. _P149:

   vbb. or adjj. to form phrases with a definite meaning.
   Thus to “wait for” means to await, whereas to “wait on”
   means to serve or attend upon a person. The use of prepp.
   after vbb. and adjj., therefore, must be closely observed,
   and this is always indicated in a good dictionary. Study, for
   example, the following phrases, and notice the change of
   meaning and the entirely arbitary nature in the use of prepp.
   ::

      on the train                  look down upon person 卑视
      get on the horse              look over the manuscript 阅
      house is on fire 着火         look about 环顾
      dog is on the chain           look forward to 期望
      march on London 攻            look back upon 回顾,追忆
      draw a knife on me            get at the meaning
      turn back on a person 拒是    get up from bed
      look on a game 旁观           get on with a friend
      look at a thing 看            get away from a place
      look upon something 视        get through with one's work
      look into a matter 勘查       get down to work
      look up to a person 累仰是    get used to athing

   The use of up and down in connexion with travelling
   is quite like Chinese. We say up north, but down south,
   and use up in general for going to a higher place, or captital,
   or university, and down for the opposite. The word around
   is gradually disappearing in British usage, and is being 
   substituted by round. While Americans would say turn around,
   go around to the post, the church around the corner, loaf
   around a place, such expressions are already impossibilities for
   an Englishman. He would say round here, round the corner,
   seated round the table, stationed round the field.

   Notions of concrete position naturally shade off into
   those of abstract relationships. For prepp. expressing 
   relationships (angry with a person, at a thing), see Chap. XV.

.. _P150:

Ch VII Representation
---------------------

Representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   7.10. Representation.--When we say “John speaks to
   John's mother, but John's mother does not hear John,” every-
   body feels that the statement is unnecessarily long and awkward. 
   Usually we say “John speaks to his mother, but she
   does not hear him." The words his, she and him represent, or
   take the place of, John's, John's mother and John. Hence it
   is often said that pronn. are words which take the place of nn.
   This is quite true, but it should be remembered that, like all
   other definitions, this definition should not be taken too 
   seriously. The word mother in John's mother can be said to take
   the place of, or represent, Mrs. X, and yet it is not 
   considered a pron., but a n.

   What is more important for the student of grammar to
   rememberis that here we are dealing with a general problem
   of representation. We use she to represent Mrs. X, because
   there is a need for economy in speech. There are various
   reasons for using representation: for economy, variation,
   expressiveness, and for social reasons. But this is not 
   confined to pronn. When we say “He forgot to take the cover
   off, although I told him to” (for “to take the cover off”), we
   are purposely avoiding repetition and aiming at economy just
   as in using the pron. she for Mrs. X.
   On the other hand, when we purposely avoid saying “I
   believe” and use “we believe” or “the present writer believes”

.. _P151:

   instead, we do not achieve economy, but are satisfying a need
   for modesty. When a Chinese mother refers to her husband
   not by mentioning his name, but as “So-and-so's father” or
   as the very ambiguous “he,” she is also using a form of
   representation out of shyness. Finally, when a newspaper
   editor writes “A certain general is reported to have sent a 
   large consignment of a certain commodity to Shanghai,"
   instead of writing more bluntly “General Y----- has sent a
   consignment of opium," he is using representation to avoid
   going into gaol.

   The pronn. are, of course, the most important class of
   words used for representation. In this chapter, we shall study
   not only the forms of pronn. but also the purposes for which
   representation is used. We shall also study various means of
   representation besides the pronn., such as the use of metaphors,
   indirect statements and representation by omission.

Personal Pronouns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   7.20. Personal Pronouns: Case and Person.--When we
   speak of pronn, we always think of the words I, you, he,
   she, it, we, they. These are called “personal pronouns” and
   they form the most important class. There are also impersonal 
   and other pronn. which we shall study later. All these
   personal pronn. except if, refer to persons, and the words who
   may also be included here.

   These pronn. are said to belong to three persons and
   three cases. In the following tables, the old or archaic forms
   are put in brackets.

.. _P152:

      +-----------------+----------------+----------+
      |                 |   Singular     |   Plural |
      +-----------------+----------------+----------+
      | | First Person  | | I            | | we     |
      | | Second Person | | you (thou)   | | you    |
      | | Third Person  | | he, she, it  | | they   |
      +-----------------+----------------+----------+

   The words I, you, he, etc. used as subjects of vbb. are
   said to be in the “nominative case”; the words my, your,
   his, etc. are said to be in the “possessive case”; and the words
   me, you, him, etc. used as objects of vbb. (see me) or of prepp.
   (for me) are said to be in the “objective case.”

      =========== === ====== ===== === ==== ===== ===== ===== =====
      Nominative  I   (thou)  he   she  it   we    you   they  who
      Possessive  my  (thy)   his  her  its  four  your  their whose
      Objective   me  (thee)  him  her  it   us    you   them whom
      =========== === ====== ===== === ==== ===== ===== ===== =====

   The peculiarthing about the pronn. in the objective case
   is that they are usually unaccented and are joined to the
   preceding vbb. or prepp. in pronunciation as if they were
   syllables of the same word. Thus--
   ::

      Don't believe it [bi'li:vit].
      Don't rell them ['telðəm,'teləm].
      I can't see him ['si:him,'si:im,'si:m].
      Was glad to meet her ['mi:tə] (pr. just like meter).
      No use denying it [di'naiiŋit).
      in it ['init], above it [ə'bʌvit].
      once upoh a time [ˈwʌnsəpɒnˈtaɪm].
      at home [ət'houm, or: ə'toum], at if [ətit, or: 'ætit].
      to him ['tu(:)im], to me ['tu:mi:].
      forus [fɔrʌs, 'fɔrəs; or: 'fɔ:-)].

.. _P153:

   Chinese students usually say “tell them,” “see him”--
   which is all wrong. Only when these words are emphasized
   do we accent them, as “for me, not for you.”

   7.21. Mine, Thine, etc.---Study the following:一
   ::

      This is my book.           It is mine.
      This is her ring.          The ring is hers.
      You bring your book.       They will bring theirs.
      It is my pleasure.         The pleasure is mine.
      It is your fault.          The fault is yours.

   Notice when the nn. used after my, thy, etc. are understood, 
   we change the pronn. into mine, thine, etc. Thus we
   have the following series, with the exception of its.
   ::

      my-----mine                our-----ours
      thy-----thine              your----yours
      his---his                  their----theirs
      her----hers                whose---whose

   A very peculiar use is seen in the following:--
   ::

      Our friend.                A friend of ours.
      My pen.                    This pen of mine.
      Their relative.            A relative of theirs.
      Jinmy's (his) brother.     A brother of Jimmy's (his).
      Your boy-husband.          That boy-husband of yours.
      Your filial son.           That filial son of yours.
      Her uncle's book.          That book of her uncle's.

   There is always a tinge of familiarity implied in such
   expressions. Notice that we cannot say that your son or this
   my pen, but must say that son of yours or this pen of mine
   (cf. §8.30).

   Exercise 45. Put in the words mine, thine, etc. and omit the
   nn. wherever you can in the following sentences 1-5, and use a…of

.. _P154:

   yours, that...of mine, etc. in the sentences 6-10.

   1. I will give you my book and you will give me your book.
   2. My mother is older than her mother.
   3. He forgot to bring his dictionary. I have not forgot my dictionary.
   4. It is both your fault and his fault.
   5. Here is a handkerchief. Whose handkerchief is it?
   6. That son you have is up for mischief.
   7. He is my father's darling friend.
   8. That is his pet notion.
   9. That is one of my bad habits.
   10. It has been my fond dream to visit Europe.

   7.22. Infuence of Modesty, Respect, Familiarity, etc.--
   As we have said already, pronn. are used for different purposes
   of representation. Pronn. are changed also, therefore, when
   the purpose is changed.

   Out of modesty, real or assumed, we often try to avoid
   using too many “I's," especially in writing, and substitute
   for them the vaguer “we,"as in we believe, we have often
   seen, if we are to believe his words, if we are not mistaken.
   This is so especially in writing. Sometimes the present writer
   is used instead, as inIt has come to the present writer's knowedge, 
   etc. for “my knowledge.” In official signed statements,
   the undersigned (sing, or pl.) is often uscd with vbb. in the
   third person (The undersigned is, or are, of the opinion, etc.)。
   Compare Chinese 鄙人，愚，愚见，etc, instead of 我，吾意.
   This, of course, is always formal and may seem at times 
   affected and unnatural. Compare also the “modest” use of
   one (§7.24,“c”)。

   On the other hand, respect or deference to a superior or
   stranger often compels us to avoid the direct “you.” Compare

.. _P155:

   Chinese 杨先生，焕章先生，尊意 and the Pekingese 您 instead
   of 你，汝意. The English you can be used in addressing 
   superiors and strangers quite generally, where Chinese would
   avoid it by saying “Mr. Yang,’“Miss Chen” (杨先生,陈女
   士, 焕章先生)，etc.

   Study also the following cxpressions:--

      I object, your Honour (to judge).

      Your Majesty (to king, queen, emperor). Also in the third
      person His Majesty the King, Her Majesty the Queen, Their
      Majesties the King & Queen, whence H. B. M. (His or Her
      Britannic Majesty), H. M. S. (His Majesty's ship).

      Your (His, Her) Royal Highness (to princes, etc.).

      Your Excellency (to ambassadors, governors & their wives).
      Hence “the late H. E. Wu Ting-fang.” It is His Excellency's
      desire, etc.

      Received an order from yourself, or your good self (only in
      commercial letters).

   Familiarty, on the other hand, causes us to use the
   plain, natural “I” and the blunt “you,” and it is good for
   a man to be able to speak and write naturally. In the “familiar 
   style" of essays and in personal letters, we write as if we
   are speaking to intimate friends in our unbuttoned moods,
   and this way of writing has a charm of its own. That is also
   why the humorists usually use the plain I and you (I believe,
   I met, I know, I doubt, I can't understand, you know jolly
   well, you will never understand, not if you die in the attempt, ctc.)

   Then there are various other factors, social or psychological. 
   A modern Chinese young lady sometimes refers
   to her father as “papa” even when speaking to people not

.. _P156:

   her relatives, perhaps out of a desire to appear dainty. In
   all households with children, the terms “mother,” “mammy,"
   “daddy,” “uncle,” “auntie” invariably supplant other ways
   of reference, so that the husband would often refer to his
   wife as “mother” (How is mother? | Where's daddy?). Study
   also the following:--
   ::

      Damn it, kid, I love you! (among sweethearts)
      But, my dear sir, this is not so simple (sarcastic, familiar)。
      Also, in the same sense: my good sir, my dear fellow, my good
      man, my good woman (ef. 老兄啊).
      How is my baby? (to sweethearts and wives)
      Don't let the old man know (referring to father or husband)!
      What does your old man (woman) say? (husband or wife)
      But yours truly will not be there (slang for 1).
      What can a fellow do? (for What can I do?)
      Ask my Mrs. She knows all about it. How is your Mrs.?
      (common familiar term for wife).

   It is quite all right in English to speak of “my wife,“ “my
   husband” as a common term of reference.

   Special mention should be made of the royal we and
   the editorial we. The first is used by kings and queens in 
   proclamations and official statements (“It has our approval,”
   “We feel better today”). The second is used by the newspaper
   editor in his leaders (“We do not think it fit to publish the
   said letters”). In both cases it is based on the idea of
   collective responsibility.

   7.23. Reflexive and Reciprocal Pronouns.---Besides the
   regular pronn., there are the self-pronn. in English:--
   ::

      myself. ...............ourself, ourselves
      thysef .................yourself, yourselves
      itmself ─╮
      herself  ├─ ............hemselves
      itself  ─╯
      oneself, or one's self

.. _P157:

   Ourself (singular) is seldom used except in connexion
   with the “royal we"§7.22). Yourself is the sing, of yourselves.. 
   In general, these self-pronn. have two uses, one to
   show reflexive or reflected action, and the other to show emphasis. 
   Examples of reflexive action are:--
   ::

      He killed himself.                Don't starve yourself.
      Understand yourself.              If you do, you have only yourself to blame.
      Protect yourself.                 Gave herself a holiday.
      Amused oneself with novels.       Give oneself airs.
      Deceive oneself,                  Rest yourself.
      Believed himself to be a genius   System lends itself to abuse.
      Gotthemselves into trouble.       Magazine pays for itself.
      Made oneself a nuisance.          Tomorrow will take care of itself.
      Dragged himself from bed.              

   Examples of the use for emphasis are:---
   ::

      She herself said it.
      You yourself told me.
      You yourself did it. 
      I myself saw it. 
      I saw it myself.
      Ask the lady herself. 
      Tell him yourself.
      Even the king himself didn't know.
      They themselves are to blame.
      We ourselves would do the same on like occasions.

   In the above examples, the self-pronn, are used to reinforce 
   the meaning of the preceding pronn. and are used in
   apposition to them. It is possible to use them alone without
   preceding pronn:--

.. _P158:
   ::

      Ask herself.
      It was myself.
      My wife is the same age as myself.
      What ourselves would do is none of your business.
      Ourselves are to blame.

   But it would not be very nice to say Myself saw it, Himself
   went there. There are also such uses as for themselves,
   (the thing) in itself,(They sat) by themselves, and your own
   self.

   There are two compound pronn. each other and one
   another, which indicate reciprocal action. Examples of their
   use are:--
   ::

      Do you know each other?             Copy sentences for each other.
      Ask each other questions.           Tear each other's hair.
      Change dresses with ane another.    Look into each other's face.
      Tell one another stories.           Each looks into the other's face
      Share one another's money.          They hate each other.
      Share money with one another.       Each hates the other.

   Each other and one another are now used in the same
   way. The distinction between each other for two persons
   and one another for more than two is neither necessary, nor
   useful, nor historically sound.

   Exercise 46. (1) Make some sentences using the self-pronn,
   in the emphatic sense (I myself, you yourself, etc.).

   (2) Make some sentences showing reciprocal action, with vbb.
   like help, fight, cheat, dislike, quarrel, make peace with, trade with,
   salute, suspect, trust, recognize, know, despise, etc. Also the material
   in the above examples may be freely drawn upon.

   7.24. General Person:“One,” “People,” etc.--We often
   say “one may think,” “people may think” with referen ire
   to a vague general person or society in general. This is
   really neither in the first, nor in the second, nor in the third

.. _P159:

   person, because it really includes all three. There are various 
   ways of expressing this abstract general person in English.
   Study this:--
   ::

      People may think you crazy.
      They may think you crazy.
      One may think you crazy.
      To hear you talk like that, one would think you are crazy.
      On looking over the statement carefully, one is termpted to
      think that you are paid to sing praises of the Board.
      One will have to be more careful in speech, if one values one's life.
      You will have to be more careful in speech, if you value your lives.
      We shall have to be more careful in speech, if we value our lives.

   We and you here are really used to denote general person.
   In this sense, you is used only in a very familiar style.
   The use of one requires special attention. Two meanings
   may be distinguished here:--

      | (a) One hates his enemies and another forgives them.
      | (b) One hates one's enemies and loves one's friends.

   In the first example, one is really the short form for one man.
   In the second example, it denotes general person and means
   the same thing as people. In this second sense, it is better to
   use one's, oneself, one in the rest of the sentence instead of
   his, himself, he, him ("One knows one's, not his, own weakness”),
   although in America and with some British writers, the use of
   he, his after one is quite common. There is a third use for
   one, and that is as a “modest” substitute for I:--

   (c) After reading this, one gets a confused feeling about the
   whole affair (= Iget, etc.)

      On inquiring further, one was told, etc.(=I was told, etc.)

.. _P160:

   The mixture of one, I, we, you, people for the same person
   in the same sentence is in any case bad English.

   Exercise 47. (I) Find out in the following whether the one
   used denotes a general person or some particular one person or
   tbing, or is really a substitute for I:--

   1. I saw one on the floor and picked it up.
   2. One came in and was followed by another.
   3. One cannot always spend money on others: he (preferably
      one) must also plan for his (preferably one's) own future.
   4. He spoke so eloquently that one was inclined to believe him.
   5. He asked me for help. Could one refuse in such circumstances?

   (II) Correct the following mixed use of one, I, we, you, people.—-

   6. The use of “one”is rather new to you, so one has to be careful.
   7. If one looks into the minutes of the meeting, you will be
      surprised how much time was wasted in useless discussion.
   8. We would have gone on infinitely, had one had time to do so.
   9. One must be patient, if we want to succeed,
   10. People always criticize the older generation, and when they
       grow old, you do the same.

Confict of Person and Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   7.30. Conflict of Person.---We have seen already in
   §5.40 that sometimes there is a conflict in number. Sometimes 
   there can be also a highly inconvenient confict in person,
   or in both person and number. Thus,(1) shall we say
   “He or I am (is?) to blame,” “Neither I nor you are (am?)

.. _P161:


   allowed to speak”? Here grammarians cannot agree on any
   single rule, and the fact is, there is no rule in usage. One way
   is to follow the force of attraction, i.e., follow the nearest
   pron., thus: “He or I am to blame” but “I or he is to
   blame,” and “Are you or I next?” but “Am I or you next?”
   A better way is to avoid such constructions by saying “He or
   I should be blamed," or “Either he is to blame, or I am to
   blame.” This second way is always possible in writing, and
   is to be recommended.

   (2) When there is a confict of number, and when one
   of the subjects is plural, or when two subjects form a plural
   number, then use the plural vb.
   ::

      Either he or his brothers fail in their duty.
      You and I are out of danger now.
      I and he were on the same train.
      I hear you and he are cousins.

   (3) There is another source of troubie from such constructions 
   as some of us, some of you, etc. Here commonsense
   may be trusted to decide on the right word to use. Study the
   following:--
   ::

      Some of us think they (not we) can fight without my leadership.
      (Not including the speaker.)
      Some of us think we (notthey) can conquer by passive resistance.
      (Including the speaker.)
      Some of you believe they can make more money that way.
      Most of us lost our heads (if including speaker), or Most of
      us lost their heads (if the speaker thinks he is an exception)。

   (4) But our troubles do no end here. We have the
   relative pron. who. Who aiways agrees with its related 
   preceding word (“antecedent”) in person and number, Study
   the following:一

.. _P162:
   ::

      Don't choose me, who am already burdened with too much work.
      It is not you who are in trouble, it is I who am in trouble.
      I am not one who is (not am) afraid of criticism.
      I am not one who cares.
      You are the one who was (not were) elected.

   Exercise 48.(I) Make sentences with the phrases:--
   ::

      1. I who am                5. He who has 
      2. Yoy who are             6. They who have
      3. He who is               7. He who knows
      4. We who are              8. We who know

   (II) Decide which word should be used in the following:-

   I. It is not he who have (has?) cheated you. It is you who
      have (has?) cheated him,
   2. You are the man who break (breaks?) his promise.
   3. Are you he who were (was?) here some time ago?
   4. Either he or you is (are?) wrong.(change in any way you
      like.)
   5. I hear you and he are (is?) good friends.
   6. You who...so strong----you ought to be ashamed of
      yourself beating him who...a mere child.

   7.31. Conflict of Case:“Who” and “Whom.”--Here are
   three types of cases to be discussed: (a) the it-is-I type,
   (b) the use of who and whom, and (c) the use of whoever, whomever.

   (1) In It is I,"“It is he,"the pron. I and he are not the
   objects of is in meaning. Hence the use of the nominative
   case. So also--
   ::

      It was not I.
      Then who (not wham) is it?
      If anybody is to be punished, it should be he (not him)。
      Is this she (not her) whom I am going to marry?

.. _P163:

   (2) Who:whom. The use of the relative pron. who
   or whom has nothing to do with its antecedent, but depends
   entirely on its relation inside the who-clause (marked offin
   parentheses).
   ::

      He deserted me (who gave him his chance in life). [Subj. of gave]
      His mother is the person (whom he loves him best). [She loves him best]
      His mother is the person (whom he loves best). [He loves her best]
      Don't argue with me (who am trying to help you). [Subj. of am]

   We have to use different words when the cases are different, as in the following:—-

      His name is Alfonso, who is their king and whom they are trying to overthrow.

      Hackett was her husband, who often maltreated her, and whom she hated like poison.

   Sometimes this is confused by the introduction of an
   independent clause, like I think, they suppose, but the rule
   remains unchanged. Compare the following:一
   ::

      Then came Mr. Dobson, who (not whom) we knew was a
      grocer. We knew he (not him) was a grocer.

      Then came Mr. Dobson, whom they knew to be a grocer.
      They knew him to be a grocer.

      Hemet the girl whom he recognized to be his childhood friend,
      He recognized her (not she) to be his childhood friend.

      News came from Captain Johnson, who, they had thought, was
      dead. He, they had thought, was dead,

      News came from Captain Johnson, whom they had regarded as
      dead. They had regarded him as dead.

   Notice also the following:一

.. _P164:
   ::

      I don't know (who did it).
      We will decide (who is to go first).

   The whole who-clauses are the objects of know and decid.
   and therefore we do not say whom. Again, the use of whos
   or whom depends on the relation inside the clause.

   (3) Whoever: whomever. Like who and whom, the use
   of whoever or whomever also depends on its relation inside the
   clause entirely.“Whoever” simply means “any person who”
   and “whomever” means “any person whom”

      Whoever says so is a liar or a knave.(Any person who says so, etc.)

      Whoever cones is welcome.(Any one who comes, etc.)

      Whomever they met was asked to contribute a few dollars.(Any
      person whom they met, etc.)

      I will marry whoever comes first my way. (I will marry any one
      who comes, etc.)

      They stopped whomsoever they saw. (They stopped any person
      whom they saw.)

      For whomever he met he had a nod. (For any one whom he met. etc.)

      For whoever met him he had a nod. (For any one who met him. etc.)

   Thus our general conclusion is as follows:--
   ::

      Person and Number           |     |  Case
      ----------------------------+-----+--------------------------
      Agrees with what            |     |  Is determined by what
      goes before:                | WHO |  follows: who knows,
      I who am, you who are, etc. |     |  whom they know, etc.

   Exercise 49. Decide whether who or whom, should.be used in
   the following, and show why:--

.. _P165:

   1. The question regarding who(m) was to blame for the Great
      War is not so simple as the ignorant people imagine.
   2. She kept the secret from him who(m) ought to know everything.
   3. It was not he who(m) she was afraid of, but his lawyer.
   4. It was not he who(m) was afraid of her, but she who(m)
      was afraid of him.
   5. You need not be afraid of him who(m) you know is a per-
      fect gentleman.
   6. She was the girl who(m) I met yesterday.
   7. He is a man who(m) they detest.
   8. To those who(m) have, more shall be given.
   9. He likes those who(m) flatter him and hates those with
      who(m) he does not agree.
   10. He likes those who(m) agree with him.

Thing-Pronouns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   7.40. Thing-Pronouns.--So far we have been dealing with
   personal pronn. There are, however, pronn, for things, as well
   as pronn. for persons. Following are the common pronn. for
   things in English:--
   ::

      all    none    that     these    such
      some   most    this     one      former (前者)
      any    what    those    which    latter (后者)

   For lack of a bette rterm, we may call these “impersonal
   pronouns” or “thing-pronouns.” It should be remembered,
   however, that most of these thing-pronn. can refer to both
   persons and things, and that, on the other hand, the “personal
   pron,” ii does not usually refer to persons. The important
   point is that representation of thing-words is expressed by
   means of these pronn.

.. _P166:

   It can be easily seen that almost all these words are originally 
   adjj: from I like those apples to I like those. Study
   the following:--
   ::

      ADJECTIVES                          PRONOUNS
      Which boy?..........................Which is which?
      Which way?..........................Don't know which.
      Any new student.....................Haven't seen any.
      All things .........................Don't take all.
      Some food...........................Please take some.
      Whatthing?..........................What is it?

   It will be noticed also that, with the exception of this,
   that (pl. these, those) and one (pl. ones), all these words can
   be either in the singular or in the plural.
   ::

      None is, or are, there.
      There is, or are, none left.
      What is the reason? What are the reasons?
      A thing that makes you sick. Things that make you sick.
      All is lost. All are found.
      Some of it is, some of them are, rotten. (Cf. §5.41 “e”)

   7.41. Some, Any, None.--Some is used in questions and
   affirmative statements. Any is used in questions and negative 
   statements.
   ::

      Do you have some? Do you have any？
      I have some, I haven't any. I have none.
      Can some (one) tell me? Canany (one) tell me?
      Some can tell me. None can tell me.

   Exercise 50. Fill the blanks with the proper words (some, any,
   none):一
   ::

      1. There are.........               3. May I have.........?
      2. Are there........?               4. I don't want........
      5. Give him.........                   have seen.........
      6. Don't give hin.........          8. No, I haven't seen........
      7. You haven't seen all, but you    9. Haven't you seen.........?

.. _P167:

   7.42. What.--What (=that which) is a very useful word
   expressing the idea represented by the Chinese so (所). What
   he knows is this =他所知道是这样. See if you can use the
   following phrases in sentences:---
   ::

      what one knows                what is useful, useless
      what one can see              what is true, false
      what I am afraid of           what he said
      what you do in a day          what you heard
      what the government wants     what they saw
      what you pay for              what frightens him
      what makes me hate him        what woman wants
      what everybody knows          what to say, think, do

   As what means that which and already contains the antecedent 
   in itself, we cannot say all what, but should say
   all that. But what is chiefly colloquial: in literary use, 
   generally but that is used.

      That is all he knows, or That is all that he knows (not all
      what he knows).

      All one can do is to wait, or All that one can do (not all
      what one can do) is to wait.

      Who knows but that (but what) he may have purposely told
      you a lie?

      Who can tell but that (but what) he may be the most important 
      man in the country three months hence?

   7.43. One, Thing, Affair, Something, etc.--The use of
   one representing persons has already been discussed in the
   above (§7.24). Thing and affair are not usually considered as

.. _P168:

   pronn, but the fact remains that these words are most commonly 
   used in English to represent almost any kind of things.
   Study the following:--
   ::

      Such a nice one (referring to a dress, hat, Christmas tree, apple, etc.).
      Give him a good one (punch him hard, pitch a baseball)。
      That's a good one (a good joke, retort, etc.).
      A short life and a merry one.
      Select the best ones. Throw away the bad ones.
      He started the next revolution, if it may be called one.
      Stay at any one of the dozen families you know in town.
      The ones (photographs) you saw.
      Open the drawer on the left, the one with a key in it.
      He writes many poems, but publishes only the ones he likes.
      The top one. The lower one. Little ones. A new one. Two old ones. Such a one.

      (For persons) The lucky ones. The young ones. One so fair and
      beautiful. Like one weary of life. Like one in a dream. Like
      one risen from the grave. Offending one so powerful. Marry
      one worthy of you. One who talks. One who dares.

      I don't know a thing about it.
      I doo't understand the whole thing.
      The thing, or affair (perhaps a performance, a party, a dinner,
      a match, or a wedding), was a complete failure.
      That's the thing (the thing we want, the right thing to give or to do, etc.).
      Things (or Affairs) are better now (general conditions are better).
      Take off your things (outdoor clothes, hat, etc.).
      The great thing is to make a right start.
      Blue socks are now the thing (the fashion).
      (Referring to persons) That thing Jones. She, poor thing, never
      heard of it. A dear, old thing (man, woman or animal),
      What is the latest thing (news)?

.. _P169:
   ::

      His death is a good thing.
      I haven't a thing to say.
      Something new.                             Anything you say.
      Something useful.                          Anything you ask.
      Something easy.                            Anything I do.
      Nothing strange.                           Something to do.
      Nothing new.                               Something to live for.
      Nothing difficult.                         Something to read.
      Anything sweet.                            Something to think about.
      Anything above five feet.                  Nothing to see.
      Anything you want.                         Anything to eat.

   Exercise 51. Make sentences with the words and phrases one,
   the one, like one, a thing, the thing, things, something, nothing, 
   anything, etc., using the above examples as models.

   7.44. That.-Like the words thing and affair, the word
   that is often used to represent a fact, a statement, a general
   situation, or something we have vaguely in mind.

      That is the trouble. (Something we have just mentioned is the trouble.)
      When was that? (When did the thing happen?)
      That was long ago. (An old event or situation.)
      Oh, is that what you mean? (Is what you haye just said your real meaning?)
      Who was that? (Who was the person at the door?)
      So that is that. (A common formula for closing one point of a discussion.）
      Now, that's a good boy. (Form of coaxing children =乖乖的)
      I know all that. All that is a waste of your time. All that is mere propaganda.

   Of special interest is the use illustrated below:--

      You had better break his friendship, and that (=break it) at once.

      We have topay him_a monthly bribe, and that (=pay the bribe)
      always promptly and in full.

.. _P170:

   Much more common and important is the following use:--

      The climate here is like that (=the climate) of France (not like France).

      He has a head like that(=the head) of an ox, and eyes like
      those of a field mouse.

      Her wedding took place at the same time with shat(=the wed-
      ding) of her sister.

   Exercise 52. Correct or improve the following sentences:--

      1. His voice sounds like his brother.
      2. Her name resembles her aunt.
      3. This has a smell like banana.
      4. Her handwriting is neat and small, while Po-liang isbig and slovenly.
      5. We usually value our own money, and think little of other people's money.
      6. We usually like our own composition and fail to appreciate others.

   7.45. It.--The word it also often stands for a vague
   something. What it stands for is vague enough, when used
   as the subject of impersonal vbb, but still vaguer, when used
   as an object.
   ::

Metaphors
~~~~~~~~~

   7.50. Metaphors and Figurative Expressions. Every language 
   has its metaphors or figurative expressions and English
   is no exception. Metaphors have one great value in a language
   in maintaining the balance of concrete imagery in it and
   preventing it from becoming a mere abstract, logical dialect
   of the scientists and professors. They preserve for it always
   the smell of the soil, as it were. The English language is
   considered a virile language just because it is full of metaphors
   and metaphorical uses of words. In spite of the great increase
   of scientific vocabulary, real modern English remains racy and
   fresh because of the many figurative uses of its simple and
   homely words.

   Metaphors, therefore, greatly increase the expressiveness
   ofone's language. Sometimes, metaphors are used for elegant 
   variation, but usually, metaphors are used on their own

.. _P174:

   merits-the merits of expressiveness. To call a wicked woman
   a she-devil is direct. If a man is talking nonsense, it is easien
   to shut him up by calling it perfect rot than describing it as
   nonsensical talk. When a rich bourgeois merchant died with
   lots of money, it may be more appropriate to say that he
   cut up fat. The concrete imagery of a fat pigbeing cut up
   for the enjoyment of his relatives suggests many things which
   abstract terminology cannot. To tell the soldiers that they
   are cannon--fodder may have more persuasive force than volumes 
   of prize essays on international peace. (Cf. the imagery in
   Chinese 俎上鱼肉, 釜底游魂, 瓮中鳖.) Further examples are:一

      A misplaced eyebrow: contemptuously of a small moustache.
      A salamander: one who loves to sit by the fire.
      A chatterbox: a woman given to chattering.
      A dumb bell: (Amer. slang) one who does not understand, a fool.
      Take a moral holiday: have a spree or indulge in temporary immorality.
      Take rosy-coloured views: be optimistic.
      The seamy side of life: the unseen and less beautiful side.
      Make sheep's eyes at a lady: cast amorous glances.
      An eyesore: person or thing one hates to see, e. g., dirty hut
      near a mansion, a poor relative, etc.
      An eyewash: (slang) humbug, something made to deceive.
      A bed of roses: easy and luxurious life.
      A crumpled rose-leaf: small irritation in a happy life.
      Eat one's cake and still have it: it is impossible to enjoy two
      things at the same time.
      Kill the goose that lays the golden eggs: for immediate benefit at
      the cost of the future.
      Have one's tail between one's legs: show great fear or submission.
      Hold the purse-strings: control money.

.. _P175:

   Such expressions could be multiplied without end.
   It will be interesting to see how the simplest words in
   English, usually concrete in meaning, develop the greatest
   variety of metaphors. Following are some examples taken
   from the Concise Oxford Dictianary:--
   ::

      Cat.—

         That old cat =悍妇，泼妇，老狐狸精。
         A cat may look at a king =一视何伤？
         Living a cat-and-dog life =夫妻反目，日夜吵架，鸡犬不宁。
         Let the cat out of the bag =漏泄秘密，走漏风声.
         See which way the cat jumps =取观望态度，看风头。
         Cult of the jumping cat =骑墙主义.
         Rains cats and dogs =大雨倾盆。
         Not room to swing a cat =无立锥之地。

      Dog.—

         Go to the dogs ＝鸡零狗碎，零落，破灭不可收拾。
         Throw to the dogs ＝唾弃,牺牲。
         Every dog has his day ＝瓦片也有翻身时。
         Haven't a dog's chance ＝极少希望.
         Lead a dog's life ＝过穷苦生活，苛延残喘。
         Give a dog a bad name and hang him ＝欲加之罪，何患无词?
         You lucky dog ＝好造化!好狗命!
         Love me, love my dog ＝打狗看主面，爱壓及乌.
         Let sleeping dogs lie ＝一动不如一静，勿无事生非。
         Dog in the manger ＝狗占马槽(于自己无用者,且不肯让人)。

      Dust.—

         Throw dust in one's eyes ＝欲图蒙蔽。
         Shake off the dust of one's feet ＝拂袖而去(不怿).
         Bite the dust ＝战败倒毙.
         In the dust ＝归土，入黄泉.
         Humbled to the dust  ＝大受挫辱,辱在泥涂。
         Raise a dust ＝扬尘;引申为“引起纠纷.”
         Dust and heat ＝风尘劳顿,汗马之劳.

.. _P176:
   ::

      Finger.—

         Done by the finger of God ＝由于天意,由于神力.
         Lay one's finger on ＝指出(病原等);随意拾得、
         Look through one's fingers,at  ＝佯为不见.
         Won't stir a finger  ＝不拔…-毛.
         Turn or, twist a person round one's finger or little finger ＝任意
         播弄,玩之股掌之上.
         My fingers itch to ＝手痒,技痒,渴想.
         His fingers are all thumbs ＝用手笨拙.
         With a wet finger  ＝容易，不费吹灰之力、易如反掌.
         Burnone's finger ＝自做蘖，好管闲事，招惹是非.
         Have a finger in the pie ＝与闻，染指.
         Let slip through one's fingers ＝不觉放弃，轻轻放过.
         Have a subject at one's finger-tips ＝娴熟，拿手好戏.
         To the finger-mails ＝浑身，自顶至題，一身(都是胆).

   To write a good, idiomatic English style, one should
   pay attention to such uses of the simple words. Chinese
   students of English are usually at home in the use of long
   words of. Latin, origin; a college dean, for instance, says of
   his new curriculum that “it epitomizes the processes of 
   modernization of China.” He might have said that “it shows the
   modern changing China in a miniature,” or “it sums up in a
   nutshell, as, it were, the various phases ofchanging. China.”
   Few Chinese students are truly at home in the idiomatic use
   of simple English words. The secret of a good English style
   lies in mixing up the homely words with more high-brow ones,

.. _P177:

   as Edward Sapir* has done when he speaks of “grammatical pattern”
   (for type of structure) and “the drift of language”
   (for tendency of language). Instead of saying, “Mr. MacDonald
   began to deal with the problem directly,” it would be an actual
   improvement in expressiveness to say that “he came to close
   grips with the problem.” Instead of saying, “Mr. Lloyd George's
   efforts, at pleasing some Conservatives,” one might speak of
   “Mr. Lloyd George's flirtations with them” (cf..Chinese 吊膀
   子). And instead of saying ,“He tries to locate the economic
   distress,” one could say, “Hetries to find out where the shoe
   pinches,” and it would be better English.

Indirect Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   7.60. Direct and Indirect Statements.--Very often ive
   want to quote or restate what another says. We have a direct
   quotation, with a capital and quotation marks in the following:--

      Mr. Barker said to his son, “I am going away from the city for
      a few days, and you should come home to see your mother
      everyday.”

   This can be made into an indirect statement as follows:--

      Mr. Barker said to his son that he was going away from the
      city for a few days and that he, the son, should come home
      everyday to see his mother.

   This is also a case of representation and the indirect statement 
   may also be called a “represented statement.”

   In direct quotations, we must use the exact words and

   [*] Author of Language (Harcourt, Brace, N. Y.)-

.. _P178:

   consider the quotation marks as sacred. If words are omitted, 
   we should indicate the omission by a dotted line.

   In indirect statements, we donot bind ourselves to use
   the exact words, and naturally change the person of pronn.
   and the tense of vbb. according to the actual meaning.

   Indirect questions have already been discussed in §3.64.
   In indirect questions, we do not use the “inverted order" of
   vb. and subject:一
   ::

      Peterson asked: “Are you coming?” (Direct)
      Peterson asked if he was coming. (Indirect)

   While indirect statements are introduced by that, indirec!
   questions are introduced by if, whether, how, when, what, etc.
   so that we get the following phrases:--
   ::

      ask if ask why
      ask whether ask when
      ask how ask where
      ask what ask for what reason
      ask who ask by what means, etc.

   Look up §3.64. again for review.

   In indirect commands and requests, the vbb. are usually
   expressed with the helping words should, would, are to, were
   to, etc. When the vb. alone is used, the infinitive form is
   used both for the past and present tenses. For example:--
   ::

      It is our wish that he leave the city now.
      It was our wish that he leave the city at once.

   We may say:
   ::

      It was our wish that he should leave the city at once,

   which means the same thing as leave. But to say:

.. _P179:

      It was our wish that he left at once

   would imply that he actually left (indicative of fact) in accordance 
   with our wish (cf. §3.74).

   Exercise 54. Change the following direct statements, questions
   and requests or commands into good and clear indirect statements,
   etc., and notice the changes in pronn. and vbb. that you will have to
   make. Had to may be used for the past tense of must.

   1. Peterson explained to his mother: “I must go now, for I
      have to meet a friend.”
   2. His mother asked: “Why do you have to go in such a hurry?
      Is your friend more important than your mother? Can you
      not wait a while, till your sister returns?"
   3. Peterson said: “There is no time to wait. Besides, my sister
      may not come home today at all."
   4. His mother replied: “If that is the case, go now. You must
      always have your own way. But come back early.”

   7.61. Tense of Dependent Clauses.---In the sentence--
   Mr. Barker said that he was going away for a few days.
   Mr. Barker said is called the “main clause,” and the clause
   introduced by that is called the “dependent clause,” because
   it depends on the main clause in meaning. As a rule, if the
   main clause is in past tense, the dependent clause should be in
   pasttense also. Thus--

      Mr. Barker said that he could come.

   Here the speaker is simply repeating the words of Mr. Barker,
   and assumes no responsibility as to whether he will actually
   come or not. There are times when we can say:

      Mr. Barker said that he can come.

   This would more or less imply that the pressent speaker believes

.. _P180:

   in him, and is willing to state it as a pressent fact that he
   can come. So also--

      | Mr. Barker said that the earth was round.
      | Mr. Barker said that the earth is round.

   In the first sentence, the present speaker is simply repeating
   Mr. Barker's words; whether the earth is round or not
   is none of the present speaker's business. (Mr. Barker might
   have said it to his washerwoman, and we can imaging the
   washerwoman now quoting it with great respect for Mr. Barker's 
   opinions.) In the second sentence, the speaker is more
   or less willing to state it as a fact.

   Exercise 55. Study the use of verbaltense in the following
   dependent clauses and find out the reason for its use:--

   1. He just told me that he can come tonight.
   2. He told me that you are bankrupt.
   3. He said that he had been in Singapore for three years before he came here.
   4. You go and tell him that I am a Singapore merchant
      myself and had never heard of his name when I was there.
   5. Mr. Russell said in his lecture that prohibition has succeeded 
      in making drinking very popular in America today.
   6. Mr. Wu declared that he, too, was a revolutionist.
   7. They asked him if he was a communist, and he said “No."
   8. Mr. Wudenied that we have failed in the revolution; he
      said that our present government was better than the
      Manchu Government.
   9. It was requested that the murderer be handed over to
      the Chinese authorities.
   10. He was allowed to stay at home with the condition that
       he report at the police headquarters every morning.

.. _P181:

Representation by Omission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   7.70. Representation by Omission.--Grammar should
   teach one how to omit, as well as how to express, things. As
   Jespersen has wisely remarked,“Only bores want to express
   everything, but even bores find it impossible to express every-thing." 
   Jespersen mentions as example the case of a man purchasing 
   a railway ticket at the station and saying “Two third
   Brighton return,"' which real'y represents,“Would you please
   sell me two third-class tickets from London to Brighton and
   back again, and I will pay you the usual fare for such tickets.
   Economy of speech is usually the motive for representation,
   whether by use of pronn., of by other means. To say: “five
   feet four” (four inches) and “three seventy-five” (three dollars
   seventy-five cents) implies as much a form of representation
   as to say “The book is mine or his” (my book, his book)，
   or “buy it at the grocer's" (grocer's shop), or “She went to
   her uncle's’ (uncle's home). Following are some idiomatic
   omissions:--
   ::

      Got up at six (o'clock) thirty.
      In the year nineteen (hundred) thirty-seven.
      He stands five feet six (inches).
      It measures four (feet wide) by five (feet long).
      The price is seven (dollars and) fifty-five (cents).
      But what (am I) to do (or: say)?
      I have heard (people) say that...
      Live and let (others) live.
      Help (to) make it a success.
      I help him (to get) over the stile, down the bridge, up the wall,
      out of a difficulty.
      Her stepmother made her (toi sweep, scrub and clean.
      I feel(I) like going out today.
      He dare not (to) appear.

.. _P182:

   (1) The avoiding of repetition is one of the common
   causes for omission or suppression of words. Thus--
   ::

      The upper (shelf) and the lower shelf.
      His old (associates) and new associates.
      Good-bye to the old year and weicome to the new (year)!
      Cut off the first and last parts of the play, and leave the middle
      (part of the play).
      I told you to come at nine o'clock, and you come at eleven (o'clock).
      He can (do it) and will do it.
      I can do it, but dare not (do so).
      He could not do it, and would not (do it) if he could (do it).
      He has inherited and (has) spent his fortune.
      A new government had been established and (had been) over-thrown 
      in the course of the three days.
      He was jeered, (was) hooted, (was) made fun of, and (was)
      dragged off from the stage.
      I know you and (I know) him.
      He brought his wife and (he brought his) children.
      He lost his wife, (his) three children and (his) property.
      His wife is taller than he (is tall).
      You love her more than (you love) me.

   In strictly correct English, one should not let one helping 
   vb. represent by omission another which is not exactly
   the same. We can say “He had fought and (had) been defeated," 
   but we should not say “He was defeated and they
   (were) victorious." Because were is different from was, it should
   be expressed and not omitted.

   Exercise 56.(I) Repetition is not grammatically wrong, and

.. _P183:

   is sometimes very expressive, but see if you can avoid the repetition
   of words, when you want to.

   1. He gave him five dollars and gave me only three dollars.
   2. This is seven o'clock, and you said it was eight o'clock.
   3. We have searched the house and have found nothing.
   4. He has come and has gone already.
   5. The man was immediately taken to the hospital and was treated by a doctor.
   6. You have learnt nothing and have forgotten nothing.
   7. In three months' time, he has bought a house, has insured it
      for $35,000, has burnt it down, and has got the money for it.
   8. He has successively married seven women, has divorced six
      of them and has made a present of the seventh one to General Chang.

   (II) Correct the following by changing the tense of vbb. or
   fling in words where omissions are unjustified:一

   1. I came here to see the city and met a few friends.
   2. I intended to go to Tsingtau and spent the summer there.
   3. After the storm was over, we found that our house alone
      was intact, while all the others destroyed.
   4. Many men have built the house and one man torn it down.

   (2) For psychological reasons, we often omit the beginning 
   or the last part of a sentence, when we consider
   the part expressed as sufficiently clear. This is true especially
   in answers to questions. In this sense “Yes” and “No"
   may stand for almost anything expressed in the question.
   Also—-
   ::

      How many do you want? (Ans.) Four.
      Would you have it (the egg) fried or scrumbled? (Ans.) Fried.
      Would you have it boiled hard or soft? (Ans.) Soft, or medium.
      Is this quarter past three? (Ans.) No, ten past.
      Would you have tea or coffee? (Ans.) Coffee.
      Shall I bring you a pen or a pencil? (Ans.) Both.
      Do you like it? (Ans.) Rather！

.. _P184:

   In very common expressions, we often omit the first one
   or two syllabes, out of simple laziness.
   ::

      (Good) Morning!                     (I am) Present!！
      (Will) That do?                     (He or She is) Absent!
      (You) See what I mean?              (I am) Sorry.
      (I am) Here!                        Fraid not. (=I am afraid not)
      (I) Thank you!                      (That's) A good idea!
      (I) Beg your pardon.                (Do it) Gently, please。
      (I hope to) See you tomorrow.       (It's) Well done.
      (Do you) Remember that letter?      (Let's) Have done!
      (Think of) What people will say!    (Keep your) Hands up (or: off)!
      (That's) Imposible!                 (Be) Quick！

   On the other hand, we may have what Jespersen calls
   “pull-up sentences," where the last part is left omitted as
   being unnecessary for the understanding of the complete meaning. 
   The to with the vb. omitted is quite common in such endings.
   ::

      He never came, although I told him to (come).
      He did not take off the cover, although I had told him to (do so).
      Come with me, if you care to (come).
      Would you come?---I should love to (come).
      We have asked him to pay at the end of this month, and he
      Says he is willing to (do so).

   Other kinds of quite common pull-up sentences are:--
   ::

      I told him he was wrong, and he admitted quite as much (as what I said).
      But Shaw is quite as great an author (as any we have been discussing).

   He is not nearly so great (as the other one):

.. _P185:
   ::

      Chen-teh comes from the same place (where I come from).
      I don't like to offend one so powerful (as he).

   Truer types of pull-up sentences are, for example:--
   ::

      Well, I never (heard of such a thing)!
      Well, go to (the thing you want to do, and I will not object)!
      If I only knew about this an hour ago!

   It would be bad grammar not to recognize these as complete 
   sentences simply because some of their parts are understood. 
   Such grammar could be a hindrance, instead of a help,
   to the power of expression.

Ch VIII Determination
---------------------

Representation, Determination and Modification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   8.10. Representation, Determination and Modification.--
   When we say this book, that book, my book, the book that you
   took away, we are using various ways to indicate or “determine”
   the particular book we mean, and this we call the problem
   of determination in grammar. Grammatical means of determination 
   always answer the question “Which one?” Further cxamples are:--
   ::

      the same book              either this or that book
      the other book             each book
      some other book            the respective books
      every other book           any old book
      the second book            whatever book

   It will be seen that there is a close ielation between
   determination and representation. The pronn. he, you, they,
   myself, themselves are all representative words, and yet they
   all help to “determine” which person wc inean.“His book”
   also helps to answer the question, “Which book?"
   There is also a closc relation between determination
   and modifcation. We say, for instance, that in the red
   book, the adj. red modifies the n. book. It describes what
   kind of a book it is. But the word red serves also to limit
   the meaning of book by excluding the green ones, the blue
   ones, etc. It, therefore, also helps to “determine”the book
   meant. Generally, the modified nn. have a narrower or

.. _P187:

   more restricted meaning than unmodified nn. “Northern
   Chinese” are only one part of the Chinese people, and
   “humorous essays” exciude essays that are not humorous.
   Moreover, determination is only one form of modification:
   this, a determinative word in this book, modifies the word
   book. It is only because the determinative words and
   phrases are both common and important that we study them
   as a class by themselves.

   Thus we may distinguish three functions:--

   (1) Representation: to take the place of other words (Chap. VII).
   (2) Determination: to answer the question “Which one?" (Chap. VIII).
   (3) Modification: to modify or describe the meaning of other words (Chap. IX).

   They are three classes of notions that we have to study, but
   one and the same word may serve two or three different
   functions at the same time.

   8.11. Classes of Pronouns.--In the old grammars, pronn.
   are classified in the following way:--

   (1) Personal: I, you, it (also possessive forms my, mine, your, yours, etc).
   (2) Demonstrative: this, that, which (pointing out which one).
   (3) Relative: "the man who escaped,""the girl that he loves," etc. (relating to a preceding word).
   (4) Interrogative:who? which? what?(used for asking questiens).

   It will be seen that the possessive pronn. my, your and the
   demonstrative pronn. this, that chiefly serve the purpose of

.. _P188:

   determination. The relative pronn. serve as often to determine 
   which one as for other purposes of modification, thus:--

      | I know the man who escaped from prison.(Determining which person.)
      | I know this man, who is a dirty rascal.(Describing the person.)

   For convenience' sake, the relative clauses will be studied
   in the next chapter on Modification.

   The above division is useful and convenient as a classification 
   of pronn. Regarded from the point of view of notions, however, 
   these pronn. should be studied together
   with other classes of words serving the same purpose. Thus,
   both demonstrative adjj. and demonstrative pronn. serve the
   purpose of determination, and their distinction is really unimportant:一
   ::

      ADJECTIVES                       PRONOUNS
      This book.                       I know this.
      Take another one.                Take another.
      Both men came.                   Both came.

   The relative pronn. and the relative advv. should also be
   studied together as serving the same purpose of determination
   or modification:--
   ::

      RELATIVE PRON.                   RELATIVE ADV.
      Find out the man who said this.  Find out the time when he arrived.

Distinction and Apposition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   8.20. Distinctior: “This,” “That,”“Same,” “Other.”--
   Like this and that, the words same and other may be used
   as adjj.(the same people, other people) or as pronn. (is the

.. _P189:

   same, for others). The expressions the same as and the same
   that are generally used as in the following examples:--
   ::

      This is the same one that you saw yesterday.
      This is the same one as that (one).
      Ieat the same food that you eat.
      My food is the same as yours.
      You are the same age as my sister.
      Wealth or poverty is all the same (or just the same) to me. (As adj.)
      But I thank you all the same (or just the same). (As adv.)

   It is always best to use that when a clause follows (i.e.,
   with a vb. expressed), and use as when a simplen. or pron.
   follows (i.e., when there is novb. following, or when the vb.
   is understood).

   When there is a vb. with the idea of sharing, we may
   use with, as--
   ::

      I live in the same room with him.(=I share a room with him).
      The use of another, the other and others follows the usage
      regarding the use or omission of a and the.

      A boy.         Another boy.   (Indefinite sing.)
      Boys.          Others.        (Indefinite pl.).
      The boy(s).    The other(s).  (Definite sing, or pl.)

   Another is simply a compound word formed by an and other.
   We may say, also, some other boy or boys, any other boy(s)
   and no other boy(s) as we say some boyls), any boy(s) and no
   boy(s). No other is followed by than, but different, differ are 
   followed by from, e.g.--

      | This is no other than the one we saw yesterday.
      | It can be no other person than Mr. Ma himself.
      | This is different from the one we saw.

.. _P190:

   Exercise 57. Study the following and find out why the words
   another, the other, others, the others and the words as, that, with,
   than are used. Then make some sentences with the same as, the
   same that, another, some other, any other, others, no other than, etc.

   1. Is your book lost? Buy another.
   2. There were two brothers. One was a cripple, and the other was deaf and dumb.
   3. I am not speaking of Miss Yang; I am speaking of the other girl, her room-mate.
   4. Only I was present. All the others were sick at home.
   5. Another day, he came in at breakfast time.
   6. Other people have other things to do.
   7. He saw one (cinema) show after another.
   8. Others may do what they like and say what they like, but I will not be influenced by them.
   9. We must find some other way.
   10. Is there any other person you want to see?
   11. This is not the same book as mine.
   12. It is the same that I borrowed from you.
   13. He is the same person that called yesterday.
   14. He can givc no other reason than mere laziness for not handing in his composition.
   15. If you insist on sending the letter, it will have to be signed by some other person than myself.

   8.30. Possessive Pronouns and Nouns.--We have studied
   in §7.20-7.21 the possessive pronn. my, your, and mine,
   yours, etc. Nouns in the possessive case add an “apostrophe
   s”('s) in the singular, as bird's, person's. These are all true
   determinative words, and are easy to use. The only peculian
   forms of the possessives in 's are exemplified by the following:
   ::

         (a) Plural nouns:             three days' journey
             birds’ nest(s)            persons' faults

.. _P191:
   ::

          others’ ideas                (But, for brevity's sake,
          friends’ help                for argument's sake)
          parents’ consent         (d) Compound nouns:
          women's troubles             the Duke of York's brother
      (b) Singulars ins:               the Queen of Sheba's beauty
          James's horse                   Schwab & Son's
          Jones's children             Governor of New York's
          Charles's letter                statement
          Pythagoras's teaching        Emperor of Japan's cousin
          Ulysses’ Return              Government of India's position
          Moses’ journey
          Jesus' words             (e) Nouns in apposition:
      (c) For ~'s sake:                Philip the Great's son
          for goodness' sake           Henry the Tailor's bills
          for peace' sake              My brother Yujen's book
          for convenience' sake        William the Second's death
          for conscience’ sake

   In (b) we read [siz] for s's. Where the word already ends
   in s-s sound (Ulysses, Moses, Jesus), it is best to omit the
   additionals just as in things', birds' (not things's, birds's).
   The examples in (c), for...sake, may be considered special
   cases; the apostrophes is omitted because s's before sake
   would not sound nice. The examples in (d) are compound
   names, and those in (e) contain two nn. which refer to the
   same person (“in apposition"). Of course we do not say
   my brother's Yujen's wife.

   The expressions of yours, of mine, of my father's have
   already been mentioned in §7.21. They are quite peculiar
   and idiomatic English constructions. Examples of their use
   are:--
   ::

      He was a very dear friend of her uncle's.
      It was a great idea of his that China could be saved through rural education.
      It was a fond hobby of my father's to collect curios.
      It is a fond dream of mine to visit Spain.
      Those fingernails of yours are a disgrace.
      Look at that nice son of yours.
      Take home these paintings of his and tell me what you think of them.

.. _P192:

   Notice that in all these examples, either something familiar or
   something we are fond of is expressed. That nice son of yours
   (familiar use) implics also some contempt: compare Chinese
   你那个好儿子. There is always some tinge of emotion (hatred,
   love, familiarity) associated with this form of possessives.
   There is no point in saying, for instance, the monthly income
   of his for his monthly income. In fact, we may call this the
   “familiar possessive.”

   Notice also we cannot say that your, this my for 你那个,
   我这个 in English; we have to say that...of yours, this...of
   mine.

   8.40. Apposition and Example.--Following are examples of 
   the use of apposition for the purpose of determination:--

      Your brother was killed. Which brother? Teh-ming. Your
      brother Teh-ming was killed.

      Teh-ming was killed. Which Teh--ming? Teh-ming, your brother, was killed.

      Mary, the mother of Jesus, was not Mary Magdalen.

      Edith Wharton, the woman novelist, is an American.

      Mr. Jones, the President of the National Bank, committed
      suicide last night.

      Captain Byrd, the explorer of the Antarctic, returned to 
      civilization after a two years’ absence.

      My servant Ko-fu is now ill.

      There are many kinds of infectious diseases, cholera, typhoid
      and diphtheria, now in this city.

      I have met many famous men of their country, writers, generals,
      militarists and Socialist leaders.

.. _P193:

   In all these examples, the phrase in italics modifies or makes
   clear the meaning of the preceding n. or pron. The construction 
   is therefore very simple. Words used in apposition must
   be in the same case as the words they modify, thus--

      | Then we three, Kuo-fang, Min-cheng and I, started together.
      | They tried to catch us, Kuo-fang, Min-cheng and me (myself).

   In the last two examples in the first part of this section
   (There are many kinds of diseases, etc.), the words in apposition 
   arc really exampies or instances (cholera, typhoid, diphtheria) 
   of the word they modify (diseases). Such examples are
   usually introduced by the phrases:--
   ::

      such as                       as follows
      for example (“e.g.”)          that is (“i.e.”)
      for instance                  namely (“viz.”;

   As follows is always used to mean as what follows. We
   never say as follow, even when many things follow.

   Exercise 58. (I) Words in apposition are used for general
   purposes of modification as well as for determination. Point out the
   appositive words in the following and tell whether they are used
   only for determination or for other purposes of modification.

   1. The Chinese Emperor, a mere boy of seven years old, had to abdicate the throne.
   2. He, a father of grown-up daughters, was still running round with all sorts of women.
   3. Edison, the famous inventor, is a friend of Henry Ford, the automobile king.

.. _P194:

   4. Herbert Hoover, the President of the United States, was an
      official mining engineer of the Manchu Government in his early days.
   5. Your cousin Mary is engaged to be married.
   6. Tom, the piper's son, stole a pig.

   (II) Fill in appositive words in the following:--

   1. Mr. Chang, the--- of the paper, was arrested.
   2. I like all kinds of fruit,----,----,---- and ----;

Sequence, Alternation and Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   8.50. Sequence:the Ordinals.--The numbers 1,2,3,4, etc.
   are called “cardinals,” while the numbers of sequence 1st,
   2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. are called “ordinals” in grammar. From
   the fourth on, the following numbers always take a th, except
   numbers with “one,” “two,” “three” which still keep the
   first, second and third. Eighth has only one t, ninth is spelt
   with the e in nine omitted, and twelve bocomes twelfth.
   Thus—
   ::

      fifth                 twelfth             fiftieth
      eightt                thirteenth          forty-first
      ninth                 hundredth           eighty-second
      tenth                 thousandth          seventy-third
      eleventh              fortieth            hundred and first

   Notice also that we say--
   ::

      Number one, but: the first one.
      Number two, but: the second one.
      Book one,   but: the first book.
      Volume two, but: the second volume.

.. _P195:

   It is more common to use “No.” with the bigger numbers,
   thus “prisoner No. 1075, seat No. C75,” etc.

   These ordinals form adv. by having -ly added to them,
   thus firstly, secondly, thirdly, lastly, etc. But first and last can
   otherwise be used as advv. also, as He came first, I came
   last, Last came the cripple.

   Some special uses of these sequence words are shown in
   the following examples:--
   ::

      He came on the 12th (of this month).
      Go from the ground floor [楼下] to the first ftoor [二楼], then
      to the second floor [三楼], third floor [四楼], etc.

      The student gets promoted from the first form (or first year)
      [一年级] to the second form (or second year) [二年级], etc. In
      someplaces, first is the highest, and sixth is the lowest, but
      this is not usual.

      Take the next to the last seat.[倒数第二位)
      Pronounce the last word but (=except) one.
      Read from the last line but two.[倒数第三行】

      Next to Ke-min, Wang Lo is the best student in class. Wang
      Lo is the next best (or second best).

      Hand in your compositions next Wednesday(= nearest coming
      Wednesday= Wednesday of this week if said on Monday,
      Tuesday; but Wednesday of the next week if said on Thursday, etc.).

      I met him last Tuesday (or on Tuesday last).

   Exercise 59. Make some sentences with some of the above phrases.

   8.60. Alternation and Distribution.--There are times
   whep we want to refer to some particular numbers in a

.. _P196:

   group or series, with a half definite and half indefinite meaning. 
   The use of such expressions is best illustrated by examples.

   Either...Or, Beither...nor, every other, every third, every
   ninth, etc.
   ::

      Either he or she is to blame.
      Either of the two (any one) wili do.
      You either do what I say or leave this place
      What you do is neither. wise nor honourable.
      Either come in or go out.
      He is neither able, nor experienced, nor willing to work hard and learn.
      They have now divorced each other, either through his or through her fault.
      I am not going to retract my words. Nor am I going to apologize. Neither is he.
      You have lost your job? I have nothing to do myself, either.
      I cannot help you, either. (=Nor can I help you.)
      Take either end (either this or that).
      The river overflowed on either side (=on both sides).
      If you do not go, I shall not either (=also).
      There is no time to lose, either (=besides).
      He came here every other day (once in every two days-on alternate days).
      The doctor visits her every third day (or every three days).
      Every eighty-second year, the comet comes back to us.

   Each, respective(ly). These may be called distributive
   words, for the meaning refers to each one or each group
   separately.
   ::
 
      They had one box each.
      Each of them was given a box.
      They had each abed to himself.
      They had each his own bed.
      We went each our own way.

.. _P197:

   We had each a new suit of uniform (or: new pair of shoes).
   Go to your respective seats. (=Go each to your own seat.)
   They were rewarded according to their respective merits (=each
   according to his merit).

   A and B contributed the respective sums of thirty and fifty
   dollars.

   The colleges for men and women are to be built respectively
   on the south and southeast sides of the c. mpound.

   (For the use of each other and one another, see §7.23.),
   Exercise 60. Use the above phrases in sentences of your own.

Definite and Indefinite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   8.70. “A,” “An” and “The.”--A boy means an indefinite boy, 
   and the boy means a definite boy. This is really
   the same as Chinese i-ko (一个) and cheh-ko (这个). Hence,
   a is called “the indefinite article” and the is called the 
   “definite article.” A expresses indefinite singular (a boy), while
   indefinite plural is expressed without any article (boys). Thus
   we have--

   +------------+-----------+-----------+
   |            | Singular  | Plural    |
   +------------+-----------+-----------+
   | Indefinite | a boy     | boys      |
   +------------+-----------+-----------+
   | Definite   | the boy   | the boys  |
   +------------+-----------+-----------+

   All this is very simple and just like the Chinese i-ko
   jen, cheh-ko jen, jen (一个人, 这个人, 人). The only difference 
   is Chinese nn, have no pluralending, so that the indefinite 

.. _P198:

   plural is expressed in Chinesc, for example, by jen ta
   hu, hu ch'th jen (人打虎, 虎喫人, like singular in form), but
   in English by Men kill tigers and Tigers eal men (in plural
   form).

   But in English, abstract nn., (knowledge, courage) and
   mass-words (water, milk) have no plural forms, because they
   really have no number and cannot be counted (it would. be
   nonsense to say one knowledge, two knowledges), so it happens
   that indefinite abstract nn., like Chinese words, are expressed
   in the singular form without any article. Thus--
   ::

      ABSTRACT                         CONCRETE
      Knowiedge is virtue.             Women are men.
      Knowledge kills virtue.          Women marry men.
      Virtue kills knowledge.          Men marry women.

   On the other hand, definite abstract nn. or mass-words
   may have the article the, as the water you drink, the knowedge 
   of the students, the milk in the coffee, the health of the family.

   “An” is used instead of “a” before words beginning
   with the vowels, a, e, i, o, u, except when these vowels are
   pronounced really with a consonant, w ory, at the beginning. 
   Thus the “long u” is really [j+u:] and so requires
   a instead of an. Examples are:—-
   ::

      a university [,ju(:)ni'və:s(i)ti]   such a one [wʌn]
      a useful servant                    a one-hour class
      a united policy                     a once popular writer

.. _P199:

   Some people still write an historian, because h in the
   unaccented syllable his-is weakened so that the word is
   pronouned almost like an istorian. Also: an historical play,
   an heroic act [(h)is'tɔrikəl; (h)ɪˈrəʊɪk]. But today many
   people do not do this; they use a even before h in unaccented
   syllables.

   Exercise 61. Point out in the following why a or the is used,
   or why both are omitted. Is the meaning definite or indefinite,
   singular or plural, or neither singular nor plural (with abstract
   words which cannot be counted)?

   1. A letter was received from Hongkong, but, as it was
      unsigned, nobody knows who was the writer of the letter.
   2. There was a Jones in the same college.
   3. A man named Bailey called this morning, but finding
      you not at home, he walked all over the house.
   4. Jackson is one of the best students in physics, if not the best.
   5. A Mrs. Watson was at the witness box.
   6. That's a lie!
   7. Liars must have a good memory.
   8. Beggars must not be choosers.
   9. They are taiking like a pair of lovers.
   10. That's the girl!
   11. It's the only right thing to do.
   12. Have the letter sent at once.
   13. Help me with money and not with empty words.
   14. He is giving up medicine and going to study law.
   15. Don't talk to me about religion and sins and prayers.
   16. I want three things in life: work, a good library, and a
       woman who understands.

   8.71. Generalization: “a Cat,” “the Cat,” “Cats,”—-
   When we talk about things in ecncral, we may use the

.. _P200:

   plural without article or use a or the in the “generic singular”
   (§5.25). Thus--

   (1) Englishmen are usually reserved in manners.
   (2) An Englishman seldom talks to strangers.
   (3) The Englishman is quite different from the Frenchman in his manners.

   The third form refers to an abstract idea of “the Englishman," 
   and is not found in Chinese. Here the abstract
   “Englishman” is made to represent “all Englishmen.” Also--

   (1) Cats are afraid of dogs.        (Indefinite pl.)
   (2) A cat is afraid of a dog.       (Indefinite sing.)
   (3) The cat is afraid of the dog.   (Abstract type)

   Exercise 62. Study the following examples, and see if it is
   possible sometimes to change the generic singulars into generic (or
   indefinite) plurals and vice versa:---

   1. According to the Christian prayer-book, the bridegroom
      promises to love and protect, and the bride promises to love and obey.
   2. The short story is a modern invention, and so are short skirts.
   3. The steam-engine was invented over a hundred years ago.
   4. The boy stays with his father four months in the year,
      and lives with his mother during the rest of the time.
   5. The modern mother does not feed her baby at midnight.
      The baby will sleep till early morning once it forms the habit.

.. _P201:

   6. Modern fathers must be good pals(=comrades) to their sons.
   7. Mr. Hsihas all the poet's ways and the poet's weaknesses.
   8. When a lion meets a lamb, one plus one makes one.
   9. Mr. Ma looks like a thinker. He has the thinker's face, thin and wan.
   10. The busy doctor's time is not his own.
   11. Do actors and actresses always lead immoral lives? Must
       they always have scandals?
   12. This costs $ 3.75 a yard.

   8.72. Special Uses of “A” and “The.”--There are some
   specialuses of “a”" and “the” which must be mentioned here.

   (1) In regard to pronunciation, a is pronounced [ei]
   when accented or stressed, but otherwise and generally [e].
   The is pronounced [ði:] only when accented or stressed, other-
   wise [ðe] before following consonants, and [ði] before vowels.
   As Chinese students of English often make a mistake in
   pronouncing these two words generally with accent or stress
   when they should be unaccented, it is very important for
   them to learn to pronounce them correctly.
   ::

      I said a hat, an egg, not hats, eggs. [ai sed 'ei 'hæt|'æn︶'eg|
      nɒt 'hæts|'egz|--|]

      Yes, that is the Mr. Wang I mean. ['jes ðæts 'ði: mistə waŋ ai
      'mi:n|-|]

      a boy [ə'bɔi]                the story [ðə 'stɔ:ri]
      an eagle [ən︶'i:gl]         the horse [ðə'hɔ:s]
      the idea [ði ai'diə]        the ear  [ði'i-] or [ði:'iə]
      the only...[ði 'ounli...]   the ants [ði 'ænts]

   (2) What a, quite a, such a, many a, rather a.--
   ::

      What a lie!                   Quite a long essay.
      What a nuisance!              Many a time.
      Such a question!              Many a young man.
      Such a government.            Muny a husband.
      Such a fool.                  Rather a nuisance.
      Quite a comfort.              Rather a failure.
      Quite a good student.         Rather a new thing.

.. _P202:

   (3) How...a, too...a, so...a, as...a.—-
   ::

      How different a fate!         So rash a step.
      Too serious a matter.         So good an opportunity.
      Too important a question.     As quick a writer as...
      So queer an idea.             As able a man as...

   Instead of how different a fate, we can say what a different 
   fate, and instead of so queer an idea, we can say such a
   queer idea.

   (4) “The” before proper names. “The” is generally
   not used before proper names, except (a) before river names,
   (b) before proper names in plural, (c) when denoting some
   particular phase or aspect of the thing represented by the
   proper name, and (d) when followed by an adj.

   (a) The Yellow River. The Yangtse. The Nile. The Rhine.
   (b) The Lins and Chens. The Stuarts. The Chinese. The Alps.
   (e) The China (of) today is not the China of our grandfathers.

      The John Roebuck that I know is quite a different kind
      of person.

      She sees only the Rod at the fireside, the Rod who plays
      with his children, not the Rod who swings the whip over
      poor workers.

   (d) The young Dickens (Dickens when he was young).

      The noble and great Frederick.

      The seventy-year-old Mr. Chang had to call the five-
      year old Wu-chi “tuncle.”

      The old China. The new China.

.. _P203:

   (5）“The” as adv. of degree.. This use is very common.
   Examples are:一

      The sooner he is gone, the better it is for all of us. The sooner
      gone, the better. The sooner, the better.

      The more, the better.

      The more, the merrier. The more people there are, the merrier it is.

      The more he flatters, the less I like him.

      The older he grows, the more shameless he becomes.

      If he will not come, that is so much the better.

      Instead of hating him, I like him all the more for it.

      He refused to pay? So much the worse for him.

   Exercise 63. Make some sentences with the phrases studied in
   this section.

   8.73. Omission of “A”' and “The.”--The use or omission 
   of “a” or “the” is often a difficult thing to decide.
   Many foreign students who have studied English for ten or
   twenty years still often find a doubt in meeting with such a
   question. Thus, shall we say “find a doubt,” or “find doubt”
   or “find doubts” in the above sentence? There is a psychological 
   reason for this difficulty, and we shall soon see it.

   (1) It is clear that, as we have said in §8.70, abstract
   nn. and mass-words require no article (the or a) when the
   meaning is indefinite, but require the definite article the when
   the meaning is definite. Thus:--
   ::

      INDEEINITE                 DEFINITE
      He wants power.            But: He wants the power to vote.
      Drink water.               But: Drink the water in the cup.

   Hence, we also say have patience, take time, spend money,

.. _P204:

   because patience, time, money are regarded as abstract
   nn., and eat ice-cream, drink tea, add milk because ice-cream,
   tea and milk are mass-words (§4.51).
 
   So far so good. But examine the following common
   phrases, all with the omitted:--
   ::

      go to school (hospital)       out of job
      in school (class)             at sunrise
      after class                   at night (but: in the night)
      after dinner                  by day
      during dinner                 all day long
      have (take) dinner            at noon (midday)
      go to church                  without (beyond) question
      after sermon                  without doubt.
      go to bed                     sold at auction
      lie in bed                    shut up shop
      out of bed                    open shop (school)
      at table                      take bath
      go to law-court               in fashion
      at home                       for (on) sale
      not in office                 on business

   Notice that all the nn. in the above examples refer to
   some action or event. The peculiarity of an action or event
   is that it is half visible and half invisible. We can see some
   people eating at dinner; therefore, we say we can see the dinner. 
   And yet we cannot touch the dinner (or dining) as we
   can touch a table. These words are therefore half concrete and
   half abstract words, standing between, the abstract nn. hunger,
   satisfaction and the concrete nn. kinves and forks. Hence,
   we sometimes use, and sometimes omit, the article. We say:--
   ::

      After crying ..................Or: after a good cry.
      Give help .....................Or: give a help.
      Serve dinner ..................Or: serve a dinner.
      Under examination .............Or: under an examination.

.. _P205:

   Now, in the above examples (go to school, etc.) all the
   seemingly concrete words school, church, class, bed, hospital,
   home, office, law-court really stand for some sort ofaction
   (teaching, praying, studying, sleeping, etc.) Hence, we can say:
   ::

      Go to school ..................Or: go to the ichool.
      Go to hospital ................Or: go to a hospital.
      Not in office .................Or: not in the office.
      Beyond question ...............Or: beyond a question.
      Take bath .....................Or: take a bath.
      Have dinner ...................Or: have a dinner.
      Resign work ...................Or: resign the work.
      Sold at euction ...............Or: sold at an auction.
      Shut up shop ..................Or: shut up the shop.

   And, because the above phrases are in very commion use,
   therefore, we habitually omit the article before the nn. It
   is more idiomatic to say “Have dinner with me” than to
   say “Have a dinner with me.”

   (2) A second source of trouble is that abstract nn.
   often have concrete meanings, and nn. of action (or, we may
   say, half-concrete nn.) often develop abstract meanings (cf.
   §4.20-4:30). If we regard them as abstract, we often drop
   the article,” and if we. regard them as concrete, or partially
   concrele, we use a or the. Thus--
   ::

      CONCRETE                            ABSTRACT
      They have formed a trade union.     In union there is strength.
      This man has a special system       What you want here is system.
      for indexing.

.. _P206:
   ::

      She has found a new love(=lover).   She does not understand what love is.
      He gave me a wrong medicine.        He is going to study medicine.
      Where is the money you gave me?     He has money, influence and power.
      Take up a business.                 Business is as usual.
      Learn a trade.                      Trade is at a standstill.
      Receive a favour.                   Show favour to some one.

   Exercise 64. Take some of the above phrases (go to school, in
   school, after class, etc.) and some of the nn, of action, and concrete
   or abstract nn., and use them in sentences of your own. Show the
   reason why the article is used or omitted. His, my, this, etc. may
   beused instead of the article.

   (3) The articie is often dropped in regular phrases.
   as the soldiers in uniform (not in a imiform, or in uniforms),
   and translate word by word (not one word by one word), learn
   it by heart (not by the heart). Often, it is possible to insert
   the article or the words some, any, my, etc., when the meaning
   is more concrete and specialized and the phrase loses therefore
   its general character. Thus, we say, last or at the last, by
   chance or by a queer chance, beyond question or beyond any
   question, go by train or go by the next train. See if you can
   use the following phrases:--
   ::

      week by week                     go by boat
      day by day                       come by train
      step by step                     set foot on China 到中国
      man for man 以个人比较              came on foot 步行而来
      tit for tat 报复                 leave word for him 留言
      in case, in this case            in point of fact 事实上
      in fact, in actual fact          in view of 为...起见
      by chance, by some chance        clean house 扫除积弊
      at heart, at his heart           play tennis
      by mistake, by a bad mistake     at night
      eat by mouth                     at noon

.. _P207:

   (4) Finally, articles may be omitted before nn. used
   as modifiers, which approach adjj. in meaning:--
   ::

      He was not man enough to confess his mistake.
      Mr. Hsü, poet and painter, arrived yesterday.
      I met Mr. Hsü, the brother of Hsi Tien-hsi and husband of
      Su-cheng (second the usually omitted).
      They have elected him president of the company.
      He acted as secretary to Li Yuan-hung.

Indetermination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   8.80. Indetermination.--We have studied now the various
   means of expressing determination, whether definite or indefinite 
   (a and the), and of making generalizations (§8.71). It
   remains now to study how the idea of lack of determination is
   expressed in English. The common phrases are:一
   ::

      Marry any old fool for a husband.
      Pay it in any old way you want.
      Pay it in whatever way you want.
      I will do it, whatever he says.
      Whatever you do, don't offend him again.
      Whatever you think of it, I am going to get married to this girl.
      Is there any chance whatever of our escape?
      He has no friend whatever in this city.
      He cannot do it, however he tried.
      He cannot do it, no matter how he tried.
      He will not consent, no matter how hard you try to persuade him.
      No matter what you think, it is I who am going to get married.
      No matter what you do, don't ofiend him again.
      I will do it, no matter what he says.
      You can pay me at any time, no matter when.
      Inany case, there is no use discussing it now.
      Anyhow, it is too late now.
      The boat floated wherever it pleased.
      Wherever Mary went, the little lamb was sure to go.
      Wherever there is a stream of water with fish in it, there you
      may look for the kingfisher.
      You may come whenever you like (please).
      The kingfisher flies away whenever it sees a man.

.. _P208:

   The words whatever, whoever, however, whenever, wher-
   ever require some special notice. The last three are easy and
   are used as special forms of the conjunctive advv. how, when
   and where, introducting clauses.'I hus--
   ::

      How he tried. However he tried.
      When he remembers. Whenever he remembers.
      Where he went. Wherever he went.

   Whatever, whoever, too, can be used as special forms of
   what (=no mui.ter what) and who (=no matter who). The
   only peculiar thing to notice here is that we often have apparently 
   two vbb. to these words. Thus in--
   ::

      (What I have) is yours,
      (Whatever I have) is yours,

   it is quite clear that what(ever) I have is the subject of is.
   Hence we have such constructions as--
   ::

      (What is left) is quite worthless.
      (Whatever is left) is taken away.

.. _P209:

   Similarly, who and whoever are used as in the following:--

      | (Who steals my purse) steals trash.
      | (Who breaks) pays.
      | (Whoever said this) is a liar.
      | (Whoever kills the enemy captain) shall have my daughter for his wife.

   It would be wrong to say--

      | Whoever said this, he is a liar.
      | Whoever kills the enemy chief, he shall marry my daughter.

   Compare also §7.31 “c” for the use of whoever and whomnever and for further examples.

   Exercise 65. Make sentences with whatever, whoever, whenever,
   wherever and however after the models given above, and study closely
   the grammatical relations of these words. However, whenever and
   wherever are used as conjunctive advv. It is best to regard whatever
   and whoever as conjunctive pronn., and no matter what, no matter
   who as conjunctive pronominal phrases.

.. _P210:

Ch IX Modification
------------------

Modification: Its Importance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   9.10. Modification: Its Importance.--We have mentioned 
   in our discussion on sentence structure (§3.22) that
   a sentence, no matter how long and complicated, really 
   consists of some of the five parts:（1) subject, (2) principal
   vb., (3) object, (4) modifiers (including prepositional
   phrases), and (5) conjunctions. Without the modifiers and
   conjunctions, we should all be speaking short, bald sentences
   like these--
   ::

      Flood came.
      Mother died, father disappeared-son sat-door-step-wept.
      Student was punished-stole books-proctor saw-dismissed-
      school-was beaten-father-became robber-became emperor-China.

   Thus we should not be able to say where and when the food
   came, and whether it was a big flood, a small flood, a terrible 
   flood, or a flood that lasted only three hours-or whether 
   it was a flood of water, or a flood of news, or a flood
   of tears, or a flood of words. Examine also the following
   sentence and see what an important part is played by the
   modifying words, phrases and clauses in italics (phrases and
   clauses are in brackets):--

      (All of a sudden) and (without any warning) the terrible flood
      came,(a foaming, furious, thundering torrent),(that destroyed
      houses, streets and whole villages),(drowning men, women children
      cats, dogs and cattle) and (turning the whole region into
      a lake, dotted here and there with tree-tops and house-roofs
      with men and women on them like drowned monkeys).

.. _P211:

   Thus we have-

   1. All of a sudden modifying came, or showing how the flood came.
   2. Without any warning also showing how.
   3. The modifying flood.
   4. Terrible also modifying flood.
   5. A foaming, furious, thundering torrent, an appositive phrase,
      showing what kind of a fiood it was. The first four words
      again modify torrent.
   6. That destroyed houses, streets and whole villages, a relative
      clause modifying flood.
   7. Drowning men, women, children, cats, dogs and cattle, a par-
      ticipial phrase also modifying flood.
   8. Turning the whole region to like drowned monkeys, another
      participial phrase modifying flood.

      | Into a lake further modifies turning.
      | Dotted further modifies lake.
      | Here and there further modifies dotted.
      | With tree-tops and house-roofs mcdifies dotted.
      | With men and women on them modifies house-roofs.
      | Like drowned monkeys modifies men and women.

   Thus at every step we are tripping on the toes of modifying
   words and phrases without suspecting them.

   Since modification is so common and important, a study

.. _P212:

   of the various means of expressing this will greatly help the
   student in a fluent mastery of the English language and a
   better understanding of the structure of English sentences.
   When modification is understood, there are no other problems
   about sentence structure, because the subjects, principal vbb.,
   objects and conjunctions are usually easy to find out. We
   shall study in this chapter, for instance, such common and
   important constructions as the relative clause, the prepositional
   phrase, the participial phrase, the infinitive phrase and the
   complements of principal vbb. which are all some form of
   modifiers.

   9.11. Word-Classes and Word-Ranks.--In the phrase
   exceptionally fine music, we say that fine modifies music, and
   exceptionally modifies fine. Here we fee! the n. music to
   be the principal or chief word, and fine to be only a word
   used to qualify or modify it; exceptionally, again, is logically
   subordinate to fine. Hence, it is possible to speak of “word-
   rank”: the modified word seems to stand on a higher rank
   than its modifier. Similarly, we can distinguish three ranks
   in the phrases: very (3) entertaining (2) book (1), or
   quite(3) well (2) written (1), or rapidly (3) rising(2)
   reputation (1). It will help us to understand the relationships
   between modifiers and modified, if we use the terms “higher
   rank,” “Jower rank” (or “subordinate”) and “equal rank” 
   (or “co-ordinate”). Of course, we can have more than three
   ranks: thus in the following, each added word, except “a”,
   modifies the modifier which stands after it一
   ::

                                                             an essay
                                                      a written essay
                                                 a well written essay
                                            a very well written essay
                                        a not very well written essay
                              a certainly not very well written essay

.. _P213:

   Word-ranks are different from word-classes or parts
   of speech. Usually the first modified word is a n., the first
   modifier is an adj., and the third, fourth and further modifiers 
   are advv. But this is not always the case: thus in the
   phrase He writes well, the modified word is a vb. write, and
   not a n., and the first modifier is an adv. well, and not an
   adj. It is, therefore, necessary to keep the two classes of ideas
   apart: the terms "noun,” “pronoun,” “adjective,” “adverb,”
   etc. refer to their word-classes, while the terms “modifier” and
   “modified” express their word-ranks with reference. to one
   another.* Thus, in the phrase book cover, we may say the n.
   book is a “modifier” of the n. cover. This is probably clearer
   than to say that “the n. book is used as an adj.” We speak of
   “modifiers” and “modified” when referring to work-ranks,
   and speak of “nouns,” “adjectives,” etc. when referring to
   word-classes or parts of speech:

   The following sections (§69.20-9.27, pp. 214-235) may
   be partly or entirely omitted at the teacher's discretion for less
   advanced classes.

   [*] Jespersen, who first enunciated the theory of “word--ranks," uses
   the term “primary” ”for the chief modified word, “adjunct” (or “sec-
   ondary word”) for the first modifer, and “subjunct” (or “tertiary
   word”) for the second modifier. For the sake of simplicity, which is
   quite a consideration in grammars for students, these words ane ayoided,
   and only the terms “modifier” and “modified” are used here.

.. _P214:

Relationship between Modified and Modifier

   9.20. Relationship between Modified and Modifier.--The
   most common combinations of modifier and modified are
   either (1) of the wriften essay type, where we have 1 adj.
   +1 n., or (2) of the book cover type, where we have two
   nn., the first being used to modify the second. The relationship 
   between the modified and the modifier in these two
   types should be studied, and ofen there is a question as to
   which type is the proper one to use. It has already been
   pointed out in §2.21 that both Japan tour and Japanese tour
   (=tour through Japan) may be used; also both college student
   and collegiate student, and both South China and Southern
   China. It has further been pointed out that combinations
   of the second type, like stone wall, honey-bee, motor roads, show
   different relationships between the modifying word and the
   modified. A stone wall is a wall made of stone, the honey-bee 
   is the bee producing honey, and a motor road is a road
   for motor cars.

   Now it should be noticed that this second type is very
   common in modern English. Thus it is very common to
   find expressions like the geography teacher (地理教员), the
   China problem (中国问题), the food problem (粮食问题), the
   Disbandment Cenference (编遣会议), maternity hospital（接生
   医院) and the fire-brigade (救火队). One should not say
   the communicative system for 交通系统, but communication
   system, nor unemployed situation for 失业状况,but unemployment 
   situation. Logically speaking, the situation is not unemployed, 
   but there is a situation of unemployment, noris the
   system communicative, but really the system of communication

.. _P215:

   is meant. Below are some more examples:--
   ::

      air transport 航空运输              birthday party 寿宴
      temperance society 禁酒会           wedding march 结婚进行曲
      water problem 饮水问题              swimming suit 游泳衣
      employment bureau 职业介绍所        bathing costume 浴装
      arithmetic class 算术课             fishing-boat 渔船
      railway regulations 铁道章程        washing-woman 洗衣妇
      trade mission 商业调查旅行团        printing machine 印刷机
      peace conference 和平会议           dancing party 跳舞会
      war council 军事会议                dining-room 饭厅

   It may be noticed here that a bathing costume does not refer
   to a costume which bathes, but one used for bathing: thus
   bathing is here originally a vb. turned into a n. and then
   used as a modifier. Similarly, a fishing-boat is a boat used
   for fishing purposes. (But a sailing-boat may mean a boat
   which sails, and a printing machine may mean a machine
   which prints as well as a boat for sailing and a machine for
   printing.)

   On the other hand, we must notice that the English
   language has certain phrases which may seem logically wrong,
   but are idiomatically recognized today. Thus a dead march
   is the correct expression for a funeral march (cf. wedding
   march), and a mad-doctor is the correct expression for a doctor
   of brain diseases (cf. madman, mad dog). These phrases are
   created for convenience. Again Foreign Office is strictly
   Foreign Affairs Office or Office of the Secretary for Foreign
   Affairs (who is also called “Foreign Secretary,” but who is
   reaily not “foreign” at all). Further examples are:--


.. _P216:
   ::

      Criminal lawyer, lawyer for criminal cases (刑法律师，刑名师爷).
      Insolvent court, court to decide cases of insolvency or bankruptcy
      (处置破产者之法庭).
      Greek student, student of Greek language and literature.
      Indian problem, problern of India.
      English teacher, teacher of English who may be a Chinese.
      Dead list, list of the dead in battle (阵亡表).
      A sickroom, not a sick room, but a room for sick people(病房)。
      Female education, education for women (女子教育).
      Comparative literature, comparative study of the literatures of
      different peoples (比较文学).
      Clinical thermometer, one for clinical use (医生验温表).
      Married life, life of married men or women (结婚生活).
      Dying wish, wish of a dying man (临死遗嘱).
      Historical novelist, a writer of historical novels.
      Easy money, money that is earned without trouble.
      Difficult friend, friend difficult to get along with.
      Lazy time, time when one is lazy or idle.

   It may be noticed that in the case of dead list (=list of the
   dead), we have an adj. dead used as a n., which is then
   used as an adj. or modifier again. On the other hand, we
   have death-duties (=遗产继承税, tax levied on property before 
   it goes to the heir of the dead), deathbed(=that on which
   one dies) and death-rate (=死亡率, the rate of death in a
   population).

   Exercise 66. Simplify the following phrases by making them
   into phrases of the water problem and peace conference type:—-

   1. A cake like the moon of the Mid-Autumn (中秋月饼).
   2. A present for Christmas (圣诞节礼物).
   3. A cake for his birthday (寿糕).
   4. A gift for the New Year (年礼).
   5. His clothes for Sundays (星期日服).
   6. Her gown for the night-time (卧服，寝衣).
   7. My studies at school (学堂功课).

.. _P217:

   8. The days when he was a student (学生时代).
   9. The new system of examination (考试制度).
   10. The ceremonies for graduation (毕业典礼).
   11. A painting of landscape (山水画).
   12. The train leaving at eleven thirty(十一时三十分火车).
   13. The railway running between Tientsin and Pukow (津浦铁路).
   14. A reservation for a sleeping berth (卧车定位).
   15. A card bearing your name (名片).
   16. Your marks in algebra (代数分数).
   17. A party in the evening (晚间宴会).
   18. During the hours in the morning (早间).
   19. Bad discipline in the dormitory (宿舍纪律).
   20. Matters concerning money (钱项).
   21. Reform of the currency (币制改革).
   22. Bureau for the inspection of lace (花边检验局).

   9.21. The Use and Omission of Hyphens.--From such
   examples, as fireman, fire-brigade and fire station, one can
   see that the same logical combination between modifier and
   modified may be sometimes written as a single word, sometimes 
   as a hyphened compound, and sometimes as two separate words. 
   In this respect, the English language presents a
   disgraceful chaos and confusion, and even usage cannot be
   always depended upon, because different writers and different
   dictionaries adopt different forms of spelling.* Some people
   write blackboard, penknife, postgraduate, and others write
   black-board, penknife, post-graduate. Again some people write
   water-pressure (水压), wet-nurse (乳母), blood-heat（血温)

   [*] The Modern English Usage says, “The chaos prevailing among
   writers or printers or both regarding the use of hyphens is discreditable
   to English education” (p. 243), and again, “usage” is “so variable as to
   be better named caprice” (p. 245).

.. _P218:

   (with a hyphen) and others write water pressure, wet nurse, blood
   heat (without any hyphen). The three stages are also represented by—-
   ::

         (1) football   (2) basket-ball   (3) volley ball
      or (1) bathtub    (2) bath-house    (3) bath chair (病家所用之挂轮自由椅）

   These are spelt differently, although psychologically we feel all
   three as single words. The utter confusion may be further
   seen in the following examples:---
   ::

      blackmail (1)吓诈                         gunboat (1), also (2)
      blackbird (1)鸟名                         gunshot (1), also (2)

      footstool (1), also (2) 脚凳              fireplace(1)

      sun bath (3) 日光浴，晒日光                bath-tub (2), also(1)

   The student should, however, closely observe the usage
   as far as his reading goes, and should also take some dictionary

.. _P219:

   as his standard, whenever in doubt. He should remember
   three things. (1) Many words which are written separately
   are really single words, as full stop, Holy Ghost (圣灵), good
   will, short story, New Year, fair play (公道), foul play (规犯,
   诡计). (2) Most of the hyphened words have a dominant
   (or chief) stress on the first words, as pen-knife, hang-bag.
   class-mate, class-room, day-time (which could all be written without
   hyphens as single words). If the chiefstress falls on the second
   word, there should be generally no hypen, as good will, short
   story, New Year, foul play. (3) The difference between a hyphened 
   word (gun-cotton, 绵火药) and a full compound word without hyphen
   (gunpowder) chiefly depends on age and usage. Generally, the
   older a word is and the more permanent the compound combination 
   is felt to be, the more likely are we to drop the hyphen: 
   as madman, moonshine, sunlight, sunrise, waterproof,
   waterfall, rainfall, football, fireplace, but fire-brigade, water-
   tight, sun-beam, water-melon, basket-ball, side-walk (or sidewalk)
   and time-table.*

   [*] After admitting the weltering chaos of the English language in
   this respect, Mr. H. W. Fowler, co-editor of the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 
   believes that, after the lapse of twenty years, he has found a
   rule which “seems capable of converting the chaos ... into something
   like order... The simple rule is that in such compounds the legitimacy
   of hyphening depends solely on pronunciation: it must only be done
   if the two parts are said with a single (or with one clearly predominant)
   stress, and`that falls on the first.” (Sec the inserted remarks in the
   Preface in the 1929 revised edition.) Because headmaster is pronounced
   with the stress on mas-, and not on head, one should not hyphen it,
   but should write either headmaster or head master, “either of which will
   serve.” And because water ouzel is pronounced with two equal stresses,
   there is no choice but to leave the compounds as two separate words
   without hyphen. This rule is psychologically correct and historically
   justified by the fact of Germanic stress-shifting. It does not alter the
   fact, however, that until Mr. Fowler's rule is generally followed by the,
   majority of writers and printers, “usage” remains stil “a weltering chaos;”

   Relationship between Modifiers

   9.22. Relationship between Modifiers.--It has been noticed 
   in §9.11 that the modifiers and modified stand in different
   ranks towards one another. e.g.--
   ::

      well    (3)    written      (2)     essay       (1)
      quite   (3)    well         (2)     written     (1)
      very    (3)    entertaining (2)     book        (1)
      quickly (3)    rising       (2)     reputation  (1)

   In the above examples, the firstrank represents the modified,
   the second rank its modifier, and the third rank the modifier
   of the modifier. The modifier is supposed to be subordinate
   to, or of lower rank than, the modified.

   Keeping this in mind, we may distinguish the relationship 
   between modifiers as either co-ordinate (of equal rank)
   or subordinate (lower rank). We have co-ordinate modifiers
   in good, healthy child (2+2+1), or pale, thin face (2+2+1),
   and one subordinate and one main modifier in rather bitter
   disappointment (3+2+1), or thinly concealed lie (3+2+1).

   9.23. Co-ordinate Modifiers (2+2+1).--Let 'us now
   first study the co-ordinate modifiers (2+2+1). The simplest
   cases are:--
   ::

      a small, clear handwriting       a sweet, graceful manner 
      a beautiful, clear voice         those lonely, bare, stone houses
      a long, eventful career          that stingy, dirty, little black
      a thin, long face                backyard

   Then, in English, we often have conjunctions of various
   kinds put in between these modifiers. e.g.一

.. _P221:
   ::

      a rainy and stormy weather       a mediocre, but serviceable book
      a careful and efficient          worker of reference
      a tedious and long speech        after a dangerous, though 
      a small but comfortable room     exciting adventure
      a very clever, but rather        a homely but clean-looking face
      eratic (unsteady) chap           a glorious, though defeated fighter
      a brilliant, but thoroughly      making slow but sure progress
      impracticable scheme             progressing slowly but surely

   In certain phrases, these modifiers seem to merge with one
   another in meaning and in a way really modify one another.
   This is especially clear in phrases beginning with nice and, as 
   nice and clean, nice and cool, nice and warm, nice and soft.
   Here nice and really acts as a kind of adv. modifier for the
   following adj. Thus, “The caris going nice and fast” means
   that it is going fast in a nice way, or satisfactorily fast, and
   “The house stands nice and high” really means that it stands
   high enough to satisfy you.* In the same way we have. “high
   and dry talk” (=abstract talk) and “high and mighty manner” 
   (=proud, arrogantmanner).

   These co-ordinate modifiers are often used to reinforce
   one another's meaning, as in the above example of that stingy,
   dirty, little black backyard, where it seems the speaker cannever
   condemn it enough, but must pile up more and more adjectives.
   In such cases, we practically never employ any conjunction,
   but just pile them up for accumulating effect. Some interesting
   examples are:一
   ::

      I saw a great, big tiger,
      He was a tall, big, husky fellow.
      Don't worry about such small, littlethings.
      It was only atiny, little spot.
      That was your great, good luck (not greal good luck, but great luck and good luck).
      He had a tremendous, big fortune.
      He had some excellent, good wine.
      It was a terrible, fearful-looking thing.
      You dirty, low-down dog of a scoundrel,
      She had a rich, golden voice.

   [*] Here the use of and is really similar to its use in “Be a good
   boy and get out of my presence,” which means “Be so good as to get
   out of my presence.”.

.. _P222:

   Finally, we have some very common combinations, where
   the several modifiers are not truly co-ordinate. If we examine
   the phrase that nice young lady, we find that this means something 
   rather different from that young nice lady. The second
   form is usually not used, unless we want to emphasize the
   word nice. We see, therefore, that young lady forms a concept
   by itself which is modified by the word nice, and we mean really
   a nice young lady, and not just a nice lady, nor nice and young
   lady. The formula for this is really 2+(2+1). Similarly, we
   say “Take the first fast truin” if we emphasize the fast train
   idea, and “Take the fast first train” if we emphasize the first
   train idea. It will be noticed, therefore, that the most closely
   related modifier always stands next to the word modified.
   Other examples are:--
   ::

      your new straw-hat            a grand wedding party
      every New Year's Day          his teacher's profession
      his uncle's new book          her woman's heart
      a big Christmas dinner        her mother's heart 

   In the last example, mother's heart forms a concept(=heart
   of a mother) modified by her. “The loss of the baby broke
   her mother's heart” means that it broke her motherly heart,
   and not the heart of the baby's grandmother.

.. _P223:

   Exercise 67. Make sentences or phrases with the following
   material. Decide which of the following types you wish to use:--
   ::

      (a) a small, clear handwriting (without conj.)
      (b) a tedious and long speech; a clever, but unsteady chap
          (with conii. and, or, but, though, although)
      (c) that stingy, dirty, little black backyard (piling up modifiers
          without conj.)

      1. Horse-great, Arabic, racing.
      2. Car-new, smart-looking, smooth-running, 1929 mode?.
      3. Pen-knife-good-looking, useless.
      4. Friend-formerly close, now forgotten.
      5. Journey-eventful, miserable, long, three-day, exciting, 
         wonderful, second, etc.
      6. House-yellow, red-roofed, foreign-style, cheap-looking,
         small, moss-grown, ivy-covered, etc.
      7. Essay-well-written, clear, not brilliant.
      8. Student-so-so, not too good, not too bad.
      9. Dress-bright-coloured, silk, new, smart, too thin.

   9.24. Subordinate Modifiers (3+2+1).--There are some
   characteristic combinations of this type which need to be
   studied. The simplest combination is of course of the type well
   (3) written (2) essay (1), or much(3) older (2) man (1).
   The third rank need not always be an adv.; it could be an
   adj. or a n. Thus--
   ::

      English     (3)      grammer     (2)   teacher   (1）
      ready-made  (3)      boot        (2)   shop      (1)
      second-hand (3)      book        (2)   store     (1)
      newspaper   (3)      manager`s   (2)   office    (1)

   In the case of ready-made boot shop, one should try to avoid
   confusion by the way of hyphening or joining words. Thus
   one should avoid such spellings as ready-made boot-shop, and
   dirty clothes-basket; ready-made hoot shop and dirty-clothes
   basket are preferable.

.. _P224:

   Study below the characteristic types often found in English:--

      (A) Hyphened modifiers                 a deariy paid for mistake
      ready-to-hand proof                    undreamed-of success

      letters work

      product
      an internationaily known playwright    (E) With infinitive phrases

                                             those not to be avoided expenses
      (C) With attached advv. or piepp.
      unheard-of wonders                     those clearly to be avoided mis-
      unpaid-for goods takes

   We may note here the internal relationships between the modifiers 
   in some typical examples:一
   ::

      (a) ready(2)-to-hand (3) proof (1), or (2+3)+1.
          three-inch(3)-high (2) heel(1), or (3+2)+1.
      (b) much (3) regretted (2) affair (1).
          far-and-wide (3) discussed (2) new product (2+1).
      (c) unheard(2)-of(3) wonders (1), or(2+3)+I.
          dearly (3) paid for (2+3) mistake(1).
      (d) to me (3) interesting (2) idea(l).
          to her (3) absolutely (3) new (2) experience(1), or
          3+(3+2)+1, or 4+(3+2)+1.
      (e) strongly (3) to be desired (2) reform (1).
          not (3) to be avoided (2) expenses (1).

   It may be noticed now that the use of hyphens in the
   above examples is somewhat irregular. Thus we hyphen
   well-arranged, but not admirably carried out; again, we hyphen
   long-drawn-out, but not tightly fastened down. This difference,
   it should be clearly understood, is largely dictated by convenience 
   only; we do not as a rule use any hyphen unless it is
   necessary or is a help toward clearness. The hyphen serves
   to show that the whole group of words is used in one grammatical 
   function, thus ready-to-hand is used as one adjective,
   Like the parentheses in “(2+3)+1,” it serves to bind the
   group together as a unit. Thus we write “This piano has
   not yet been paid for,” but “this unpaid-for piano.” In long
   combinations, like “admirably carried out plan” or “tightly 
   fastened down mouth,” the use of hyphens is felt to be unnecessary
   and awkward-looking.

   Exercise 68. Try to make phrases of the “a,” “b,” “c,” “d,”
   “e” types discussed above, by taking those given examples as models
   and change parts of them. Thus from the following originals, one
   might make the modifications:一
   ::

      ORIGINAL                               MODIFICATION
      Hitherto unpublished letter .......... Hitherto unknown author.
      Undreamed-of success ................. Undreamed-of fame.
      Unpaid-for goods ..................... Uncared-for children.
      The most talked-about girl ........... The most highly thought-of person.
      This for him very ordinary
      occurrence............................ This for me very common, etc.

   Or complete the following phrases:—
   ::

      good--for-nothing .................... a much talked-about new .....
      worse-than--useless .................. a closely concealed .........
      four-year-old ........................ a closely guarded ...........
      well planned ......................... a much prayed-for ...........
      not very well performed .............. a tightly sealed-up .........
      nationally known ..................... a by no means bad ...........
      politically unwise ................... a in some respects better ...
      to me uninteresting .................. a by far superior ...........
      for him unexpected ................... a soon to be completed ......

   Shifted Ranks*

   9.25. Shifted Ranks.--In English we often find a shifting
   of word-ranks in certain phrases. These are mainly of three
   types: (a) probable winners, from those who probably win,
   and heavy sleepers from those who sleep heavily: (b) extraordinary 
   good luck for extraordinarily good luck, and real wicked
   people for really wicked people; and (c) new-laid eggs or
   newly-laid eggs. Type “a” represents a shifting from (adv.+
   vb.) to (adj.+n.). Type “b” represents the substitution of adjj.
   in places where advv. would normally be expected, Type
   “c” contains an adj. or an adv.-a participle.

   [*] §9.25 (pp. 226-230) may be omitted for less advanced students,

.. _P227:

   (a) Adv. + Vb. > Adj. + N. E.g.--
   ::

      first offender          heavy eaters         perfect strangers
      quick thinkers          sound thinkers       hard students
      close prisoners         sound sleepers       good haters
      probable winners        hard drinkers        (positive wrong)
      early risers            swift runners        (comparative ease)
      long residents          heavy losers         (almost certainty)

   In all these cases, if we analyze carefully, we see that the
   modifiers modify only half of the modified words. Heavy
   eaters does not mean that the eaters are heavy, but that only
   eating is heavy: they cat heavily. Good haters does not mean
   the haters are good, but only they can hate very well. Close
   prisoners are not “close” at all (for that would make no sense)。
   but they are closely guarded. Perfect strangers are far from 
   “perfect,” but are only perfecily strange to us. The last
   three examples in parentheses represent a shifting of ranks not
   from adv.+vb., but from adv.+adj,--from comparatively
   easy and positively wrong to comparative ease and positive
   wrong.

   Exercise 69. Change the following sentences with a shifting
   of word-ranks of the italicized words.

   1. This fellow does not hear anything when he is asleep. He sleeps soundly.
   2. Don't punish him too hard. This is the first time he ever commits an offence.
   3. Among you three, Chu-lien is going to lose most heavily in this deal.
   4. He writes quickly. He wrikes rapidly.
   5. He came here only a short while ago. (New-comer.)
   6. He has been in this country a long time. (Old-timer.)
   7. This man talks glibly.
   8. That man can be easily victimized or cheated.

.. _P228:

   (b) Adj.+Adj. There is a steady tendency in the English 
   language to cut out the adv. ending -ly in places where
   briefness and force are wanted for effect, especially in 
   colloquial speech. Thus Come quick is now more common than
   Come quickly, because the adding of the -ly seems to decrease
   the force of the word. One might say He is devilishly handsome, 
   and She is deucedly clever, but it is more idiomatic to say
   devilish handsome and deuced clever. Similarly, extraordinary
   good luck and real wicked people are more expressive than
   extraordinarily good and really wicked. So also, we have the
   -ly regularly dropped in dead, hard and fast as advv., as
   dead drunk, dead pale, dead tired, hard hit, hard pressed, run
   fast. Notice that in the following examples, it is always adjj.
   expressing emphasis or intensity that are subject to this strange
   shifting of duty, which proves that the desire for brevity and
   force is the cause of this apparent shifting. Those examples. not
   quite accepted in literary English are marked with an asterisk.*
   ::

      A) burning hot soup           *mighty glad              bitter cold,
         shocking bad novel         *jolly nice               biting cold
         real wicked guy            *jolly good               blazing hot
         excellent good friends     devilish handsome         
         real stubborn fellow       deuced clever         (C) red--hot
         extraordinary good luck    confounded difficult      snowy-white
                                    *wondrous fine            ashy-pale
      B) *exceeding small           *terrible strong          bitter-sweet
         *exceeding hot             dead tired                darkred
         *thundering good           dead drunk                deep blue
         passing strange            dead asleep               light green
         *uncommon fine             stark naked               wide open

   [*] For the source of most of the examples given, see Modern English
   Grammar, II, 15.2.

.. _P229:

   One notices that the examples under “A” could easily be 
   explained as having a real adj. in the first modifier. Thus
   shocking bad novel may mean a novel both bad and shocking,
   as well as shockingly bad, but real stubborn fellow must be
   explained as real stubborn-fellow, and excellent good friends
   must be explained as excellent good-friends. Good friends,
   good luck, stubborn fellow thus form single concepts modified
   by the adiji. The cases under “C" are really felt as compound
   modifiers, consisting of two adjj. Thus red modifies hot,
   snowy modifies white, and ashy modifies pale, but at the same
   time we feel that red also directly modifies the hot object, which
   looks red, and snowy also directly modifies the white substance.
   In the same way a window which is described as wide open is
   not only widely open, but is also wide because it is opein:
   wide, therefore, directly modifies the window as well as open.
   A “bittersweet experience” is an experience that is both sweet
   and bitter; it is therefore different from a “bitter cold night”
   which means a night bitterly cold. Darkred, deep blue and
   light green are felt as compound adjj.
   ::

      (e) Adj. or Adv.+Participle.
      new-laid eggs, or newly laid eggs
      new-born baby, or newly born baby
      new-coined words, or newly coined words
      newly-married couples
      green-painted houses, but thoroughly re-painted car
      smoky-looking walls
      good-mannered people, or well-mannered, people
      moderate-sized building, or moderately sized building
      foreign-built house
      deep dug-in trenches
      plain-spoken man

.. _P230:

   Just as in the case of red-hot iron, we retain the adj. form
   red because it partly modifies iron itself, so also in the case of
   new-laid eggs, it is possible to say new, because we are partly 
   thinking of new eygs. In these cases, we can say new when
   we feel that it modifies eggs, and say newly when we intend it
   to modify the participle laid. Hence we can have moderate sized
   houses or moderately sized houses, but must say green painted
   and not greenly painted. Foreign-built houses does not mean
   that they are built by foreigners or in foreign countries, but
   that the houses themseves are in foreign style. These cases
   will be made clearer from a study of the following paragraph.

   9.26. Transformed Phrases as Modifiers.--In the above
   examples, good-mannered man and well mannered man, moderate-
   sized building and moderately sized building, we have really two
   types of modifiers. The type well mannered man and moderately 
   sized building is easy to understand or analyze. The other
   type really belongs to a large class of modifiers which are
   quite freely formed in English. These may really be regarded
   as phrases transformed into modifiers for the sake of conve-
   mience and brevity. Thus--
   ::

      A moderate-sized building--a building of moderate size,
      A good-mannered man-a man of good manners.
      The concepts moderate-size and good-manners are taken as a
      whole, given an-ed, and used as modifiers.

   Two most important and useful types of such modifiers 
   transformed from phrases are worth studying:--
   ::

      “Adj.+N.+ed”                     bob-haired girl
      moderatesized                    house red-haired woman
      good-mannered man                smooth-tongued fellow
      good--hearted people             blood--curdling story
      seven-hilled city                heart-rending problem
      three-legged cat(三脚猫)         fiesh-eating animal
      eight--legged essay (八股文)     awe--inspiring appearance
      nine-headed bird(九头乌)         body-building food
      evil-minded man                  story-telling contest
      swell-headed fellow              peace-loving people
      bow-legged child              (b)frost-bitten fiowers
      three--storied building          thunder-struck face
      round--eyed innocent             famine-stricken district
      chicken-hearted fellow           God-forsaken sinner
      clean-minded man                 storm-tossed ship
      able-bodied men               (c)smoky-looking room
      self-starting machine            cheap-looking dress well
                                       deep--sunken 
      “X+Vb.-ing, or --ed”             slow-going boat
      (a) hair-raising stunts          high-sounding speech

.. _P231:

   It is quite clear that in both cases, both of the hyphened
   members are taken as a whole to modify the following word.
   Thus nine--headed bird really means nine-headed bird (=a
   bird with nine heads) and not nine headed--birds. Headed--bird
   would make just as little sense as raising stunts or curdling
   story. In the second group formed with vbb, we have
   under (a) vbb.+their objects,（b) vbb.+their logical 
   subjects, and (c) vbb. with complements.

   | (a) hair--raising stunts m stunts that raise your hair.
   | (b) frost-bitten flowers =s flowers bitten by frost.
   | (c) smoky-looking room =r a room that looks smoky.

   Because the room looks smoky, and the well is sunken deep
   (smoky modifying room, and deep modifying well), we do not
   say “smokily-looking room” or “deeply sunken wel.”...

.. _P232:

   Exercise 70. (A) Try to turn all the above phrase-modifiers into
   phrases or clauses following the modified words.

   (B) Transform the following phrases or clauses into phrase,
   modifiers preceding the modified words:--
   ::

      1. A crook with a double face.        14. A device for saving money.
      2. A chair with three legs.           15. A policy that shares the
      3. A house with five rooms.               profits of the company.
      4. A boy with a round face            16. A man who is educated by
      5. My brother who uses his left           himself.
         hand more than his right hand.     17. A people abiding by the law.
      6. The quinine pills coated with      18. A person who means well.
         sugar.                             19. A wall which is painted dark.
      7. Cigarettes with cork tips.         20. Old age which is approaching
      8. Sticks with golden handles.            fast.
      9. A man with a cool head.            21. The habit of telling the truth.
      10. A young man with a hot head.      22. A country torn by war.
      11. That child who looks sleepy.      23. A nation that drinks tea.
      12. A machine for cutting paper.      24. People who go to church.
      13. A machine for rolling ciga--      25. Shoes made by hand, or
          rettes.                               made by machine,

   9.27. Nouns and Verbs as Modifiers.--Nn. and vbb. are
   usuaily words modified by others. It is not so uncommon,
   however, to find nn. and vbb. acting as modifiers themselves.
   Examples of nn. as modifiers are:--
   ::

      I kind of admire him (admire him in a way).
      I was a sort of tired and disgusted with the whole business.
      I sort of pitied him.
      He was way above the others.
      He was standing miles off from the place.
      The husband and wife are a world apart as human beings..
      Edison says that Henry Ford is sometimes happy, but he is
      never happy a billion dollars' worth.
      This cloth is thirty-six inches wide.

.. _P233:
   ::

      I don't care a twopence what you do with it.
      I don't care a rap (a bir) about it.
      A child may say to her mother, “I love my sister a little bit,
      and love you a whole big balloon.”
      This is twenty-five cents above the usual price.
      He was three times older than his “uncle.”
      I am coming next week.
      I am going this Thursday.
      That was something awful, something great (here used in the
      sense of “indeed awful," etc.).
      The picture was nothing wrong (meaning not at all wrong; in
      some constructions, we find even nothing plus a participle,
      as “nothing daunted,” meaning not at all daunted).
      Goone better (American slang=go one step or one degree
      further).
      You haven't the ghost of a chance (=a ghostly chance)。
      He had a hell of a time (=hellish time).」
      That rascal of a fellow (=rascally fellow)。
      That shiftless, sin--smelling drunkard of a husband(=husband
      who is a drunkard).
      You will catch a death of a cold (= a deadly cold)。

   It will be seen that in the last five examples, the firstn. really
   modifies the secondn. and is thus its logical modfier, although
   gramimatically the second n. seems to modify the first. Thus
   in hell of a time, logically hell modifies time, while grammatically 
   of a time modifies hell.

   Vbb., because of their very nature, are very seldom used
   as modifiers. This is because, when they are used as modifiers,
   they generally take the form of a participle or an infinitive
   phrase, and these will be studied in the following sections.
   When they are not participles or infinitives, they generally have
   a subject expressed or understood, and this makes it dificult

.. _P234:

   for them to act as modifiers. There are, however, some cases
   where an independent clause with a finite vb. has become 
   amalgamated into an adv, as in the following:--
      
      Maybe you are mistaken; maybe I can do it (from independent
      clause it may be, meaning perhaps).

      I will go away temporarily, say (from let us say), for three
      weeks, and then come back.

      Bring him in here, willy-nilly (from will he, nill he-whether he
      likes it or not).

   The words please and suppose retain still clearly the force
   of an imperative vb. in Please ring the bell and Suppose he
   won't consent, but are coming dangerously near to being advv.
   in--

      Will you please do that? (Cr. “Will you kindly do that?”)
      Suppose we go to bed. (in imperative, as a formula of proposal)

   Also, there are sound-descriptive words, like pop, crash, bang,
   which are somewhat different from usual vbb. in character,
   but which are both used as vbb. and as advv.
   ::

      [As vb.]    Pop the question (=propose marriage)/pop in and out
                  (=go or put suddenly) pop the pistol.
      [As adv.]   Pop goes the weasel (name of a country dance)/Something 
                  inside there goes pop (==breaks with a pop).
      [As vb.]    Bang the door/Doors bang.
      [As adv.]   Hit him bang in the face/He fell bang on the floor.
      [As vb.]    Crash through the gate/The whole building crashed down.
      [As adv.]   A piece of stone came crash through the window.

   It may also be noticed that the word let in let alone (=not
   to speak of) is often used in a place where a participle or an
   infinitive would seem to be required:--

.. _P235:

   He cannot unify his own province, let alone unifying the whole
   country (really we will let alone the question of, etc.)

Phrase and Clause Modifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   9.30. Phrase and Clause Modifiers. So far, we have
   been considering modifiers that precede the words they modify,
   together with the relationship between such word-modifiers.
   Now, we shall study modifiers that follow the words they
   modify and these are principally phrases and clauses. These
   are the Infinitive Phrase, the Participial Phrase, the Prepositional
   Phrase, and the Relative Clause and their modifications. Finally,
   we shall go on to study the Predicate Modifiers, which are
   generally words again, and not phrases or clauses. This will
   conclude our study of the important function of modification.

   The Infinitive Phrase as Modifier

   9.31. The Infinitive Phrase as Modifier.--The infinitive
   is one of the commonest forms used in English. We have
   already seen it used as a noun phrase in §2.30. Here we
   shall study its function as a modifier. The main types are
   five:--
   ::

      (a) Something to do, a book to read (as adj.)
      (b) Came to tell you, began to see (to complete the meaning of
          some preceding vb.).
      (c) Brave enough to go, too poor to pay (to complete the
          meaning of some preceding adj.).
      (d) To be sure, to tell you the truth (as an independent or
          absolute phrase in a sentence).
      (e) Ask him to come, allow him to stay (modifying the object).

.. _P236:

   The types “b” and “e” are strictly both predicate modifiers, 
   but for the sake of convenience, “b” will be studied
   here first, while “e”will come under §9.70.

   Examples for study and practice follow:--

   (a) These include the English equivalents of Chinese
   phrases like 有事可做, 无书可读, 有人做伴, 有功课要预备, etc.
   ::

      Something to do, to see, to talk about, to read.
      Nothing to do, to see, to eat, to drink.
      Nobody to play with, to talk to, to appreciate.
      Somebody to encourage you, to keep you company, to understand 
      your troubles, to be your friend and adviser, to lend you money.
      You have everything to gain and nothing to lose by going to see him.

      I have a story to tell you.               No money to spend.
      A lesson to prepare.                      A family to feed.
      A lesson to copy.                         A brother to educate.
      Some work to do.                          A question to ask.
      A new world to conquer.                   A request to make.
      A desire to learn.                        Ability to talk.
      No desire to study.                       Mind to study.
      No chance to see him.                     Power to give.
      Readiness to act.                         Permission to go.
      Money to buy.                             Will to try.
      No time to wait.                          Opportunity to see.

   Exercise 71. Translate these into Chinese and then back into
   English again. This may be done by yourself in the form of writing,
   or with the help of the teacher or some other students giving the
   Chinese equivalents. Then make sentences with these material, or
   form new phrases with the following as the words to be modified:

.. _P237:

   no chance, no time, no opportunity, ability, desire, nothing, something.

   (b) When we say try to see him, the infinitive phrase
   to see him obviously helps to complete the meaning of the
   principal vb. try. Inasmuch as the infinitive here completes
   the meaning of the principalvb., it may be called a complement 
   of that vb. As it comes directly within the predicate
   itselfand modifies the principal vb., it may be also called a
   predicate modifier of the vb. The English language abounds
   with such idiomatic expressions, and they include not only
   vbb. in the active voice, but also vbb. in the passive voice
   and adjj.
   ::

      (Vb.) Begin to                        Prepare tove
            Continue to                     Hasten to
            Cease to               (Pass.)  Be pleased to
            Help to                         Be told to

   Exercise 72. Try to expand these into complete sentences
   orally, and see if you can add new ones to the list.

   (c) With adiji. like enough, sufficient and advv. like
   too, enough, so, the meaning is left incomplete without the
   infinitive phrase following them.
   ::

      Heis too proud to learn.         Be good enough to tell me.
      He is too lazy to study.         Be so kind as to tell me.
      This is too good to be true.

      This happiness is too great to last.
      We have sufficient money (or money sufficient) to last us a week.
      He was fool enough to tell him everything.
      He is not man enough to confess his mistake.
      The colours of the dress are too loud to be in accordance with good taste.
      It is never too late to mend.
      He came too late to see the opening of the show.
      I am now old enough to see the truth of it.
      He is old enough to be your father.

   Exercise 73. Complete the following sentences:--
   ::

      The child is big enough to 
      He was not brave enough to
      The insult was too deep to
      The composition was too long to 
      I have not time enough to 
      People are so foolish as to 
      China is too big to 

   (d) Finally, we have infinitive phrases inserted in the

.. _P239:

   middle of a sentence to modify the meaning of the whole
   statement. Examples are:--
   ::

      To begin with, you started the quarrel.
      To make a long story short, he was arrested and put in prison,
      To tell you the truth, I don't want to marry her.
      This, to be sure, is not your fault.
      To be perfectly frank with you, you can be a successful barber.
      Strange to say, we met again at Chefoo.
      And after the husband died, the concubine acted like the lord
      of the family and husband of the wife, so to speak.

   Exercise 74. Make sentences expressing the meaning contained
   in Chinese absolute phrases like: 说也奇怪,老实说,老实对你讲,总括一句。

   9.32. The Split Infinitive, etc.--As can be seen from the
   above examples, the vb. in the infinitive cantake on mnodifiers 
   and objects like other vbb. E.g,--
   ::

      To tell you the truth (you indirect object, and truth direct object).
      To last us one week (one week adv. phrase of time, modifying last).

   The infinitive can be in the active or passive voice; and
   can be in the perfect or imperfect tense :--
   ::

      Active.    A house to let.(Owner has house to let.)
      Passive.   A house to be let.(House is to be Jet).
      Perfect.   He seems to have read a great many books.
      Imperfect. He seems to be. working all the time.

   Now, with regard to the modifiers of the infinitive; when
   we put a modifer between to and the vb., we have what is
   usually called a split infinitive.
   ::

      To come quickly (Normal.)
      To quickly come. (Split Infnitive.)

.. _P240:

   There are many “non-splitters” among the grammarians
   who absolutely will not countenance a split infinitive, like
   to quickly come. But there are just as many people, and
   among them good writers, who take care to consciously
   and deliberately flaunt the rule. The plain truth is, however,
   that the only determining factors should be: clearness of
   meaning and the natural rhythm of the language. Usually, a
   split infinitive breaks the natural rhythm of the sentence, as in--

      Tell him to quickly come.

   But--

      Tell him quickly to come.

   is just as bad, because the rhythm is not better, and the meaning 
   is not clear (ambiguous): quickly may as well be taken
   to modify tell as to modify come. The only clear and natural
   way is to say--

      Tell him to come quickly.

   Study also the following alternatives:--

   (1) He has begun to really understand it.
   (2) He has begun really to understand it.
   (3) He has begun to understand it really.

   Form “1” is best, because it is clearest and most natural.
   Form “2” is natural, but slightly ambiguous; while form
   “3” puts too much emphasis on really by giving it the final
   position.

   The fact is, all advv. have their normal or natural positions, 
   and any attempt to remove them to a new position
   either spoils the natural rhythm of the sentence, or tends to
   give the advv. an undue emphasis.

.. _P241:

   Exercise 75. Decide where the advv.(in italics) are to be
   placed in the following sentences, and find out your own reason for
   doing so.

   1. We need/to further strengthen/our position/.
   2. His army seemed completely to/have been/destroyed.
   3. The principles will have boldly to/be/followed.
   4. The letter ought carefully to/be/written.
   s. He was able immediately to/perceive/the importance of the suggestion.
   6. His action seemed largely to/have been/dictated/by selfish motives.
   7. Such mistakes are absolutely to/be/avoided.

   9.33. Need to, Dare to.--We know that words like can,
   will, may, must, shall (called auxiliarics, or helping vbb.) are
   followed directly by vbb. in the infinitive with the to omit
   ted, e. g., can go, will go, must go, etc. There are two vbb.
   in the English language which are becoming auxiliaries, but
   which have not developed so far as the other words. That
   is to say, they are used exactly like must, can, etc. in questions
   and negative sentences, but not in affirmative sentences:一
   ::

            Need              Dare              (Can, etc.)
      Ques. Need he go?       Dare he go?       (Can he go?)
      Neg.  He need not go.   He dare not go.   (He cannot go.)
      Aff.  He needs to go.   He dares to go.   (He can go）

   In the affirmative sentence, we add an -s in the 3rd person
   sing., and we do not omit the to. Besides Dare he go? Need
   he go? we can also say Does he dare to go? Does he need to
   go? And besides He dare not go He need not go, we can say

.. _P242:

   He does not need to go! He does not dare to go.

   Notice, however, that to is usually omitted in the following
   negative sentences, even though the phrase dare not or need not
   does not directly occur:--
   ::

      No one need know about it.
      No one dare say a word about it.
      You need tell no one.
      Under no circumstances darehe betray the secret.
      I need hardly tell you that... (hardly=almost not)

   The word please sometimes drops, and sometimes retains,
   the to behind it:一
   ::

      Please ring the bell. Please don't (or do not) forget,
      Please to ring the bell. Please not to forget.

   The words make, bid, etc. will be treated under § 9.91.

   Exercise 76. Transform the following orally. into negative
   sentences and questions, either with do or without do, over .and 
   over again until you can do it quickly without mistake.

   1. You dare to go alone. 4. We necded to show him everything.
   2. They dare to tell me that. 5. Weneed to come too.
   3. You need to be so careful. 6. He needs to be reminded of it,

   (NOTE.--The above sentences are formed for practice only, and
   are not quite idiomatic. In afirmative sentences, dare to is used,
   but always stressed, while need to is seldom used, its idiomatic form
   being have to (须) and not need to. Need in the affirmative is usually
   used in constructions like need something, he needs a book, a pen,
   etc.)

The Participial Phrase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   9.40. The Participial Phrase as Modifier.--The participial 
   phrase is one of the commonest constructions in English, 
   and yet many Chinese students have learnt its name
   without knowing how to use it in sentences. The reason is
   that they have not learnt to distinguish between vbb. expressing 
   an action and vbb. expressing a state or condition. This is
   best illustrated in the sentence: 我站在那儿等着他 (I stood
   there, waiting for him) and its variations. It will be seen in
   the following that the Chinese particle cho (着) serves the
   same purpose as the ending -ing in participles to indicate a
   condition:--
   ::

      我站在那儿等着他。      I stood there, waiting for him.
      我站着等他。            I waited there sitting.
      我坐着等他。            I waited there standing.

   The vb. without -ing is the principalvb. and the vb. in -ing
   (participle) is meant only to help describe a condition. The
   participial phrase is therefore subordinate in relation to the
   main clause, serving as a modifier only. One should learn to
   subordinate the vb. describing a condition and put it into the
   participial form. One could say “I stood and waited," but
   it would be better English to say “I stood waiting there”; if
   it is intended to describe the standing as a condition, one should
   say, “I waited there, standing(in the rain).” The most common 
   uses of the participial phrase are to describe a manner,
   a cause or motive, and to indicate general relationships.

   (1) Describing manner.一

      Making three circles with his chop-sticks, he invited his guests
      to help themselves.

      Paying no attention to what the others said, he went ahead,
      Bruhing everybody aside, he pushed his way into the moband
      kissed the drowned girl.

      Shouting at the top of his voice, he said to them...

      The child returned home, stretching both his hands to his mamma, 
      and dropping his satchel.

      The old man came, numbling something in an undertone.

.. _P244:

   (2) Describing cause or motive.--The words think, believe, 
   mistake, hear, etc., when used as participles, usually describe 
   a state of mind, and therefore help to indicate or explain
   the motive of action.--

      Knowing that the child's case was hopeless, he did not consult
      the doctor but the priest.

      Seeing that there was no more hope, the parents sat quietly in
      despair.

      Thinking that Chinese medicine might help, they sent for an old
      Chinese doctor.

      Believing what the Chinese doctor said, they had high hopes
      again.

      I left Shanghai last Monday, intending to spend a month in Japan 
      (or: intending never to come back).

      Frightened by the news, he came back.

      Failing to carry out his plan, he bought a steamship ticket and
      sailed for Australia.

      Coming from an old French stock, he had his ordinary share of
      pride in the mother country.

   (3) Indicating general relationships,--Participial phrases
   used for this purpose generally stand at the beginning of a
   sentence, as this helps to make the general relationship of
   the sentence clearer.

      Coming back to our first topic, I may say.,,

      Speaking of Chinese art, there are many things waiting to be
      written about it.

      Writing in the Fourteenth Edition of the Encyclopaedia 
      Britannica, he pointed out...

      Having made this point clear, I may go on to...

.. _P245:


   In this connexion, it may be mentioned that the participles
   concerning and regarding, originally belonging to this class and
   serving this purpose, are now generally regarded as prepp.
   Granting, providing and granted, provided are used indifferently
   as conjj.--

      Regarding your note of the 14th, I beg to inform you that...

      Concerning the plan for the new school building, it has been
      proposed that...

      Granting (or Granted) that he didn't know, he should have writ-
      ten to inquire about it.

      I will go, provided (or providing) you send a car..

      Concerning the difference between present and past participles, 
      see §2.33.

   Exercise 77.(A) Form sentences with the following participles 
   describing manner, cause, or motive:--
   ::

      hearing that                     leaving a letter
      seeing that                      planning to
      mistaking the noise              advancing three steps
      wishing to                       waving his hand
      kneeling on the ground           encouraged by
      lying on his face                surprised by
      desiring to drenched             through with rain
      having finished his work         supported by
      determined to                    exhausted through work
      frightened by                    having been told that

.. _P246:

   (B) Learn to subordinate some of the vbb, turning them into
   descriptive participles:--

   1. We sat and talked and forgot that the messenger had been
      waiting outside all the while.
   2. He disappeared early in the morning and left no trace of himself.
   3. He came home at last, and believed that his fiancee was still living.
   4. Correct these sentences and change the vbb. if they are wrong.
   5. He sat and waited there and revui a book.
   6. He furned to me and asked me a hard question.
   7. Heasked the question and pointed his finger at me.
   8. He was supported by thirty young students and rushed on to the stage.

   (C) Translate the following into English, using participles for
   the underlined words:--

   1. 佣妇回来,手里提着一篮的菜。
   2. 她还是不肯再嫁, 希望她的前夫一旦能够回转念头。
   3. 他昨夜还预备功课, 以为（误认）今天为星期一。
   4. 他坐在案前, 用一枝红铅笔改作文。
   5. 他知道（或听见)今天我拿到薪水, 又来向我借钱。
   6. 他们俩一夜不睡, 一直谈到天亮。
   7. 他答应了, 说事做完就来。

   9.41. Misconnected Participles.--Great care should be
   taken with regard to the word (n. or pron.) to be modified
   by the participle. The participie introducing a participial
   phrase ought to modify the subject of the main clause, to
   which the participial phrase is attached. Thus, in--

      Having finished my lesson, I went home.

   the participle having finished modifies the subject of the main

.. _P247:

   clause, 1. It is, however, very easy to connect it up with a
   subject which it logically cannot modify. One might easily
   Say:

      Having finished my lesson, the teacher let me go home first.

   This is wrong because it was not the teacher who had finished
   the lesson. One ought to say, therefore--

      Having finished my lesson, I was allowed by the teacher to
      go home first.

   Exercise 78. Study the following examples, and see why the
   participles are wrongly connected. When it is difficult to make
   the correct participial construction, other forms may be used, e.g,
   “As I have finished my lesson,” or “When he was three years old.”

   1. Being three years old, his father died.
   2. Not knowing the strange town, the guide showed me the
      different places worth visiting.
   3. Having punished them enough already, cannot the prisoners 
      be set free now?
   4. Being desirous to settle the accounts, will you please send me
      the amount due by return post?
   5. Being a movie fan, Colman and Barrymore are his favourites.
   6. Being a despotic ruler, the people disliked him.

   9.42. Absolute Participial Phrase.--A participial phrase,
   as we have seen, always begins with a participle which modifies 
   the subject of the main clause. It is thus dependent on
   the main clause. We may have, however, a participial phrase
   containing its own subject, as follows--

      He being a despotic ruler, the people disliked, him.

      Mr. Watson being too weak to attend the meeting, I went in
      his stead.

.. _P248:

   Such constructions are called absolute participial phrases, by
   which we mean that the participle is not directly connected
   with the subject of the main clause, although the phrase itself
   is still in a subordinate relation to the latter. Further examples are—-

      Weather permitting, we shall go for a picnic on Monday.

      God willing, I shall take care of your mother till the end of
      her days.

      All things considered, he was the best boy in class.

      There were a hundred seventy-two of them, all told.

      There were a hundred seventy-two of them, the spoilt ones excepted.

      You had better all go back, Pan taking up his old work and
      you continuing yours.

      I paid for my friend, he happening to be out of pocket.

      Then we went over the top, the captain leading the attack himself.

      The accused being under sixteen years of age, we should not
      send him to prison, but to the reformatory.

      There being no evidence against him, and he denying the charge,
      we could do nothing.

      Your last check being dishonoured by the bank, I shall have
      to ask you for another one.

      I should not advise you to go to Hangchow now, this being
      the rainy season of the year.

   Notice that in most of these examples, other longer expres
   sions might be substituted, e.g, “if weather permits,” “if you
   take everything into consideration.”

   It should be noted, however, that in the case of partici-

.. _P249:

   ples expressing general relationships (see “3” above), the
   participial phrase feally modifies the general intent of the
   whole sentence, and not the subject of the main clause only.
   Hence, the following examples are correct:---

      (Talking of the football match), who won?

      (Granting that B---- College was defeated), were their men to blame？

      (Granting his honesty), he may be mistaken in his enthusiasm.

      (Allowing for minor deficiencies), the play was on the whole a success.

      (Coming to the question of the proper marrying age), did not
      my father marry at twenty-nine?

      There are thirteen left, (not counting the spoilt ones).

   In all the above examples, it will be seen that the participial
   phrase modifies the main statement as a whole.

The Prepositional Phrase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   9.50. The Prepositional Phrase.--Of all the kinds of
   phrases in English, the prepositional phrase is by far the
   most commonly used. Some examples will suffice to show
   that a great number of the commonest phrases are of this class.
   ::

      at first           at the meeting                   by chance（偶然)
      at last            at Shanghai                      by luck (碰巧)
      at least           at great cost                    on purpose (故意)
      at once            at me, you, him, etc.            after all (到底)
      at the same time   with me, him, it, etc.           in case (倘若)
      at the beginning   by her, him, it, etc.            by turn (轮流)
      at the end         through us, you, them, etc.      in fact（其实）
      at this price      for her, you, me, etc.           in time (及时)
      at this time       (cook) by gas, electricity, etc. for example (例如)
      pt this place      (go)by train, boat, etc.         above all（首先）

.. _P250:

   This is also casily seen from the fact that prepositions, like
   in, at, on, for, to, down, up, before, after, by, through, with,
   without, against, etc. are among the commonest words in
   English, and that every time a prepositicn is used, it forms a
   prepositional phrase (see §2.11 “6”). Besides the above, one
   should also take account of the following extremely common
   compound prepositions:--
   ::

      as to, as for     in view of        for fear of
      on account of     in case of        with reference to
      instead of        in connexion      with with (in) regard to
      in spite of       by means of       in accordance with
      in place of       by way of         on behalf of

   For further examples of the uses of prepositions, see §2.18,
   Exercise 5.

   Exercise 79. Make sentences with the prepositions and prepositional 
   phrases mentioned above.

   9.51. Prepositions for Brevity.--Compare the following sentences:--
   ::

      (a) He died of malaria.
          He died because he had malaria.
      (b) He was convicted of muder.
          He was convicted as a man who had commited murder,

   It will be seen at once that the great advantage in using
   prepositional phrases is that they make the sentences shorter
   and therefore neater.

   Exercise 80. Make the following sentences shorter by using
   prepositional phrases in place of the clauses initalics. Use nn. 
   or vbb. in --ing after the prepp. suggested in brackets.

.. _P251:

   1. There was a row when they were holding the meeting. (at, during)
   2. The student was punished because he came late. (for)
   3. He could not climb the mountain because he had heart trouble. (on account of)
   4. The big Swedish concern collapsed when Krueger died. (at)
   S. He went all the same, although I advised him not to. (in spite of)
   6. Ite went away and did not say a word. (without)
   7. He returned home, taking a train. (by)
   8. I could not come because I was ill. (on account of)
   9. As Reuter has reported, the Japanese have seized the
      customs revenue at Dairen. (according to)

   9.52. Prepositions at End.--In idiomatic and colloquial
   English, as distinguished from pedantic writing, the prepositions 
   are very often left at the end of a sentence or clause.
   “He is the man you are looking for” is more idiomatic than
   “He is the man for whom you are looking.” This is because,
   in. English, the prepositions form with their preceding vbb.
   or adjj. definite phrases with a very definite meaning, like
   look for. In spite of what many grammarians say, a truly natural 
   and idiomatic English style cannot get along without often 
   allowing prepositions to stand at the end of sentences or
   clauses. The following examples of extremely common and
   idiomatic sentences will suffice to show this English tendency.
   ::

      What are you doing that for?
      What are you looking at?
      That will give you something to think about.
      You can never tell what this will lead to.
      Do you think he is a man you can depend on?
      People in famine districts will eat anything they can lay their
      hands on. (“Anything on which they can lay their hands”
      would sound pedantic here.)
      That depends on what they are cut with. (Not “That depends
      on with what they are cut”.)
      Do you know who you are speaking to? (To say “Do you
      know to whom you are speaking” would lose the whole
      force of the question.)

.. _P252:

   Note that in order to avoid leaving prepositions at the end
   in the above sentences, phrases like for whom, with which
   about which will have to beused, and these constructions are
   always awkward and roundabout.

   9.53. But, Than.--“But” and “than” are sometimes
   used, even by good writers, as prepositions followed by pronn,
   in the objective case, as follows:--
   ::

      All but me had fied.
      No one wishes it more than us.

   Now both these words may be used as conjj., and therefore
   but I and than we could also be used. As a rule, one should
   generally avoid using the objective case, where but and than
   could be used as conjj. with pronn. in the nominative case,
   In modern English, the only surely correct susage of than as
   prep. with a pron. in the objective case following is in the
   phrase than whom, as in--

      The occasion called for a man of great wisdom and courage
      like Mr. R---, than whom no one could suggest a better
      candidate for the presidency.

   As a conj, than may have a nominative or objective pron.

.. _P253:

   following, according to the circumstances. In the sentence,
   “They treated him worse than her.” the meaning is “worse
   than they treated her.” On the other hand, “They treated
   him worse than she" would mean “worse than she treated him.”

   9.54. Some Special Uses of English Prepositions.--A
   few peculiar uses of some prepositions may be noted here.
   The use of a preposition in any particular place is purely
   determined by custom and usage, and different languages
   often use different prepositions to express the same meaning
   (see §6.61). Following are some special uses of English prepp.
   worth noting:--

   With, for descriptive phrases.

      He came home a disappointed man, with his business ruined,
      his money gone, his health broken and his self-confidence
      visibly shaken.

      With one of his legs gone, he was still able to go about visit-
      ing his friends.

      I saw a woman walking in the street, with a baby in her
      breast and another child holding her hand.

   With or for +all, meaning “in spite of.”

      With all his experience and technical training, he could not
      build that bridge alone.

      For all his thrift and care in spending money, he still remains a
      poor man.

      For all his charity, Rockefeiler took more from others than he
      has ever given back to the world.

      Mr. F-- may be the owner of this property, for all I know
      (here in a slightly different sense=“as far as I know”).

   Under, denoting an incomplete process.

      The bridge under construction; the question under consideration; 
      the patient under treatment; the project under consideration.

.. _P254:

   To, expressing effect on a person's mind.

      | To my great surprise, he turned up at the last moment.
      | He failed to turn up, to our great disappointment.
      | We found, to our great delight, that the news wasn't true.

   In, describing some part or detail affected.

      | He was blind in the eye; injured in the knee.
      | Chang is weak in algebra.

   On, meaning “immediately after” or “as the result of.”

      | On arriving at the scene, I found..
      | On examination, I found....
      | On second thought, I decided to change the subject.
      | On hearing the news, I went to see the manager.

   On, suggesting a temporary state.

      On the move; on fire; on strike; on leave, on his. best behaviour; 
      on good terms with.

   Through, meaning “by” but suggesting effort.

      | He obtained the job through my infiuence (help).
      | It was through (because of) you that we failed.
      | That was all done through (because of) jealousy (ignorance, carelessness, etc.).

   Exercise 81. Make sentences showing the use of the prepositions mentioned above.

.. _P255:

The Relative Clause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   9.60. The Relative Clause.--The relative clause does
   not exist in the Chinese language, but is one of the most 
   characteristic constructions of English and its allied languages.
   A relative clause is a clause introduced by a relative pron. or
   relative adv. The essence of a relative pron. or adv. is that,
   while it serves its usual grammatical function in the clause, it
   acts'at the same time as a conjunction to connect the clause
   with some preceding word, called its “antecedent.”

   The man (who came here this morning) was my school friend.

   The rel. pron. who serves as a regular pronominal subject
   in the relative clause who to morning, but it acts also as a
   conjunction connecting the clause with its antecedent man. The
   whole relative clause is used to modify the antecedent man.

   In the sentence--

      We came to the room (where the emperorused to study and
      talk with the great scholars).

   we have the rel. adv. where serving as an adv. in the clause
   where to scholars, and at the same time acting as a conj, to
   connect up the clause with the antecedent room.

   The rel. pronn. are who (whom, whose), which, that, as
   (preceded by such, the same, or as) and but (preceded by no
   one, etc.).

   The relative advv. are where, when and why.

   The use of these words will be studied in the following
   sections....

.. _P256:

   9.61.“That”as a Defining Rel. Pron.--It has already
   been stated in §4.61 that, of the three rel. pronn, who, which
   and that, who is used for persons, which for things, and that
   for both. There is a difference, however, between that and
   which in their usage, namely, that that is “defining” and which
   is commentative. It is a difference which is hard always
   to observe and which is not always observed. But the observing 
   of this distinction would always insure correctness
   of idiom, besides making the sentences clearer in meaning.

      | (A) This is the house that Jack built.
      | (B) Jack built this house, which was used for keeping malt.

   In sentence A, the rel. clause defines, or limits, the meaning
   of the antecedent house. The meaning of the main clause
   “this is the house” would be left undefined, if the clause
   “that Jack built” were not added. But in sentence B, the
   main clause--“Jack built this house”---is quite complete in
   meaning, and the adding of the relative clause which to malt
   does not in any way limit its meaning, but only attaches a
   comment to it. The function of that in sentence A is, therefore, 
   a “definig” or “demonstrative” of “determinative”
   function, serving to point out which one, while the function of
   which in sentence Bis “non-defining” or “commentative,”
   and often purely “descriptive.” Further examples follow--

   (A) This is the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that
   Jack built.

      The doctor examines the rat that carries the flea that 
      harbours the germ that infects the poor Indian.

      She was the first Chinese woman that (who) ever took a
      doctor's degree at Harvard.

      The man that you saw this morning is my uncle.

      It is something that can't be done in a few days.

.. _P257:

   (B) He is preaching Confucianism, which is steadily losing its
   influence today.

      Even if you could get the money, which isn't as easy as you
      think, you still would have to find the man to do it.

      So we were forced to stop at the little village, which was
      against our original plan.

      More and more people are beginning to learn English, which
      is becoming very popular in China.

      He asked me to explain to him the art of writing poetry,
      which cannot be taught.

   Many English wrifers use which in the defining sense (Group
   A) also, but to use that in the commentative sense (Group B)
   would be decidedly wrong. Notice that in the B group, the
   relative clause could very well be left out without greatly
   affecting the sentence, whereas in the A group, the omission
   of the rel. clause would make the sentence meaningless.

   The distinction between that and who is still less easy
   to observe, who being used both as a defining and a commentative 
   word, while that is still used for defining only.

      The man who came this morning (defining) was my school
      friend.

      I met Mr. B--, who seemed to be a very decent fellow (com-
      mentative).

   Here that could be used for who in the first sentence, but not
   in the second sentence.

   As a rel. pron,that is always unstressed [ðæt], while
   who and which are usually stressed.

   9.62. “Which” as a Commentative Rel, Pron.—This use

.. _P258:

   has already been illustratcd above. “Which” is thus often
   used for passing comments, reniarks or personal judgments
   on various things. The mastery of this construction therefore
   leads one into ore of the secrets ofa personal literary style.
   A writer like Bernard Shaw, who is full of opinions of his
   own, and has all sorts of comments to make, would use a
   great number of such commentative phrases or clauses. On the
   other hand, a man who usually dces not have much comment 
   to make would not need them, and consequently his
   sentences would have a somewhat bald effect. Below are
   some more examples of parenthetical remarks or comments
   introduced by which.

   The League of Nations, which is a great organization for the
   development of oratory, etc.

   The Japanese violated the integrity of the Chinese Maritime
   Customs, which is the only support for Chinese credit at
   home and abroad.

   Exercise 82.(A) Study the following clauses and see what
   sentences could be constructed to incorporate them.
   ::

      which isn't true
      which isn't quite exact                         
      which is a fact
      which is a pure waste of time                         
      which is a palpably false statement (a lie)
      which is all you want
      which was more than she had expected                                    
      which was an accomplishment of great merit
      which might terrify less courageous people
      which is all nonsense
      which does more harm than good
      which cannot be learnt from books
      which is a question of opinion (i. e., not of fact)
      which is something that cannot be taught 
      which is very questionable
      which is the desire of her parents

.. _P259:

   (B) Translate the above examples and the sentences you make
   into Chinese, and see how often such parenthetical remarks will
   have to be put in scparate sentences. Compare the translation of
   sentences with the that clauses in §9.61.

   9.63. “Which” Modifying Statements.--In the two examples,--

      Yenching, which is probably the best university in China, etc..
      His wife wasn't beautiful, which was a sin he could not forgive.

   which has the n. Yenching as its proper antecedent in the
   first sentence, but in the second, the antecedent of which is
   not the adj. beautiful but the whole statement that “she
   wasn't beautiful,” because it was this fact that her husband
   could not forgive. Another example should suffice—-

      If she pulls through the third week, which is quite probable,
      she will be out of danger.

   It is not the week which is “probable,” but the fact that
   she may pull through the third week.

   9.64. In Which, from Whom, etc.--It is most easy to
   make mistakes in employing the which and who constructions.
   The thing that should constantly be borne in mind is that
   every rel. clause must have such a perfect construction in
   itself that it could be turned into an independent sentence.

.. _P260:

   Thus, the clause which is quite probable may easily be turned
   into a perfect sentence, This is quite probable. But a sentence
   like--

      We came to the room which the emperor used to work.

   is wrong, because we cannot say The emperor used to work
   the room, but have to say work in the room. Hence the sentence 
   should read---

      We came to the room in which the emperor used to work,

   Following are some correct examples:一

      I got a letter yesterday from my sister, from whom I had not
      heard for a long time. (I had not heard from her.)

      We must work for our country, which we all love and in which
      we all believe.(We believe in our country.)

      He ate a lot of indigestible food immediately after his recovery
      from typhoid, than which there could be nothing more dangerous.

      At New York, he met the great composer, with whom he had
      been on most intimate terms years ago when they were
      studying together in Germany.

      We met Mr. Wilkinson, the great novelist, of whom I had
      heard such a great deal.

   Exercise 83. Connect up the following pairs of sentences:--

   1. I brought the girl to see the lawyer. To this lawyer, the
      father had entrusted the care of his daughter.
   2. I brought the girl to see Mr. Yang. Through Mr. Yang,
      she obtained a new position.
   3. Then we changed over to the abolition of extra-territoriality
      in China. A great deal has been written about this (topic).

.. _P261:

   9.65. Which...It, Which..Them, etc.--Another frequent
   source of trouble comes from the writer fo getting whether
   which is the subject or the object in the rel. clause. Some
   common mistakes, with their proper corrections, are given
   below:--

   1. We began to play billiards, which my friend had not played
      `it` for a long time. (It should be dropped, because which is
      already the object of played in the clause.)
   2. The young bride was confronted with a series of new
      problems, which no one had told her about `them`. (Them
      to be dropped: which is already the object of about.)
   3. They showed the two men a letter, which, when we had
      studied carefully, seemed to be written by a woman. (Say
      “when we had studied it carefully,” as which is serving as
      the subject of seemed.)
   4. I gave him a picture which, upon looking at, he recognized
      it to be that of his dead brother. (Say “upon looking at
      it,” as which is serving as the object of recognized: it after
      recognized to be dropped, because which is already the
      object of the verb in the clause.)

   9.66. That...to, That...for, etc.--The characteristic of
   that is that we cannot put a prep. before it as in the case of
   which (in which, for which). Such prepp. are therefore regularly 
   left at the end of the rel. clause.

      The people that you meet with are not always the people you
      wish to meet. (Mect with expresses a casual or unintentional 
      meeting; to meet a person expresses an intentional
      eeeting, as to meet him at the station.)

      There is no sense in continuing a friendship that one nolonger
      cares for.

      I began to realize the financial situation that he had come to.

      The subject that every one was talking about; the piano that
      had not yet been paid for, the debt that he is in; the
      person that he had referred to; the opportunity that he had
      prayed for; the missing letter that he had been worrying
      about, etc.

.. _P262:

   9.67. “That” Used for “in Which,” “for Which,” etc.--
   That may be used instead of in which, for which, etc. as a rel.
   adv. when referring to time, place, way, reason, manner,
   etc.

      The reason that I came is, etc. (Better than for which I came).

      I don't like the way that he looks at me.(That may be
      omitted, see following paragraph. That =in which here.)

      You cannot treat King George with the same familiarity that
      (with which) you treat your younger brother.

      We are in the same position that (in which) he was a year ago.

      The last time that I saw him, he was ill in bed.

   9.68. “That” Dropped.--In idiomatic English, both spoken 
   and written, the rel. pron, that is very often dropped,
   when it is the object in the rel. clause.
   ::

      The books (that) I like.            The fiowers she picked yesterday.
      The people (that) I know.
      The poems he writes.                The man he promoted.
      The things he spoke about.          The business he started.
      The book you mentioned              The car he owned.
      The song everybody is singing.      The cigar I like.
      The child you love.                 The money he left behind him.
      The woman he married.               The class I belong to.

.. _P263:

   The dropping of that in these constructions is entirely in
   consonance with the general English tendency to shorten on
   abbreviate all phrase modifiers (see §9.82).

   9.691. “As” as a Rel. Pron.--Besides the regular rel.
   pronn. who, which and that, there are two other words which
   often serve in the same capacity: as and but. Both these words
   can act as subjects in the rel. clause and at the same time as
   conjj. to connect the clause with an antecedent. The peculiarity 
   of these words is that they usually go with certain other
   preceding words. As is usually used in the phrases such....as,
   the same...as, and as...as.

      Such customers as drifted our way were generally strangers from
      the passing ships.(Subj. of drifted)

      There was such a confusion as might be caused by a theatre panic. (Subj.)

      She did not turn out to be such a good travelling companion
      as we had expected. (Obj.)

      As many men as applied were admitted. (Subj.)

      As many men as we found were taken up into the ship. (Obj.)

      We took in as many men as could be accommodated in the small ship. (Subj.)

      He came by the same route as had been followed by his predecessors. (Subj.)

      A revolution broke out, such as no one had seen before. (Obj.)

   The use of as alone is also quite common:--

      The play, as is well known, is based on a famous novel.

      The ex-convict committed crimes again, as is usual (or, as is to
      be expected), and was arrested again.

      As is often the case; as often happens; as might be expected
      (As often happens, when the patient ustthe nervous type, etc.)

      Many nasty things were said about him, as have been said
      about other people.

.. _P264:

   (NOTE.--Some grammarians have questioned the legitimacy of
   the above constructions, insisting on putting in another word as the
   subj., e.g. “as it is well known” or “as nasty things have been said
   about other people.” Close observation, however, of this particular
   idiom and of the general tendency of English with regard to modifying 
   clauses does not warrant this view. Such constructions as “as is
   well known,” “as is often the case” are far too common and too
   well supported by usage to be easily banished from writing; the
   omission of it in as is well known is moreover in entire agreement
   with the peculiarly English tendency to shorten modifying clauses:
   see §9.82.)

   9.692. “Bur” as a Rel. Pron.-—But as a rel. pron. is always
   preceded by some negative antecedent, usually no one. In
   this connexion, but=“who...not,” “which...not,” “that...
   not.”

      There is no one but knows (=no one who does not know=
      every one knows) about this affair.

      Hardly a man came to the exhibition but was surprised by the
      originality and boldness of his conceptions.

      Not a new man entered politics but was soon converted into
      an official of the old type.

      There is no habit so old but may be cured by a strong will.

   9.70. Relative Advr. “When,” “Where” and “Why.”一
   As a rel. pron. is a conjunctive pron., so arel. adv. is a conjunctive 
   adv., i.e., it serves as an adv. in the rel. clause, but
   at the same time connects the clause with an antecedent. Except 
   for this difference, the construction of the rel. clause itself 
   is exactly similar to what we have been studying in the
   foregoing sections.

.. _P265:

      | Rel. Pron. We saw the man who was a town broker.
      | Rel. Adv. We saw the place where the broker died.

   In the second sentence, where serves as an adv. modifying
   died.

   The place where:--

      We had reached a stage where it was impossible to go any further.

      Business had come to a point where increased sales did not
      mean increased profit.

   (As antecedent-rel. adv. combined):--

      I am where I should be.

      Send him where he will be taken care of.

   The time when:--

      He deserted her at the time when she most needed and deserved his sympathy.

      That was the morning when we had so many guests in the house.

   (As antecedent-rel. adv. combined):--

      He deserted her when she most needed, etc.

      Leave when you like.

   The reason why:--

      The reason why I came is this.

      Let us inquire into the reason why he left in such a hurry.

   (As antecedent-rel. adv. combined):--

      I can't understand why he left.

      Let us inquire why he left in such a hurry.

.. _P266:

   but simply how, or simply the way, or the manner (the way)
   in which:——

      The way (in which) he talked to his inferiors was ridiculous,
      but the way (in which) he talked to his superiors was
      disgusting.

   Wherein, whereof and wherefore (=in which, of which,
   for which reason) are not in common use today except in
   pedantic writing, poetry and legal documents, with the exception 
   of wherefore as a n. in the phrase the whys and wherefores.
   Whereby (=by which) is more commonly used.

      We must think of a means whereby Manchuria may be recovered by China.

   Whenever and wherever are used exactly like when and
   where in their constructions:--

      Leave whenever. you like.

      Go wherever you like.

   introduced by when and while ofien have their subj. and
   finite vb. dropped:--

      When (you are) in doubt, ask for “Capstan.”

Review of Phrase and Clause Modifters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   9.80. Phrase and Clause Modifiers Summarized.--The
   above sections, §9.30 to 9.71, cover the most important
   kinds of phrases and clauses in the English language. They
   are: the infinitive phrase, the participial phrase, the 
   prepositional phrase and the relative clause.

   The infinitive phrase may be used to modify a n. (“a
   lesson to learn"), an adj. ("too proud to learn"), an adv. (“too
   quickly to be seen”), or a whole statement (“To tell you the
   truth, I wasn't there~”). It may also be used as a complement
   to complete the meaning of a finite verb ("began to see").

   The participial phrase is always used to modify the subject 
   of the related clause (“I came, acting as his representative”): 
   The absolute part. phrase has a subj, which is modified
   by the participle, and the whole phrase serves to modify the
   main clause ("He being too weak to go, I went in his stead").

   The prepositional phrase may modify a n. (“the book on
   the table”), or a vb. ("He came from America""On coming
   back, I found, etc.").

   The relative clause may be introduced by a rel, pron.
   (who, which, that) or a rel. adv.(where, when, why). The

.. _P268:

   rel. pron. or rel. adv. always refers to an antecedent. The
   antecedent is in most cases a n.("the man who came”), but
   sometimes it may be a whole statement (“He says that I didn't
   care, which is untrue").

   9.81. Post--Nominal Position of Modifiers.--A result of
   the use of the modifying phrases and clauses mentioned above
   is that, in English, we often have modifying phrases or clauses
   coming after the word they modify. With the exception of
   the participial phrase, which may also come before the word
   it modifies, all these constructions always come after the word
   modified.
   ::

       Inf. A book to read.
      Part. A book selling for a dollar a copy.
       Rel. The book that I like.
      Prep. The book on the top shelf.

   As the Chinese language depends entirely on word-order for
   indicating the relationship between modifier and the modified
   word, this post--nominal position is impossible in Chinese. We
   may say the modified word or the word modified in English,
   but not in Chinese. The Chinese language loses therefore in
   fiexibility in this respect, and the translation of such English
   modifying phrases into Chinese is often cumbersome and
   awkward.

   Exercise 84. Try to translate the following sentences, and
   observe the word-order in the Chinese translation.

   1. This is the dog that worried the cat that killed the rat that
   ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built.

   2. It is untrue that I had borrowed three hundred dollars
   frorn him at five percent interest and that I had agreed to
   pay it back in a year.

.. _P269:

   3. It is for this reason that Japan has become a strong
   country.

   4. I bought up the house on the corner of Kiukiang and
   Fukien Roads, but the house on Szechuen Road was rented.

   5. I sent a letter to Mr. Jen-sen Yang, (of) No. 33, (on)
   Tatung Road, (in) Chungking, (in) Szechuen.

   6. I found an old manuscript on the top shelf of a cabinet
   behind the door in the front room of the third floor.

   7. Omit the second word, line 3, paragraph 4, of Lesson 37.

   8. He is the third son by the second wife of Erh-lao-yeh [二
   老爷] of Chang family.

   9. This was the first book published by the MacMillan Company.

   9.82. Economy in Phrase and Clause Modifiers.---We
   have found that there is a general tendency to make the 
   modifying phrase or clause as short as possible. In certain
   constructions, words are often dropped (ellipsis). The clearest
   examples are:--

      The man (that) I killed. (§9.68).

      I found the handkerchief (that) you lost the other day.

      Don't talk while (you are) working. (§9.71)

      Send it to me, when (it is) finished.

      Give it to me when (it is) ready.

      He dropped in on Monday evening, as (it) was usual, or as
      (it was) usual, (§9.691)

      The reason that (=for which) I came is this. (§9.67) Or,
      the reason (that) I came, etc.

   Notice also such extremely short constructions as all told
   (=if you tell, or count, all), everything considered (=when
   you consider everything), weather permitting (=if weather
   permits), see §9.42.

   This economy of expression in modifying phrases and

.. _P270:

   clauses is natural, because they are logically less important
   than the main clause.

   By means of such economy of expression, the English
   language has attained a greater simplicity and case than the
   German language, for instance.

   9.83. The Nominal Phrase.--The law of economy has
   resulted in another type of phrase very similar to the absolute
   participial phrase mentioned in §9.42.

   a. He was carried into the house, head first (=with his head first).
   b. I can win it hands down (=without trouble).
   c. We walked together, arm in arm.
   d. He was carried into the hospital, his face a mass of bleeding flesh.
   e. The nurse entered the room, pencil in hand, to take down the patient's name and address.
   i. Bit by bit, the patient recovered.

   In each of the above sentences, there is a descriptive phrase
   introduced by a n. followed by a word or phrase modifying it.

   The absolute participial phrase may be considered as
   a special kind of nominal phrase. It differs from the others
   only in having the n. followed by a participle (as weather
   permitting, everything considered).

   9.84. Joining of Pbrases.-- It most frequently happens
   that several rel. clauses or several participial phrases come
   together in a sentence, giving us the which...and which or
   -ing...and -ing construction. Instead of and, sometimes but
   is used. This is a very useful construction and quite simple,
   so long as the writer keeps to this formula.

      Having finished his official business
      and wishing to take a little rest,
      the king returned to the country.

.. _P271:

   The great danger is that the student often uses and which, or
   and --ing, where no and is required at all. The following
   example shows a very common error:一

      We had a most enjoyable picnic party and not returning till sunset.

   Here the and is totally uncalled-for.

   Exercise 85. Straighten up the confused grammatical constructions 
   in the following sentences:--

   1. We were shown the great pearl which formerly belonged to
   the Empress Dowager and looking as big as a greenpea,

   2. We were shown the big pearl which looking as big as a
   green pea.

   3. The pearl had been given by the Empress Dowager to Li
   Lien-ying, and who was her court favourite.

   4. A curio merchant found it sewn onto a silk gown, stolen
   by a family servant, and which was sold to a pawn-shop.

   5. A Japanese soldier entered the curio shop one day, saw
   the big pearl, took the gown away and not paying for it.

Complements as Modifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   9.90. The Predicate Complements.--A predicate consists 
   either of a finite vb. alone or of a finite vb. and anything 
   else necessary to complete its meaning. Thus the object

.. _P272:

   him in I killed him is also considered a complement of the vb.
   killed. In §9.31 “b,” we have also studied the type began
   to see, where the infinitive to see serves also as a complement
   to complete the meaning of began. There are, however, other
   types of complements which serve as modifiers either of the
   subject or of the object.
   ::

      Modifying the subject:--

      (a) He was elected president.
      (b) He grew pale.

      Modifying the object:--

      (e) We made him president.
      (d) I found him sitting alone.
      (e) I made him go.

   In “a” and “c” we have nn. acting as modifiers, and in “b”
   and “d” we have other kinds of words--adjj., participles,
   etc.--acting as modifiers. The case “e” will be treated in
   the following section separately.

   Exercise 86. Study the following carefully and see whether the
   subject or the object is modified by the word or phrase initalics.

   1. He became president (or the president) of the company.
   2. We called him a fool.
   3. We considered him the ablest man of the group.
   4. The work is considered perfect (or finished).
   5. I found him naked and half crazy.
   6. I found the child in a ditch and unable to get out of it.
   7. It is thought best to let him alone.
   8. His wife described him like a fool.
   9. I found her waiting alone in the room.

.. _P273:

   10. This made me furious. 
   11. This turned him crazy. 
   12. He played the fool. 
   13. Boil the egg soft. 
   14. He was made King of Iran. 
   15. He got well.
   16. Make it nice and dainty.
   17. Hang it high in the air.
   18. I found the money gone.
   19. The girl looks very pretty.

   9.91. “I made him go.”--This requires special consideration. 
   Here an action is predicated of the object, and we
   may have the following forms:--

   (a) The action may be passive from the point of view
   of the object, as一

      Have the shoes repaired.

      Have the letter mailed.

      Have the linen sent out to be washed.

      Have a doctor sent for.

      I want to see the building finished.

      I would rather see you damned first.(An impolite form of refusal)

      Keep the money locked in the safe.

   These all suggest or indicate something to be done to the
   object. Hence the past participle is used.

   (b) The action may be active from the point of view
   of the object, in which case the vb. expressing it is put in
   the infinitive. After the vbb. make, let, see and hear, the to
   of the infinitive is regularly dropped, after help and bid, it is
   sometimes dropped and sometimes retained; after all other
   words, like ask, allow, want, command, urge, request, etc.,
   it is always expressed.


.. _P274:
   ::

      (I)   I made him go.
            I saw him go up the stairs.
            I heard him say (not said) that Mr. Liu was ill.
            Why not let him go?
            Let me pass.
            Make him wait outside (pay for it).
      (II)  Help him finish (or to finish) the job.
            This will help pay (or to pay) the week's rent.
            Won't you let me help you do it? (Better than to do it)
            Bid him go (or to go) away.
      (III) Allow him to finish his supper.
            I am not allowed to (doanything).
            I could not ask him to do it.
            Order some food to be brought to my room.

   (c) There is a difference between I saw him go up the
   stairs and I saw him going up the stairs. The former expresses
   an action, while the second expresses a condition, exactly
   similar to sentence 10 in Exercise 86 of §9.90: I found her
   waiting alone in the room.

Ch X Comparison And Degree
--------------------------

Degrees of Comparison: Their Relative Nature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   10.10. The Degrees of Comparison: The Relative Nature.--
   In English grammar, the usually recognized “degrees of comparison”
   of adjj. and advv. are three: positive, comparative
   and superlative, as represented by old, older, oldest, or good,
   better, best. Now these three degrees, it should be clearly
   understood, only refer to the formal endings,-er and -est,
   as regards the change in word-form; in no way do they exhaust 
   the possible degrees of comparison in language, as regards
   its logical content. Logically, there should be at least five
   degrees, namely, old, older, oldest, less old and least old. Thus
   we have:--
   ::

              ╭─ more stupid--most stupid
      stupid ─┤
              ╰─ less stupid--least stupid

   Moreover, there are all sorts of words expressing indeterminate 
   degrees, such as extremely, somewhat, more or less,
   in the actual language. These words are used, not for comparison 
   among several objects, but for indicating degrees in
   a general way, as somewhat in “somewhat tired,” or with
   reference to some assumed standard, as too in too old for
   her, with her as the standard. In this grammar, all such
   expressions and their use will be studied, because they are all
   means of expressing the notion of degree.

   It should also be noted that the comparative and superlative 

.. _P276:

   degrees are used oniy for comparison among several
   objects. A “better”man than AiCapone (American gangster) 
   is not necessarily a “good” man, and a “more honest”
   man than the Minister of Communications may not be a really
   “honest” man at all. This student is “older” than that student,
   comparatively speaking, but, absolutely speaking, neither of
   them is really “old.” So the positive degree (old) is really
   absolute, while the comparative and superlative degrees (older,
   oldest) are relative.

   Thus we come to the conclusion that the “better” man
   is not tetter than the “good” man, and we shall find also
   the “best” man is not really better than the “better” man.
   The “best” man is simply “better” than all the rest. If A
   is thirteen, B is twelve and C is eleven, then, clearly, A is
   only older than B and C, although he is the oldest. And
   then A really is not “old" at all.

   10.11 The “Three Degrees of Comparison."--In English,
   we have the endings-er and --est for the comparative and
   superlative degrees, as in older, oldest, while there are no
   special endings to indicate the degrees expressed by less old
   and least old, which are often expressed by younger and young-
   est. Moreover, the longer words do not admit such endings,
   but are used with more and most. The general rules are:--

   (1) Words of one syllable can always have “-er” and
   “-est.” E.g.--
   ::

      great        broad         new         deep
      greater      broader       newer       deeper
      greatest     broadest      newest      deepest

   Sometimes it is possibie to use the words more and most

.. _P277:

   Thus sound, sounder, soundest is always correct, but we sometimes say,
   “This is a more sound proposition.”

   (2) Words of two syllables sometimes take “-er” and 
   “-est” and sometimes “more” and “most.” E.g.---
   ::

      clever      narrow      happy       lovely
      cleverer    narrower    happier     lovelier
      cleverest   narrowest   happiest    loveliest

      stupid         cunning              learned
      more stupid    more cunning         more learned
      most stupid    most cunning         most learned

   There are no clear rules for this difference, except established
   usage and a vague sense of euphony, which is again based
   on usage. Thus we have cleverer, cleverest, but more proper,
   most proper, and not properer, properest. We might say
   handsomer or more handsome, and commoner or more common, 
   but we could never say cunninger or learneder or honester.
   The -y ending seems always to go well with the -er and
   -est, as dirtier, healthier, crazier, lazier, funnier (but usually
   more sticky and not stickier). The only comparatively clear
   rule seems to be that the endings -able, -ible, -ful, -ing can
   never take on the -er,-est additions. Thus formations like
   laughabler, awfuller, cunninger are practically unknown in
   English. Advv. in -ly (except early) always have “more” and
   “most,” as more rarely, most surely.

   (3) Words of three or more syilables generally take
   “more” and “most,” and only rarely -er, -ast. E.g.--
   ::

      beautiful            convenient           interesting
      more beautiful       more convenient      more interesting
      most beautiful       most convenient      most interesting

      generous             incomplete           comprehensive
      more generous        more incomplete      more comprehensive
      most generous        most incomplete      most comprehensive

.. _P278:

   Exceptionally, however, we do sometimes use -er and -est
   for emphasis, e.g., “This is the confoundedest problem I ever
   came across,” which is more expressive than most confounded.
   Such cases are really abnormal deviations from the regular
   rule for some special reasons of rhetoric.

   NOTE.--When we add the ending -er or -est to words ending
   in -y, we change the y into i, when it follows a consonant, but
   keep it unchanged, if it follows a vowel: thus, happier, lazier,
   clumsier, but gayer, coyer. Phonetically, gayer retains the original
   “long a" sound, which is not lowered as in prayer(=祷文)： gayer
   rhymes with layer (n.), and not with mayor, prayer, there, care. A
   single final consonant preceded by a single vowel is doubled when 
   -er or -est is added to it: thus thinner, fatter, but quicker and
   cheaper.

   10.12. “More Better,” “Next Best,” etc.--Two cases
   are worthy of special mention. In vulgar speech, and among
   Chinese students, the phrase “more better”is often used.
   This is not in accordance with good usage, although it can
   be found in Shakespeare, who also gives us “the most unkindest
   cut of all.” The psychological reason for this mistake is the
   desire for clearness and emphasis.

   On the other hand, the expressions “next best,” “second
   best,” “third best” are perfectly good and very convenient
   forms of expression, equivalent to Chinese 第二好, 第三好.
   English has also the expression the largest but one (two, three)
   equivalent to Chinese 第二大 (第三，第四大) respectively。

.. _P279:

   For emphasis, we have the expressions, the very best, the
   very worst, the very first and the very last. The word possible
   is also often added to a superlative in -est to emphasizeits
   meaning:--

      the best possible man for the job

      the worst possitle combination of fools and knaves

      by the quickest possible route

      at the earliest possible opportunity

      make the greatest possible allowance

   10.13. Superiority, Equality and Inferiority.--We see
   from §10.10 that a more logical division of the degrees of
   comparison should be on the basis of equality or inequality,
   as suggested by Jespersen. On this basis, we should have the
   three degrees:--

   1. (>) older than ..................( Superiority)
   2. (=) as old as ...................(Equality)
   3. (<) less old than ...............(Inferiority)

   Notice that in expressing equality, we use the conj. phrase
   as...as, but in expressing superiority or inferiority, we use
   the conj. than. Instead of the pair as...as, so...as may also
   be used. Moreover, we can put in a n. between the pair, as
   well as between --er...than. E.g.---

      He is as good a player as Morley.

      He is a better player than Morley.

   Very often especially in the colloquial style, the phrase
   introduced by than or as is dropped as being understood.

      But this will do just as well (as that one).

      It is even better (than that one).

      Are they as keen about it (as we are here)?

      But this is just as good an opportunity.

      I don't think you can find a beiter substitute.

      Oh, no, he is not as (stressed) old, but older.

.. _P280:

   Exercise 87. Change the following sentences, using the conjj.
   as...as, or -er(more)...than, with a n. in between.

   1. Mr Harding and his wife are equally great gamblers.
   2. In playing chess, Flexner is better than Harris.
   3. Your correction and the original sentence are equaliy bad.
   4. He and Hopkins are equally fast writers.
   5. Hopkins does not write as fast as Murry.

   The Latin comparatives superior, inferior, prior, senior,
   junior are followed by to and not by than, e.g, prior to
   this event, superior to him in business ability.

   For other than, see §8.20.

   10.14. Implied Comparison.--There are a few adjj. which
   are used only in the comparative and superlative degrees, and
   which cannot be followed by than. These are all words denoting 
   direction: inner, outer, nether, upper, and innermost,
   outermost (outmost, utmost), nethermost (rare), uppermost. We
   say the inner circle or the outer circle, but cannot say “This
   circle is outer than that one.” The comparison is implied.
   Notice that the words in the positive degree for these adjj.
   are all prepp. or advv.-in, out, beneath, up.

   Former and latter also cannot be followed by than: the
   former president, the latter half, but never former than or latter
   than. Latter refers to what comes behind in space, while later
   refers to what comes behind in time: the latter half of the book,
   but the luter period. The superlatives are foremost, first and

.. _P281:

   latest, last respectively. The positive degree is represented
   by regular adiji. fore and late.

   We can say further than this, further than that. Farther
   means simply “more far,” while further means“more advanced
   in a particular direction (further back in history). Notice that
   we say in English further to the east, further eastwards, further 
   to the right, further up, further down (not more eastwards,
   more up, etc.). The proper use of further is shown below:--

      I may further mention...

      And further (=moreover) we must remember...

      I shall inquire further into the question.

      I shall furnish you with further details.

      Shop closed until further notice.

      Furthermore = moreover.

   10.15. Words That Cannot Be Compared.--Certain adjj.
   and advv. are absolute in meaning, and therefore cannot be
   compared. Either a thing is right or it isn't; there can't be
   one thing more right than another. We can say more correct
   or less correct, and more in the right, more in the wrong, but
   not more right or more wrong. This comes from the English
   sense of a sharp distinction between right and wrong, which
   admits of no gradations; contrast the Chinese notions 更非，
   更是(不是). Thus we have:一

      更是= more correct (not more right)

      更非= more incorrect (not more wrong)

      更相同= more similar (not more identical)

      更不同= differs more (not more different)

      更与事实不符= is farther from the truth (not more false)

   Other adjj, which do not admit of comparison both in Chinese 
   and English, do not require special caution. One dead

.. _P282:

   body, for instance, cannot be deader than the rest, nor can
   one piece of ice be more frozen than another.

   On the other hand, we have in English certain comparative 
   forms which do not easily admit of translation into
   Chinese. In both languages, we can say, of course, that one
   is more patriotic than the other. But in English, we can
   even say he is more of a patriot than another, or he is more
   of a patriot than a politician, meaning that he is a better
   patriot than a politician. This is possible from the related
   notion that one can be “a bit of a politician” and “a bit of a
   patriot” at the same time. The comparison is that of the
   man in his two capacities. The latter construction, therefore,
   does not admit of a direct translation, but has to be paraphrased. 
   Similarly--

      That sounds like more of a gamble (than a proper trade).

   The construction more often than not is also rather pecular:--

      (It happened) More often than not, our salaries were deducted
      on account of all sorts of special emergency taxes.

      More often than not, he had to be helped out of his financial
      difficulties at the end of the year.

   10.16. Weakened Superlatives.--In all languages, superlatives 
   have been abused. All merchants claim their goods
   to be “the best.” From the movie advertisements, one gets
   the idea that every film is “the best picture of the year” or
   “the most gorgeous spectacle” or “the most stupendous production” 
   or “played by the greatest galaxy of stars” since
   human history began. The abuse of the superlative is only

.. _P283:

   an exaggerated form of the common habit to use it in a
   loose, and consequently weakened, meaning. Thus in the modern 
   Pekingese dialect, t'ing (挺) has been developed as a
   weakened superlative for the more logical ting (项). T'ing
   hao means very much the same as English “very good” (conveying 
   very little enthusiasm on the part of the speaker), while
   ting hao means “the best.” In English, the word “dearest"
   has probably been very often abused. But quite apart from
   such conventional forms, weakened superlatives are employed
   everyday of our life. Thus we say, “He is a most learned
   scholar,” “We spent a most agreeable evening,” “I read a
   most interesting novel,” or “He was the funniest man I ever
   Saw.” In polite conversation, we also often say “With the
   greatest pleasure” in reply to some request, or “I shall be
   most delighted to see you,” when we mean only “very delighted.”

   Very, although not a superlative, is similarly weakened, 
   and its function is very often more euphonic than logical,
   (like Chinese 很 in 很好，很高，很坏). This has developed
   to such an extent that today, the words many, few, little,
   much, far, near are less commonly used alone than very many,
   very few, very little, very much, very far, very near. That this
   is purely euphonic is shown by the fact that when some other
   adv. is used, very can be very well dropped.

      There are very few, so few, not few people there. (Better than
      “There are few people there.”)

      It is very far, not far, or so far.(But never “It is far,” and
      seldom “It is far from here.”)

      I like you very much.(Never “I like you much.”)

      He eats very little. (Seldom “He eats little.”)

      Very good.(More common than "Good!")
      (Notice we say 这个人很坏, or 坏透了,but never坏 alone.)

Comparison with a Standard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   10.20. Comparison with a Standard.--Instead of comparing 
   several things with one another, we might compare a
   thing with some standard, expressed or implied. Here superiority 
   is indicated by words like too, above, and the prefixes
   over-, hyper-. Equality is indicated by the phrase as...as on
   so...as, and by the adv. enough. Inferiority is indicated by not
   enough and the prefix under-. Both too and enough go with to
   (introducing the standard of comparison) or with for (usually
   introducing a person as the standard).

   (1) Too...to, too...for and allied terms. Notice carefully
   the constructions involved in the following examples and note
   the word or phrase serving as the “standard” for comparison。

      This exercise may be soo easy for you, but it is too difficult
      for me.

      Death is too good for him (--He should be punished by something 
      worse than death).

      Tennis is too strenuous for a man of my age.

      It is too beautiful to be true(=It can't be true).

      I am too busy to attend to this (too busy for that).

      Nothing is too good for his new house.(He wants absolutely
      the very best material to be used).

      For Confucius' taste, rice could never be too white, and mince-
      meat could never be chopped too fine (食不厌精,脍不厌细：
      could never be white enough=the whiter, the better).

      Your gown is too bright-coloured for this occasion.

      I am too tired to work tonight.

      This food is too hot to eat, too hot to be eaten, too hot for me,
      too hot for eating, too hot for me to eat, too hot for comfort.

.. _P285:

   There are also phrases like above normal, above my ability,
   beyond my power, beyond his means (=too expensive for him),
   beyond me(= beyond my ability or my understanding), beyond
   (any) doubt, beyond (any) question. Notice also the prefixes
   which express the Same notion as too: overeat(= eat too
   much, eat more than is good for one's health), oversleep
   (=sleep overtime), overwork, overdo (=go too far in something 
   proper or commendable in itself, as,“Don't overdo it"),
   overreach oneself (=reach out so far that one falls--often
   figuratively)； supernormal, supernatural superhuman, super-
   dreadnought (=warship of the class above Dreadnought),
   superfine (in commercial language,=of extra quality);
   hypersensitive(=over-sensitive), hypercritical(=too critical),
   hypertension (of nerves or blood pressure).

   More than. Besides the usual use in more than two, etc.,
   there are other forms that require more attention. Study the
   following constructions carefully:-
   ::

      (Subject Omitted)
         He eats more than is good for him. (More than what
         is good for him. Regarding this ellipsis, see §9.82.)
         You have taiked more than is necessary.
         I have done more than is required by the law.

      (Object Omitted)
         Heeats more than he can digest. (More than what he can
         digest. The object what is omitted.)
         That is more than (what) I can say. (It is beyond my
         knowledge.)
         He got more than (what) he asked for.
         That was more than (what) he expected.

      (Followed by an infinitive)
         He knows better than to go out alone on such a night.
         I am wiser than to believe that.

      (Followed by an adi.)
         This is more than fine: it is excellent.
         She was more than pretty: she was beautiful.
         He was more than clever: he was a great artist.
         We have more than enough.

.. _P286:

   (2) Enough to, enough for, as...as and allied expressions:--

      There are enough bacilli in this test-tube to kill the whole
      city population.

      This room is hot enough to bake potatoes in.

      In one year, he spent (or she saved) enough to buy three villas.

      This food is just enough for eight people.

      We have enough eggs (or eggs enough) to last us three days
      (or enough for three days).

      There is noise enough to wake up the dead.

      I had enough to do to catch the tram (could barely catch it).

      Enough work for today.

   The construction as...as is entirely unlike anything in Chinese.
   ::

      as soon as possible                 as hot as last summer
      as often as you like                as rich as Baron Rothschild
      as soon as you are ready            as drunk as a lord
      as high as your shoulder            as dead as a doornail
      as heavy as can be borne (cf.       as tall as he (or as he is)
         “more than is good” above)       as interesting as a novel
      as hot as a furnace                 as beautiful as a rose
      as hot as ninety-two degrees        as quick as lightning, etc.

   The use of so..as (followed by a word or phrase) and so...

.. _P287:

   that (followed by a clause) is quite common. They both express 
   a degree of quality defined by the following phrase or
   clause, quite similar in function to the word ieh (得) in 热得
   疼手, 热得头昏，etc.

   Exercise 88. (A) Translate the following into Chinese:--

   1. so hot as to burn your fingers
   2. so hot that one can scarcely breathe
   3. so soon as I can come
   4. so bright as to dazzle your eyes
   5. so big that two can sit in it
   6. so excited that he forgot his appointment
   7. so fat that she could not climb the stairs
   8. so quiet that you could hear a pin fall
   9. so happy about it that she cried

   (B) Translate the following into English, using so ...that, or
   so...as, to describe a degree:--

   1. 我疲得不能走路。 
   2. 我热得不能喘气。 
   3. 那天热得瓶中金鱼都死了。
   4. 日光亮得不能开眼。 
   5. 这机器热得烫手。
   6. 他急得要哭出来。
   7. 他穷得没钱买米。
   8. 他穷得不能付每月房租.

   (3) Not enough, etc. Cases like not hot enough and
   not as hot as differ from the examples given under “2” only
   in having not added. The prefix under- is sometimes used to
   express the idea of insufficiency.

      food is underdone (not cooked enough)

      workman is underpaid (not paid enough)

      photograph is under-exposed (not exposed long enough)

      writer has been underrated or underestimated (not rated orregarded 
      as high as he deserves)

      article is undersized (size is smaller than the normal or than
      what is required)

      man is underweight (weighs less than the normal for his height
      and sex)

Degree of Difference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   10.30. Degree of Difference.--The means of expressing
   the degree of difference between two objects is also worth
   studying. The prep. by is most commonly used in this
   connexion, as may be seen from the following examples :---

      Tom is older than Jim by three years.

      Jim is taller than Efie by an inch and half.

      Busy Bee won (the horse race) by a neck.

      This is by far the best way of meeting the difficulty.
      We won by 2-0.

      I missed the train by three minutes.

      Gold has risen by three points.

      (In the last three examples, comparison is implied.)

   Nn. indicating measures are often used for this purpose
   without any introductory prepp.

      Jim is an inch and half taller than Effie.

      Tom is one pound heavier than Steward.

      She is a year older than her younger brother.

      They are miles 'apart.

      Prof. McMurray is head and shoulders above the rest of the

      faculty in his scholarship.

   Easily the best is also a common expression meaning “by
   far the best.”

   10.31. Indeterminate Degrees.--Most advv. of degree
   belong to this class. They fall roughly into the following
   divisions:一

.. _P289:

   (1) More or less, to a certain extent, rather, somewhat,
   fairly, etc.一

      We did it more or less for fun.

      He is more or less crazy.

      I was more or less disappointed. Or: somewhat disappointed;
      to a certain extent disappointed; rather disappointed.

      To a certain extent he was wrong. In a way he was wrong.

      To a certain extent (to a certain degree), this is excusable. This
      is more or less excusable, or in a way excusable.

      He understands English fairly well.

      We had fairly enough (i.e., enough for practical purposes,
      though not quite enough).

   (Fairly often used by Englishmen as a moderate way of saying “quite.”)

      I was fairly puzzled.

      The opponent was fairly sienced.

      The company fairly went to pieces.

      I was fairly sick of the whole affair.

   (Rather=“somewhat,” “slightly,” “in a way.”)

      I rather think you know him.

      He came rather late.

      I feel rather tired.

      The performance was rather a failure.

      It was rather good.

      The singing fell rather flat.

   (2) A little, hardly, scarcely, barely, ete,---

      I was a little tired, unwilling, angered, frightened.

      He was slightly hurt.

      The little child was not a bit afraid. The big nutw was not a
      bit ashamed. He was a bit proud of his daughter.

      I don't care a bit (a rap, a twopence) what you say.

   (Little is different from a little, being negative in meaning--“not
   much.”)

      He is little known round here.

      The people live in houses little better than hovels.

      You little know how much I suffcred during your absence.

      We had little more than three pounds a week to live on.

      I am little interested in your proposition.

.. _P290:

   (Hardly and scarcely are also negative in meaning--"almost not.")

      Hardly (=almost not) a man turned up.

      We had hardly (=almost no) time to finish the lesson.

      I could hardly believe what he said.

      That is hardly possible.

      There was hardly a soul there.

      I had hardly a penny left.

      I hardly ever (=almost never) see him.

      That is hardly better than what he gave him.

      He is hardly known outside his native town.

   (Scarcely could be used for all these sentences and in any place
   where hardly is used.)

   (Barely-only just," is less negative in meaning than hardly.)
   We had barely （=only just） enough.

      He was barely five feettall,

      It is not barely (=only just) a question of money.

      That is barely possible.

      We had barely five minutes left.

      We had plenty of coal, barely enough rice, but could get no vegetable.

   (3) A lot, very, much, far, considerably, etc.--

      This way of doing it is a lot (lots, far) better.

      We got a lot (lost) more room that way.

      I can tell you something far (a lot) more interesting.

      A is far (greatly) superior to B.

      I am feeling a lot better (or a great deal, a good deal, sometimes 
      a deal better).

      He was to a great extent responsible for the failure.
      After ten o'clock, the patient felt considerably better。
      M---- was far too clever for him.

      noticeably affected        tremendously successful
      remarkably clever          exceptionally beautiful
      markedly improved          incomparably the best

   Difference between “very” and “much,” Very is usually 
   used with adjj. (very ill, very good, very interesting); while
   much is usually used with past participles (much pleased, much
   influenced, much improved, much destroyed, or very much
   pleased, etc.). Much is also used with the comparative degree 
   (much better, much greater, much more difficult). Butthere
   is a class of past participles which are so much used that they
   have practically become adjj. Thus we can say I feel very
   tired, but never I feel much tired (cf, a very tired look on
   his face). The difficulty is that usage varies extremely in this
   respect and the line of distinction between the past participles
   that can be used as adjj. and those that cannot is very
   difficult to draw. Unless one is sure that very is correct,
   much should be used before past participles. Very (besides
   much) may be safely used with pleased, delighted, surprised,
   worried and frightened when these words are not followed by
   by. In the latter case, they are really used as past participles
   in that particular connexion. When in doubt, greatly may
   be substituted.

   On the other hand, adjj. which can beused only predicatively 

.. _P292:

   (after the nn.) and never attributively (before the
   nn.) generally go with much and not very. E.g,, I am very
   much afraid (one cannot say a very afraid man) | He is very
   much like his father, very much behind the others | They are
   very much alike.

   Exercise 89. Fill in the word very or much (or very much)
   in the following blanks:--

   1. I shall be __________ pleased to see you.
   2. A ___________ celebrated writer was present at the meeting.
   3. After years of absence, he found his wife ________ changed.
   4. The sale has been _______ increased through this new method.
   s. While in Paris, he was _______intiuenced by one of his fellow-students.
   6. He was _______ worried about the affair.
   7. He was _______ surprised to find only three men in the room.
   8. The picture was _______ admired by many visitors.
   9. The professor cut the tail into two, and placed them _______ apart.
   10. After two weeks' rest, his condition was _______ improved.
   11. I hear a _______ exaggerated story.
   12. The story has been ________ exaggerated by him.
   13. I feel _______ concerned about it.
   14. He was _______ disappointed by her absence.
   15. Lucy went home alone. _______ disappointed.

   (4) Quite, almost, principally, largely, wholly, partly
   etc. Largely means “for the greater part” (大半,多半), while
   greatly means “very much.” Principally, chiefly, and largely
   mean about the same thing. Wholly, entirely, complerely and

.. _P293:

   perfectly are used with both desirable and undesirable qualities 
   or conditions, while utterly and totally are usually
   restricted to undesirable qualities or conditions, and all these
   words are opposed to partly. Absolutely is opposed to
   relatively or comparatively. Some examples follow:--

      decidedly            tremendously            knowingly

   after the models given under “3” above.

   (5) Not too, none too, not over, not altogether, etc.
   English dislike of being over-demonstrative and the English 
   avoidance of superlatives as a matter of good form have

.. _P294:

   resulted in the frequent use of negative or reversed expressions
   (cf. §3.45). Thus “very unhappy” is often expressed by
   not too happy, and very unpleasant is often expressed by not
   (none) too pleasant. This form has now been often used to
   express undesirable qualities, and always savors of disapproval.
   Thus Not too clever is often used to express a warning
   against, or disapproval of, a stupid act. Further examples
   are:一

      He was none too pleased about it.

      He went as ordered, but was none too quick about it.

      I am not over-hopeful about the situation.

      They didn't get along too well together.

      He wasn't over-happy about the whole affair.

      I didn't have too much money to spend for such idle purposes,

      Don't be too sure about it.

      I wasn't over-enthusiastic about it from the very beginning.

      This was not altogether an easy task (a success).

      She was not altogether unwiling(was, in fact, quite willing)。

   10.32. Limitation,--We have already learnt the use of
   as...as in §10.20 “2.” A slightly different sense of limitation 
   with reference to the degree of quality is suggested by
   such expressions as the following:---“I am willing to go so
   far and no farther,” or “He will stay as long (or solong) as his
   finances will permit.” The idea is that up to a certain point
   the degree of quality or action is admitted. The most typical
   example is the English phrase as far as...is concerned.

      As far as I am coneerned, you can go anywhere you please.

      As far as the accused are concerned, it is up to the court to
      settle the question.

      As far as the creditor is concerned, the debt must be paid.(He
      does not care how the money is obtained to pay it.)

      As far as the question of international debts concerns the
      United States, the problem is whether to have all the
      gold flow to America or to have her trade revived.

.. _P295:


   Note also the following phrases:--

      As far as I know, nobody was in the room this morning.
      I will take up the matter as far as I am able to.(To the best
      of my ability.)

      He took down as much of the conversation as he was able to
      understand (and left unrecorded what he could not understand.)

      Stretch your arms as far as possible.

      Eat as much as you can.

      She was as good a mother as could be.

   So long as and inasmuch as are other phrases indicating
   this kind of limitation. Like the adv. of degree the in
   “The sooner, the better” (see below §10.33), these phrases
   also bring in the idea of a causal relationship.

      So long as you persist in your old ways, I cannot give you any money.

      So long as there is no political stability in China, industry
      can not be developed.

      Inasmuch as you know the story already, I will not tell it again.

      You shall be forgiven this time, inasmuch as you realize your error.

      Mr. Chen ought to be consulted, inasmuch as he is paying the money.

      In so far as this matter concerns all of us, we should take a
      united action.

      In so far as you were responsible for the starting of this
      scheme, you ought to pay more for it than the others.

.. _P296:

   10.33. Cumulative Degrees.--Another type of ideas is
   expressed by such expressions as He is getting better and
   hetter, where not any one definite degree but rather a progressive 
   series are indicated. This is sometimes suggested by the
   word gradually (逐渐) alone, as Judaism gradually went out
   of existence in China, but sometimes by such phrases as
   smaller and smaller, weaker and weaker, poorer and poorer.
   Some examples follow:一

      While he was growing richer and richer, his country was becoming 
      poorer and poorer.

      The attacks (of epilepsy, melancholia, etc.) became more and
      more frequent.

Choice and Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   10.40. Choice and Comparison:“Had Better” and “Would Rather.”--
   There is a difference between choice (between two

.. _P298:

   different things or qualities) and comparison (between different
   degrees of the same quality). When I say,“I like apples
   rather than pears,” it means I like apples, and really do not
   like pears; but when I say,“I like apples more than pears,"
   the meaning is that I like both, but am fonder of one than
   of the other. Thus we may also state a choice or consideration 
   of two opposi te qualities. When we say, “This is deep
   brown rather than yellow," the question is whether the thing
   is yellow at all, not whether it is more yellow or less yellow
   than another.

   Would rather. The word rather is most frequently used
   for stating two different qualities or courses of action. In
   referring to actions, would rather is the regular form used,
   while had rather is also allowable. In most cases, an infinitive 
   without to is used after than. Observe the tense and 
   construction of the following examples carefully:一

      I would rather die than surrender.

      He resigned rather than stifle his conscience.

      Dying rather than surrender (=dying-rather-than-surrender)
      was the decision of every one of the garrison.

      Rather than undertake to keep three Russians at Shanghai under 
      surveillance, the Municipal Council deported them.

      He would rather have died than refused (infinitive with have
      omitted; not past tense).

      I would much rather not go.

      Use soft water rather than hard.

      He showed the desire to seem clever rather than honest.

      I had rathererr with Plato than be right with Horace.

      I had (or would) rather not say anything about it.

      I would rather leave the posts vacant than fill them with
      inferior men (宁缺毋滥)。

.. _P299:

   Had better, followed by an infinitive without to is a common 
   form used in offering advice. It indicates a course of
   action in preference to some other course. Prefer is also
   often used for indicating choice between two things or courses
   ofaction (prefer something more desirable to, and not than,
   something less desirable). Some examples follow:—-

      Don't you think you had better go home now?

      You'd better run along.

      You'd better find out what he is doing.

      He preferred the English to the French,

      She prefers working to begging.

      He prefers water to wine.

      X prefers Egyptian cigarettes.

      Y prefers to stay (would rather stay than go.)

      Z prefers to be leftalone.

      I prefer to say nothing about it.


      Noulens preferred to die of starvation rather than submit to
      this treatment,

Comparison and Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   10.50. Comparison and Case.--A comparison always.
   requires at least two things to be compared. It is important
   that we make clear to ourselves what are the things thus
   compared. When we say,“She loves him more than the
   child," the comparison may be between the lady and the
   child (more than the child loves him) or between the husband
   and the child (more than she loves the child). Fortunately, when
   a pron. is used, the meaning is made clear through the case
   of the pron.---She loves the child more than he (loves the child),


.. _P300:

   She loves the child more than (she loves) him. See the
   meaning implied in the following:一

      You could do it better than I.

      I could talk French as well as he.

      There is no better man than he to take up this job,

      They were admiring the Queen rather than Confucius.

      The remark was intended for him rather than me.

   Notice also the persons or things that are compared in the
   following:--

      Matthews wrote a longer essay than mine.

      Her dress is a prettier pink than my wife's.

      Your house is better situated and has bigger windows than mine.

      These stories are quite as interesting as those written by Andersen.

      The climate of Shanghai is not so damp as that of Hongkong.

      The grammar of the Chinese language is quite different from
      that of Japanese.

      His was a newer hat than Mr. Johnson's.

      The arms of the chimpanzee are longer than those of man.

   Exercise 92. Correct the following sentences, or decide which
   of the words in italics shall be used, as properly indicating the
   person or object compared:一

   1. I smoke more cigars than him (he?).(Can one smoke him?)
   2. The leaves of the orange--tree are smaller than bananas.
   3. The goods at Wing On are cheaper than Sincere.
   4. The Chinese can roast ducks better even than France.
      (Can France be roasted?)
   5. Mrs. Davis is a taller woman than Mr. Davis.
      (Compare the height of the twopersons.)

.. _P301:

   6. My child is older than you (yours?).
   7. The cat has sharper claws than you.(Compare the cat's claws with your finger-nails.)
   8. Her rooms are better furnished than I (me? mine?).
   9. The distance between Shanghai and Nanking is greater than Hangchow.
   10. The skin of Chinese women is, as a whole, finer and smoother than foreign women.
   11. The charges for printing English books are higher than Chinese books.
   12. The period of infancy of human beings is longer than the donkey.

Ch XI Aspects Of Acticn
-----------------------

Choice and Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   11.01. The Study of the Verb.--The study of the vb.
   and its changes has been often regarded as the most important, 
   and perhaps the most difficult, part of grammar. It is
   true that the vb. is the most important word in any sentence,
   because it is the vb. which gives life to the whole sentence and
   connects the parts up in a logical whole. Compare, for
   instance, She is picking roses in the garden, which gives us a
   satisfactory mental picture, with She roses in the garden,
   where the succession of images is dead and unrelated.

   Undoubtedly, also, the vb. undergoes more changes
   and requires more careful handling than any other part of
   speech (compare, for instance, the relative stability of the n.)
   Just as an action has more complicated relations than an 
   object or a quality, so a vb. is subject to more variations than
   a n. or an adj. An action immediately presupposes some one
   who does it (the subject of the action), and it may easily
   affect some one else or some particular thing (the indirect or
   direct object). Then, an action always takes place in time,
   whereas an object or quality does not necessarily involve a
   time-notion. Finally, the action itself may be of the most
   various kinds, whether active or passive, continuous or 
   completed, real or supposed, etc.

   In usual grammar books, the vbb. are divided into three
   classes, transitive, intransitive and auxiliary; each transitive

.. _P303:

   vb. may have two voices, active and passive; each voice may
   have somany moods, like interrogative, indicative, imperative
   and infinitive; the indicative and interrogative moods again may
   have so many tenses, present, past and future, and so many
   subordinate tenses, like present simple, present perfect, 
   presentperfect continuous, etc.

   In this book which is based on notional principles, the
   vb. will be studied mainly under four heads:(a) the Aspects
   of Action (Chap. XI),(b) Transitive Action, especially the
   relationships of the subject and object (Chap. XII),(c) the
   Time of Action (Chap. XIII), and (d) the verbal moods, or
   Fact and Fancy (Chap. XIV). Thus, except the relationships
   with subject and object, and the notions and expressions of
   time and mood, all the other changes will be covered under
   the term “Aspect.”

   11.02. What is an Aspect?*--An “aspect” of action
   means a class of action. Actions, naturally, may be divided
   into different classes. Thus--

      repeat, reiterate, return, recover, regait

   [*] The word “aspect"' is a term much used by grammarians in the
   comparative study of Indo--European languages, but except in the
   Slavic languages, where the word has a definite meaning, the term
   has been used to denote the most difterent things. Grammarians have not
   been able to agree, and it is not necessary to agree, how many aspects
   should be distinguished and labeiled in the ideal language. This is
   because certain verbal aspects are recognized in some languages and
   totally ignored in others. In the study of any one particular language,
   however, it is entrely possible, and extremely necessary, to note the
   aspect-notions in that language.

.. _P304:

   belong to one class of action, in so far as they have all one
   aspect in common, i.e., all the actions consist in doing
   something over again or in going back to some thing. The
   same action or actions may be classified according to different
   aspects. If we take the word repeat, we may look at it from
   another aspect, and say that it is a transitive vb. in having
   the action extended to some object, as repeat a song. In
   this aspect, repeat may be classified with other transitive vbb.
   like kill (a man), tell (a story), eat (some food), which are
   different from intransitive vbb. like go, come, rest, sleep. Thus
   the consideration whether an action is transitive or intransitive
   may be considered an aspect-notion. Again, actions may be
   considered as of long duration (know, remember, love) or of
   short duration (learn, remind, fall in love). Or an action may
   be active (I tell a story) or passive (I am told). There is
   also a distinction between habitual action (I smoke a pipe)
   and simple present (I am not smoking today). Thus the same
   action and the same vb. may belong to different “aspects” or
   classes. Some aspects are determined by the nature of the
   vb. itself (transitive--intransitive), others may depend on how
   it is used (active--passive) or on tense-modifications (perfect-
   continuous).

   In every language, certain aspects of action are clearly
   recognized. Without making clear to oneself these aspect-
   notions, the properuse of the vb. will never be really 
   understood, in spite of the clearest conjugation tables.

   Take, for instance, the English distinction between I
   wrote and I have written. This is usually classified as a tense-
   distinction, but the important difference is not one of time,
   but of aspect. Back of this formal distinction is the aspect-

.. _P305:

   notion, whether an action is regarded in itself (I wrote) or
   with reference to its result (I have written). The important
   thing is to realize the aspect-notion behind these formal
   changes.

   11.03. The English Verbal Aspects.--The important aspect-
   notions in English that should be carefully studied and fully
   understood are the following. 

   (1) The difference between action and condition.
   (2) The difference between transitive and intransitive action.
   (3) The difference between active and passive aspects ofaction.
   (4) The difference between completed and uncompleted action.
   (5) The inceptive, continuative and cessative aspects, or the 
       beginning, continuation and end of action.
   (6) The difference between durative (lang-time) 
       and punctual (short-time) action.
   (7) Habitual action.
   (8) Tentative action.
   (9) Miscelianeous minor aspects showing causative, reiterative, 
       reflexive and reciprocal action.

Action and Condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   11.10. Action and Condition.-The first and most important 
   distinction of aspect is the difference between action
   and condition. It is true that I am recovering(from illness)
   is in the “present continuous tense” and I have recovered is
   in the “present perfect tense.” But it is not true that the 
   difference between I recover or recovered on the one hand, and
   am recovering or have recovered on the other, is a difference
   oftense. The real difference between the two is one of
   aspect, namely that while recover (-ed) denotes an action as
   such, am recovering and have recovered denote, not an action,
   but a condition.

.. _P306:

   Chinese students continuously confuse the two aspects,
   and employ the action-aspect far too often, where really the
   condition-aspect should be used. Thus one often hears such
   remarks as You play with fire, which is highly un-English.
   The idea is to indicate the condition that you are playing with
   fire. Such mistakes are extremely common.

      He comes here,(Say is coming)

      You make a great mistake.(Say you are making, or have made)

      He deceives you.(Say he is deceiving, or has deceived)

      I consider this question now.(This is an impossible sentence:
      say I will consider or am considering)

      You fool me.(Say you are fooling)

      The child plays alone in the room upstairs.(Say is playing)

      I do not smoke this week.(Say I am not smoking this week)

      I do not see anybody today.(Say I am not seeing)

      I stay at the Y. P. S. Hotel.(Say I am staying)

      I must go.(Say I must be going)

      He gets better now.(Say he is geting)

      He suffers from a headache.(Say he is suffering)

   One may question why the fact that I must be going
   should be expressed as a condition and not as an action. But
   it is exactly this peculiarity in English ways of thinking that
   should be noted. To a very large extent, the present 
   continuous has supplanted, or is supplanting, the present indefinite,
   whose use is being gradually limited. The fact is, an action
   often covers a long period of time, so that the action becomes
   a condition, for which the continuous or the perfect is more
   suitable. Hence a sentence like I stay at Y.P.S. Hotel or I
   do not see anybody today (present indefinite) does not, in the
   English way of thinking seem to accord with the truth. The

.. _P307:

   use of I stay and I do not see seems to indicate only an
   action lasting a short moment. I am staying (pres. continuous)
   at that hotel not only at this moment, but also this morning
   and this evening. And if I do not wish to see any visitors
   today, I am not seeing (pres. continuous) them not only at
   this moment, but also in the morning and in the afternoon.

   The present indifinite is, therefore, used chiefy in three
   connexions. First, to suggest habitual action: as Do you play
   tennis?| He smokes. Secondly, in general statements: as The
   earth moves | The moon waxes and wanes The results depend on
   your own effort | The balloon goes up by its own weight or 
   lightness | It pays to advertise | As soon as the vessel is filled, 
   it topple over. In all these examples, really no present action is
   indicated. Thirdly, where the vb. itself is sufficient to 
   indicate a long duration. Many vbb. are of this nature: know, feel,
   realize, think, understand, fear, hate, love, like, live, be, remain,
   etc. E.g., He knows (feels, sees, realizes) his mistake I I think
   you ought to go | I understand what you mean | I fear you are
   wrong | I hate to go alone | He intends to come back | You gorget
   that you owe him a debt of gratitude I Where do you live? |
   That is a mistake| That remains to be proved.

   Notice that the passive voice invariably indicates a condition 
   and not an action as such: He is killed | The watch is lost I
   The jar is broken | I am told | You are not allowed | He is greatly
   respected, etc.

   It may be said that the tenses formed with the auxiliaries
   to be and to have are invariably used to indicate a condition
   rather than an action.

   The past indefinite (e.g, He took away my umbrella | We

.. _P308:

   won | This happened) is naturally used more freely than the
   present indefinite, because most actions belong to the past.
   A thing either happened some time ago or is happening now.
   That is why the past indefinite is used as much as the present
   continuous.

   11.11. Being and Doing. Among all the English vbb.,
   the vb. to be occupies a very special position. It may, in
   fact, be considered a class in itself, possibly with similarvbb.
   denoting the process of becoming, like become, grow, get, turn.
   While the vb. to be states what the subject is, all the other
   vbb. state what the subject does. This is especially clear in such
   sentences as:--
   ::

      (Doing)  He told me to go alone. That was what he did.
               You left the party in the middle of the dinner. You
               oughtn't to have done that.
               You are the only person who likes sour things. All the
               others don't.
               Some people go to church, and some don't.

      (Being)  Some people are sensitive to such remarks, others are not.
               He was afraid to go alone. Indeed he was.
               (For further examples of this difference, see §3.40)

   The consequence of this distinction is that while the vbb.
   of action may have objects, the vb. to be can never have an
   object, but only a complement to complete its meaning (It
   is important | He is dead | He is my son). Consequently, when
   a pron. follows the vb. to be, it is put in the nominative, and
   not the objective case.

      It is I.

      This is he who started the trouble.

      Who is it?

      If it wasn't he, it was somebody else.

.. _P309:

   Also, while we can use the auxiliary vb. do with any other
   vb.(does not go, does not wish, does not have), we cannot use
   it with the vb. to be (does not be is unknown).* The vb. to be
   is simply not regarded as avb. of action. The Chinese 
   translation of tung-tz'ŭ (动词) for “verbs,” therefore, fits in with
   all vbb. except the vb. to be. In German, the vb. is called a
   “time-word” (Zeirwort) which is, in this respect, more satisfactory.

Transitive and Intransitive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   11.20. Transitive and Intransitive Vbb.--This is the usual
   and the most important classification of vbb. In usual grammars,
   vbb. are divided into the three classes:（1) Transitive,（2）
   Intransitive and (3) Auxiliaries. The distinction is so important 
   that all dictionaries indicate whether a vb. is transitive
   (“v.t.”) or intransitive (“v.i."), for without knowing this, the
   vb. cannot be employed correctly. The essential difference is
   that a v.t. takes an object, but an v.i. does not. In terms of
   the aspect-notion, the difference is that, with a v.t., the
   action passes to another object, while, with an v.i., it stops
   with the subject. Following are some interesting pairs of
   vv.i. and vv.t.--
   ::

      INTRANSITIVE               TRANSITIVE
      I fall down.               I felled a tree.
      I rise from bed.           I raise my pencil.
      I lie in bed.              I lay the book down.
      He was sitting there.      He set his foot on England.
      He looks round.            He sees something.
      Helistens carefully.       He hears the order.
      You are talking.           Can't you say something?
      Speak!                     I have nothing to say.

   [*] Auxiliaries like must and can also do not admit do, but they
   are not declinable. The vb. to be is the only declinable vb. that 
   cannot go with do.

.. _P310:

   Other examples of vv.i. are: live, run, go, come, fly, swim, walk,
   sleep. The important thing to remember is that an v.i. cannot
   directly govern an object, while a v.t. can do so. Thus we say
   see (v.t.) the water and enter (v.t.) the garden, but we cannot
   say swim (v.i.) the water or walk (v.i.) the garden.

   Many vbb. are transitive in one particular context and
   intransitive in another, and in these cases the difference in usage
   should be carefully observed. Thus swim and walk are 
   generally vv. i., but we may nevertheless use them as vv. t. in
   the following phrases: swim the channel, swim one's horse
   across, walk the hospital(=be a medical student), walk the
   plank (= walk blindfold into the sea over a plank on pirate
   ship's side), walk the street (=be a street-walker). Again, we
   may say: talk a language (English, French), talk philosophy, talk
   nonsense, but we cannot say talk a story or talk this sentence.

   Study closely the different usage of the samevb. as v.i.
   and as v.t. in the following, and note that often such
   difference in use depends entirely on its association with a
   particular word or phrase:—
   ::

      INTRANSITIVE                     TRANSITIVE
      I am sure he drinks.             Let's drink his health.
      He can't eat now.                He will eat anything.

.. _P311:
   ::

      You talk too much.               Don't talk nonsense.

      Do you sing?                     Sing a song for us.

   It will be noticed that, of the two in each pair, the intransitive 
   usually has a more general meaning, often referring
   to a general habit or ability: drink= have the habit of drinking
   wine, speak=give a speech, float=have the ability to float,
   run=have the ability to run, write=be a writer, believe=
   be a believer in Christianity, sing= have the ability to sing.
   The transitive use, on the other hand, is always more limited
   or more concrete, on account of its being definitely associated
   with an object.

   Note also the difference between consult a person (请教
   某人) and consult with a person (与某商议)/also meet a person
   (路上遇人), and meet with an accident(遇见某事; 出事), plan
   meets with success (计划成功)/know a person(认识某人) and
   know of a person (闻名而未见面)/shoot a person（枪毙), but
   shoot at a person or thing (向某人或某物射击).

   11.21. Intransitive Vbb. and Prepp.--Notice, however,

.. _P312:

   that the difference between an v.i. and a v.t, is often purely
   syntactic, with sole reference of the verb's ability or inability
   to take an object directly. An v.i. cannot have an object, but
   may have a prep. phrase modifying it. Thus, we cannot say
   He comes the room, but we can nevertheless say He comes
   into the room. Actually He comes (v.i.) into the room is the
   same as Heenters (v.t.) the room, and He was looking (v.i.) at
   the game is the same as He was watching(v.t.) the game. Still,
   grammatically speaking, the intransitive actions of coming and
   looking are not supposed to have passed into the object directly, 
   whereas the transitive actions of entering and watching
   are.

   Owing to this difference, vv.i. are most frequently associated 
   with definite prepp., so much so that the v.i. and the
   prep. often form a phrase with a very definite meaning. Thus
   look at means to watch, look upon (it as shameful, as a failure)
   means to regard, look up to means to respect, look down upon
   means to despise, look into (a company's accounts) means to
   examine, and look for means to search. From the student's
   point of view, the important thing is to observe the prep. 
   associated with any v.i. and the new meaning which is thus 
   developed. A good dictionary should always indicate what
   prepp. are used in what connexion.

   The Pocket or Concise Oxford Dictionary always indicates
   clearly the prep. to be used in any particular connexion, and less
   clearly the transitive or intransitive use of the vbb. An illustration,
   with explanations, is given here, so that the student may derive
   full benefit from the use of these dictionaries. E. g, under dig,
   we are told (words in brackets [ ] are added for explanation):--
   “v.i. & t.” [v.i. and v.t.]...“Turn up (soil) with spade or other
   implement or claws &c.” [v.t., because 'soil' is put in parentheses}...

.. _P313:

   “d.[=dig] the soil (down, deep, &c.)” [v.i, because 'the soil' is
   not put in parentheses]...“make (hole &c.) thus" [the fact that
   'hole' is put in parentheses shows we can say 'dig a hole,' therefore
   v.t.]...“bring (buried object) up or out thus” [v.t.]...“make way
   into &c. thus"[v.i., we can say 'dig into']...“thrust (one's nails,
   point) into something or in” [v.t., we can say 'dig his nails into
   something’ or 'dig it in']...“(fig.)[figuratively] make search (for
   facts &c., into documents &c.) or find out by search” [we can
   say 'dig for facts,' 'dig into documents,' both vv. i., but we can
   also say 'dig something out,' v.t.].

   The student should therefore always make a mental note
   of the particular prepp. used in certain particular senses.
   Following is a selected list of some of the more useful or
   interesting combinations:—
   ::

      care for person or thing               in cloth, dry goods, etc.
      touch upon a topic (mention)           hear of news, accident

      consist of parts, in doing             bask in person's favour, popularity, in sunshine
      desist from some attempt
      refrain from bad language              play at being a poet
      refrain from doing                     pass for her husband (pretend to be)
      shrink from something objectionable    confess to a feeling, a fault
      laugh at person or thing               dispose of subject, person
      laugh over some joke                   apply to person for permission
      live on food, fruit, etc.              subscribe a newspaper, but
      live on certain income                    subscribe to fund, to a view, theory
      live for object in life 
      deal with person, with subject,        thing admits of no delay 313

.. _P314:
   ::

      agree to suggestion, with person, on some point
      look over lesson
      talk over matter
      glance through a book, at a person
      think about subject, of someone absent
      reflect upon subject
      quarrel with person, at some point, on some topic
      remonstrate with person

      crave for, long for, person or object
      despair of object
      aim at goal
      comply with request
      argue with person, about topie, against opponent
      correspond with person, but to analogous part or parallel
      abstain from drink, etc.
      what becomes of person? (what has happened to him?)
      object to proposal
      proceed with business
      count on, rely on, reckon on, dependon, support
      matter calls for attention
      yie!d to person or his demands
      indulge in bad habits.
      plunge into water, new subject, new business
      linger at or around a place, over subject of discussion
      cry over spilt milk
      jump at conclusion
      chase after bandit, girl
      call on person

   The above list gives only intransitive vbb. with their prepp.
   Adjj., participles and nn, also have their peculiar prepp.
   Sometimes two cognate words may require different prepp., as
   derogate from but derogatory to a person's reputation. Other
   words may require no prep. as vv. t., but require a prep. as

.. _P315:

   nn., e.g. prefer something, but shows preference for desired
   object | This precedes that, but This takes precedence of that |
   consider the poor man, but show consideration for the poor |
   dislike a person, but conceive a dislike to or for a person or
   thing.

   11.22. Intransitive Vbb. Used Transitively.--There are
   certain cases where an v.i. is used transitively. These are
   different from the cases discussed in §11.20, where the vb.
   is used as a v.t. in certain connexions, and as an v.i. in other
   connexions. Here we are discussing certain vv.i, used in some
   definite ways so that they still keep their meaning as vv.i,
   but can apparently have an object.

   (1) First, we have cases like dream a dream, die a natural
   (an easy) death, smile a (sweet) smile and sleep the sleep
   of the just (i.e, sleep soundly like men without worry), where
   we do not have a real object, but what is really a repetition
   of the vb.

   (2) Secondly, we have phrases like smile consent or
   acquiescence, which means to express consent or acquiescence
   by a smile. The consent is not “smiled,” but is really only
   expressed by a smile. Other cxamples are:--

      She looked her consent.

      He looked the thanks he could not express.

      He said nothing, but looked all love and sympathy.

      Mr. Astor said nothing, but laughed dissent (showed his dissent
      by a laugh).

   (3) Thirdly, and this is the most interesting type, we
   have cases like sleep the day away, talk the night away, cry
   one's eyes out and talk the horse's hind leg off. Notice that

.. _P316:

   in all these examples, the idea of until is understood (cry
   until one's eyes are out, and talk until the horse's hind leg is
   off). These may, therefore, be considered as one of the many
   ways for achieving economy in the English language. Notice
   that, in all the following examples, the object is some n. or
   pron.(often oneself) affected by the action, followed by some
   word or phrases describing the effect of the action.
   ::

      Sleep the clock round 
      (sleep until the clock comes round to the same point, i.e., twelve hours)
      sleep off a headache, sleep the headache off
      dream the hours away
      cry one's heart out
      cry oneself to sleep
      laugh a person or idea out of court
      laugh a person out of a bad habit
      laugh him down (silence him by laughing)
      look him into submission, into doing something
      look yourself blind
      look a person out of countenance
      look one full in the face (This case does not imply any effect of the action)
      eat oneself out of house and home (until one is broke)
      drink oneself ill
      drink oneself out of a job (until he loses it)
      drink away the night
      drink a person under the table (until he is drunk and fall under the table)
      drink away one's reason
      talk oneself hoarse (until one's voice is hoarse)
      talk one's way to success (attain success by talking)
      talk a child to sleep
      talk black into white
      talk one to death
      talk him round (until he changes his opinion and agrees with you)
      talk him down (until he yields or gives up)
      talk her into marrying the butler

.. _P317:

   All these words, sleep, dream, cry, laugh, look, eat, drink, talk,
   are normally vv.i. in the sense in which they are used here.
Active and Passive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   11.30. The Term “Voice.”*--A very important aspect of
   action, the distinction between active and passive, has been
   called “voice” in grammar. This name will do as well as
   any other term, so long as it is taken merely as an empty
   label. The use of the term, however, should not lead us
   into thinking that it is in any way different from the other
   “aspects,” or that it has any mysterious function. Its 
   function is merely to indicate an aspect ofaction. One should
   merely take it as a label, and not try to read any meaning
   into it. William James, in his Talks to Teachers, relates a
   story which shows the disastrous consequences of trying to
   read into the term “voice” an intelligible meaning. A teacher
   once said to a child, “Suppose that you kill me: you who
   do the killing are in the active voice, and I, who am killed,
   am in the passive voice. “But how can you speak if you're
   killed?” said the child. “Oh, well, you may suppose that I
   am not yet quite dead!” The next day, the child was asked in
   class to explain the passive voice, and she said, “It's the kind
   of voice you speak with when you are not quite dead.”*

   11.31. Formation of the Passive.--A passive voice is

   [*] noted by Jespersen, The Philosophy of Grammar, p. I6q,

.. _P318:

   formed in English by using some form of the vb. to be and
   the past participle (p.p.). No matter how varied the passive
   forms may be, this formula remains unchanged. Compare
   the following changes of a vb. in the active and the parallel
   changes of the vb. to be in the passive, and see how exactly
   they correspond:--
   ::

      ACTIVE                                          PASSIVE
      (Vb. variss)                           (To be varies; p.p. unchanged)
      Pres Indefnite.         I see                   I am seen
      Past Indefinite         I saw                   I was seen
      Future Indefinite       I shall see             I shall be seen
      Pres. Perfect           I have seen             I have been seen 
      Past Perfect            I had seen              I had been seen
      Future Perfect          I shall have sven       I shall have been seer
      Present Contin.         I am secing             I am being seen
      Infinitive              to see                  to be seen
      Perfect Inf.            to have seen            to have been seen
      Participle              seeing                  being seen
      Perfect Part.           having seen             having been seen

   It will be seen that in the formation of the passive tenses,
   all that is necessary is to decline the vb. to be like any other
   vb. while keeping the p.p. unchanged.

   Usually only transitive vbb. can be put in the passive
   voice, as we can easily turn the active Jack kills (v.t.) Jill
   into the passive Jill is killed by Juck, but we cannot easily
   make the active I sleep (v.i.) into a passive-is slept by me,
   which would be meaningless. Intransitive vbb. with prepp.
   following, however, may very well be put in the passive voice,
   as The accounts must be looked into(from the active We must
   look into the accounts: See §12.41.).

   Exercise 93. Transform the following active phrases into 
   passive phrases. The active subject may be omited for practice.

.. _P319:

   1. We spent a great deal of money.
   2. We have spent a great deal of money.
   3. They give him the rank of a minister.
   4. They have given him, etc.
   5. They are giving him, etc.
   6. They show a picture to the audience.
   7. They will show a picture, etc.
   8. They were showing a picture, etc.
   9. They have already shown a picture, etc.
   10. Having told.        Considering.
       To tell.            Without seeing.
       To have told.       Having known.
       Must realize.       Is looking for.
       Should regard.      Will have finished.

   11.32. Use of the Passive.--Apparently there may not
   be any great difference between Jack kills Jill and Jill is
   killed by Jack, which seem to be two ways of saying the same
   thing. There are many cases, however, where the passive form
   is necessary or much more preferable to the active form.
   Thus when a reporter found a man murdered, without being
   able to learn who murdered him, evidently all he could report
   would be “A man was murdered in his fiat on Avenue B-----,
   etc.” For in the passive voice, we can avoid mention of the
   subject (doer) of the action. Sometimes the doer is unknown
   (as in the above example), or very indefinite (It is said-----by
   whom?), or well understood (A student was dismissed------by
   the school authorities, of course), or of less interest to the
   hearer and the speaker than the party affected by the action
   (A house was burnt----we are interested in the house burnt
   and not in the fire which burnt it). Sometimes it is indelicate
   to mention who was the author of a deed, as in the following

.. _P320:

   examples:—-

      So the Kuomintang was turned into a personal organ and
      China was sold through the disgraceful treaty.

      I was given to understand----never mind by whom-----that no
      more should be written or published in the papers on this
      topic.

   Exercise 94. Learn to use the following very common passive
   expressions:--
   ::

      It is said that                     It is proposed that
      It is rumoured that                 It is understood that
      It is reported that                 It has been decided that
      I have been told that               Is considered to be
      I am told that (to)                 Is regarded as
      I am surprised to                   Is supported by
      I am accustomed to                  Is rendered possible
      He was annoyed at                   The story is told that
      She is disappointed to              The fact is established that
      Noreason has been given             The news has been spread that
      No arrangement has been made        It is considered best that (to)
      It has been pointed out that        It should be remembered that
      A plan has been suggested to        He has been invited to
      You are requested to                A telegram was sent
      It is forbidden to                  A meeting will be held, etc.
      I have been asked to                A proposal has been made

   11.33. Active and Passive Nn.--Although this chapter
   deals exclusively with aspects of vbb., it should be pointed
   out that nn. and adjj. often involve or imply active or passive
   action also. The English suffix -er or -or denotes the doer
   of a deed, while the suffix -ee denotes the receiver or the
   party affected by the action. Contrast—-
   ::

      employer ----- employee     lessor ---- lessee
      payer    ----- payee        vendor ---- vendee
      addresser ---- addressee

.. _P321:

   Notice also appointee (person appointed), nominee (person
   nominated for office), committee (board to which certain
   duties are committed or entrusted), referee (judge of games,
   i.e,, person to whom questions are referred). The suffix
   -er is very common, as in fisher, teacher, singer, seeker, finder,
   receiver, sender, preacher, hawker, traveller, shopkeeper, hair-
   dresser, mixer of drinks, founder of societies, owner of a car,
   subscriber to a paper. Note also -or in instructor, professor,
   guarantor, sailor, confessor, debtor, creditor, originator. The
   p.p. in -ed is often used as an. to denote the passive subject,
   as the accused (i. e., the accused person), the unemployed,
   the wounded, the deceased.

   11.34. Active and Passive Adjj.--Notice also the active
   and passive action implied in the adjj.--contemptuous（鄙视
   的)--contemptible（可鄙的)；desirous 愿望)—desirable（合意
   的)；credulous（轻信的）—credible（近情可信的)；incredulous
   (怀疑的)—-incredible（荒唐难信的)； forgetful（易忘)—unforgettable(难忘)；
   respectful(敬意的)--respectable(可敬的). The
   endings -able, -ible generally suggest the passive aspect
   (eatable, audible, visible, countable, unbelievable, permissible,
   legible, questionable, understandable, intelligible, digestible), but
   sometimes also suggest the active aspect (susceptible, capable
   of receiving; perishable, easy to perish; forcible, by use of
   force). Curiously enough, suspicious has both the active 
   meaning of “prone to suspect”(He is suspicious by nature, 生性猜忌)
   and the passive meaning of “arousing suspicion”(His conduct
   was very suspicious, 形迹可疑). Chinese students often 
   misunderstand the aspect denoted by the words fearful, frightful,
   terrible, etc. It is wrong to say I am very fearful for I fear

.. _P322:

   very much (athing, it, is fearful, but a person fears). Thus we
   have--

      Incorrect                     Correct
      I am very terrible            I am very much terrified
      I am very frightful           I am very much frightened
      I am very delightful          I am very delighted
      I am very interesting         I am very interested
      I am very exciting            I am very excited

   A good dictionary generally indicates whether an adj. is 
   applicable to a person or a thing. Thus a person may be anxious
   (人焦急), but a thing or a situation cannot (事急=“critical”)。*
   A thing may be interesting, but generally a person is only
   interested, unless he is interesting (as an author or friend) to
   others. A scene or situation may be reminiscent of some
   former situation(令人回忆往事), but a person usually cannot
   be reminiscent, he can only be reminded of that former situation
   (回忆往事). Again, a thing or arrangement may be satisfactory, 
   but the person is satisfied. The student should form the
   habit of watching whether an adj. is applicable to persons,
   or to things, or to both.

   The very important differense between present participle
   (active) and past participle (passive) has already been made
   clear in §2.33.(a terrifying noise, but a terrified look, etc.)

   11.35. False Active.--It is gratifying to find another
   instance of English economy here. Just as the Englishman
   says sleep the clock round in preference to the longer sleep

   [*] By a trick ofidiom, we can say, however, an anxious moment.
   This twist of logic is also found in phrases like a lazy time, a dying
   wish, easy money, already mentioned under §9.20.

.. _P323:

   until the clock comes round, so he says The wall looks gloomy
   instead of The wall seems dirty when you look at it, although
   we know very well that a wall never does any looking. Here
   we have a case of false active, used to circumvent the more
   clumnsy expression made necessary by employing the more
   logical passive.

   Not every vb., but only certain ones, can be used this
   way, and these are so indicated in a dictionary. Following
   are the more common examples:一
   ::

      The book sells well (really it is sold).
      The poem reads smoothly (is smooth when you read it).
      This pen writes very smoothly (really you write with it).
      The song sounds very beautiful.
      That rose smells wonderful(ly).
      This fish smells awful(ly).
      This chicken tastes delicious.
      This window looks out on a patch of green lawn.
      This stove cooks very well.
      The sofa measures twelve feet.
      Mine compares favourably with yours.
      This kind of cloth washes well (stands washing).
      This pipe does not draw easily (you cannot dtaw the smoke through it easily).

Complete and Incomplete Action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   11.40. Complete and Incomplete Action.--Expressions
   like I have eaten and He has come back belong to the 
   conclusive aspect, for they signify that an action has been 
   completed. Here the important idea indicated is not the action in
   itself, but rather a condition as a result of the action: not that

.. _P324:

   I ate or He came back, but that I am in the condition of
   having eaten (not hungry) or he is in the condition of having
   come back (not away or abroad). Such expressions indicate,
   therefore, a present condition as the result of some past action.

   This form, called the “perfect tense,” therefore belongs
   to the conclusive aspect (indicating completed action) and does
   not primarily refer to time. We could have the same aspect
   either in the present (I have eaten), in the past (I had eaten) or
   in the future (I shall have eaten). It is much clearer to separate
   the two notions of time and aspect, instead of confusing them
   under the notion of “tense,” which is really time and aspect
   combined.

   The Chinese pariicle liao (了, unstressed) exactly
   indicates this conclusive aspect, and not the past time merely.
   下雨了 means that it is raining now, that it has begun to
   rain, and not that it rained. 快要下雨了 means that we have
   already reached the condition now that rain is falling soon
   (present condition as a result of possible future action). 
   Compare also 米快要完了, which means that rice is running out
   now, that we haven't got much rice left. 事不成了，事糟了
   (The plan is doomed to failure | The thing has been spoilt) also
   indicate the conclusive aspect.

   11.41. Present Perfect and Adv. of Time.--Because of this
   fact that the present perfect indicates a present condition, we
   canot, according to the English usage, use it with advv. 
   denoting past time, although we know very well that the action
   tock place in the past. One cannot say I have come back
   yesterday. The action, it is true, took place in the past
   (therefore one can say I came back yesterday), but we are

.. _P325:

   speaking of the present condition (therefore one should say I
   have come back now).

   Fxercise 95. It is most easy to make such mistakes by inserting 
   an adv. denoting some past time when the action really took
   place. Correct the following sentences, if they are wrong:--

   1. I have met him severaltimes this week.
   2. I have met him several times last week.
   3. He has lost some money in business last year.
   4. We have talked over this matter in his house last night.

   11.42. Use of the Perfect.--（1) The following examples
   illustrate the proper use of the perfect tense. Notice that they
   indicate a condition, or a man's experience, record, or achievement 
   covering a long period.

      What have you got there?(present condition)

      I've forgotten what he said in the letter. (present condition:
      compare “I forgot to tell you.”)

      I have not seen more than three such vases in my life-time.
      (long experience)

      He has travelled a great deal. (present condition: He knows a
      great deal about foreign countries.)

      I have known him for a long time. (long experience: for this and
      the following two examples, see §11.61, “4”)

      I have always regarded you as the ablest man of the party.
      (long period)

      I have always wanted to see you.

      He has repeatedly captured the first prize in college contests.

      In his service as a diplomat, he has shaken hands with kings
      and queens, (has) sat at the same table with the greatest
      poets and philosophers, and (has) seen all that is worth
      seeing in the country. (experience)

      The affair has turned out differently from what he expected.

      I have said what I wanted to say.

.. _P326:

      S---- has graduated from Nankai.(i.e., He has the standing
      [资格] of a Nankaigraduate: compare “He graduated
      from Nankai last summer.”)
   
      We have worked together and played together as children;
      we have quarrelled and made up many times, but we
      have never ceased to be very fond of each other.(long
      period)

      He has written several volumes of poetry.(record)

      He has studied at Oxford and Berlin, two of the best universities
      in Europe.(This is his standing, but in answer to the question 
      “Where did he study?” one merely says “He studied, etc.”)

      The mother says, “I have cared for him, sent him to college,
      and given him the best of everything in life.”

   (2) The difference between present perfect and past indefinite 
   is illustrated in the following imaginary dialogue:一

      Scrupps: Where's Thomas?

      Howard: He has gone away. (present condition)

      Scrupps: I didn't know that. When did he go? (past action)

      Howard: He went away on Monday. (past action)

      Scrupps: What's he doing? Have you got any news from him?
      (present condition)

      Howart: Yes. He sent me a telegram from Cologne.(past
      action)

   The points of difference are, therefore:(1)the present perfect 
   refers to the present, while the past indefinite refers to
   the past; (2) the present perfect denotes a condition while the
   past indefinite (except with the vb. to be) denotes an action;
   and (3) consequently, the present perfect covers a long
   period of time, while the past indefinite (generally) refers to
   a short point of time. We say “Did you see the President?”
   when we mean to ask whether he saw him or not (as an

.. _P327:

   action), but “Heve you seen T--- lately?” when we mean
   to ask whether for the last few days (an extended period)
   he has seen T----. Consequently, we can say “I saw him
   just now,” or “I just saw him” (point of time), but I have
   not seen him for a long time (period of time). Notice also
   such idiomatic expressions:--
   ::

            This is the best book he ever wrote.
      But:  Of all the books he has ever written, this is the best.
            It was the longest funeral procession I ever attended.
      But:  Of all the funeral procession I have ever attended, this was
            the longest.

   (3) in connexion with “since,” we always say that since
   some time ago or since somcthing happened (point of time),
   something else has happened (period of time): Since he arrived
   yesterday, he has not been seen. This means that he arrived,
   say, at six in the afternoon yesterday (point of time), but
   that from that time till the present (a long period) he has not
   been seen. Study the following examples:—-

      Since that quarre!(Since they quarrelled), they have never met
      (or spoken to each other) again.

      I have not been able to write a single word since last week.

      Lord Lytton has made half a dozen calls since his arrival.

      There have been three floods in China since 1910.

      Husbands and wives have quarrelled since human marriage began.

      Man has sinned since the world began.

      I have not been to Europe since I returned in 1910.

      He has joined the communists since his mother died.

      Many things have happened since you went away.

      He was once bitten by a dog during his childhood, and since
      then, he has never dared to come near a dog.

      The patient has made great progress since he entered the hospital.

.. _P328:

   (4) The past perfect indicates the conclusive aspect in
   some past time, e.g.--

      He had arrived before me (or before I arrived).

      When I arrived, he had signed the check already.

      It had begun to rain before I started, so I was well provided.

      They had decided to go already, so I could not say anything.

      The girl had been neglected by her aunt with whom she was
      living (consequently she looked very thin, etc.).

      I had not been able to send him any money.

      Still he had not appeared.

      I did not go to meet him, because I had not been notified.

   Very often, phrases like I had intended, I had expected are
   used to indicate that what was intended or expected never
   took place.

      I had intended to call on you yesterday afternoon (but some
      friend called, so I was not able to go).

      I had expected some help from him (which never came).

      I had thought some sort of arrangement might be made (but
      later realized that this was impossible).

   (5) The future perfect indicates the conclusive aspect
   in some future time. e.g.--

      At fifty, you will have made enough money to retire comfortably.

      By that time, Freddie will have grown up into a big boy, and
      Eda most probably will have married.

      You post this letter now, so that when you go to see him the
      day after tomorrow, he will surely have received the letter
      already.

.. _P329:

   (6) “Have had,” “had had.” Chinese students are often
   puzzled by this combination. Reafly it is very simple, for the
   first word, have, serves as an auxiliary (as in have come) and
   the second word, had, serves as a principal vb. In English,
   have as a principal vb. can even be put in the passive voice:

      Flour can be had at 10 cents a pound.

      Nothing is to be had there (=There is nothing to buy at that place).

   Hence its use as a principal vb. in have had (for the present)
   and had had (for the past) is easy to understand.

      Look here, we've had enough of this. (Don't make any more trouble.)

      Have you had your dinner? Thanks, I've had mine already.

      Waley had had (i.e., had gone through) a most unpleasant 
      experience in his first African trip.

   Exercise 96. Study the following, giving your reasons for the
   use of the perfect tense or the past indefinite, and correct the
   sentences if they are wrong:--

   1. Haven't you eaten enough at last night's dinner?
   2. I always regarded (have regarded?) this as a risky business.
   3. While he was principal of the middle school, he has
      always been on the best terms with the Bureau of Education.
   4. The company became bankrupt, and as a result, the 
      outstanding debts are (were? have been?) left unpaid.
   5. A great deal was (has been?) written on the subject of
      extraterritoriality.
   6. News has been (was?) received from home saying that his
      grandmother is dead.
   7. The patient recovered (is recovering? has recovered?) since he
      came under my treatment.

.. _P330:

   8. This was the second marriage for both the bride and
      bridegroom. They both had (had had?) a most unhappy
      marital experience. Both were (had been?) very unhappy
      in their first marriage. Since the second marriage, they
      live (have lived? are living?) most happily together.
   9. Of course your suggestion was received with great applause.
      Nobody had thought of it before.
   10. Have you seen the famous spiritualist when he was in
       Shanghai last December？

   11.43. Incompletion: Use of the Progressive.--There are
   two tense-forms belonging to the non-conclusive aspect:（1）
   the “continuous”or “progressive” (I am writing | You are 
   listening) and (2) the “perfect continuous” (I have been writing I
   You have been listening).

   The present progressive, rather than the present indefinite,
   is the regular form used for present action, as shown already
   in §11.10. We say, “At this mpment, some people are dying
   (not die), some are being married (not are married) and some
   are being born (not are born) into this world.” We also say,
   “Look here, I am holding (not I hold) this book.”

   The past progressive indicates that something was going
   on,-more commonly that something was going on while
   something else happened. E.g.一

      I was reading upstairs, when I heard the windows shaking and
      bottles clinking in the cupboard.

      They were dancing and drinking, when the police broke in.

      I was waiting in the station when I saw a woman's face, which
      seemed very familiar to me.

      I was looking at the sailing clouds when some one slapped me
      on the back.

.. _P331:

   Notice the position of when in the above examples which
   is different from its position in Chinese. This is more common
   than the other arrangement: When I was looking..., some one
   slapped....

   Exercise 97. Translate the following into English, taking care
   where you put the word when.

   1. 正在傍徨不定 (hesitating) 之时, 我们看见前面一辆汽车开来。
   2. 他正讲了一半，他的太太走出来了。
   3. 我正坐在大椅上看报，忽然 A 跑进来。
   4. 我们都已熟睡了，忽然听见窗外哔剥的晌。

   11.44. Participles and the Conclusive Aspect.--It is the
   peculiarity of the passive voice that it generally implies 
   completed action. When a thing “is done,” then it is done already.
   If a man “is killed,” then he is already killed. If a jar is
   broken, it is broken already, or if a watch is lost, it is 
   already lost. Expressions of non-conclusive passive voice are
   comparatively rare, like A man is being killed, A picture is
   being shown at the theatre.

   Hence it is that the past participle (used in the passive
   voice) implies completed action (conclusive aspect) while the
   present participle (used in the progressive tense) implies 
   incomplete action (non-conclusive aspect).(There is, of course, the
   further difference that the present participle indicates the active
   aspect, while the past participle the passive aspect.) Thus by
   boiling water, we mean water which is still boiling, while by
   boiled water, we mean water which has been boiled. A returning
   traveller is still on his way, while a returned student has
   already returned to his home country. Contrast also the
   growing boy and the grown-up man.(See §2.33.)

   In order to express the non-conclusive aspect with the

.. _P332:

   passive voice, we have to use the word being: the officer being
   elected, the course being decided upon. Hence we have the
   following scheme:一
   ::

               Conclusive                          Non-Conclusive
      Active   having elected                      electing
      Passive  elected (or having been elected)    being elected

   Exercise 98. Study the following and see whether they are
   conclusive or non-conclusive:---

   1. The man being looked for.
   2. The watch lost yesterday.
   3. The party exploring the North Pole.
   4. The company being formed.
   5. The company formed.
   6. The judge passing the verdict.
   7. The manbeing tried.
   8. The man being held for ransom.
   9. The problem being discussed.
   10. The house being built.
   11. A person having held three posts successively.
   12. A person holding three posts now.
   13. Three battles fought and won.

Beginning, Continuation and End
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   11.50. Beginning, Continuation and End,--The three
   aspects of beginning, continuation and end (inceptive, 
   continuative and cessative) are expressed in English by means of
   the expressions:(1) begin to, begin--ing, (2) keep--ing,
   etc. and (3) stop--ing, or cease--ing.

   (1） Begin to, ete. This aspect seems to be used in

.. _P333:


   English to a greater extent than in Chinese. On this account,
   it should be more carefully studied. Say “I begin to suspect”
   and “I am beginning to think” (疑心起来,正萌此意) instead
   of “I suspect” and “I think” when the suspicion or change
   of opinion is a gradual process. Other examples are:--
   ::

      begin to realize                 am beginning to suspect
      began to understand              am beginning to fear
      began to get tired of            is beginning to decay 
      began to repent                  has begun to be talked about
      begin to think otherwise         had begun to play

   Begin followed by a vb. in --ing is also often used: begin
   building at once, began telling me a story, began washing his car.

   (2) Keep —ing, etc.
   ::

      keep going                       remain sitting
      don't keep telling me that       remain living with him
      keep on talking                  continue standing  

   We can say continue to talk or continue talking, but not keep
   to or remain to talk. The double advv. on and on are often
   used: He talked on and on[He ran on and on.

   (3) Stop -ing: stop to. These two expressions have
   opposite meanings. You never stop to think means that you
   keep on going ahead and never think, while you never stop
   thinking means that you are thinking all the time. On the other
   hand, cease praying and cease to pray both mean the same
   thing, i.e,, stop praying.

      He did not even stop to take a drink.

      A never stopped to look at a lady; Bnever stopped looking at ladies.

      I have never stopped (ceased) loving you.

      Many people cease to study when they have ceased going to school.

      H----- has never ceased to believe in you.

      Unless you two stop fighting, I will call in the police.

.. _P334:

Durative and Punctual
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   11.60. Point of Time and Period of Time.--In point of
   duration, actions may be regarded as “punctual” (taking
   place at a point of time) or “durative”(extending over a
   period). Understanding of this aspect is very important for
   the proper use of vbb. The difference is illustrated in two
   sentences already given above:---

      Husbands and wives have quarrelled (durative) since human
      marriage began (punctual). (§11.42,“3”)

      I was reading (durative) upstairs, when I heard (punctual) the
      windows shaking, etc.(§11.43)

   This durative-punctual aspect is also to be observed in the
   employment of phrases like begin to. It is more exact to
   say From that day, he began to lose hope, than merely he lost
   hope. For losing hope is a long process covering an extended
   period, whereas the phrase began to expresses what took place
   at a given point of time (that day). So also, it is more exact
   to say, “From the third day, the patient began to recover, than
   the patient recovered. The process of recovering requires an
   extended period of days or weeks, whereas beginning to
   recover could take place at any given point of time.

   Only a part of the vbb. in the indefinite refer to a point
   of time, while all the perfect, continuous and perfect 
   continuous tenses refer to an extended period.

.. _P335:

   11.61. Punctual and Durative Vbb.--In English, we could
   find many pairs of vbb. or verbal phrases expressing almost
   the same meaning, but belonging to different durative aspects.
   Thus we “got acquainted” with a person at a particular time,
   and then we “know” him for the rest of our days: got
   acquainted is punctual, while know is durative. After one once
   “falls in love” (punctual), then he “is in love” for a long time
   (durative). We may “wake a man up” in a second, but he
   may continue to “lie awake” for the whole night. Other examples 
   are: get (punctual)--have (durative) | learn (p.)--know (d.) |
   remind (p.)--remember (d., also p.) | receive (p.)--keep (d) | get
   frightened (p.)--fear (d.) | arrive (p.)-stay (d.). The vb. to be
   best represents the durative vbb, while the vb. to do best
   represents the punctual vbb. When a man is lazy or dishonest,
   he is lazy or dishonest even in his sleep. On the other hand,
   a man may steal something today and yet not steal anything
   tomorrow. Very often we dislike a person not for what he
   does, but for what he is. Some typical examples of punctual
   vbb. worth noticing are given below:--

      That reminds me I have still two letters to write.

      Itoccurred to me we might send Miss Ch-- along.

      He went to bed and fell asleep.(The proper way to say 睡觉了
      in English is to use is asleep, is sleeping or has fallen
      asleep.)

      I came to the conclusion that...(Seldom I concluded.)

   The practical consequences of this distinction between
   punctual and durative vbb. are four. (1) In order to express
   durative actions with punctual vbb., we have to use any of
   the durative tenses (perfect, continuous, perfect continuous).
   Thus come is a punctual vb., but we can express an extended

.. _P336:

   action with it by saying, for instance, I've come to know him.
   Stop is also a punctual vb., but we can say I have never
   stopped loving you, which refers to a long period.

   (2) In order to express punctualactions with durative
   vbb., we have to use helping phrases like came to, began to.
   Thus know is a durative vb., while the act of beginning to
   know (punctual) may be expressed by such phrases as came
   to know, learnt to know, began to know.

   (3) Many durative vbb. like know, understand, think,
   believe, regard, consider, value, despise, hate, love, fear are in
   themselves sufficient to indicate their durative nature. These
   words generally do not require the continuous tense to express
   an extended condition. E.g,, I know (never I am knowing)
   you are wrong | I despise (never am despising) that fellow | I believe
   (not am believing) he is in love.

   (4) With these same vbb,, the perfect may serve to
   express what is usually expressed by the perfect continuous.

      I have known him for years. (Really equivalent to I have been
      making friends with him for years. I have been knowing is
      not English. I have known him, although in “perfect” tense,
      does not imply that the act of knowing him is finished or
      “perfect.” I still know him now.)

      I have always believed in your innocence. (This does not mean
      I have stopped believing in you.)

      I have always regarded you as a talented beggar. (And am still
      regarding you that way now.)

      He has remained a symbol of honesty and purity to me.

      He has always stood at the head of his class.

   11.62. Duration in Prepp.--Prepp., too, are affected by
   the distinction between point of time and period of time. Of

.. _P337:

   those indicating point of time, at and on are the most typical,
   while the more common words used to indicate period of
   time are in, during and pending. We say, for instance, at
   nine o'clock in the morning; also at sunrise, at sunset, at
   midnight, but in or during the night. The use of on is worth
   noticing. It is selective. Just as we think of a bird alighting
   on a tree (rather than another tree), so we think of a thing
   as happening on a certain day rather than another day (especially 
   when we say Christmas falls on Friday). In this
   sense, Friday or any day is regarded really as a point of
   time in comparison with other days. So we say on that
   morning, on that evening, when we regard it as one
   morning or evening among others, but in the morning, in the
   evening when we regard it in itself as a long period. Notice
   also the phrase once upon a time.

   During more clearly covers the whole period mentioned:
   during the evening, during the week, during the meeting. 
   Pending means “during the interval until”: Pending his arrival (from
   this time until he comes), we shall go on as usual. In the
   course of implies any point during a period: I shall pay you
   in the course of next week. By suggests the passing of time:
   By that time you will be quite a rich man means that you will
   be getting richer and richer as time goes on, until that time
   mentioned when you will be quite rich. Have the dress finished 
   by Saturday means by Saturday at the latest, and earlier
   if you can.

Habitual Action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   11.70. Habitual Action.--One of the uses of the present

.. _P338:

   indefinite in English is to indicate habitual action: Do you
   smoke?i She sings | We play tennis everyday. These indicate 
   present habits, but the action is not necessarily limited to the
   present moment. We play tennis everyday implies that we
   played yesterday also. In the case of She sings, the meaning
   is She can sing, or She is a singer, implying an ability which
   is not limited to the present only. Some more examples are
   given below: note that really present action is indicated by
   the present continuous, as explained in §11.10.

      Hegets up at eight and goes to bed at ten (habitual). Contrast:
      He is getting up now (present).

      The boy goes to school (i.e, he is a schoolboy-habitual). 
      Contrast: The boy is going to school (present).

      She sends him letters everyday (habitual). Contrast: She is
      sending (or has sent) a letter to him (present).

      The boat sails fourteen miles an hour (has the capacity). 
      Contrast: The boat is sailing north (present).

      Do you go to church? (habitual). Contrast: Did you go to
      church?(past action) or, Are you going to church now?
      (present).

      Smithey never yields (habitual). But he is yielding now (present).

      Joey swears terribly (has the habit of using bad language).

   For past habifual action, the most general way is to use
   the phrase used to.

      We used to play together 

      They used to live in the same room.

      The boat used to run between Tientsin and Shanghai.

      She used to stop at Tsingtao for a day or two.

      We used to let off fire-crackers and make new year calls on New
      Year's Day.

      There used to be a boat race on the Dragon Boat Festival.

      The Chinese emperor used to get up at four o'clock in the
      morning and hold audience with his ministers.

      We used to meet every Saturday evening in his house.

.. _P339:

   Strange to say, the negative form (logically did not use to)
   is unknown, while never used to and used not to are felt to be
   awkward. The negative can be expressed by usually not, or simply 
   by never: Usually he did not turn up | He never smoked.

   The passive form be used to requires a n. after it: I am
   used to that sort of treatment. It can be used affirmatively or
   negatively (I am not used to that sort of treatment), and for any
   time (I was not used to sleeping on wooden boards). From this
   we get the expression get used to: He got used to her piano
   music and she got used to his smoke | We can easily get used
   to your pronunciation.

Tentative Action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   11.80. Tentative Action.--This aspect is known in Chinese,
   but never employed to the same extent as in English. The
   usual form is try to, with the emphaticforms attempt to and
   make an effort to. Thus a phrase like tried to capture the city
   is very difficult to translate exactly into Chinese. It may or
   may not be implied in the phrase 来攻某城攻下与否未曾言明),
   while 试攻某城 is simply not Chinese. The Chinese language
   provides clearly only for the successful or conclusive aspect:
   攻下. Thus try to persuade and persuade may be translated
   by 劝 and 劝动了. But how shall one translate such phrases
   as try to work hard, try to do your best?

   Notice also the English expressions tend to and be 

.. _P340:

   inclined to:--The movies tend to encourage crime! He is inclined
   to be lazy. These also express the non--conclusive aspect, and
   are also difficult to translate idiomatically.

   On the other hand, we have another form of tentative
   action expressed in Chinese as represented by 尝一尝，试
   一试，打一打，敲一敲，碰一-碰，走一走, 问一问. This may
   properly be called the casual aspect, implying that the action
   is done casually, without any serious purpose. 跟他讲一讲,说
   一说 means try to persuade him, and if he won't listen, then
   give up. In English, the nearest approach to this aspect is
   seen in take a look (看一看), have a taste (尝一尝), give it a
   trial (试一试) and have a go at it(碰一碰造化).

Miscellaneous Minor Aspects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   11.90. Causative, Reiterative, Reflexive and Reciprocal.--
   There are a number of other minor aspects.

   (a) Causative action. This involves two forms: either
   we cause a person to do something, or we cause something
   to be done: either We have the shoemaker repair the shoes, or
   We have the shoes repaired by the shoemaker. Both forms
   have already been fully examined in §9.91.

   (b) Reiterative action, In English, this is sometimes
   expressed through the prefix re-, as in reiterate, repeat, 
   rebuild, readdress, reconvert, reconsider, reassemble, reorganize,
   revalue, re-enter, reopen. This prefix re- is a living one in
   English, as it can be attached to any vb. with the senses
   once more, again, repeatedly, and hack to some former state.
   Sometimes the reiteration is expressed by the adv. phrases

.. _P341:

   again and again, over and over again, as in He asked the
   question again and again.

   (c) Reflexive and reciprocal action. An action may have
   direct bearing on the doer (subject) himself(Save yourself
   that trouble), in which case it is called “reflexive”; or if there
   are two or more subjects, the action may have a mutual
   bearing (Tell one another stories), in which case it is called 
   “reciprocal.” The expression of these two aspects has already
   been studied in §7.23 (“Reflexive and Reciprocal Pronouns”).

.. _P342:

Ch XII Subject And Object (Transitive Action)
---------------------------------------------

Subject and Doer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   12.10. Subject and Doer.--We shall now see the relation
   between the subject, the object, and the vb. of action. It
   should be realized that the “subject" of a vb. and the “doer”
   of an action are not always the same thing. It is true that,
   ordinarily, the subject is the doer of an action, as in He
   teaches English | She plays the piano. But in the passive voice,
   we immediately see that this is not true, as in I am told, and
   the officer has been impeached, where the subjects Iand officer
   do nothing whatsoever, but are only affected by the actions
   mentioned. Also in This is a book, no action is implied at
   all: the subject this does nothing.

   A subject is usually defined as the person or thing we talk
   about, while all that is said about the subject is called the
   predicate (vb. and object included). This general definition
   will do for practical purposes, although in He teaches English,
   we really talk about the teaching (vb.) and what is taught
   (object), as well as about the person who does the teaching
   (subject).

   It should be realized, therefore, that the notion “subject”
   is purely grammatical. It indicates merely a certain
   grammatical function in a sentence. English vbb. always
   require a subject whereas Chinese vbb. don't. In English

.. _P343:

   we say It rains, although we do not know what rains, perhaps 
   “heaven," perhaps (still better) the rain itself. In Chinese, 
   we are not compelled to find or express the subject of
   the vb. when it does not exist, as, for instance, in 下雨了
   (compare 雨下了), 不行了, 不对了. We also say 有一次,
   有一天 where we do not really know what is the subject of
   the vb. 有.

   12.11. Object and Party Affected.--The object is always
   the party affected by the action. In He told me, of course the
   object me indicates the person affected by the act of telling.
   But, conversely, the party affected is not always the object:
   it may be the subject of a passive vb., as I in I am told. 
   Notice also that, with the vb. to be, where no action is indicated,
   there is no party affected, and censequently no “object,” but
   only a “complement”: as in He is her husband, where her 
   husband merely completes the meaning of is (see §9.90).

   An object is affected by an action usually, but not always,
   as the receiver of the action. In He opens the door, of course
   the object door directly receives the action, as it were. But
   there are two special kinds of objects, which are affected in a
   different way. The first is the object of result, as in dig a
   grave, where the grave is the result of the digging. There
   was no grave until some one dug it, and consequently there
   was really nothing there to be affected by the action. 
   Examples of this kind of object are We make cakes | They form a
   circle | He writes a letter | He paints flowers. The other kind,
   which may be called the repetitive object, really repeats the
   vb. only, as in She dreamed a dream | He 'smiled a smile | They
   fight a good fight. This is very similar, logically, to the 
   conception that Rain rains or Snow snows (although we merely say
   It snows, It rains in English).

.. _P344:

   12.12. Grammatical Subjects and Objects.--It has already
   been pointed out that the terms “subject” and “object” merely
   indicate grammatical functions. Further illustrations will
   make this clear. In “The statue stands (in the yard)”, “The
   mountain stretches (to the north),” “The street turns (to the
   right),” and “The bridge spans (the river),” “The food aprees
   (with my stomach),” none of these things, siatue, mountain,
   street, bridge or food, really does anything at all. With 
   abstract nn. this is still clearer: “The question arises,” “School
   opens,” “The semester begins,” “The problem includes (many
   factors),” “A lawsuit drags on, or hangs on (for years).” Here
   the subjects are really incapable of any action.

   In the same way, in We hold a meeting, it is hard to see
   how we can do anything to the object “meeting,” or in Give
   him a warning or Teach him a lesson, how the warning or the
   lesson is affected by the man who wants to give or teach it.
   In take a bath, take a look, take a seat, do we really do
   anything to “the bath,” “the look” or “the seat”? And in
   He cut a funny figure, just how was that imaginary thing “figure”
   affected by the person who “cut” it?

   All these show that the relationships indicated by the
   “subjects” and “objects” “are merely grammatical. It is 
   advisable therefore to distinguish between the “doer” of an ac
   tion and the “subject” of a vb. on the one hand, and on the
   other, between the “party affected" by the action and the
   “object” of the vb. The terms “doer” and “party affected” are
   notional, while the terms “subject” and “object” are gram
   matical.


.. _P345:

   NOTE.--It is considered advisable to avoid the terms 
   “logical subject” and “psychological subject” which mean so many
   different things with different grammarians. Sometimes these are
   used to donote the psychologically most important or most 
   prominent word (He is wrong | I am right), sometimes to denote what
   comes first (They saw him | She married him), sometimes what is
   already known, with what is less well known as the predicate (He
   was her brother), sometimes the doer (He was loved by his father),
   sometimes the word stressed (You can't deceive me), etc. Used in
   these senses, a “psychological subject” is merely like a focussed
   point in a given picture, and it will never be possible to limit that
   focus to just any one word. Very often the whole sentence forms
   a unified concept with no central focus or with an even focus,
   where we should have to admit that the whole sentence is the
   subject, which would be absurd, grammatically speaking. Such
   problems belong more properly in the province of logic.

Kinds of Subject
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   12.20. Kinds of Subject.--The kinds of subject in the
   English language are represented by the following examples:--
   ::

             (Noun)  The garden is in bloom.
        (Verbal N.)  Fishing is a pleasant pastime.
          (Pronoun)  He was a fool. It is winter.
       (Infinitive)  To talk is easy; to act, difficult.
      (Noun Clause)  How he did it I can't understand.
                     Whether he did it or not is none of my business.
                     That this is wrong is admitted.
                     Who breaks pays.
                     Who steals my purse steals trash.

   These are the standard types.

   Bearing the distinction between grammatical and notional

.. _P346:

   categories in mind, we may discuss a few cases where notionally 
   some subjects are implied which are not so expressed in
   English. We have the following forms expressing about the
   same thing:一

   A. Who believes such a story is a fool.
   B. He who believes this story is a fool.
   C. He is a fool to believe this story.
   D. He is a fool if he believes this story.

   Grammatically speaking, in “A,” who believes such a story
   is the subject: in “B,” he is the subject, with the relative
   clause who believes this story modifying it: in “C,” he is the
   subject with the infinitive phrase to believe this story 
   moditying the vb. is: and in “D,” he is again the subject, with
   the subjunctive clause if he believes this story modifying the vb.
   is. This is all very correct, because if he did not believe this
   story, he would not be a fool. The infinitive phrase in “C”
   and the if-clause in “D” therefore properly modify the vb. is,
   and not the subject he. But, notionally, don't they come to
   the same thing as he who believes this story in “B” where the
   who-clause modifies the subject he and not the vb. is? And,
   notionally, is not he who believes this story in “B” as much
   the subject of is as who believes such a story in “A”? Do not--

      Believing this story, he is a fool

      If he believes this story, he is a foo!

   really say the same thing? So it is correct to say that, in He
   is a fool if he believes this story, we really mean he-who-be-
   lieves-this-story is a fool. Therefore, notionally speaking,
   he-who-believes-this-story is the subject of the vb. is.

   12.21. “It” as Subject.--(a) in the following sentences,

.. _P347:

   the words in italics indicate the real, though not the 
   grammatical, subject of the vb.一

      It is wrong to tell a lie.

      It is true that I dislike him.

   These mean the same thing as--

      To tell a lie is wrong.

      That I dislike him is true.

   The form with it as the grammatical subject is used because
   it is much more convenient to dispose of the short predicate
   first and then state the long subject afterwards. It seems as
   if we were to say It is wrong and then, in answer to the 
   question “What is it?” say: to tell a lie. To tell a lie is 
   therefore, said to be “in apposition” to the subject it. In It is
   true that I dislike him, the subject it may be considered as
   the “antecedent” of the relative clause that I dislike him.
   (Sees 7.45 for further examples.)

   (b) It is also often used without any clear meaning,
   but merely to satisfy the English grammatical requirement
   for a subject, as in It rains | It was winter | It is never too late
   to mend. We really do not know, and do not care to know,
   what is never too late to mend, or what was winter.

   12.22.“There is."--The peculiar construction there is
   corresponds to the Chinese yu(有): There is a boy （=有一
   小孩). In such sentences, we are forced to assume that the
   n. following there is is the subject: thus in There is a boy,
   boy is the subject, and is the vb. Really it does not mean 
   quite the same thing as A boy is there. Phonetically, there
   in there is, there are is always pronounced without stress or
   accent:[ðə]([ðə'riz], and [ðə'ra:] or [ðərə]). This is especially

.. _P348:

   clear in the sentence--

      There is a boy there.

   The first there is pronounced [ðər], while the second there
   [ðeə]. The second there serves as a complement to indicate
   a place, while the first there indicates nothing at all.
   (NOTE.--In there's, the pronunciation is usually [ðeəz, 
   some times [ðəz]).

   In Let there be light, there sounds suspiciously like an.
   (compare Let it be done). However, we are still forced to
   call it something other than a n., and analyze the sentence
   as Let light be there. It would be much better to regard
   there is or there be as a compound vb. deserving to be written as
   one word and meaning “exist.” Let there be light means“Let
   light exist,” or “Let light come into being (or existence).”

Transitive Action and Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   12.30. Transitive Action.--A transitive vb. may have
   an object (I kill--I kill him), but an intransitive vb. cannot
   (He is sleeping). It has already been mentioned(§11.21) that
   this distinction between vv.t. and vv.i. is also purely 
   grammatical. A transitive action is supposed to pass in some way
   or other intoits object, while an intransitive action is not:
   I see the boy, but I slept. Now it is quite clear that in I
   kill him, the action passes into the object him, but in I see
   the boy, does the action really pass into the boy? Note also
   that enter is a v.t. (He enters the room) and that come is an
   vi. (He comes into the room), but is there actually any
   difference between He enters the room and He comes into the

.. _P349:

   room? Therefore it is clear that the difference is not logical, but
   grammatical. The grammatical difference is that an intransitive
   vb. requires a prep. to enable it to be connected with any
   object, while a transitive vb. does not.

   12.31. Direct and Indirect Objects.--A v.t. may have two
   objects at the same time. In I give you a knife, knife is called
   the direct object, and you the indirect object. It really means
   “I give the knife to you.” The person to whom or for whom
   a thing is done is said to be the indirect object. Thus an
   indirect object is really an object with a hidden prep.(to or
   for). According to English idiom, we usually drop the prep.,
   whenever possible, and place the indirect object before the
   direct object, Buy me a new hat is more idiomatic than Buy
   a new hat for me. Study the following:--
   ::

      Will you do me a favour? (Not: “Will you do a favour for me?”)
      Send him the story. (Not: “Send the story to him.”)
      Wish me good luck. (Not: “Wish good luck to, or for, me.”)
      Pay him the money. (Not: “Yay the money to him.”)
      You do me a great honour. (Not: “You do a great honour to me.”)
      Save me the trouble. (Not: “Save the trouble for me.”)
      Save him some money. (Not: “Save some money for him.”)
      Spare me that agony. (Not: “Spare that agony from me.”)
      Show him the picture. (Not: “Show the picture to him.”)
      Teach him a lesson.
      Kiss him good-night.
      Give him a warning.
      Call me a taxi.

   The forms in brackets are not ungrammatical, and are 
   sometimes used, but are not really idiomatic. Notice that both
   forms are used in Chinese：送我一本书，给他十块钱，报告你一个消息，
   and 送一本书给我，拿十块钱给他，给你报告一个消息。

.. _P350:

   With some vbb., we can attach a prep. either to the
   indirect or to the direct object. We may say I present you
   with a new book or I present a new book to you / furnish him
   with information or furnish information to him. Other vbb.
   can govern only things and not persons as direct object:
   explain a thing, but explain to a person, hence explain that to
   me, or explain to me something, but never explain me. Still
   others may govern both persons and things directly, forgive
   a person and forgive a fault, excuse a person and excuse his
   appearance. We usually say forgive him his past faults. With
   vbb. in ---ing, we usually say excuse a person from ---ing (coming),
   or forgive a person for -ing (not attending).

   Exercise 99. The English language is full ofidioms like show
   me, tell me, bring me someting, serve me a good dinner, sing me a
   song, buy me a hat, do a man a good turn, serve him a warning,
   call me a car, etc. Learn to use these phrases. Translate the 
   following into English:--

   1.给我叫一辆车。
   2.把这事情告诉他。
   3.借我一百元（把一百元借我)。 
   4.替我买一枝洋伞。 
   5.给他一个瞥告。
   6.给他一个差事。
   7.衣服给我带来。
   8.给我做一双新鞋。

   Translate Chincse sentences with the words pa, tui, kei (把,对，给)
   and see how they come out in English. Notice that the use or
   omission of any prep. and the general arrangement depend entirely
   on the particular vb. used.

Passive Subjects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   12.40. Passive Vbb. with Objects.---The conversion of

.. _P351:

   Jack kill Jill into Jill is killed by Jack is quite simple. But
   when there are two objects, one of them may be converted
   into a subject in the passive sentence, with the otherone
   still kept. Thus from They told him a lie, we get He was
   told a lie. Study the following:--
   ::

      He was never told the truth.
      He was given a great welcome.
      She was paid three pounds a week.
      We were denied entrance into the park.
      We were given the privilege of going out at night.
      He was shown a picture of deceased.
      When only ten years old, she was taught French and violin.
      When only twelve, she was given a scholarship.

   Exercise 100. Change the following sentences into passive
   forms:--

   1. They asked him an awkward question.
   2. They paid her thirty cents for a day's work.
   3. They allowed her two eggs and one pint of milk per day.
   4. They gave him the job as a reward for his services.

   12.41. Passive Intransitive Vbb.--It is of course impossible 
   to form the passive voice with vv.i. which have no
   objects. If I say She slept there, it is impossible to say that
   something was slept by her. But vv.i. which are connected
   with a prep. phrase can be put in the passive voice. If I say
   No one has slept in this bed, I can change it into the passive
   by saying that The bed has not been slept in, meaning that
   the person who used to sleep in it did not come last night.

   Now, in §11.20 and 11.21, we have already seen the
   close connexion between vv.i. and their prepp., as look at,
   look up, look into, etc. which form very definite concepts. We
   have also seen that enter (v.t,) the room means the same thing

.. _P352:

   as come (v.i.) into the room. Come into thus forms a definite
   concept, which is used very much like a v.t. It is therefore
   easy to understand that we can take the v.i. and its prep.
   and put them together in the passive voice. Following are
   some examples:--
   ::

      She resents being looked at.
      He is looked upon as a leader.
      The accounts of last year must be looked into.
      A doctor has been sent for.
      The lost watch has been looked for all over the place.
      She is the most talked about girl in town.
      I am done for. (No active form exists.)
      He is never listened to.
      That is a thing devoutly to be prayed for.
      That is a question which has been greatly debared about (or upon).
      Who likes to be laughed at?
      From her childhood, she has never been properly looked after.

   Exercise 101. Convert the above sentences into the active
   form, using they, we, or no one where no particular doer is 
   mentioned.

Impersonal Subjects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   12.50. Impersonal Subjects.--In English, there are a great
   number of vbb. which can be used with impersonal subjects,
   very much as we say in Chinese 事情发生, 东西遗失. Unless
   one takes care to note this use, one might easily make 
   mistakes in the use of vbb. Thus we have:“a dress becomes a
   person” (looks well on him or her). “food does not agree
   with a person” (not: person agrees with food), and “idea
   occurs to a man” (not: man oceurs to idea). The proper way

.. _P353:

   to say 我遇见某事 is: “I came across something” or “Something 
   happened to me,” but never “I happened to something.”
   Study the following examples of vbb. with impersonal subjects:--
   ::

      The door opens.
      Shops open at 9.0 a.m.(not are opened)
      The semester begins.(But: Work is begun.)
      Here the letter ends (in speaking of some letter which the
      speaker has been reading. But: The task is ended).
      Winter begins on Dec. 21 and ends on Mar. 21.
      The disease progresses very slowly.
      The interest gradually accumulates (not is accumulated).
      That doesn't count (=should not be counted).
      It amounts to over a hundred dollars.
      Something (which has been worrying him) weighs upon his mind.
      A picture was hanging (not was hung) on the wall.
      The subject acquires a new interest for me. (Also: I acquire a
      new interest for the subject.)
      The problem presses for solution.
      A doubt arises in my mind.
      The fact remains that he did not pay his debt.(Not is 
      remained: a common mistake with Chinese students.)
      How time flies (not is flown)!
      A desire awakened in her breast (not was awakened).
      This knife will last me a lift-time (not will be lasted).

   It is impossible to draw up any rule as to which kinds of
   vbb. may take impersonal subjects and which kinds may not.
   One should merely form the habit of noting whether a certain 
   vb. is used with impersonal subjects or not. The only
   rule is to consult a dictionary, when in doubt. A certain
   Chinese student once wrote The men were full of house (for
   人满屋, really The house was full of people), because he had

.. _P354:

   neglected to learn sentences as a whole and to observe the
   use of an impersonal subject in the case of the phrase be full.

   NOTE.--The use of false active (poem reads, book sells) has been
   discussed in §11.35. The action of objects (made him come, saw
   him go) has already been discussed in §9.91. Reflexive object have
   been studied in §7.23.

Ch XIII Time Of Action
----------------------

The Time Scheme: Present, Past and Future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   13.10. The Time Scheme: Present, Past and Future.--
   The usual division of time is into the three main classes:
   present, past and future, as represented by I saw, I see and
   I shall see. In each of these three main divisions, one can
   state that something has already taken place before it, and
   something is going to take place after it. Thus we get nine
   tenses altogether, as shown in the following scheme:--
   ::

      Before-past       I had seen
      Simple past       I saw
      After-past        I was (going) to see
      Before-present    I have seen
      Simple present    I see
      After-present     I am going to see | I shall see
      Before-future     I shall have seen
      Simple future     I shall see! I am going to see
      After-future      I shall be going to see

   Notice that there is an overlapping in the central division 
   “present,” “Before-present” is really past, and “after-present” 
   is really future. In English, the distinction between
   before-present and past is preserved through the forms I saw
   and I have seen, whereas in French, for instance, “I have
   seen” (j'ai vu) is regularly used for the past. Whether the
   grammatical distinction is maintained or not, the action
   itself really took place in the past. On the other hand, the
   after-present and the future really cometogether in English,
   because what comes after the present is naturally in the future.

.. _P356:

   However, a slight distinction is noticeable. There is a difference 
   between I am going to do it now or I shall do it now (after-
   present) and I am going to do it tomorrow or I shall do it
   tomorrow (simple future).

   Notice that, on account of the fact that the past of
   shall (should) has a non-temporal use (i. e., not pertaining
   to time proper), it is defective and cannot be used for the
   after-past and cannot alone form the after-future. On the
   other hand, the expression be going to gives us a perfect
   conjugation in all tenses. Actually, be going to is as 
   important a form for expressing future action as shall or will.

   Again, actions may last a long time. Hence, we get
   another scheme of durative tenses:-
   ::

      Before-past       I had been seeing
      Past              I was seeing
      Before-present    I have been seeing
      Present           I am seeing
      Before-future     I shall have been seeing
      Future            I shall be sveing

   In this case, what is before-present really started in the
   past and is continued down to the present. Before-future
   has very little actual use.

Present
~~~~~~~

   13.20. What is Present?--If we imagine time as flowing
   in a straight line, and try to fix the limit for the “present,” we
   immediately see that it occupies aninfinitesimal, ever--fleeting
   point of time only. Logically that time we call present is just
   a bare second, whereas all that goes before it belongs to the
   past (even the last second) and all that comes after it belongs

.. _P357:

   to the future (inciuding the next second). It is because of this
   fact that the present always encroaches upon the territory of
   the past or the future. I have just seen him, nominally called
   the present, really indicates a past action, and I shall do it
   now indicates really that the action will take place in the
   future. It is, therefore, very difficult to “do” anything in
   the present. There are very few things that can be done in
   the present second. Hence, we practically never express really
   present action by the simple present, and use instead the
   present continuous: I am doing it now, which expresses an
   extended period. The result is, either we have done a thing,
   or are going to do it, or we are doing it right now. For
   fuller illustrations, see §11.10.

   13.21、 Habitual Action and Eternal Truths.--Actually,
   however, we do regard the present as something more than a
   mere point of time. We often mean by it today, or the
   present week, or even the present year. For instance, we say
   I an staying at the X Hotel this week, or We dine at eight
   this year, last year we dined at seven. The last example 
   indicates not really present acticn, but merely a present habit.
   Or in the case of words like know, believe, think and be (I
   know you are right| I believe you are wrong), the suggestion is
   really that knowing or believing covers a long time. Or again,
   we may express an eternal truth when we say The earth moves
   around the sun, or at least a general statement when we say A
   curriage has four wheels | A hansom has two wheels | A statue
   stands in the yard | The Japanese eat a lot of beans and fish |
   Bread is made from flour | If you take the plug off, the current is
   cut off I There is not enough ventilation in this room. For this
   reason, we see that the simple present in English is used to

.. _P358:

   express habitual actions like know and love that cover a long
   time, and eternal truths or general statements. But it is never
   used to express really present action. When a man is killing
   a boy unintentionally, say to him, “You are killing the boy!”
   and not “You kill the boy!” although the killing may take
   only a fraction of a second.(See §11.10)

Future
~~~~~~

   13.30. Expression of Future.--Future action differs from
   present action in that it has not yet actually taken place, and
   hence the action is not an accomplished fact, but a wish, an
   obligation, a possibility or an expectation merely. He will
   go | He shall go I He may go | He expects to go. There is always
   more or less an element of uncertainty or intention in it.
   The purest form is what we call “simple future”: He will die
   soon, or He is going to die soon. These forms may be arranged
   under the following heads:--

   (1) Simple future: I shall come again! He will die soon.
   (2) Intention： I will come again.
   (3) Command： Come!/You shall come this afternoon.
   (4) Possibility：I may come again.
   (5) Obligation: I am to see himt his afternoon.

   13.31.“Shall” and “Will.”--The English shall and will
   seemn to cause a great deal of difficulty among Chinese students.
   ::

      +------------------------+-----------------+
      |     SIMPLE FUTURE      |     COMMAND     |
      | I shall     we shall   |   Always shall  |
      | you will    you will   +-----------------|
      | he  ─╮                 |                 |
      | she  ├─ will they will |    INTENTION    |
      | it  ─╯                 |   Always will   |
      +------------------------+-----------------+

.. _P359:

   The clearest and simplest explanation is to arrange them under
   the three heads: command, intention and simple future.

   As examples of COMMAND, we have: You shall he
   punished for this| He shall be kept indoors| Each one shall have
   to eggs for his breakfast! You shan't see her again. As no
   one gives commands to himself, therefore the forms I shall,
   we shall are not found in the sense of commands. Instead of
   we shall, the form let's is used: Let's go.

   As examples of INTENTION, we have: I will come again |
   They will come tonight | He has decided that he will not stay
   here any longer.

   As examples of SIMPLE FUTURE, we have: I shall be
   going soon | I shall be away tomorrow | You will be sorry for
   this | The school will close soon | It will rain soon | Tomorrow will
   be Saturday I It will be impossible to do anything tonight.

   In asking questions, use the word which you expect in the answer.
   ::

      Shall you be here tonight?    I shall.
      Will you come again?          I will.
      Shall they come, too?         They shan't.
      Shall I tell him?             Do. (You shall.)
      Will he die？                 I'm afraid he will.

   The important thing is to form the habit of using I
   shall and we shall for simple future instead of I will (and
   shall I? in questions instead of will I?). Say I shall not be
   able to and not I will not be able to, because this is simple
   future, for be able is not something that you can “will.”
   There is a tendency in modern English to use I'll for I shall
   (indicating simple future), because I'll is shorter and easier to
   pronounce: as I am afraid I'll die soon (strictly I shall). This

.. _P360:

   is especially true of American and Scotch usage. But one should
   nevertheless form the habit first of following the correct usage
   ofusing I shall.

   Will and shall are usvally pronounced [l] and [ʃæl] or
   [ʃ-l] respectively: I'll [ail], he'll [hi:l), they'll [ðeɪl], I shall
   [ai ʃæl]. Shan't is pronounced with a clear [a:]: You shan't
   [ʃa:nt) do this. There is a special use of will, meaning “insist,” 
   which is always pronounced full [wil].

      I told him not to go, but he will go (i.e., he insists on going).
      Boys will be boys (i.e.. you can't expect boys to behave like
      grown-ups).

      But things will happen against our wish.

   Also as a full vb. (not as an auxiliary), will is pronounced
   full: God wills (willed) [wilz(wild)] that it should be so.

   Exercise 102. Fill in shall or will in the following sentences
   expressing simple future:--

   1. They say he --- he promoted soon.
   2. No one -- be able to sion him.
   3. I am afraid I ----- not be here tonight.
   4. Who.---- spcak at tonight's dinner?
   5. ---- he take part in the contest?
   6. I ---- not dare to tell him.
   7. If we are caught, we ---- all be sent to prison.
   8.---- we stay away very long?
   9. ---- we go very far?
   10. The matter ---- be settled soon.
 
   13.32. Chinese “Chiang” and “Yao.”--The distinction
   between simple future and intention is best illustrated through
   their Chinese equivalents. Chiang (将) and chiu（就) and originally 
   the meaning of “going,” “going near” and “following,”

.. _P361:

   like the English going to, and like going to they are used to
   indicate simple future. It is going to rain (simple future) is
   easily translated by 将(要)下雨了 and 就要下雨了. It will
   be finished soon, or It is going to be finished soon (simple
   future) is easily translated by 就(要)完了.(This is true also
   of the French language, where “I am going to come,” je vais
   venir, is used to express simple future.)

   The word yao(要) originally expresses intention. 他要来
   不要来?== Will he come or not (is it his intention)? But like will
   in English, it also takes on another meaning indicating no 
   intention, but simple future: He will die soon==他快要死了.

   13.33. “May” and “Is to.”--Shall and will (with be
   going to) cover the three usual expressions of future action:
   simple future, command and intention. Two other forms,
   possibility and obligation, are usually expressed by may and
   be to. Thus He may or may not come and I may go away
   tomorrow are as much forms of expressing future action as I
   will go or You shall go tomorrow. Notice also that we say I
   hope he will go and I hope he may go, both indicating future
   action.

   As a way of. expressing future obligation, is to is often
   more useful than shall. Even in commands, You are to hand
   in the exercises next Monday is as often used as You shall
   hand in, etc. Where several subjects are designated, is to is
   probably more convenient than shall: The first year students
   are to enter first, and the second year students are to follow
   them (instead of students shall, etc.). Also in stating that
   something was going to take place in some past time (after-
   past), was to, instead of should, is the correct expression. The

.. _P362:

   ship was to arrive that afternoon (not ship should) means that
   the ship had not yet arrived at that past time, but was going
   to arrive.

   Exercise 103. Translate the following from Chinese into English:--

   1. 明天也许他不家。
   2. 也许明天他不见了，这是很可能的事。
   3. 这出戏（play）成功不成功不一定。
   4. 子路应在前走，子贡应跟着他。
   5. 我就走了，因为我还要去看几位朋友。(过去)
   6. 那天下午正要开学。
   7. 你们一听哨响（whistle)，就得聚集操场(playgroynd)上。

   13.34. Present Used for Future.--In English, the present
   is used for expressing future action under two circumstances.
   First, the vbb. expressing the idea of “going”or “moving”
   are often used this way. Thus for I shall come, we simply
   say I am coming (iomorrow or next week), and not I am going
   to come. I am going and I am coming therefore really express
   future action (compare I am thinking, I am working now).
   Further examples are:--

      I leave tomorrow for Peiping.

      The ship sails next Saturday.

      He starts this afternoon.

      You are not going to tonight's meeting, are you?

      He is going away this summer.

      He is coming back next autumn.


   Secondly, in all clauses implying supposition, the present
   is used for the future. We say, If it rains tonight, I shall not
   go (never if it will rain tonight).

      Give him my best regards when you see him.

      By the time you return, there will be nothing left.

      Don't wait for me for supper, if I don't come back before seven.

      If you do this again (or If this happens again), you shall be duly punished.

      Tell him to wait for me, in case he calls.

      When he graduates from college, he will betwenty-two.

Past
~~~~

   13.40. Past Actions Are Facts.--Much more than ninety-
   nine per cent of the events in this world took place in the
   past. Hence it is that the past forms of vbb. are most frequently 
   used in stating facts. In this sense, the past constitutes the
   exact opposite of the future, which expresses a wish, a possibility
   or at most an expected event (see above §13.30). When we
   say He killed a man, we mean that the murder is already an
   established fact, but when we say He will kill a man, it is
   only a surmise, and even I will kil you consitutes nothing but
   a threat in the eye of the law.

   13.41. Use of the Past.--Because past actions are facts,
   the most common use of the past is in reporting events. Whole
   shelves of history may be written in the past tense with the
   exception of the dialogues and the writer's opinions of 
   incidental remarks. In making reports, scientific or otherwise, the
   past tense should always be used. The following is an example
   of a proper scientific report:--

      When the Congress of the Behaviourists assembled on the
      third day, a public experiment was carried out in the presence
      of the delegates and the local university professors to test the
      qbility of pigs to distinguish artificial pearls from realones,

.. _P364:

      Two professors were in charge of the pigs in the yard, properly
      numbered from one to twenty-four. After the President called
      the meeting to order, Professor Lavinsky led Pig No. One by 
      the right ear to a square previously marked. Athermometer
      was putin the pig's mouth, and the professor's assistant listened
      with a stethoscope held close to the subject's sides in order to
      observe its heart reactions, while a string of artificial pearls
      was held forth about thirty centimeters from the pig's snout for
      thirty minutes. After the reactions, if any, were properly
      recorded, astring of genuine pearls was produced at the same
      distance, and the subject's reactions were observed and recorded
      in the same manner. The number of gruntings was also recorded.
      The experiment was applied in identical manner to all the
      twenty-four subjects. After the complete series of experiments 
      was carried out, and the records showed no noticeable
      difference in the subjects' reactions to real and artificial pearls,
      the Congress unanimously came to the conclusion that pigs
      are [eternal truth or general statement] not capable of 
      distinguishing between real and artificial pearls of the kinds used.
      The meeting was adjourned at 12.30.

   Another very common use of the past which should
   be noticed by Chinese students is in the form of phrases
   like I knew, I thought, I didn't know, I didn't quite realize,
   I forgot, which are forms for expressing a previous thought or
   idea, usually given up at present. I thought is the same as
   我认为 and implies that I do not think so now. I knew ==
   我早知道, means I knew this before it happened. About the
   Same idea is expressed by Itold you long ago. These forms
   are very useful.

      I knew you would do it. (A way of approval, when a man has
      consented to do something after your persuasion.)

      I knew he couldn't doit.(I am a very wise man.)

.. _P365:

      I thought you didn't want me to come along. (A good excuse.)

      Oh, I didn't know you had a friend here. (Excuse for intrusion.)

      I thought you had decided to cut out smoking. (Gentle remonstration.)

      I thought you were an honest man. (Sarcastic remark.)

      I thought I was dealing with an honest man.

      He thought he could get away with it. (Now he knows he
      can't: said with some satisfaction.)

      That was what I thought, too. (I shared the mistake.)

      I told you long ago not to believe him. (But you would not
      believe me until it is too late.)

      I forgot to tell you that A wasn't coming.

   13.42. Past Visualized: “Dramatic Present,”--In telling
   stories, especially in passages of vivid description, the present
   tense is often used for what is known to be past events. The
   writer and the reader are supposed to be so absorbed in the
   account that the events seem to take place before their eyes.
   This is called the “dramatic present.” E.g.一

   Achilles is so angered by the death of his friend Patroclus
   that he changes his mind. He swears that his friend's death must
   be avenged.

   So Achilles once more appears before his camp. With a great
   shout, he enters the battle. The Greeks are overjoyed to see their
   hero again, while the Trojans gird themselves for a severe battle.

   Achilles sees Hector, and the two close in combat. Hard and
   furiously the two great warriors fight against one another, while
   around them the battle rages. The Trojan women look on from the
   ramparts with breathless excitement, for it is the greatest battle
   they have ever witnessed. Back and forth the tide of battle turns.
   Spear clashes with spear, and shield with shield, while the noise of
   chariots and horses and men's war-cries and women's shrill voices
   are heard in the general confusion.

   At last, Achilles's spear pierces through Hector's body. The

.. _P366:

   great Trojan falls. A great shout goes up from the soldiers of
   Agamemnon and rends the sky. The Trojan women are seized with
   fear and bitter sorrow. Some weep and some wail, while Hector's
   own mother and sisterstand quietly, silent as death.

   In his fury, Achilles takes off the helmet of Hector, and binding
   his dead body to the chariot, he drives it around the city wall, with
   Hector's head trailing in the dust. Three times Achilles drives his
   chariot around the city, while the Trojans look on aghast and
   terrified.

   It is a great day for the Greeks, and towards evening, there is
   great rejoicing in their camps.

   13.43. Tense in Dependent Clauses.--Generally, if the
   mainvb. of the sentence is in the past tense, the vbb. of the
   dependent clauses must be in the past tense also. Thus we
   say: Barker said (main vb.) that he was coming(dependent
   clause)/ It was reported (mainvb.) that Mr. Soong was going
   to resign (dependent clause). For ful study of this use and
   examples, sees 7.61.

Iregular Verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   13.50. Irregular Vbb.--The present, the past and the
   past participle are called the three “principal parts” of a
   vb. A regular vb. forms its past and p.p. by adding -ed,
   as return, returned (p.), returned (p.p.). In English, there are
   a good number of vbb.(among them, some very common
   ones, like come, go, speak, write, stand, sit, etc.), which do not
   form their past and p.p, this way and which are, therefore,
   called “iregular.” The irregularity is due to historical 
   development from earlier Indo-Germanic forms, while a great number
   of regular vbb. today were originally irregular. English vbb.
   from Latin or French sources are always regular (return, commence,

.. _P367:

   cease, remember), while all irregular vbb. are original
   Germanic words (with related forms in modern German, Dutch,
   Danish, and Scandinavian).

   For practical purposes, it is only necessary to study these
   vbb. under three heads: (a) those having one form, (b)
   those having two, and (c) those having three.

   (a) Some vbb, do not change at all or have only one form,

   Notice that all these are monosylabic words, with a final t
   (exceptrid. etc.). One never says hitted, cutted, setted. On
   the other hand, we have two alternate forms, knit and knitted,
   wed and wedded, quit and quitted for both the past and the
   P.P.

.. _P368:

   (b) We have vbb. with two forms, the past and p.p.
   being similar. Among these vbb,, the p.p. never ends in-n
   (except beaten, which really belongs under “c”). Those marked
   with an asterisk (*) have also regular past and p.p. with --ed.

   NOTES (1) Hanged as past and p.p. is used in the sense of
   "hanging a man to death;" hung is used in the other senses.
   (2) Sung and sprung are not in modern use for past tense.
   (3) The auxiliaries can, may, wil! and shall have only two forms
   (present and past, but no p.p.). These will be studied ing §13.60.
   (e) Finally we have vbb. which have three forms in the
   three principal parts. With the exception of the words begin
   and swim (which are nearer the words in “b”), these vbb. are
   always distinguished by the fact that they have their p. p.
   ending in -n.

.. _P373:

   NOTES.(1) The last p. pp. marked with an asterisk have 
   one form ending in -en. These forms are used chiefly (though not
   exclusively) as modifiers preceding nn., while the other forms
   without the _en ending are used as parts of a verbal tense. e.g.--
   ::

      A graven image.
      Molteniron.
      A proven or proved theory. Image has been (en)graved。
      Iron is melted.
      Theory has not been proved.
      A clean-shaven face. Have you shaved yet?
      A shorn lamb. Lamb's wool has been sheared.
      A forgottenincident. I have forgot (or forgotten) it.
      Il-gotten money. What have you got?
      A sunken bell. The ship was sunk.
      A drunken fellow. He was dead drunk.
      A disease-stricken district. I was quite struck by her beauty.
      Your bounden duty. That is bound to happen,
      A hidden word. Where have you hidden yourself?
      (hid rare)
      God's only begotten son.
      Laziness is begotten of the devil.
      Ashrunken face. The cloth has shrunk.
      The swine's cloven hoof (only in this sense; otherwise cleft: a
      cleft roof).

   (2) Distinguish carefully between the v.t. lay (lay a book down)
   and the v.i. lie (I he in bed); also between the regular load and the
   irregular lade:--
   ::

      lay [放]                laid              laid
      lie [卧]                lay               lain
      lade (rare)             lade              laden （与load意同）
      load                    loaded            loaded

.. _P374:

   (3) Distinguish between the p.p. borne (The whole burden is
   borne by him) and the p.p. born (A baby born).
   (4) Notice that flow and welcome are perfectly regular, although
   fy and come (also become) are irregular.
   ::

      ty[飞]            flew              flown                
      dow [流]          flowed            flowed
      come              came              come
      welcome           welcomed          welcomed

   Welcome is used as an adi. in You are welcome | He is welcome to
   say what he pleases.

   (5) Distinguish between see and saw:--
   ::

      see[看]              saw                  seen
      saw [锯]             sawed                sawn

   (6 Distinguish between the regular waken, awaken and the
   iregular wake, awake. All four words are used both as vv.t. and
   as vv.i., and all four mean about the same thing. Wake and
   waken are usually connected with up (I wake up, I waken up | wake
   him up, waken him up), while awake and awaken are not.
   ::

      awake                awoke             awoke, awaked
      wake                 woke, waked       woken, waked
      awaken               awakened          awakened
      waken                wakened           wakened

Auxiliaries
~~~~~~~~~~~

   13.60. Might, Could, Would, Shouid and Ought.--The past
   forms of the auxiliaries may, can, will and shall are, of course,
   might, could, would and should. In addition, there is the auxiliary 
   ought, which is the past form of the vb. owe. The use
   of these words should be specially studied.

.. _P375:

   (1) They are used as past forms in dependent clauses.
   When we transform a direct statement like “He said,‘I will
   come.” into an indirect statement, we have to substitute
   would for will: He said that he would come.

      I didn't know what I should do (=was to do) at the moment.
      He said he would be coming in a week.

      You didn't think he could do it, did you?

      I thought he might want to leave his home for a change.

      The doctor said that a week's rest should do him a lot of good,

      So I asked him to get the money ready, and he said that it
      should be arranged.

   (2) They are used to indicate something which is not
   true or which has not happened at present, especially in 
   connexion with I wish.

      I wish you would not talk like that.(You are talking in a
      very rude manner.)

      I wish I could go away for a vacation.(The fact is, I can't.)

      He thinks that he might be able to get the job (which be
      hasn't got yet).

      It would be a great pity to lose his service at the present
      moment.(Actually, he has not resigned yet.)

      You ought to realize that this isn't a public playground.

      I wish I could help you (but I can't).

   (3) They are used with like, want, care, think, be able
   to, etc. as modified or weakened statements. I like states
   directly an open fact that I like, while I should like suggests
   a gentler, less decisive meaning. The latter form is generally
   used in preference to the former.
   ::

      I should like to              He might be able to
      I should think                He might be willing to
      You wouldn't want to          I should love to

      I shouldn't want to           You would like to
      I shouldn't care to           He would want to
      I should be able to           She would care to

      I should think he must be there now.
      I shouldn't think so.
      You wouldn't want to play the whole afternoon.
      I should be able to tell you something more definite, if, etc.
      You should be able (You ought to be able) to do it.

.. _P376:

   (Review §3.67 for a fuller discussion of this use.)

   (4) The most common use of these past forms is as
   auxiliaries indicating a general supposition, without reference
   to time. Do you suppose that he could do it? means: is he
   the kind of man to do such a thing, whether now or at any
   time? If you put a lamb and a hungry lion together in the
   same room, what do you think would happen? The lion
   would eat up the lamb, of course. This is true at any time,
   and does not refer to the past or the present. We may say
   that would is used here to indicate a general tense.

      The ideal thing would be for a man to marry at about twenty-
      five and for a girl to marry at about twenty-two.

      That would be the best arrangement.

      Any one could do it.

      No one could do two things well at a time.

      General Chang Tsung-chang believes that a girl should be shut
      up in her house and should never appear in a public park.

      He is a very sensitive man, and if you tell (or: should tell) him 
      that he has got a loose button, he might be offended.

      Aspirin could be taken whole or dissolved in a glass of water.

.. _P377:

   Exercise 104. (A) Make sentences with I should like, I should
   think, etc.

   (B) The use of should, would, etc. to indicate a general supposi-
   tion is a most important habit to form in learning English. Avoid
   the following direct statements and change them into statements of
   general supposition:--

      1. If you take away his books, he has nothing to do and he
         sits the whole day without saying a word.
      2. I like to be an engineer.
      3. Is there a chance for me?
      4. If you don't look out, you fall down.
      5. He will not listen to his friends' advice.
      6. We two may pay him a surprise visit.
      7. Do you dare to go out in a pink pyjamas?
      8. It is best to let him alone.
      9. Do you care to come?
      10. Do you like to come along?
      11. I'm afraid that is a little difficult.

   13.61. Expression of the Past with Auxiliaries.--On
   account of the fact that the past forms would, should, could
   and might are usually used to express general time, a
   definite form for expressing the past with these auxiliaries
   (including may, must and ought) has been created by putting
   the principal vb. in the perfect tense. Thus we have He could
   do it (general tense), but He could have done it (past tense).

      I may have seen it.

      It must have been a mistake.

      Some one must have told you.

      You should have prepared your lesson.

      It would have been all right, if, etc.

      If the other banks had not helped, that bank would have failed.

      Who could have done this?

      You may have heard the story before.

      You should have heard him talk at the dinner.

      I should have run away.

      You should have resigned.

      He could not have seen me, because he was not there.

.. _P378:

   Exercise 105. These phrases are extremely important. Learn
   to make sentences with should have, could have, may have, might
   have, must have. Fill in the blanks in the following sentences:--

      1. He had a car and five servants in his house. So he must
         have -------- a rich man.
      2. How could you stand such a man for so long? If I were
         you, I should have --------.
      3. He knew all about it. Some one must have ---------- him.
      4. You kept us all waiting for an hour. At least you might
         have --------- us.
      5. He must have ------- this before.
      6. He suddenly left without telling any one of us. I think he
         must have --------.

   13.62. Declinable Substitutes for the Auxiliaries.--
   Because will, shall, must, can have become auxiliaries, these
   words are not declinable, i.e., they do not have a full 
   conjugation. There is, for instance, no past for must (He must
   go yesterday is not English). Modern English, however, has
   developed substitutes for these words, which can be expressed
   in any tense like other vbb. These substitutes are in every
   way as commonly used as the auxiliaries themselves: thus
   I am going to tell him is just as common a way of expressing
   future as I will (or shall) tell him. We have, then--

.. _P379:
   ::

      shall or will = be going to
                can = be able to
               must = have to

               Be Going to
      Past     I was going to see him.
      Present  I am going to see him.
      Future   I shall be going to see him.

               Be Able to
      Past     I was able to pay him.
      Present  I am able to pay him.
      Future   I shall be able to pay him.

               Have to
      Past     I had to pay him.
      Present  I have to pay him.
      Future   I shall have to pay him.

   Moreover, the future of past is expressed by was going
   to or was to. We were to hold a meeting that afternoon means
   that the meeting had not been held yet, but it was decided
   that a meeting should be held that afternoon. We say: The
   ship was to arrive the next morning, and not The ship should
   (past form of shall), etc.

   Exercise 106. Make sentences with the following:--
   ::

      I shall have to            He was going to
      You will have to           I am not going to
      He had to                  The meeting was going to
      We were to                 The next athletic meet is going to

Conjunctions Expressing Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   13.70. Conjunctions Expressing Time.--Among these
   conjj, some express sequence of time (before, after), and
   some express contemporaneity (when, while). Before and after
   are quite simple. The use of others will be illustrated below:--

   (1) Not until. Some Chinese students say I will buy
   a new hat until money comes, meaning 等钱来了，我要买一
   顶帽子. The Chinese teng (等) cannot be translated this way.
   Either say: I will buy nothing until money comes, or I will
   buy something when money comes.

      Now can you forgive him?----Not until he makes an apology.

      Not until the problem of militarists is solved, will there be any
      solution of the economic problems of China.

      I will stay (or: I will not go away) until (or till) his mother comes.

      We sat up last night till (or until) one o'clock. We did not go to
      bed till (or until) one o'clock.

      We will keep on (will not change) until the proper time cones.

      No one will be able to know the truth until the wounded man
      returns to consciousness.

      Until you told me I had no idea of it.

   (2) No sooner than, as soon as, directly, the moment.

      No sooner had he finished his last sentence than the audience
      stood up. As soon as he finished, etc.

      No sooner did I save up a few hundred dollars than some of my
      relatives fell sick or died. As soon as I saved up, etc.

      The moment you leave the office, everybody starts talking,
      smoking and doing anything but attending to his duties.

      Directly (or: As soon as) you leave, etc.

      Immediately he went away, some burglars went into his house
      and stole many things.

      There will be a great sensation, immediately (or: directly or as
      soon as) this news is spread abroad.

.. _P381:

   (3) While and when. Notice that we just as often
   attach while or when to the second clause as to the first in an
   English sentence. We were talking together when he entered
   the room is probably more idiomatic than When we were 
   talking together, he entered the room (cf. Chinese 我们在讲话之
   时他进来, but not 我们讲话在他进来之时). In any case, a
   when- or while-clause often stands at the end of an English
   sentence, while it seldom does so in Chinese. The English
   proverb says, “Make hay while the sun shines,” and not
   “While the sun shines, make hay.” When is often used like
   which for adding comments (§9. 62).

      You may just as well finish this up while you are waiting (or:
      while you have nothing else to do).

      I have no time to do any reading until I come back from
      office, when I am usually tootired. (Comment)

      Why do you have to be an official when you can make much
      more honest money in business?

      I often go to see him, when I have nothing to do.

      When a man is out of job, he will do anything for a living.

      What's the use of staying in office, when you can't do what you
      wanted to do for China?

      Don't wait unti they dismiss you, when it will be too late.
      (Comment)

      I like to do my writing at midnight, when all is quiet around
      me, and nobody calls and no telephone rings.(Comment)

      The Marshal goes to bed at seven in the morning, when 
      every-body is getting up, and gets up at seven in the afternoon,
      when everybody is about ready to go to bed, (Commnent).

.. _P382:

   Notice that when and while are often used to express a 
   relationship not pertaining to time proper.

      He is very short, while she is very tall.

      He is dark, while his wife is very fair.

      While (Although) it is true that he never visited China, he
      knew Chinese philosophy very well from the study of the
      classics.

      While (Although) you cannot have exactly what you wish, you
      have gained something that you did not expect.

      A ought to keep his promise, while B ought to help to make
      it possible for him to keep his promise.

      Why do you remain with him, when he does not care about you
      and does not even support you?

   Exercise 107. Make some sentences, using when for making
   comments and while meaning “on the other hand” or “although.”

Adverbs of Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   13.80. Adverbs of Time.--The following is a list of the
   most typical advv. or adverbial phrases indicating time. 
   Notice that we use after three days, three days after, three days
   before and three days ago for the past, while we use in three
   days, in a week, in a minute generally for the future: I shall
   come back in a minute. (He finished it in a week has a 
   diferent meaning.) Notice also that there is a difference between
   always and often, both of which are usually translated by the
   Chinese word ch'ang (常). He is always like that should be
   strictly translated by “他老是这样” and He is often like that
   should be transiated by “他常这样.” Presently does not mean
   at present, but by and by: I shall attend to this presently |

.. _P383:

   Presently (Soon afterwards) he appeared again. Every and next
   are not preceded by prepp,---every time, next Wednesday,
   next month.
   ::

      often, seldom                    this time,(the) last time, next
      ever, never                         time, every time (without

Ch XIV Fact And Fancy
---------------------

The Verbal Moods: Close Relation to Sentence Moods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   14.10. The Verbal Moods: Close Relation to Sentence
   Moods.--The usual classification of verbal moods is as follows:--

   (1) Indicative: I come! I shall come.
   (2) Imperative: Come!
   (3) Interrogative; Will you come?
   (4) Subjunctive: If he vome.
   (5) Ininitive: To come.

   The indicative mood is used for making statements, the
   imperative is used for giving commands, the interrogative
   for asking questions, the subjunctive for stating suppositions,
   and the infinitive for stating actions without any particular
   subjects.

   These verbal moods are but certain forms in the employment 
   of vbb. They do not conflict with the “sentence moods”
   studied in Chapter III, but help to form them. The interrogative 
   mood is naturally used in forming an interrogative
   sentence, and the imperative mood is used in sentences which
   are commands, etc.

   14.11. Fact and Fancy.--Among verbal moods mentioned
   above, the only one that has peculiar forms is the subjunctive
   mood (if he comel if I were). But this subjunctive mood is
   important not only because of its peculiarforms. From the
   notional point of view, it represents a very important psychological 

.. _P386:

   distinction between fact and fancy in the speakers of
   the English language, a distinction which is not observed in
   Chiness.

   14.12. Subjective and Objective Moods.--From a notional
   point of view, we may divide the verbal moods into two
   classes:subjective（主观) and objective（客观）. He came，for
   instance, is a bald statement of an objective fact; He might
   come | He would come | if he should come are statements of
   subjective judgments. In That is a mistake, the vb. is is 
   definitely used to state a fact (although it may involve a 
   subjective judgment), but in That must be a mistake | That would be
   a mistake! That might be a mistake, the vbb. must be, would be
   and might be state only subjective opinions.

   The “subjective moods” may also be called “potential
   moods” (see §3.71-3.77). They cover a wider field than
   the old term “subjunctive mood.” For instance, in I hope
   you will come, will come is really a subjective statement (a
   hope) although in form it is said to be in the indicative, and
   not the subjunctive, mood.

The Subjunctive Mood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   14.20. The Subjunctive Mood: Shifting of Tense.--It is
   necessary to study the forms of the subjunctive mood first. We
   have the following forms:--

   (1) If I had known. (Past)
   (2) If I knew. (Present)
   (3) If I don't come home tonight. (Future)
   (4) If I (should) know. (General)

.. _P387:

   In addition, we have to examine the subjunctive forms of the
   vb. to be (if he be I if he were I if he was).

   It will be noticed that there is a shifting of tense in the
   subjunctive mood. The past perfect is used for the past, the
   past for the present, and the present for the future. Form
   (4) will be discussed separately (§14.21).

   Contrast the following subjective and objective statements:--
   ::

      OBJECTIVE                     SUBJEGTIVE
      It was a failure.             If it had been a success.
      It rained yesterday.          If it hadn't rained.
      I knew nothing about it.      If I had known.
      I hnow nothing about it.      If I knew.
      That is a lie.                If it was a fact.
      I have only a dollar left.    If I had more.
      He thinks so.                 If he thought otherwise.
      You are studying English.     If you were studying French.
      I shan't come home tonight.   If I don't come home tonight.
      It will rain.                 If it rains tonight.
      War will break out soon.      When it breaks out next week.
      You will see him tonight.     When you see him.

   Exercise 109. Finish the following sentences in the subjunctive
   mood:---

   1. He forgot to bring a dictionary. If he...not....
   2. I stopped him. If I...not....
   3. It rained last night, as you could see the road is wet. If it... not...
   4. I have very little money. If I....
   5. He is very clever, but a little too talkative. If he....
   6. (I am not in your place.) If I...you....
   7. Don't let him know. If he....
   8. I shall go and see him. And ifI...not find him....
   9. What will you do, if you...(die? shail die?) tomorrow?
   10. She will marry him, no matter what...(happens? will happen?)

.. _P388:

   14.21. General Supposition: If He Should Have, If He
   Have.--The word “should,” as is already discussed in §3.76
   and 13.60, is used for stating general suppositions. The form
   it...should is probably the one most commonly used for this
   purpose.
   ::

      If you should ever need money.
      If there should be (Should there be) a vacancy.
      If he should forget.
      If I should die now.
      If he should become the president.
      If you should be interested in this matter.
      If that should be the case.
      If there should be a war between China and Japan.
      If some one should say to you today.

   As has already been pointed out, these sentences do not refer
   to any particular time, although sometimes a time may be
   indicated. We may say that these are general suppositions,
   belonging to the general tense.

   Furthermore, should is also used in connexion with lest,
   for fear, in case, and other subjective clauses.

      I shall send him a written word, lest he should forget.

      Lest you should think I was unwilling to help you, I am 
      enclosing herewith some money.

      I am putting the money in different banks, in case (lest) some of
      them should fail.

      He is doing it for fear (lest) people should misunderstand him.

      In case you should need my help, just let me know.

.. _P389:

   Having made this clear, we may proceed to study the
   English subjunctive forms: if he come | if he be | if he have.
   Such forms are not in common use at present in standard
   English (which prefers if he comes | if he is | if he has or if he
   should come | if he should be | if he should have). Because they 
   are out of the way, the usual grammars pay more attention to
   them than is necessary. Such forms may be considered as
   the equivalents of the forms if he should come, with the should
   omitted. That is to say, whenever such forms occur, it is
   always possible to insert the word should in it. For example,--

      If it be said that, etc.--if it should be said that, etc.

      Although it be the last thing I desire-although it should be, etc.

      Lest he hear about it=lest he should hear, etc.

      Suppose that he return you the money =suppose he should
      return you, etc.

      The court ordered that he leave the city at once, or that he be
      hanged to death-the court ordered that he should leave,
      etc., or that he should be hanged.

      He agreed to go, on the condition that his family expenses be
      (=should be) well provided for.

      The widow was bequeathed the whole estate, provided she
      remain(=should remain) unmarried.

   Exercise 110. The word “should” is very often used in all
   statements that do not definitely state a fact, as It is proper that
   you should, etc. Make sentences with the following phrases:--

   1. If...should....
   2. What if...should...？
   3. Should there be a.....
   4. How should I..?
   5. I would...whenever he should.....
   6. Should you..., would you...?
   7. Lest...should....

.. _P390:

   8. In case he should....
   9. For fear he should....
   10. It is proper that...should....
   11. It is not right that...should....
   12. It is beyond my understanding that...should...
   13. I am thinking whether...should....
   14. I do not doubt that you should be able to...
   15. It is incredible that... should....
   16. Don't you think you should...?
   17. I can't understand why..should....
   18. I can't believe that...should....
   19. It was his mother's idea that he should....
   20. It was our plan that...should....

   14.22. Different Degrees of Supposition.--Attention has
   already been called to the existence of several subjunctive forms
   (§3.77). In a simple sentence referring to the present, we
   could use the following forms:--

   (1) If he comes
   (2) If he come (if he should come, should he come)
   (3) If he camne

   The question is, how should one distinguish them in actual
   use? In order to understand this, we should know that there
   are different degrees of supposition, from a supposition which
   may quite possibly be true (if he comes), to a purer form of
   supposition (if he should come) and even a supposition which is
   definitely untrue (if he came for the present, and if he had
   come for the past). Just what degree of supposition is used
   depends entirely on the intention of the speaker.

   (1) Past suppositions are untrue. Past events are facts
   (see §13.40). Hence whether a statement in the past tense
   is true or untrue is generally known, and an imagined on

.. _P391:

   supposed event in the past is known to be untrue. This is
   easily seen in the following examples:

      If it had rained last night, the roads would be wet (It did not
      rain last night.)

      If I had not stopped him, he would have been killed.(I did
      stop him.)

   (2) Future suppositions are uncertain. Future actions
   or events have not yet taken place, and therefore future 
   statements seldom state a fact, but a wish (I will go), an 
   obligation (I have to go), a possibility (I may go), or an expectation
   (I shall go). In any case, there is almost always a strong
   subjective element (see §13.30). The subjunctive form (if
   it rains tomorrow: also general tense form, if it should rain
   tomorrow) always implies an uncertainty.

   (3) Present suppositions vary. The most common form
   used is the ordinary indicative: if he comes. When a greater
   degree of supposition is meant, the general tense-form if he
   should come (now) is used. This may be called a purer form
   of supposition. If he come (instead of if he should come) is
   used with still greater subjective effect, as in arguments: even
   if he come / though he be a millionaire / provided he obey strictly
   my orders. A more direct and still purer form of supposition
   is if he came, or even if he came, which almost always implies
   that the supposition is untrue.

   Exercise 111. Decide which form should be used in the following 
   sentences, and examine the degree of supposition invoived,
   whether it is possible, supposed, or untrue. Notice that the 
   ordinary indicative is very often used for the present.

.. _P392:

   1. What if I don't (didn't?) want to heip you?
   2. What does it matter, even if it is (was?) true?
   3. I will have that treasure searched for, even if it cost (should
      cost? costs?) me a hundred thousand dollars.
   4. What can (could?) he do, even if you refuse (refused?) him？
   5. Go and see if he is (be? was?) here.
   6. If we want to obtain government by law, we must see to it
      that corrupt officials are (be?) duly punished.
   7. If he ever comes (should ever come?) back, do not take him in.

   14.23. If I Was, If I Were.--In the cases of the vb. to
   be, an additional distinction is made between if I was and
   if I were (also if he was, if he were) for the present. Both 
   state probably untrue suppositions, but I were, he were 
   emphasize their untrue character more than I was, he was. 
   However, both forms are quite in common use in modern English,
   sometimes almost without distinction.

      He could not know everything unless he was a god.(In this
      connexion, was is perhaps preferred to were.)

      If I were you, I wouldn't tell him about it.(In this phrase,
      invariably were)

      Even if I was (or were) here, what could I do?

      It were better (short for it would be better) that you never
      saw him again.

      I know that if he was here, he wouid deny it.

The Potential Moods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   14.30. The Potential Moods.--The “potential moods”
   are but another name for the subjective moods. In Chapter
   III (§3.71-3.77), the potential moods of sentences have
   already been studied. These moods cover all subjective statements

.. _P393:

   of wish, command, request, doubt, fear, hope, judgment,
   advice, need, courage, presumption, conjecture, possibility, and
   other kindred statements. Here we shall review them once
   more, with special regard to the verbal forms used. They do
   not always employ the subjunctive form, but generally reipuire
   some auxiliary or helping vb.

   (1) Command, request, suggestion. The subjunctive
   form is most frequently used with this class of statements. The
   present tense iusually called “subjunctive present”) is used
   even for the pasttense.

      The Captain commanded that he go at once. (Go=should go,
      see §14.21.)

      It is requested that the patient be (not is) allowed to have some
      food brought to him.

      I suggest that you go (not will go) and fetch him.

      It is the people's desire that the king resign (=should resign) and
      be (notis) replaced by his nephew.

   (2) Condition and Concession. The subjunctive (past or
   present) is often used, though the ordinary indicative is 
   perhaps more common. For their choice, see §14.22.

   Condition:--

      I don't know if this be (or is) true.
      If it come (=should come or comes) to that, I would fight it
      out in court.

   Concession:--

      Although she is (indicative) rich, she is not happy. (It is a
      fact that she is rich.)

      Though she be (subjunctive) the richest woman in town, she
      would not be satisfied.(A supposition.)

      You have done very well, although you might (or could) have
      done better.

      Still I am not for it, although all that you say may (or might)
      be quite true.

.. _P394:

   (3) Wish. A wish often refers to an untrue supposition,
   and therefore the past tense is quite generally used (sees
   14.22, form “3”). See also §3.73.
   ::

         I wish I knew.
         I wish I were dead.
         I wish I were in your place.
         I wish you would (or could) come.(Not will.)
      But: May God bless you! May the Devil take you!

   (4) Hope, fear, doubt. These often involve forecast
   of future events, and therefore very naturally employ the 
   future will (2nd and 3rd persons) and shall (1st person).

      I doubt whether I shall be able to do it.

      I have no doubt he will be able to do it. (Is able is also correct,
      but less common.)

      I am afraid I shan't be able to come.

      I'm afraid that will be the end of his romance.

      I hope you will come. (But: “I hope you are satisfied”--referring 
      to the present.）

      We hope that China will become (not becomes) a strong nation.

      There is no doubt he is the best boy of the class. (Referring to
      the present.)

   (5) Judgment and supposition. This has been fully
   covered in §14.21-14.22 already. The purer the supposition, 
   the more the subjunctive form is used. “That might be
   true” has a stronger subjunctive connotation than “That
   may be true.” Compare “I suppose he can do it apd I know
   he is going to doit” with “I suppose he could do it, if he
   wanted to.”

.. _P395:

   (6) Obligation. In British usage, ought is quite often
   used, much more so than in American usage, which oftenuses
   should instead.
   ::

      You oughtn't to do it.
      You ought not to speak like that.
      I ought to have told you.

   (In American dialects the vulgar form had ought is often used
   for the past tense.)

   (7) Conjecture. In making conjectures about unknown
   things, can (or could) is usually used in the negative sense,
   while must is usually used in the affirmative sense.
   ::

      It cannotbe due to his ignorance.
      The mistake must be intentional.
      It could not have been stolen by some burglar.
      It must have been stolen by some one among the servants.
      Yes, I think that must be true.
      That must be a mistake.
      No, it cannot be a mistake.

   (8) Possibility. May or might is used according to
   the circumstances or the degree of supposition.
   ::

      That may be your last chance.
      He might still succeed,
      You might burn down the whole house.
      He may recover.
      If I give you all the money now, you may spend it all.

Ch XV Relationships
-------------------

Conjunctions and Logical Relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   15.10. Conjunctions and Logical Relatiunships.--The conjunctions 
   in any language serve to bind the various parts of a
   sentence together. Grammatically speaking, they are the
   joints of the sentence structure. Notionally speaking, their
   function is to express the logical relationships. This fatter
   view is broader and more comprehensive. We see, for instance,
   that English sentences often begin with coniji. like “and,”
   “therefore,” “but,” or “because”: “And I went away”) “Therefore 
   I went away” / “But how can I do it?” / “(Why didn't
   you go?) Because it was too late.” It would be easy to find
   their logical relationship with the preceding sentence, whereas
   it would not be so easy to establish their grammatical 
   relationship with the same, because every sentence is supposed to be a
   separate unity.

Simple, Compound and Complex Sentences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   15.20. Simple, Compound and Complex Sentences.--The
   parts of a simple sentence may all be classified as shown in
   the following scheme:---

.. _P397:
   ::

                                 Predicate
                        ╭───────────┴───────────╮
      (I) Subject | (2) Principal Vb./(3) Object
         (4)  (5) Modifiers which mmay be
          │       attached to any of the three
          │       parts above (and sometimes to
          │       one another)      │
          │                         │
      ╭──────────────╮              │
      │ Conjunctions │              │
      ╰──────────────╯              │
               ╭─────────────────────────────────────────╮
               │ Participial phrases (adj. phrr.)        │
               │ Infinitive phrases adj. or adv. phrr.)  │
               │ Pronominal phrases (adj. or adv. phrr.) │
               │ Participles                             │
               │ Nouns in apposition, §8.40              │
               │ Nouns & Verbs (rarely), see §9.27.      │
               │ Adverbs                                 │
               │ Adjective                               │
               ╰─────────────────────────────────────────╯

   The above accounts for the structure of simple sentences. 
   Interjections or exclamations are practically independent in their
   nature. In such simple sentences, conii. are chiefly used to
   join modifiers: “I saw a good and handsome boy”) “He worked
   hard and fast.” The subject and principal vb, remain simple
   in nature.

   Then we have another kind of sentence where we have
   either two subjects to one vb. (He and I went), or two vbb. to
   one subject (He came and went). Some grammars consider
   these already as compound sentences in contracted forms(= He

.. _P398:

   went and I went | He came and he went contracted). But this
   has no practical meaning except for grammarians who are in
   the habit of classifying things.

   Thirdly, we have real compound sentences, like the
   following:--
   ::

      He went away, so i came.
      I came, because he went away.
      Either you said so, or you didn't.
      You broke it, therefore you must pay for it.
      He wanted to go, but he didn't.

   It is seen in the above that the conij. so, because, etc. serve
   to connect two separate sentences into one, each part having
   its own subject and predicate.

   So far, no clause has been introduced that is woven into
   another clause. He went away is clearly separate from I
   came. The moment we introduce a clause which is woven into
   another, or serves as part of its structure, we have what is
   called a compiex sentence. For example--

      I didn't say this. (Simple)

      I didn't say that I wouldn't go. (Complex: that I wouldn't go
      serves as object in the main clause.)

      That is unknown to me. (Simple).

      How he did it is unknown to me. (Complex: noun clause as subject.)

      The man went away. (Simple)

      The man who was with you went away. (Complex: relative
      clause as modifier of man）

   In the above three examples of complex sentences, we have
   the conii. that, how and the relative pron. who serving to
   connect the new clause with the original main clause. A

.. _P399:

   relative pron. is really only a conjunctive pron., just as a
   relative adv.(the time when, the place where) is only a 
   conjunetive adv., because its function is to connect the new clause
   with something else, besides serving its regular function inside 
   the relative clause.

Co-ordinate and Subordinate Clauses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   15.30. Co-ordinate and Subordinate Clauses.--In the
   complex sentences, it is clear that there is always one main or
   principal clause, and one or more subordinate or dependent
   clauses. The dependent clause is woven into, or dependent
   upon, the main clause, and is therefore rightly regarded as of
   lower rank. Thus in The man who was with you went away, the
   clause who was with you is dependent on the main clause The
   man went away.

   But even in some compound sentences, we can distinguish
   between main and dependent clauses. In He came, but I went,
   both clauses are evidently of equal importance, and there is no
   main or dependent clause. But in He would come, if I would
   go, clearly the first clause (He would come) is the main 
   statement, and if I would go describes only a condition of his
   coming. The second clause is therefore felt to be of less
   importance or lower rank than the first. Thus we can have
   a main clause and a dependent clause even in a compound
   sentence.

   In such compound sentences, just what clause is considered 
   main or dependent, and whether the two clauses are of
   equal or unequal importance depends entirely on the meaning.
   It cannot be judged from the grammatical form。 Conii. like

.. _P400:

   and, both, either...or, but, as well as, not only...but also naturally
   introduce co-ordinate clauses (ofequal rank). On the other
   hand, conjj. like if, because, although, since, in order that, so
   that, lest naturally introduce subordinate clauses (or lower
   rank).

   Following are some illustrations of the difference between
   co-ordinate and subordinate clauses, as determined by their
   meaning (words in italics are conji. or conjunctive phrases):--

   Co-ORDINATE CLAUSES (equal rank)

      He was a thief, and she was the thief's wife.

      This one is good, but that one is not.

      Not only is it possible, but it is also desirable to have him go
      with you.

      Neither is this mine, nor is it yours.

      This is all very well; still, it is not enough.

      The rich man becomes richer, while the poor man becomes poorer.

      She became very weak, whereas she had been very strong and
      healthy before her marriage.

      You must do as I say; otherwise (or: or else) I will have
      nothing to do with you.

   SUBORDINATE AND MAIN CLAUSES (unequal rank)

      I will tell you, if you will promise not to tell any one.

      Unless you promise, I cannot tell it to you.

      We climbed over the top, in order that we might get a better view.

      He began to do his best, lest he should fail again.

      I said that he was no person to take up this business.

      So long as you persist, I will not give you any money.

.. _P401:

Logical Relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   15.40. Logical Relationships.--All conjj. express some
   kind of logical relationship. These relationships may be 
   classified roughly under the following heads, under each of which,
   we shall examine the means of expressing them in English.
   The conjj. play the most important role, together with the
   conjunctive parts (relative pronn. and relative advv.). 
   Prepositional and participial phrases are often employed instead
   of clauses introduced by conjj.; in fact, they are always shorter
   and therefore make the sentences simpler and easier to handle.

   15.41. Combination.---The commonest form of relationship 
   is combination. And and both..and may connect any kinds
   of words or groups of words.
   ::

      He was [both] defeated and tired (combining adjj.).
      He played [both] fast and beautifully (advv.).
      We saw each other off and on (advv.).
      The arrow pierced into and through his chest (prepp.).
      I paid both for him and [for] his friends (prepp.).
      Both he and his wife escaped (subjects).
      He was strong and he was handsome (clauses).
      Men must work and women must weep (clauses).

   Other similar relationships are expressed by as well as,
   not only...but (also), furthermore, besides, in addition, what is
   nucre, on top of that:--

      He was well as his secretary, was found guilty.

      We not only dined together, but also danced together.

      Not only did we dine together, but we also danced together.

      It was not only unfair; it was contemptible.

      He was not only found guilty, but was also condemned to life
      imprisonment.

      Besides(conj.), it is against my principles.

      Besides (prep.,) giving him moncy and advice, he also bought
      the steamship ticket for him.

      I have, in addition, last month's bills to pay.

      What is more, the prisoners were subjected to flogging and
      torture, in addition to poor food and unhygienic surroundings.

      On top of that, they were denied all intercourse with their friends.

.. _P402:

   15.42. Opposition.--Probably the most useful conj. for
   expressing opposition is the word however. Other words and
   phrases are: but, while, whereas, far from, on the contrary, on
   the other land, despite (prep.), in spite of (prep.) and the simpler
   prepp. contrary to and against. While but is the simplest and
   commonest in use, however is most useful both as a variation
   from but and as a conj. which could be placed in different
   parts of a sentence, thus making for a smoother and more
   fexible construction. Nevertheless is also very useful, 
   conveying a deeper sense of contrast, while notwithstanding (prep.)
   is a little archaic.

      However, I am merely reporting this as a fact.

      This, however, is something different from what you said the
      other day.

      This is, however, something different, etc.

      This is something different, however, from what, etc.
      (For expressing a concession.--However much I may wish to
      help you, I can't. See §15.45.)

      But you said you could.

      While this position offers you honour and power, it imposes on
      you also a great responsibility.

.. _P403:

      He claimed that opium had been completely suppressed in that
      district, while the facts are exactly to the contrary.

      Contrary to what he said, the growing of poppies has been
      systematically enforced upon the people against the people's
      wish.

      In opposition to what you read in the newspapers, the prisoner
      has really never received a fair trial.

      Far from wishing him any ill, I have been offering him the best
      advice a friend can give.

      On the contrary, his expenses were all subsidized by the Japanese
      news agency.

      On the one hand, he took money from the Government, on the
      other hand, he was carryingon anti-government propaganda.

      On the other hand, there is this to be said for him.

      Despite (In spite of) repeated warnings, he went to Manchuria.

      She married him in spite of her father's opposition (against
      her father's wish).

      Nevertheless, she married.

      She married all the same.

      For all (In spite of all) your trouble, nothing has been gained or
      accomplished.

   15.43. Selection and Substitution.--For selection, we
   have either...or and neither...nor. Either may be used alone
   at the end of a,clause or sentence, meaning “also.” Neither
   and nor may both beused alone at the beginning of sentences,
   meaning “also not.” For substitution, we have the phrases:
   instead of (prep.), in place of (prep.), otherwise, or, or else, Or
   has two meanings:(1) suggesting an alternative,=或是,(2)
   =otherwise, 不然.

      You are either a fool or a knave.

.. _P404:

      Either you are a fool or you are a knave.

      Either you are tryn:g to deceive me, or you have been deceived
      yourself,

      Either he goes or I go (i.e., we cannot work together).

      Neither you nor anybody else can persuade him to give up writing poetry.

      God is neither here nor there.

      Neither of you knows the exact truth.

      Either of us (Either you or I) must go.

      You cannot do it. Neither (or Nor) can I. I cannot, either.

      You do as I say, or (=otherwise) out you go.

      You had better hurry, or (otherwise) you will be late.

      You can send him along, or else you can go yourself.

      Otherwise, how could he come in?

      Instead of being dressed up for dinner, he came down in his
      dressing gown.

      Instead of this, he took that. He took this instead of that.

      Instead of improving his service, he became worse.

      I came in his stead (or place).

      Instead of a Li Hung-chang, we have a graduate of Oberlin.

      In place of the old manager, we have a new boss in the person
      of McKinley.

      Government by law, instead of by personal privilege, is what we
      want.

   15.44. Exclusion and Inclusion.--The present participles
   excluding, excepting, including are placed at the beginning of
   clauses, while their passive forms (excluded, excepted, 
   included) are always used after the words they modify. Except,
   excepting, and but are all used in the same sense, both as
   conii. and as prepp. Except=除非. But for often appears as a

.. _P405:

   phrase, meaning “except for”=如非. Too is more common
   and idiomatic in modern English than also. Both words may
   be used at the middle or end of sentences, while also often
   stands at the beginning.

      We have ten working days left this week, excluding the Sundays
      (or the Sundays excluded)。

      We will take in all applicants, foreigners (or: Chinese) excepted。
      Excepting for a little over-use of red and green, the painting is
      perfect.

      But for your help, I might have died.

      The hospital has a staff of thirty, including the nurses(=nurses
      included=- with the nurses included).

      “I can resist everything except temptation,” says Oscar Wilde.

      When we arrived, we saw nothing except three persons sitting
      in the front row.

      That is true, too. This is also true.

      He came along, too. He, too, came along.

      He came also. He also came.

      Also(=Moreover), it must not be forgotten that he was born
      of Indian parents.

      That is also a good thing. That, also, is a good thing. That is
      a good thing, also.

   15.45. Condition and Concession.--If, providing, provided
   and on the condition that are used to express a condition.
   Though and although are used with very little difference to
   express a concession, as also granting and granted. At the
   beginning of sentences, although is more common than though.
   Granting, providing are less common than granted, provided,
   but mean the same as the latter words. The use of as and
   while in this sense should also be observed.


.. _P406:

      Measles is not a dangerous disease, provided you keep the child
      in a closed room and maintain an even temperature.

      Many incurable diseases are really curable, providing (=if）
      you begin treatment early.

      Providing (or: Provided) everything goes off smoothly as we
      planned, there is no reason why you should not succeed.

      Although he is poor, he is honest.

      He is honest, though poor.

      He cannot make both ends meet, atthough he tries his best to save.
      (Elliptical) Do your best (=Although you may do your best),
      but you won't succeed.

      Try as you may (=Although you may try as hard as you
      please), you won't succeed.

      Hard as I tried (=However hard I tried), I could not hit the mark.

      Willing as I was (=Although I was willing) to help him, I had
      to send him away empty-handed.

      While (Although) I admit that it is so, still I cannot absolve
      him from all blame.

      While (Although) he was not the only person to blame, he was
      principally responsible for it.

   Exercise 112. Make sentences implying concession or admission, 
   making use of the above conjj. with the above sentences as
   models.

   15.46. Cause and Effect.--The common words expressing
   cause are the conii. because, as, since, the prepp. owing to,
   on account of, and the participial phrase. Effect is expressed
   by: hence, therefore, consequently, in consequence, as a 
   consequence, with the result that.. Hence always stands at the 
   beginning of the clause, while the position of therefore varics
   exactly as the word however (§15.42). Owing to and on
   account of are prepp. followed by nn. or verbal nn. (--ing),

.. _P407:

   and therefore make for shorter sentences. They do not form
   clauses, but only prepositional phrases.

      Therefore, there was no way for me to do it.

      There was, therefore, no way for me to do it.

      There was no way, therefore, for me to do it.

      There was no way for me to do it, therefore. (rare)

      As I did not want to see him, I sent him a letter.

      As it was his fault, he had to make it up to him.

      As the train was two hours late, we strolled round the neighbourhood.

      Well, since you say so, I will go.

      Since there was nobody else to go, I went myself.

      Since it is neither white nor black, it must be grey.

      Since that is the case, we might just as well go home.

      On account of his presence, we did not express any opinion.

      Owing to (Because of) his presence, etc.

      Because he was present, etc.

      As (Since) he was present, etc.

      Consequently (In consequence, As a consequence,) he died.

      died three days afterwards.

      He spoke for an hour and half with the result that the other
      speakers had no chance to say anything.

   Of particular interest is the English construction which, like
   many Chinese sentences, expresses cause without any conj.
   whatsoever. Examples of this typeare:--
   ::

      Love me, love my dog.
      Once a thief, always a thief.
      First come, first served.

   15.47. Motive and Purpose.--A slightly different relationship 
   is expressed by words denoting parpose or amotive.

.. _P408:

   Generally, cause and effect are regarded as more external (an
   external event), while motive and purpose are internal (a mental 
   reason for doing things). The participles thinking, seeing,
   hearing, knowing, believing, mistaking and other similar words
   describing mental states are often used in this way. Other
   phrases often used are: in view of, with a view to (--ing), in
   order that, in order to, so that, for the purpose of, out of
   (kindness, gratefulness, etc.), by way of, to the end that.

      Believing (Thinking, Hearing) that he was in Paris, she took the
      next train to France.

      In her hurry, she got into a train for Lyons, mistaking it for
      the Paris train.

      She went there, with a view to ascertaining(in order to 
      ascertain, for the purpose of ascertaining, so that she might
      asceitain) who was her husband's new love.

      It was done purely out of jealousy.

      Out of gratefulness (for returning the handbag), she gave the
      coolie a present of ten dollars.

      I was doing it just out of pity, not out of love.

      In order to stop this trouble, the Government is ready to close
      down the whole school.

      We gave him a hundred dollars just in order to shut up his
      mouth.

      By way of illustrating what he meant, he produced a chart of
      the club's activities.

      We should all work and labour, to the end that the new movement
      may become a success.

   15.48. Comparison and Conformity.--The use of conji.
   for expressing comparison (more than, as...as) presents many
   grammatical peculiarities. This arises from the fact that a
   comparison always implies two compared members, whether
   nn., vbb., adjj., or whole groups of words. Thus, if I compare

.. _P409:

   my age with your age and say I am three years older than
   you, the two members compared are: I am old and you are
   old, or my age and your age. Naturally, the full meaning is
   I am three years older than you are old, but it would be
   foolish to repeat the second member compared. Hence there
   is always a shortening of the second member: in this case,
   shortened to you. Also, in I know you better than he does, does
   in the second member takes the place of knows you.

Such omissions and peculiarities in the second compared
   member have already been fully studied in §10.20 and
   10.50. Thus we have--
   ::

               Subject omitted:  He eats more than (what) is good for him,
                                 (See more than, §10.20, “1”)
                Object omitted:  He eats more than (what) he can digest.
                                 (See more than, §10.20, “1”)
       Subject and vb. omitted:  I love you more than (I love) her.
        Object and vb. omitted:  I love you more than he (loves you).

   Compare also the use of so... hat and so...as on p. 286 (§10.20, “2”)

   The second member of comparison may be a n., a vb.,
   an adj, an infinitive phrase, or a whole clause.
   ::

      Noun or pronoun:  This is better than that.
                 Verb:  I would do anything rather than let him get off like that.
        An infinitive:  He knows better than to go out alone on such a night.
         An adjective:  This is more than fine: it is excellent.
            An adverb:  I have read it more than once,
               Clause:  He spends more than he is earning.
                        She is as good as she is pretty,

.. _P410:

   We can also have a complex sentence in which the second
   member is woven into the first clause:

      This is as much as I can stand.

   Here we have the main clause This is much and the dependent
   clause as much as I can stand, serving as an adv. clause
   modifying much.

   The usual words expressing conformity are: according
   as (followed by a clause), according to (followed by a n.),
   in conformity with, in accordance with and accordingly.

      According to Rule Six, all cinema films made in China must be
      censored before they are exported.

      In accordance with that rule, I am submitting this for your 
      inspection,

      He said that all this had been done in conformity with their
      previous agreement.

      We treated them on the spot or sent them to a hospital 
      according as the wounds were light or heavy.

      He is drunk or sober, according as he wins or loses (according
      as he fares, or according to his luck).

   15.49. Time and Logical Relationships.--We have conii.
   and advv. expressing time relationships like as soon as, 
   meanwhile, after, introducing regular clauses. The usual advv. of
   this category, are, of course, when, while and as. It is found,
   however, that all such connecting words signifying time often
   develop a new meaning, which expresses another logical 
   relationship besides time. Thus in the sentence-

      Why do you try to help others, when you cannot even pay
      your tailor's bills?

.. _P411:

   the relationship expressed is not one of time merely, but of
   a contrasting aspect. Similarly, with while and so long as:
   --“Why doesn't he pay up his debt, while he is buying his
   wife new hats everyday?” | “So long as they don't see each other,
   they get along nicely; but the moment they come together, they
   start quarrelling all over again.”

   At the same time, in the meanwhile, in the meantime, 
   meanwhile and while express contemporaneous action, often with
   contrasting effect. Pending with the same sense, is a prep.
   As soon as, the moment, directly, immediately and after, expressing 
   a sequence of events, often imply an inner relationship of
   cause and effect also. The adv. once is particularly often
   used to express a causal relationship.

      Once you begin, you never know where you will end. (Cf. “一”
      in Chinese: “此例一开”, “一失足成千古恨”）

      Once you taste our dinner, you will come again.

      When once he understands, he will forgive everything.

      Immediately you try to do something, people will cry you down.

      The professor began his lecture the moment he entered the room.

      Directly (= As soon as) the teacher walked out of the room, there
      was an uproar.

      After I had done so much for the boy, he ran away and disappeared.

      At the same time, you must remember this is not all a matter
      of luck. One has to work hard, too.

      Meanwhile, you go ahead with your own work.

      Pending the construction of the new building, the students will
      be housed in the old dormitory.

      As soon as one goes away, another comes in.

Interrogative Adverbs and Pronouns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   15.50. Interrogative Adv。 and Pronn.--It is understood 
   that relative pronn. (who, what) and relative advv. (how,
   why, when, where) are partly conjj. and partly pronn. or advv.,
   as the case may be. But, whether they are serving as relative
   parts or not, these interrogative words can all begin noun
   clauses, and may, therefore, be considered as a kind of conjj.

      How he did it I do not understand.

      This is not a question of money, but of how much we can do
      with the money at our disposal.

      There was no question as to who was the guilty party.

      I cannot say whether it is right or wrong.

      That was the reason why he did it. (Relative)

      We will see what we can do for you.

      Tell me when you want it ready.

      Who breaks pays.

      He refused the offer but finally had to accept what was for
      worse than the first offer.

      I don't care where you live; you must come to the office at
      nine sharp [九点正].
 
      Where you live does not concern me.
 
Punctuation
~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   15.60. Punctuation: Logical and Phonetic Basis.--The
   punctuation marks or “stops” (as they are generally called in 
   England) include the comma, the semi-colon, the colon, the
   full stop, the exclamation mark or point, the question mark,
   the quotation marks (also called “inverted commas” in British
   usage), the brackets and parentheses, the dash and the dotted
   line. The use of these marks has a close relation to sentence
   structure.

.. _P413:

   There are some points in the use of punctuation marks
   which admit of dispute. So much depends on the basis of
   judgment. Some grammarians believe that their use should be
   strictly on a logical basis, the stops being used to make clear
   the logical meaning, while many people hold that the stops
   should be on a purely phonetic basis, their use being to help
   the reader to know where to stop and where not to stop
   while reading the sentence. The latter believe that only in this
   way can the author's style be correctly appreciated. All good
   literature, whether Chinese or English, should be read aloud to
   be truly appreciated, and the punctuation marks should guide
   the reader as to how the author intends it to be read. Illustrations 
   of this difference will be found in the discussions on the
   comma.

   It is clear, however, that beginners should not attempt
   to go upon the phonetic basis, as only after years of familiarity
   with language would one know exactly where a break had
   better, or had better not, be made in the reading. Only in
   the hands of expert writers may this principle be safely applied.
   The beginners and the average writers should go on the logical
   basis and attempt at the clearest expression of their meaning.
   The only principle involved is really Clearness. A great deall
   may be left to commonsense.

   15.61. The Comma.--The use or omission of the comma
   may often be disputed, much more so than that of the other
   marks. Some examples of these questionable cases will be
   given.

   (a) In enumeration, no comma should separate the
   last two items where “and”exists.

.. _P414:

      I bought a hat, a cane and a book. (Not cane,)

      Tom, Dick and Henry.

      She sings, writes poetry and plays the piano. (Cf. She sings
      and writes poetry and plays the piano.)

   On the phonetic principle, one might write: I bought a hat, a
   cane, and a book. Notice that when long parallel clauses or
   phrases are joined by and, the commais often quite necessary
   before it.

      She sings French songs, and speaks the French language fuently,
      and plays the piano.

      (On the phonetic basis, the first comma may or may not be
      omitted) She sings French songs and speaks the French
      language fiuently, and plays the piano.

   It is seen that the phonetic principle is less certain, but because
   it is so, it allows more room to express the intention of the
   author. Such punctuation, and such writing, would accord
   more closely with the actual spoken language. On the logical
   basis, one should omit the first and, as follows--

      She sings French songs, speaks the French language fuently
      and plays the piano.

   But we do not always speak like that in real life, and 
   therefore such sentences may give the impression of artificiality
   or stiffness.

   (b) Where we have two modifiers to one noun, the
   second modifier or modifying phrase is often separated by
   two or one commas.

      She bought a very expensive, but very good-looking (,) hat.
      He was a clever, but undependable (,) assistant.

.. _P415:

   Logically, we should have two commas, but phonetically,
   only one is required, as no one makes a pause between the
   last two words.

   (c) Common phrases or advv. may often be inserted
   without commas.

      Therefore (,) I went.

      That was (,) of course (,) a fact.

      Of course he knew.(Better than: Of course, he knew)

      Bul: This was, logically speaking, incorrect.

      To be sure, he was to blame.

      The envelope, strange to say, had been cut open.

   (d) Commonsense could decide the rest for securing the
   greatest degree of clearness.

      Any militarily weak nation would, like China, when she was
      invaded by Japan, resort to the boycott as the only weapon
      of defence. (The clause, when she was invaded by Japan,
      might be misinterpreted to refer to any nation; therefore,
      omit the comma after China and read:)

      Any militarily weak nation would, like China when she was
      invaded by Japan, resort to the boycott, etc.

   15.62. The Semi-Colon.--The semi-colon is usually
   used to separate parallel constructions or to mark a greater
   division of the sentence than is indicated by the comma. The
   characteristic of the semi-colon is that, with it, one can
   begin a new clause without any conjunction, E.g.--

      This was not due to carelessness; it was due to wilful neglect.

   The same sentence could be written as--

      This was not due to carelessness, but (it was) due to wilful
      neglect.

.. _P416:

   or-

      This was not due to carelessness. It was due to wilful neglect.

   One feels, however, that the two parallel statements are quite
   closely connected, and do not deserve to be separated by a
   full stop. The semi-colon, therefore, marks a division point
   between the full stop and the comma.

   Where the logical relationship justifies the use of a semi-colon, 
   it may be used even with a conj.--

      This was not ideal; still, it was the best one could expect under
      the circumstances.

   Exercise 113. Correct the following by replacing comas with
   semi-colons or otherwise with appropriate conii.--

   1. She was sent to Shanghai without her mother's knowledge,
      it was against the fatter's wish.
   2. Policemen were standing in the middle of the road, they
      stopped the tram-cars and the buses, automobiles were
      searched, and all passengers were subjected to a close
      examination.
   3. On the one hand, he could not do it himself, on the other,
      he tried to prevent others from doing it.
   4. Man proposes, God disposes.
   5. Firstly, he did not want to go, secondly, he was not the
      best man for it, and thirdly, Dick was realy to go in his
      stead.

   15.63. The Colon.--The colon is usually used when one
   or more examples of what has just been said are about to
   follow. It is also used when one statement repeats another
   statement in a different form.

      He said: “You have won.”

      The list is as follows: one hat, two canes, three pairs of boots, letc.

      Columbus discovered a string of islands: he did not discover
      the American Continent.

.. _P417:

   15.64. The Full Stop.--The full stop marks a complete
   sentence. There is a tendency in American journalism to
   make short snappy sentences, with full stops marking parts of
   sentences, which should not be imitated.

      “There is a tendency in modern newspapers to use short
      snappy sentences. The shorter the better. For the snappien
      they are, the happier the reader will be. Which is a good
      thing for the busy businessman.”

   The full stop is also used whenever there is an abbreviation
   of any sort. Examples are: Dr. (Doctor), Mr. (Mister), C.P.
   (Communist Party), Dec. (December), R.C.A. (Radio Corporation 
   of America), yrs. (yours).

   15.65. The Exclamation and Question Marks.--Although
   the use of these marks is a matter of commonsense, a warning
   should be given that mistakes are often made in their employment.

      She asked me how I did it. (Not a question)

      I was meditating how wonderful it all seemed. (Not an exclamation)

      You are coming, too? (Aquestion)

      You are not joking? (Aquestion)

      Is that a fact! (An exclamation; but the question mark might
      be used; or the two “?!” might be combined.)

      How dare you? (or you）)

   15.66. Inverted Commas.--Some people prefer to use
   the single inverted comma, but the double inverted commas
   are more in general use. Quotation marks should be regarded

.. _P418:

   as sacred; no word should be put within these marks
   which does not exist in the original quoted. If there is an
   omission, dotted lines should be used. If words are added, these
   should be put in brackets, as follows:--

      “He [Mr. Henderson]...would not allow anybody to 
      interfere with the policy of the Committee.

   A quotation within a quotation should be marked with a
   single or double inverted commas, according to which one
   has not been used at the beginning: either “He said, 'You
   have won,'” or 'He said, “You have won,”'

   In quotations extending over several paragraphs, the
   inverted commas are used at the beginning of all the
   paragraphs, but only at the end of the paragraph where the
   quotation closes. Thus--
   ::

      “............................
      “............................
      “............................”

   15.67. The Dash and the Dotted Line.--The dash is
   usually used to indicate an abrupt break of thought, with
   or without breaking off of the grammatical structure. There
   is no denying the fact that in actual life our thoughts do not
   run off in perfect sentences, but often change midway to
   something else, or are otherwise interrupted, before the original
   intended sentence is finished. Consequently, the modern personal 
   style often employs the dash to indicate this break of
   thought. Such sentences are often actually heard in 
   conversations, so that their use in letters or familiar essays will
   contribute to that informal and easy-flowing effect.

   (a) Sometimes, merely a pause is meant, as in the

.. _P419:

   following sentence:一-

      When the mandarin fell on the floor, the first thing he would
      do on getting up was to readjust his tortoise-shell 
      spectacles -- leisurely, correctly.

   (b) Abrupt breaks of thought are indicated in the
   following:--

      In order to get a divorce, you'll have to--oh, well, we won't
      go into that.

      I gave him full permission--in fact, I encouraged him, to
      examine the company's accounts.

      We had no money, no food, not suficient clothing, being
      stranded in a strange city, hounded by the police from
      place to place--you can imagine the rest.

   (c) The dash is also used after a colon, a comma, or
   a full stop, serving also to indicate a longer pause.

      The conditions are as follows:--

      Dear Sir,--

      For example,--

   (d) The double dash is used exactly like the parentheses 
   or brackets to indicate an inserted remark.

      After that, the three of us--i.e,, my wife, my wife's brother
      and myself--went into a restaurant.

   This is exactly the same as--

      After that, the three of us (i.e, my wife, my wife's brother
      and myself) went into a restaurant.

   The dotted line indicates an unfinished thought. In the
   modern style, sometimes the dotted line is used to indicate
   bits of thought, as in reminiscences. This method of description

.. _P420:

   is often more effective than perfectly connected sentences,
   because it is more suggestive.

      Shut up alone in the attic, I began to think of my early
      childhood. Effie playing in the garden... the nurse Jennie...
      my mother's smiling face...my father's stern eyes and prickly
      beard which tickled my little fingers...Jack my best school friend...
      the barn behind the backyard in which Jack and I used to
      play hide and seek...my story book with a green cover...the
      adventures of Captain Drake...

   Often paragraphs end off in a dotted line, by which the
   meaning is conveyed that the writer has so much more to
   say yet, but is willing to leave it off like that (不尽欲言).

   15.68. Parentheses and Brackets.--These two terms are
   sometimes used indiscriminately, but a proper distinction is
   made between parentheses “()” and brackets “[ ].”
   Too much use of parenthetical remarks shows a loose, slipshod 
   style and should be avoided, unless there is enough gusto
   in the writer to carry it through as, for instance, in the 
   writings of George Saintsbury. Parentheses may also contain a
   sign or a short phrase.

      This was the great (?) Dr. Forbes. (The insertion of the 
      question mark implies that the writer doubts Dr. Forbes'
      “greatness.”)

      indicates the appiause of the audience at Mr. Henderson's 
      remark.)

Loose and Periodic Sentences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   15.70. Loose and Periodic Sentence Structure.--Compare 
   the following groups of sentences:---

      (A) Loose Sentences--

      The dinner is at eight, if I am not mistaken.

      He writes fairly well, although he is a little inclined to
      use long words.

      (B) Periodic Sentences--

      If I am not mistaken, the dinner is at eight.

      Although he is a little inclined to use long words, he
      writes fairly well.

   In group “A,” the dependent clauses stand at the end, while
   in group “B,” they stand at the beginning. Although the contents 
   of the sentences are the same, the stylistic effect is quite
   different. In the first sentence, the speaker intends to Say
   “the dinner is at eight,” where the sentence could very well
   stop, but “if I am not mistaken” is added as an after--thought.
   In group “B,” the same sentence is conceived as a whole
   from` the beginning. Hence the first type (called “the loose
   sentence”) is more informal, more natural and less pretentious,
   while the second type (called “the periodic sentences”) is more
   correct and more formal. Both types have theirusefulness in
   conveying different effects. The danger is that the Chinese
   student is apt to use exclusively the periodic sentence type,
   with the result that the sentences will lose their informal 
   character, which is necessary to an easy, fowing style.

      The loose sentence does not exist in classical Chinese.

.. _P422:

   The Analects says 齐景公曰:“善哉!信如君不君, 臣不臣, 父
   不父, 子不子, 虽有粟, 吾得而食诺?” It would beimpossible
   to put the dependent clause at the end and say,吾得而食诸，
   虽有粟? or 虽有粟, 信如君不君, 臣不臣, 父不父, 子不子?”
   But in the modern paihua style, it is possible to say: “你
   的话好啊! 我那里有饭吃，虽然有粟，假如君不君，etc.”
   This is an improvement in the flexibility of the language,
   and makes possible a truly colloquial style.

.. _P423:

Ch XVI Economy Of Expression
----------------------------

Ease and Economy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   16.10. Ease and Economy.--Proficiency in any language
   means a certain ease in handling its sentence forms and 
   constructions. The foreign student is apt to err on the side of
   stiffness and over-correctness of expression. He says, for
   instance,“you must not” instead of “you mustn't,” and
   “if it is possible” instead of “if possible.” These simpler forms,
   however, are used to a very large extentby the native speakers,
   for every language has naturally evolved certain omissions and
   short cuts which make for ease and economy. The English
   language, in particular, is marked by its love of economy
   and simplicity of construction, for the Englishman does not
   use more words than is strictly necessary for his purpose. It
   is therefore very appropriate that we should conclude oun
   study of English grammar with a review of its various 
   word-saving and energy-saving devices.

Shifting of Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   16.20. Shifting of Function.--A n. generally makes for
   simpler and shorter sentences than other parts of speech.
   Compare the following sentences:--

      I saw hatred in his eyes. Or: His eyes seemed to show hatred.

      His eyes seem to show that he hated me.

      I have no fear of his running away.

      I am not afraid that he may run away.

      Cleanliness is next to holiness.

      To be clean is next in importance to to be holy.(A bad sentence)

      There's comfort for one's soul in smoking.

      When one smokes, one's soul feels comforted.(A bad sentence)

      Strive for simplicity of style.

      Strive to be simple when you write.

      He makes a virtue of necessity.

      Because he has to do it, he is making it appear that he
      loves doing it.

.. _P424:

   In all the above pairs of sentences, it is easily seen that the
   first example is neater, shorter, and on the whole a much
   better sentence than the second example.

   16.21. Change of Clauses into Phrases.--In consequence
   of the relative simplicity of nn. and complexity of finite vbb.
   (which entail with them a subject and perhaps an object),
   phrases which are without a vb. and subject are shorter and
   neater than clauses. This is especially true of prepositional
   phrases. The two words for fun can stand for he was not
   serious in, and the two words by necessity can take the place
   of the clause because he had to do it. Do it by turn is much
   shorter than You do it first and the others will do it one after
   another. During his absence is shorter than while he was away.
   In English, there are many pairs of prepp. and conii. which
   have the same meaning.
   ::

      PREPOSITIONS                     CONJUNCTIONS
      on account of his illness on     because he was ill
      because of illness

.. _P425:
   ::

      during his illness               while he was ill
      against, despite, in spite of    although I advised him to the
      my vice                          contrary
      for all my trouble, with all     although I (you) took so much
      your trouble t                   rouble

      with that, he went away          after he said that, he, etc.

      on hearing this                  when he heard this 
      but for my help                  if I had not helped him

      before coming                    before one came
      since his departure              since he left

   Many vbb. and adij, may be followed by a prepositional
   phr., an infinitive phr. or by a clause beginning with that.
   ::

      I am sure of his coming.
      Iamn sure to meet him.
      I am sure that he will come.
      He is afraid of death.
      He is afraid to die.
      He is afraid that be may die.
      He is thinking of going home,
      He is thinking to gohome.
      He is thinking that he must gohome,
      I am sorry for you.
      I am sorry to hear this.
      I am sorry that the letter didn't reach you.
      He was disappointed at their attitude.
      He was disappointed to hear that they did not care.
      He was disappointed that they took no interest in it.

.. _P426:

   16.22. Change of Phrase--Modifiers into Word-Modifiers.
   --Many phrases are used as modifiers and can be converted
   into word-modifiers. Thus, instead of saying “We are living
   in a China torn by civil wars,” one might write more simply
   “We are living in a war-torn China.” “If you go through
   the famine--stricken district” is simpler and better than “if
   you go through the district stricken by famine.” “How such
   modifiers are formed has already been fully explained under
   §9.26.

Ellipsis
~~~~~~~~

   16.30. Dropping of Auxiliary Words.--A few examples
   should suffice here--

      They had come and (had) gone.

      He had inherited and (had) spent a forturne.

      She was trying to start a ball, and he (was trying) to prevent it.

      She was trying to get into society, and he (was trying) to get
      away from it.

   16.31. Dropping of Principal Words.--This kind of
   ellipsis is especially common in answers to questions.

      Would you join? I should love to (join you).

      I should like to fry chicken or bake potatoes, but do not know
      how (to do it).

      He has declared bankruptcy. You don't tell me (that this is
      true)!

.. _P427:

      Would you speak at the next meeting? I would rather not
      (do that).

      Will you come? I think (I will) not.

      Why the hurry? (Why should there be such a hurry?)

      Why so? (Why is it so?)

      But how? (But how to do it?)

      How now? (How is it now?)

      What next? (What is to come next?)

      What about? (What is it about?)

      May I telephone to him now? You might just as well (do so).

      Is that correct? In a way (it is).

      Does he write poetry? Not any that I know of.

      Did you know of this? Not until now.

      (Do it) Gently, please.

      (That's) Enough! (That's) Impossible！

      He comes from the same place (as I do).

      I went to Enfield's (house or shop).

   16.32. Ellipsis in Dependent Clauses.--Dependent clauses
   are often subject to all sorts of mutilations in English (see
   §9.82).

      I'll come, if (it is) possible.

      Wash it in water, pick out the small particles, if(there's) any.
      and sun it in the air. Take it in, when (it is) dry.
      Replace it, if (it is) necessary.

      (When) Dinner (was) over, the ceremony was begun.

      I will bring her up all alone, (if) God (be) willing.

      You should come when (you are) called.

      When (you are) writing your mother, give her my warmest regards.

      When (you are) in doubt, consult the dictionary.

      Although (he was) the youngest of the class, he captured all the prizes.

.. _P428:

   Note also the frequent dropping of that in clauses:--

      He said (that) he was coming.

      I saw (that) he could not do it.

      He said (that) he had reveived word (that) Millie was not coming.

   The relative pron, that is also dropped when used as an
   object (§9.68):--

      The man (that) you saw.

      He was not the man (that) I wanted.

      He was the one (that) you were asking for.

      The things we have are not the things we want, and the things
      we want are not the things we have.

   The tendency to shorten dependent clauses has also
   brought about the use of words like as and but as relative
   pronn.--

      He came to apologize, as was expected.

      Anyway, he lost his job, as has been mentioned above.

      There is no one but admires his courage.

   16.33.“And that.”--In English, the phrase “and that”
   may stand for a whole preceding clause. E.g.--

      The poor boy was ordered to go out and fetch water, and that
      (i.e., go out and fetch water) on a stormy night like this.

      You had better pay up, and that (pay up) immediately.

Abbreviations and Contractions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   16.40. Contractions.--The contracted forms like isn't，
   aren't, won't, wouldn't, shan't, can't, are so common that they
   are part of the daily language. In fact, they have become
   the regular colloquial forms, so much so that when an Englishman 

.. _P429:

   says I shall not or I cannot, it suggests a slight emphasis 
   on not. Actually, the word not is always pronounced
   full [nɔt] and never [nət], so that there is no way of
   pronouncing this not except either with a clear vowel or
   contracted as indicated.

   In questions especially, the forms Are you not coming?
   or Can he not go himself? are more rarely used than Aren't
   you coming? and Can't he go himself? Do...not in questions
   is still rarer. One very rarely Says Do you not think so? or
   Does he not come here evergyday?, but uses forms with don't
   you and doesn't he. No student, therefore, can expect to
   speak English properly and idiomatically without mastering
   these forms (§3.51).

   The use of don't for the third person singular present
   has never yet been countenanced by grammar books. Actually, 
   he don't is extremely common today, even in lectures by
   Columbia University professors, for instance. The underlying
   reason is the unconscious desire for economy, for doesn't
   consists of two syllables, while don't consists of only one.
   That don't matter is certainly easier to pronounce than That
   doesn't matter. However, it is not for the Chinese students
   of English to be pioneers in English grammar reform.

   16.41. Abbreviations.--Abbreviations have alsobecome
   a part of the English daily language. Ordinarily, one says
   auto and not automobile, taxi and not taxi-cab, co-ed and not
   co-education, movie and talkie and not moving picture and
   talking picture,'phone instead of telephone, cinemainstead of
   cinematograph, and exam instead of examination. An advertisement 
   is referred to as an ad, and an omnibus is just a bus.

.. _P430:

   The Elevated Railways in New York is progressively 
   abbreviated thus: elevated--el.--L. In current English, one also
   speaks of “T.B.” (tuberculosis), “O.K.” (meaning “all right,”
   and traced to excellent wines made in Aux Cayes in Santo
   Domingo, later used for anything that is of the right standard),
   “C.O.D.”(cash on delivery by post), “C.P.”(Communist
   Party), “B.A.T,” (British American Tobacco Co.), etc.

   16.42. Monosyllabism.--The same desire for brevity is
   seen in another tendency to substitute short words for long
   ones, especially in current American slang. Below are some
   examples (the specifically American or English slang words
   are indicated):一
   ::

      cop=copper=policeman                sack=“give, get the sack”=dismiss, 
      thug=gangster                          be dismissed
      tuck=dollar, as in “three bucks”    pop=papa
      (Am.)                               mom=mamma
      guy=fellow (Am.)                    kick=protest (“raise a kick”)
      chap=fellow (Eng.)                  row =quarrel (“raise, make a row”)
      kid=child 
      grub=food, feed(Eng.)               push=aggressive or enterprising
      bite, snack=a light lunch              spirit
      grit=endurance                      fit=in good health (Eng.)
      guts=real value, inner force        deal=business transaction
      swop-change                         job, post-position.
      fake-forgery, anything false        dough=money (Am.)
      fad, craze= fashion                 tip=suggestion (“give you a tip”)
      crib=plagiarize                     clue-suggestive evidence
      cram=work hard before examination   off=finished, over
                                          through=“am through with you”
      grab=take by force                         =will have no more to do
      lot=amount                                  with you

.. _P431:
   ::

      hike=make an excursion on foot      up-has come up(“What is up?"
      probe=investigation                 “subject is up for discussion”)
      boss, chief--manager or president   play=drama
      date=appointment with girls         broke= bankrupt
      lift=elevator                       bum-penniless loafer

   A very long list could be drawn up of these monosyllabic
   words, but the above, some of which are in literary use,
   should suffice. Notice also such truly monosyllabic 
   combinations, which approach very nearly the Chinese:--
   ::

      stand pat=remain firm in one's      love-nest=lover's home
         attitude                         old man=-husband, father
      wash-out=a complete failure         joy-ride-pleasure trip or drive
      lock--out-exclusion of workers      high-brow--high class, 
      as employer's method                   high and fine
      against strikes                     give-and-take=exchange of 
      try-out-preliminary test               service or favour
      tight-wad=stingy person            frame--up=trick to involve 
      soul-mate=lover                        persons with the police
      dumb-beil, bone-head= fool         

   The actual prevalence of monosyllabism in current American 
   can only be fully appreciated from the following examples, 
   where whole sentences or phrases consist of monosyllabic 
   words. E.g, She got into a fit(=rage) / You've got to
   hand it to him (==acknowledge his superiority or cleverness) /
   Knock some sense into that guy (=make him realize his situation) / 
   He was the best guy to put over a deal(= a business
   transaction) / I take off my hat to him (=acknowledge his
   cleverness) / What a guy wants is a lot of push and grit that
   will keep him on the go and not see red or fall flat and get
   scared when some one shoots a pop-gun at you.

Some Special Uses of Economy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   16.50. Mottoes.--Mottoes, in order to be effective and
   easily remembered, must be brief. Hence we find some English 
   mottoes expressing a whole philosophy or belief with the
   brevity of Chinese grammar, in which all unnecessary words
   are done away with. When the Chinese say “Sit eat moun-
   tain empty” (坐吃山空), he conveys his idea just as clearly
   and much more picturesquely than a long sentence such as
   “If you do nothing but eat, even a fortune as big as the
   mountain will be gone some day.”Below are a fewexamples:--
   ::

      Easier said than done. (Notice      Once bitten, twice shy.
      that, strictly, more easily         Once a thief, always a thief.
      should be used.)                    No work, no pay.
      First come, first served.           Well begun, half done.

   16.60. Economy and Emotional Language.--It is natural
   that under the stress of emotion, one says what is uppermost
   in his mind, because one has notime for grammatical 
   perfection. That does not mean such exclamations are not
   grammatical or less effective. The grammatical peculiarities of
   exclamations have been mentioned in §3.80. A few examples
   here will show many omissions natural in such exclamations:
   Hands off! | Hats off! | My purse! | Me a burglar? | Pretty, isn't it? |
   Best food I've ever tasted! | He married?! | Quick--the doctor!

   16.70. Economy and Business.There are many occasions 
   when economy is needed for practical reasons, such as
   in writing cable messages, newspaper heads, advertisements,
   sign-posts and hoardings. When a man sends a cable“man
   in hospital doctor confident remit money,"no one will criticize 

.. _P433:

   him for his grammar. In the other cases, such as
   advertisements and news heads, the great consideration is for
   effectiveness, brevity and force. It is by force of suggestion,
   rather than by wordy statements, that customers are persuaded
   to buy the goods. Hence we find some of the best advertisement 
   lines are short and to the point. The most effective
   cigarette advertisement consists of two words They satisfy!;
   others are Walk a mile for a Camel | They are toasted | Taste
   is everything | Smoke Capstan. The repetition of such phrases
   produces a hypnotic effect on the reader, whether he is a
   smoker or not.

Synopsis Of Formal Grammar
--------------------------

   By formal grammar is meant the kind of grammatical
   study which concerns itself with the given forms of the 
   language. Formal grammar studies the classification of words,
   the definitions for the different classes, the changes in form
   peculiar to each class, and analysis of the sentence structure.

   A purely theoretical study of the formal aspects of a language 
   always requires the counting of so many kinds of adjj.,
   advv., etc., and in order to make the system exact, arbitrary
   definitions must be given to them. It is surprising, however,
   how little of this formal grammar is needed by the foreign
   student of the language. From the practical point of view,
   the following summary should be sufficient for the average
   student. References are given to sections in this book, which
   discuss the respective points at greater length.

NOUNS
~~~~~

   1. Definition.--Nouns denote things. These may include 
   an action (examination) or a quality (goodness)[§2.11].

   2. Classification.--Nouns may be classified as follows:

      Common:     city (§4.40)
      Proper:     Ningpo (§4.40)
      Collective: committee (§4.50)
      Material:   water (§4.51)
      Abstract:   kindness (§4.30)

   3. Gender.--There are four genders [§4.71]:--

      1. Masculine： man
      2. Feminine： woman
      3. Common： teacher
      4. Neuter： chalk

.. _P435:

   4. Number.--There are two numbers in English: singular 
   (one) and plural (more than one)[§5.20]. Plurals which
   are formed by adding -s are called regular (windows): others
   not so formed are called irregular (children)[§5.2].

   5. Case.--When a noun is used as the subject, it is in
   the nominative case; when it denotes possession (man's), it
   is in the possessive case; when it is used as an object, it is
   in the objective case. In English only the possessive Case
   of nouns is distinguished by a special form.

PRONOUNS
~~~~~~~~

   6. Definition.--A pronoun is a word used in place of
   a noun (he for John, this for this book).

   7. Classification.--Pronouns may be classified as follows [§8.11]：

           Personal: he
      Demonstrative: this, that
           Relative: “the boy who came”
      Interrogative: who?, what?

   8. Gender.--There are four genders, as in the case of
   nouns. Actualiy, gender is distinguished only in the third
   person singular of personal pronouns (he, she and it).

   9. Person and Number.-- There are three persons and
   two numbers, as follows;

.. _P436:
   ::

                     Singular       Plural
      1st person     I              we
      2nd person     thou, you      you
      3rd person     he, she, it    they

   10. Case.--There are three cases, nominative, possessive
   [§8.30] and objective which have different forms for the
   personal pronovns [§7.20].

   11. The relative pronoun is a pronoun which introduces
   a new clause, and at the same time refers to a preceding
   word, called its antecedent [§9.60].

ADJECTIVES
~~~~~~~~~~

   12. Definition.--An adjective is a word used to modify
   a noun or pronoun.

   13. Classification.--The classification of adjectives into
   “descriptive,” “demonstrative,”“quantitative,”etc. has no real
   practical meaning.

   14. Definite and Indefinite Articles.--The is called the
   definite article, and a (an) is called the indefinite article
   §8.70].

   15. Comparison.--Adjectives have three degrees of comparison: 
   positive, comparative and superlative (good--better--
   best/white--whiter-whitest)[§10.10].

VERBS
~~~~~

   16. Definition.--Verbs are words that tell what persons
   or things do.

.. _P437:

   17. Classification.--Verbs may be classified as transitive,
   intransitive and auxiliary.

   Transitive verbs may directly govern an object, as: “I
   see (v.t.) you (object)” [§11.20].

   Intransitive verbs do not govern objects (I was sleeying),
   but may be followed by a prepositional phrase (I was sleeping
   in his bed)[§11.21].

   An auxiliary or helping verb is used with other verbs,
   as: “I can see”/“I will go” [§13.60].

   18. Person and Number.---Verbs agree with their subjects
   in number and person. Actually, only the third person 
   singular present indicative has a special form: “He comes.” The
   two verbs to he and to have have more special forms: I have,
   thou hast, he has, we (you, they) have | I am, thou art, heis,
   we (you, they) are. For the past tense, the verb to be has
   also distinctive forms: I was, thou wert, he was,' we (you,
   they) were.

   The forms with -est for thou (Thou comest) and the
   forms with -eth for the third person singular (He cometh) are
   archaic.

   19. Finite and Infinitive.--Verbs connected with definite 
   subjects (He comes) are called finite verbs; those that
   are not so connected, but follow the word to, are said to be
   in the infinitive mood (to come).

   20. Participles.--Verbs which are used like adjectives
   are called participles. The present participle is always formed
   by adding -ing, while the past participle is usually formed by

.. _P438:

   adding -ed. The irregular verbs form their p.p. by adding
   -n,-en (beaten, drawn) or by some other modification (slept)
   [§13.50].

   The present participle is used to denote active or incomplete 
   action (a deceiving letter, a drowning man). The past
   participle is used to denote passive or completed action (a
   deceived person, a drowned man) [§2.33, 11.44].

   21. Voice.--A verb may be in the active or passive voice
   [§11.30]. When something is done to the subject, the verb
   is in the passive voice ("I was sent away"). The passive voice
   is formed by the different forms of the verb to be plus the
   past participle: was (past of to be) sent (p.p. of send), shall
   be sent, have been, etc. [§11.31].

   22. Mood.--Verbs are said to be in any of the following moods:
   ::

              ╭─ Indicative： He comes.
      Finite ─┤  imperative: Come.
              ╰─ Subjunctive: If he come.

   Some grammars recognize also the interrogative mood [§14.10].

   The indicative mood is the usual mood used for making
   statements. The imperative is used for giving commands,
   which are usually confined to the second person (you). The
   subjunctive is used in stating a supposition, and is distinguished
   by having no-s added in the third person singular present
   tense [§14.21].

   Note that the so-called subjunctive mood refers strictly
   to the form of the verb [§14.12]. A really subjunctive
   statement (as, for instance, a supposition) may not at all

.. _P439:

   be expressed by the subjunctive form, as in if he comes, where
   the form is indicative but the meaning is subjunctive [§14.20].
   Also, the form if he should come is called “subjunctive future”
   by old grammars, but this is a serious misnomer, because this
   form really belongs to the general tense and its use is not
   confined to the future [§14.21].

   The verb to be has special forms for the subjunctive
   mood: if I were [§14.23].

   23. Tense.--There are three main tenses: present, past
   and future [§13.10]. Within each of these maintenses, there
   are other tenses, as follows:
   ::

                        Present           Past              Future
      Indefinite        I come            I came            I shall come
      Continuous        I am coming       I was coming      I shall be coming
      Perfect           I have come       I had come        I shall have come
      Perf. Contin.     I have been       I had been        I shall have been
                        coming            coming            coming (rare)

   Regarding the use of the different tenses, see §11.10,
   13.21 (present indefinite), §13.41 (the past), §13.30(the
   future), §11.42 (the present perfect), §11.43 (the continuous
   or progressive).

   24. The Principal Parts.-The present, the past and the
   past participle are called the three principal parts of a verb.
   Verbs which form their past and past participle by having
   -ed added are called “regular”(kick--kicked--kicked), while
   verbs which do not do so are called irregular (draw--drew--
   drawn I pay--paid--paid) [§13.50].

   (The word “gerund” referring to a verh in -ing used as a

.. _P440:

   noun, as coming, going, serves no practical purpose in modern
   English.)

ADVERBS
~~~~~~~

   25. Definition.--An adverb is a word which modifies a
   verb, an adjective or another adverb.

   26. Classification.--Adverbs may be classified as follows:
   simple, interrogative and relative. This classification has no
   particular meaning except that the relative adverb is one
   which introduces a clause and has an antecedent expressed or
   understood: “Tell me (the time) when you are coming.” Here
   the word time is called the “antecedent” of the relative adverb
   when. Simple adverbs are again classified according to their
   meaning, as adverb of time (when), adverb of place (where,
   here), adverb of manner (how, well, cleverly), etc.

   27. Comparison.--Adverbs, like adji, may have three
   degrees: positive (quickly), comparative (more quickly) and
   superlative (most quickly) [§10.11].

PREPOSITIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   28. Definition.--A preposition is a word which shows
   some kind of relation and governs a noun as its object: on
   the top, at the time. Sometimes it is followed by an adverb:
   at once, for ever, from afar.

   A preposition never stands alone in actual use, but al-
   ways forms a prepositional phrase.

.. _P441:

CONJUNCTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   29. Definition.--A conjunction is a word used for connecting 
   words or groups of words:“this and that / “He was
   there or he was not.”

   30. Classification.-Conjunctions which connect clauses
   equal in importance or logical relationship are called co-ordinate,
   while conjunctions which express an unequal logical relationship 
   are called subordinate. Clauses of equalrank are called
   “co-ordinate”; when there are two unequal clauses, the one
   which contains the principal verb is called the main clause,
   while the other which is a component part of the main clause is
   called the dependent or subordinate clause [§15.30].

INTERJECTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   31. Definition.--An interjection is a word or phrase
   which is used in an exclamation.

   ::

      *              *              *

SENTENCES
~~~~~~~~~

   32. A sentence is a group of words which expresses a
   complete meaning [§3.10].

   33. Subject and Predicate.--The subject of the principal
   verb is called the subject of the sentence. The principal verb
   and any words attached to it, such as the object, complements
   or modifiers, together form the predicate.

   34. A complement is that part of a sentence which is
   added to complete the meaning of the principalverb, as “I

.. _P442:

   should like to go” | “He was made king” | “Paint it white.” An
   object is, by definition, also a complement, as “I killed him”
   [§9.90].

   35. Direct and Indirect Objects.--The person for whom
   or to whom a thing is done is called the indirect object of
   the verb: “I gave you(indirect obj.) a knife (direct obj.)”
   [§12.31].

   36. A clause is a sentence within a sentence.--It is
   distinguished from a phrase by having a subject and predicate
   like a complete sentence [§3.23]. A noun clause is a clause
   used as a noun [§3.64], an adverb clause is a clause used as
   an adverb, and a relative clause is a clause preceded by a
   relative pronoun or adverb [§9.60].

   37. A phrase is a group of words which does not contain 
   a subject and a finite verb [§3.23]. A participial phrase
   begins with a participle [6 9.40], a prepositional phrase begins
   with a preposition [6 9.50], and an infinitive phrase begins
   with an infinitive [§9.31]. When such phrases are used as
   adjectives or adverbs, they are also called adjective and adverb
   phrases respectively. A participial phrase which contains the
   word modified by its own participle is called an absolute 
   participial phrase [§9.42].

   38. A compound sentence is made up of two or more
   co-ordinate clauses. A complex sentence is made up of one
   main clause and one or more dependent clauses [§15.20]

   39. To parse a sentence is to tell the parts of speech
   of each of its words and to give the gender, number, case
   of nouns and pronouns (also the person of pronouns), the

.. _P443:

   number, person, mood, tense of finite verbs, the degrees of
   adjectives and adverbs, and to state the relationships of the
   different words in the sentence.

   40. To give the conjugation of a verb, or to conjugate it,
   is to state its forms in the different moods, tenses, persons
   and numbers.
