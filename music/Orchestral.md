I Overview

    The High Quality Software Synthesizer "Orchestral" is a plug-in software 
    synthesizer that provides string, wind, percussion, and keyboard 
    instruments suitable for classical music and screen music.

    It features the same high quality synthesizer engine and effects found 
    on all products of this series, and also supports DXi 2/VST2.0 multiple 
    outputs, delivering flexibility and quality for your musical productions.

Main features

- High quality orchestral sounds in one package

    Orchestral gives you a string section that even reproduces pizzicato 
    and tremolo playing techniques, a concert grand piano rich in ambience, 
    oboe and other wind instruments, timpani, harp, and other indispensable, 
    high quality orchestral sounds. It is the ideal choice for classical 
    music or screen music production.

    Strings:
    Violin, viola, cello, and contrabass sections, with pizzicato and 
    tremolo variations included. Solo sounds for each instrument are 
    also included, as well as harp.
     
    Wind:
    Brass section, brass instruments such as trumpet and horn, and 
    woodwinds such as flute, oboe, and clarinet are included.
     
    Percussion:
    Timpani and other orchestral percussion instruments
     
    Keyboard instruments:
    Piano, harpsichord

- Hybrid package contains two types of plug-ins

    The package contains two types of plug-ins (supporting DirectX instruments (DXi) 
    and VST instruments), for seamless operation with major high-performance 
    sequencers, such as Cakewalk SONAR, Home Studio, Music Creator, Plasma, 
    CUBASE, and Logic Audio.

- The same high quality synthesizer engine as all products in the series

    The software synthesis engine uses 32-bit floating point processing 
    and supports 96 kHz for top-notch output quality. 
    Intel Corporation's SSE instructions, 
    AMD Corporation's Enhanced 3DNow! technology, 
    and Motorola Corporation's AltiVec 
    are supported in order to take maximum advantage of your CPU's high-speed 
    signal processing power.

- Support for multiple outputs

    The multi-channel output capability of DXi 2 and VST 2.0 is supported. In your host application, you can apply effects independently to each part, or output audio to multiple devices.

    sign_attention.gif In order to use multiple outputs, you must have a host application that supports DXi 2 or VST 2.0 multi-out capability.

- Internal effects
    Orchestral provides high quality reverb (three types) that rivals dedicated units, 
    as well as chorus/delay. Effect presets optimized for orchestral sounds are 
    also provided, delivering the rich ambience of a concert hall.

The Orchestra Style screen lets you automatically make basic settings such as 
sound selection, volume, and pan for each part, simply by selecting from 
commonly used orchestral configurations (styles). A graphic will visually 
indicate the placement of the instruments for the selected style, and you 
can audition a sample song played in that style. This makes it easy to find 
a style that is appropriate for the song you are creating.

# Rhythm set that support Advanced Mute

In the rhythm sets provided by Orchestral, some sounds have 
Advanced Mute function that lets you simulate more natural-sounding 
mutes for instruments such as cymbals.

For sounds that support Advanced Mute function, you can mute the 
instrument by using an assigned mute key (Advanced Mute Key) to mute 
the currently sounding note. Since the velocity of the advanced mute key 
can vary the muting time, you can create very natural-sounding muting effects.

Sounds that support Advanced Mute are described in "About the sounds."

# Sounds that support Advanced Vibrato

Preset sounds whose names are followed by "/Vsw" or "/Msw" support 
Advanced Vibrato. These sounds have the following features.

Sounds whose names are followed by "/Vsw"
Strong velocities will play sounds with vibrato, and weak velocities 
will play sounds without vibrato.
 
Sounds whose names are followed by "/Msw"
When modulation messages (Control Change #1) are received, the sound
with vibrato will be heard. This allows you to obtain a more natural 
vibrato effect even when playing in real time from an external keyboard.
