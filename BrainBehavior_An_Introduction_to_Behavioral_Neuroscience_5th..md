   Preface
   A Message From the Authors
   Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who
   keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind
   young.
   —Henry Ford
   Flip through this book and you’ll see that its pages are chock-full of facts and
   applications—just a sampling gleaned from a vast supply that grows too fast for
   any of us to keep up with and that becomes obsolete just as fast. But sifting
   through those facts and reporting them is neither the most difficult nor the most
   important function of a good textbook. A greater challenge is that most students
   fail to share their instructors’ infatuation with learning; perhaps they lack the
   genes, or the parental role models, or just the idea that learning can be fun. At
   any rate, they can find a text like this intimidating, and it is the textbook’s role to
   change their minds.
   The colorful illustrations, case studies, and research vignettes may capture
   students’ interest, but sparking interest alone is not enough. That’s why we’ve
   adopted a big-picture approach in writing the text, one that marshals facts into
   explanations and discards the ones left standing around with nothing to do.
   When you put facts to work that way, you begin to see students look up and say,
   “That makes sense,” or “I’ve always wondered about that, but I never thought of
   it that way,” or “Now I understand what was going on with Uncle Edgar.”
   We believe education has the capacity to make a person healthy, happy, and
   productive, and it makes a society strong. Education realizes that promise when
   it leads people to inquire and to question, when they learn how to learn. When
   45% of the public believes in ghosts, and politics has become a game played by
   shouting the loudest or telling the most convincing lie, education more than ever
   needs to teach young people to ask, “Where is the evidence?” and “Is that the
   only possible interpretation?”
   To those who would teach and those who would learn, this book is for you.
   To the Student
   Brain & Behavior is our attempt to reach out to students, to beckon them into the
   fascinating world of behavioral neuroscience. These are exceptionally exciting
   times, comparable in many ways to the renaissance that thrust Europe from the
   Middle Ages into the modern world. According to the American neurologist
   Stanley B. Prusiner,
   Neuroscience is by far the most exciting branch of science because the
   brain is the most fascinating object in the universe. Every human brain is
   different—the brain makes each human unique and defines who he or she
   is.
   We know of no scientific discipline with greater potential to answer the burning
   questions about ourselves than behavioral neuroscience. We hope this textbook
   will convey that kind of excitement as you read about discoveries that will
   revolutionize our understanding of what it means to be human.
   We want you to succeed in this course, but, more than that, we want you to learn
   more than you ever imagined you could and to go away with a new appreciation
   for the promise of behavioral neuroscience. So, we have a few tips we want to
   pass along. First, try to sit near the front of the class, because those students
   usually get the best grades. That is probably because they stay more engaged and
   are encouraged to ask more questions; but to ask good questions, you should
   always read the text before you go to class. And so you’ll know where you’re
   going before you begin to read, take a look at “After reading this chapter, you
   will be able to,” then skim the chapter subheadings, and read the summary at the
   end of the chapter. Make sure you can define the terms, and visualize the
   pathways and brain areas as you come across them. Use the questions in the
   margins as you go through the text, answer the Concept Check questions, and be
   sure to test yourself at the end using the Test Your Understanding questions. As
   you read, pay special attention to the text in blue; these are definitions of the
   most important terms, which are defined again in the glossary at the end of the
   book. A “play button” icon like the one you see here will tell you which figures
   have been animated on the text’s website to help sharpen your understanding.
   Then, don’t forget to look up some of the books and articles in For Further
   Reading. Finally, carefully curated lists of web resources at the end of every
   chapter are fully hyperlinked on the Student Resources site at
   edge.sagepub.com/garrett5e, directing you to a wealth of additional
   information on the web. If you are considering a career in behavioral
   neuroscience, make sure you look at the For Further Thought questions at the
   end of each chapter. If you do all of these things, you won’t just do better in this
   course; you will leave saying, “I really got something out of that class!” And
   when it’s time to take the GRE (or MCAT or VCAT), or talk to your doctor, or
   interview for a biomedical job, or simply read the Science section of the New
   York Times, you’ll be using the knowledge you gained in this text.
   Stories of Brain & Behavior
   We wrote Brain & Behavior with you in mind, so we hope you will let us know
   where we have done things right and, especially, where we have not. We wish
   you the satisfaction of discovery and knowledge as you read what we have
   written for you.
   To the Instructor
   When Bob wrote the first edition of Brain & Behavior, he had one goal: to entice
   students into the adventure of behavioral neuroscience. There were other good
   texts out there, but they read as though they were written for students preparing
   for further neuroscience courses in graduate school. Those students will find this
   book adequately challenging, but Bob wrote Brain & Behavior so that anyone
   interested in behavior, including the newly declared sophomore major or the
   curious student who has wandered over from the history department, can have
   the deeper understanding that comes from a biological perspective as they take
   other courses in psychology.
   It is not enough to draw students in with lively writing or by piquing their
   interest with case studies and telling an occasional story along the way; unless
   they feel they are learning something significant, they won’t stay—they’ll look
   for excitement in more traditional places. As Bob wrote, he remembered the text
   he struggled with in his first behavioral neuroscience class; it wasn’t very
   interesting because neuroscientists knew much less about the biological
   underpinnings of behavior than they do now. Since that time, they have learned
   how the brain changes during learning, they have discovered some of the genes
   and brain deficiencies that cause schizophrenia, and they are beginning to
   understand how intricate networks of brain cells produce language, make us
   intelligent, and help us play the piano or find a mate. In other words, behavioral
   neuroscience has become a lot more interesting. So the material is there; now it
   is our job to communicate the excitement we have felt in discovering the secrets
   of the brain and to make a convincing case that behavioral neuroscience has the
   power to answer students’ questions about behavior.
   A good textbook is all about teaching, but there is no teaching if there is no
   learning. Over the years, our students have taught us a great deal about what they
   needed to help them learn. For one thing, we realized how important it is for
   students to build on their knowledge throughout the course, so we have made
   several changes from the organization of other texts. First, the chapter on
   neuronal physiology precedes the chapter on the nervous system, because we
   believe that you can’t begin to understand the brain until you know how its
   neurons work. And we reversed the usual order of the vision and audition
   chapters, because audition provides a friendlier context for introducing the basic
   principles of sensation and perception. The chapters on addiction, motivation,
   emotion, and sex follow the introduction to neurophysiology; this was done to
   build student motivation before tackling sensation and perception. Perhaps more
   significant, some topics have been moved around among chapters so that they
   can be developed in a more behaviorally meaningful context. So we discuss
   language along with audition, the body senses with the mechanisms of
   movement, the sense of taste in the context of feeding behavior, and olfaction in
   conjunction with sexual behavior. Most unique, though, is the inclusion of a
   chapter on the biology of intelligence and another on consciousness. The latter is
   a full treatment of recent developments in the field, rather than being limited to
   the usual topics of sleep and split-brain behavior. These two chapters strongly
   reinforce the theme that behavioral neuroscience is personally relevant and
   capable of addressing important questions.
   Brain & Behavior has several features that will motivate students to learn and
   encourage them to take an active role in their learning. It engages the student
   with interest-grabbing opening vignettes; illustrative case studies; and In the
   News, Application, and Research Spotlight features that take an intriguing step
   beyond the chapter content. Throughout each chapter, questions in the margins
   keep the student focused on key points, and a Concept Check at the end of each
   section serves as a reminder of the important ideas. At the end of each chapter,
   In Perspective emphasizes the importance and implications of what the student
   has just read, a summary helps organize that information, and Test Your
   Understanding questions assess the student’s conceptual understanding as well
   as factual knowledge. Then, For Further Reading suggestions guide the student
   in exploring the chapter’s topics more fully, and a list of websites points the way
   to related information on the Internet. We have found over the years that students
   who use the study aids in a class are also the best performers in the course.
   New in the Fifth Edition
   It has been just three years since publication of the fourth edition of Brain &
   Behavior, but that short time has witnessed unprecedented activity in the
   neurosciences. We (founding author Bob Garrett and new author Gerald Hough)
   have reviewed thousands of research articles to ensure that the fifth edition
   provides students with the most up-to-date coverage of behavioral neuroscience
   possible. We have undertaken the most ambitious revision of Brain & Behavior
   since the second edition. We have updated more than 300 references, added 30
   new terms, revised more than 50 illustrations, freshened the overall look of the
   text, and polished its presentation. We completely rewrote several sections, not
   only to bring them up to date but also to provide better organization and clarity
   and to shift focus to the most significant aspects. We have, for example, added
   optogenetics as one of the research techniques in Chapter 4; recast the Chapter 5
   discussion of reward, brain plasticity, and learning in addiction; in Chapter 8
   developed recent thinking that aggression depends on both testosterone-to-
   cortisol ratio and the balance of activity among the hypothalamus, amygdala,
   and prefrontal cortex; revised the discussion of long-term potentiation in Chapter
   12 to better emphasize the roles of dopamine, synaptic proteins, and
   neurogenesis; reconceptualized Chapter 14 to bring the discussion of
   psychological disorders into line with the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5); and revised the final chapter to
   reflect current understanding of the sleep and waking circuits. To support these
   changes, we replaced all the In the News features, updated the Applications, and
   added a new feature, Research Spotlight, to highlight selected recent
   developments. In addition, we updated the online material and added new
   animations to better explain difficult concepts.
   In recent years behavioral neuroscience has been dominated by two areas of
   research, and both continue to gain significance in explaining behavior. The first
   of these is genetics. New gene associations continue to be discovered, for
   example, linking autism spectrum disorder to genes for GABA and oxytocin
   receptors and genes concerned with the formation of synaptic proteins. At the
   same time, intelligence, schizophrenia, Down syndrome, and Alzheimer’s
   disease are yielding additional secrets as researchers shift their attention to de
   novo mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic influences. Also on the
   genetic front, the CRISPR technique of gene editing (the American Association
   for the Advancement of Science’s 2015 breakthrough of the year) is showing
   great promise for medicine while generating increased concerns about modifying
   the human gene line.
   The second research area, involving neural connectivity and networks, is
   continuing to reveal how the brain works and, in the case of disorders, how it
   fails to work. For example, we are beginning to appreciate the role of the
   salience network in consciousness, by detecting conditions that require attention
   and switching between the default mode network and the executive network.
   Other recent studies have found decreased connectivity in the cortex, corpus
   callosum, and thalamus in bipolar disorder, and both decreased and increased
   connectivity in different brain areas in depression.
   At the same time, we are keenly aware of the need to translate research findings
   into applications whenever possible. Newly developing treatments featured in
   the text include the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and memory-inhibiting drugs
   to fight addiction; and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease with nerve growth
   factor, brain-growth neurotrophic factor, and the drug aducanumab, which are in
   phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 clinical trials, respectively. We also applaud the
   good news in two recent reports that prevalence of autism spectrum disorder
   appears to have leveled off and the risk for Alzheimer’s disease has declined in
   several countries, including the United Kingdom (by 20%) and the United States
   (by 26%).
   Acknowledgments
   Revising a textbook like Brain & Behavior is incredibly hard work, and in spite
   of Bob’s and Gerald’s best efforts, the fifth edition would not be possible without
   the help of many others. Kudos to acquisitions editor Abbie Rickard and content
   development editor Lucy Berbeo for their insights, their patience, and their
   ability to keep us on schedule (almost). Aside from their challenges in dealing
   with the authors, they have managed a host of contributors, including Meghan C.

   the In the News features; Joshua S. Rodefer, of Valdosta State University, who
   contributed Application and Research Spotlight features; Richard J. Addante, of
   California State University, San Bernardino, who reviewed the artwork; and an
   untold number of illustrators and animators. We also want to thank others who
   have made the project go so smoothly, including production editors David Felts
   and Kelly DeRosa, editorial assistant Jennifer Cline, cover designer Gail
   Buschman, marketing manager Katherine Hepburn, and marketing associate
   Tzveta Mihaylov.
   Bob has had a number of mentors along the way, to whom he is forever grateful.
   A few of those special people are Wayne Kilgore, who taught the joys of science
   along with high school chemistry and physics; Garvin McCain, who introduced
   him to the satisfactions of research; Roger Kirk, who taught him that anything
   worth doing is worth doing over and over until it’s right; and Ellen Roye and
   Ouilda Piner, who shared their love of language. These dedicated teachers
   showed him that learning was his responsibility, and they shaped his life with
   their unique gifts and quiet enthusiasm.
   But of all of Bob’s supporters, the most important was his wife, Duejean; love
   and thanks to her for fond memories and for her patient understanding and her
   appreciation of how important this project has been to him.
   For Gerald, becoming a coauthor on this textbook, which he has used in his
   classes over the past decade, is an amazing privilege. He hopes that the
   instructors and students who use this book find that the overall presentation and
   helpfulness in assisting in the learning process are unchanged from the previous
   editions. His background in behavioral neuroethology (a mouthful for sure!)
   provides a background in understanding the neural bases of behavior. He would
   like to thank his academic mentors who have helped him find his way in a
   complex scientific world: Erich Klinghammer at Wolf Park in Battle Ground,
   Indiana, sowed the seeds for a love of wolves and understanding behavior in
   naturalistic settings; Susan Volman at The Ohio State University introduced him
   to the complexities of behavioral neuroscience through their investigation of
   how birds learn (and forget) songs at the neural level; and Verner Bingman gave
   him the opportunity to develop as a scholar and mentor to his students at
   Bowling Green State University in Ohio. He would also like to thank his family
   for letting him work on this important textbook: his wife of 25 years, Kerry; sons
   Alexander and Benjamin; and of course Melbourne the parakeet.

   My cell phone is my best friend. It’s my lifeline to the outside world.
   —Carrie Underwood
   Mobile telephones appeared in vehicles in 1956, but a handheld mobile was not
   commercially available until 1983; dubbed the “brick,” it weighed 1.75 pounds
   (0.79 kilograms) and cost $3,995 (Figure 1.1). Your four- or five-ounce phone
   operates over a vast cellular network to connect you to your friends and family
   and an estimated 4.8 billion people all around the world (there are actually more
   mobile devices on earth than there are people). Assuming you have a
   smartphone, you have access to many additional people by way of email, text,
   and video, as well as more than 1 billion websites on the Internet. Your phone
   also allows you to record memories in the form of notes and images, perform
   calculations, identify a tune or a flower, and determine the best route for your
   road trip.

   The brain has many similarities. The neural cells (neurons) generate a tiny
   electrical signal that allows each one to communicate with a thousand other
   neurons, which in turn connect to thousands of others in a network of more than
   80 billion neurons. One computational neuroscientist estimates that the brain’s
   storage capability rivals that of the Internet; as a psychologist put it, if the brain
   were a video recorder it could store 300 years of video. But storage of memories
   and information is only one of the brain’s many tasks. The brain is organized
   into specialized subnetworks that orchestrate your body’s 640 muscles, generate
   thought and make decisions, perform calculations, keep track of where you are
   and help you navigate around your world, tell you when to drink and when and
   what to eat, and provide your humanly unique language capability and range of
   sensory capabilities. Like the cell phone, the brain has evolved over time and
   across species, but in this case as its capability has grown so has its size. Still, all
   of its amazing power is packed into just three pounds of tissue that consumes the
   same amount of energy as a 20-watt light bulb!
   Mobile phones came into their own in the last decade of the 20th century, in
   terms of both their capabilities—such as built-in cameras, Bluetooth
   connectivity, and international calling—and their popularity, indicated by more
   sales worldwide in 1998 than for cars and PCs combined. The period was also
   seminal for the awakening field of neuroscience, so much so that in the United
   States it was designated as the Decade of the Brain. Planned as an effort to
   increase public awareness of the benefits of brain research, the Decade of the
   Brain was also a celebration of past achievements and a sober look at the future.
   At the threshold of a new millennium, we understood that we had an obligation
   to expand the horizons of human knowledge and advance the treatment of
   neurological diseases, emotional disorders, and addictions that cost the country a
   trillion dollars a year in care, lost productivity, and crime (Uhl & Grow, 2004).
   Since then, in the span of your lifetime, we have developed new treatments for
   depression, identified key genes responsible for the devastation of schizophrenia,
   developed agents that block addiction to drugs, found ways to slow the memory
   impairment of Alzheimer’s, produced a map of the human genes, and literally
   peered into the brain itself to watch it work. These achievements seem
   remarkable for such a brief span of time, but in fact they have their roots in a
   300-year scientific past and in 22 centuries of thought and inquiry before that.
   For that reason, we will spend a brief time examining those links to our past.

   The Origins of Behavioral Neuroscience
   The term neuroscience identifies the subject matter of the investigation rather
   than the scientist’s training. A neuroscientist may be a biologist, a physiologist,
   an anatomist, a neurologist, a chemist, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist—or even
   a computer scientist or a philosopher. Psychologists who work in the area of
   neuroscience specialize in behavioral neuroscience, the branch of psychology
   that studies the relationships between behavior and the body, particularly
   the brain. (Behavioral neuroscience is the more modern term for biological
   psychology; sometimes the term biopsychology, psychobiology, or physiological
   psychology is also used.) For psychologists, behavior has a very broad meaning,
   which includes not only overt acts but also internal events such as learning,
   thinking, and emotion. Behavioral neuroscientists attempt to answer questions
   like “What changes in the brain when a person learns?” “Why does one person
   develop depression and another, under similar circumstances, becomes anxious
   while another seems unaffected?” “What is the physiological explanation for
   emotions?” “How do we recognize the face of a friend?” “How does the brain’s
   activity result in consciousness?” Behavioral neuroscientists use a variety of
   research techniques to answer these questions, as you will see in Chapter 4.
   Whatever their area of study or their strategy for doing research, behavioral
   neuroscientists try to go beyond the mechanics of how the brain works to focus
   on the brain’s role in behavior.
   What is behavioral neuroscience, and how does it relate to psychology?
   To really appreciate the impressive accomplishments of today’s brain
   researchers, it is useful, perhaps even necessary, to understand the thinking and
   the work of their predecessors. Contemporary scientists stand on the shoulders of
   their intellectual ancestors, who made heroic advances with far less information
   at their disposal than is available to today’s undergraduate student.
   Writers have pointed out that psychology has a brief history but a long past.
   What they mean is that thinkers have struggled with the questions of behavior
   and experience for more than two millennia, but psychology arose as a separate
   discipline fairly recently; the date most people accept is 1879, when Wilhelm
   Wundt (Figure 1.2) established the first psychology laboratory in Leipzig,
   Germany. But biological psychology would not emerge as a separate science
   until psychologists offered convincing evidence that the biological approach
   could answer significant questions about behavior. To do so, they would have to
   come to terms with an old philosophical question about the nature of the mind.
   Because the question forms a thread that helps us trace the development of
   behavioral neuroscience, we will orient our discussion around this issue.
   In the sciences, we are now uniquely privileged to sit side by side with the giants on whose
   shoulders we stand.
   —Gerald Holton
   Prescientific Psychology and the Mind-Brain Problem
   This issue is usually called “the mind-body problem,” but it is phrased
   differently here to place the emphasis squarely where it belongs—on the brain.
   The mind-brain problem deals with what the mind is and what its
   relationship is to the brain. There can be no doubt that the brain is essential to
   our behavior, but does the mind control the brain, or is it the other way around?
   Alternatively, are mind and brain the same thing? How these questions are
   resolved affects how we ask all the other questions of neuroscience.
   At the risk of sounding provocative, we argue that there is no such thing as mind.
   It exists only in the sense that, say, weather exists; weather is a concept used to
   include rain, wind, humidity, and related phenomena. We talk as if there is a
   weather when we say things like “The weather is interfering with my travel
   plans.” But no one really thinks that there is a weather. Most, though not all,
   neuroscientists believe that we should think of the mind in the same way; it is
   simply the collection of things the brain does, such as thinking, sensing,
   planning, and feeling. But when we think, sense, plan, and feel, we get the
   compelling impression that there is a mind behind it all, guiding what we do.
   Most neuroscientists say this is just an illusion, that the sense of mind is nothing
   more than the awareness of what the brain is doing. Mind, like weather, is just a
   concept; it is not a something; it does not do anything.
   Figure 1.2 Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920).

   This position is known as monism, from the Greek monos, meaning “alone” or
   “single.” Monism is the idea that the mind and the body consist of the same
   substance. Idealistic monists believe that everything is nonphysical mind, but
   most monists take the position that the body and mind and everything else are
   physical; this view is called materialistic monism. The idea that the mind and
   the brain are separate is known as dualism. For most dualists, the body is
   material and the mind is nonmaterial. Most dualists also believe that the mind
   influences behavior by interacting with the brain.
   How do monists and dualists disagree on the mind-brain question?
   This question did not originate with modern psychology. The Greek
   philosophers were debating it in the fifth century BCE (G. Murphy, 1949), when
   Democritus proposed that everything in the world was made up of atoms
   (atomos, meaning “indivisible”), his term for the smallest particle possible. Even
   the soul, which included the mind, was made up of atoms, so it, too, was
   material. Plato and Aristotle, considered the two greatest intellectuals among the
   ancient Greeks, continued the argument into the fourth century BCE. Plato was a
   dualist, whereas his student Aristotle joined the body and soul in his attempt to
   explain memory, emotions, and reasoning.
   Defending either position was not easy. The dualists had to explain how a
   nonphysical mind could influence a physical body, and monists had the task of
   explaining how the physical brain could account for mental processes such as
   perception and conscious experience. But the mind was not observable, and even
   the vaguest understanding of nerve functioning was not achieved until the 1800s,
   so neither side had much ammunition for the fight.
   The nature of the mind and soul is bodily.
   —Lucretius, c. 50 BCE
   What we call our minds is simply a way of talking about the functions of our brains.
   —Francis Crick, 1966
   Descartes and the Physical Model of Behavior
   Scientists often resort to the use of models to understand whatever they are
   studying. A model is a proposed mechanism for how something works.
   Sometimes, a model is in the form of a theory, such as Charles Darwin’s
   explanation that a species developed new capabilities because the capability
   enhanced the individual’s survival and opportunity to reproduce. Other times, the
   model is a simpler organism or system that researchers study in an attempt to
   understand a more complex one. For example, researchers have used the rat to
   model everything from learning to Alzheimer’s disease in humans, and the
   computer has often served as a model of cognitive processes.
   What is a model in science, and how is it useful?
   In the 17th century, the French philosopher and physiologist René Descartes
   (Figure 1.3a) used a hydraulic model to explain the brain’s activity (Descartes,
   1662/1984). Descartes’s choice of a hydraulic model was influenced by his
   observation of the statues in the royal gardens at St. Germain. When a visitor
   stepped on certain tiles, the pressure forced water through tubes to the statues
   and made them move. Using this model, Descartes then reasoned that the nerves
   were also hollow tubes. The fluid they carried was not water, but what he called
   “animal spirits”; these flowed from the brain and inflated the muscles to produce
   movement. Sensations, memories, and other mental functions were produced as
   animal spirits flowed through “pores” in the brain. The animal spirits were
   pumped through the brain by the pineal gland (Figure 1.3b). Descartes’s choice
   of the pineal gland was based on his conclusion that it was at a perfect location
   to serve this function. Attached just below the two cerebral hemispheres by its
   flexible stalk, it appeared capable of bending at different angles to direct the
   flow of animal spirits into critical areas of the brain. Thus, for Descartes, the
   pineal gland became the “seat of the soul,” the place where the mind interacted
   with the body. Although Descartes assigned control to the mind, his unusual
   emphasis on the physical explanation of behavior foreshadowed the
   physiological approach that would soon follow.

   Descartes lacked an understanding of how the brain and body worked, so he
   relied on a small amount of anatomical knowledge and a great deal of
   speculation. His hydraulic model not only represented an important shift in
   thinking; it also illustrates the fact that a model or a theory can lead us astray, at
   least temporarily. Fortunately, this was the age of the Renaissance, a time not
   only of artistic expansion and world exploration but also of scientific curiosity.
   Thinkers began to test their ideas through direct observation and experimental
   manipulation as the Renaissance gave birth to science. In other words, they
   adopted the method of empiricism, which means that they gathered their
   information through observation rather than logic, intuition, or other
   means. Progress was slow, but two critically important principles would emerge
   as the early scientists ushered in the future.
   What two discoveries furthered the early understanding of the brain?
   Helmholtz and the Electrical Brain
   In the late 1700s, the Italian physiologist Luigi Galvani showed that he could
   make a frog’s leg muscle twitch by stimulating the attached nerve with
   electricity, even after the nerve and muscle had been removed from the frog’s
   body. A century later in Germany, Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig (1870)
   produced movement in dogs by electrically stimulating their exposed brains.
   What these scientists showed was that animal spirits were not responsible for
   movement; instead, the cause was nerves operated by electricity! But the
   German physicist and physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz (Figure 1.4)
   demonstrated that nerves do not behave like wires conducting electricity. He was
   able to measure the speed of conduction in nerves, and his calculation of about
   90 feet/second (27.4 meters/second) fell far short of the speed of electricity,
   which travels through wires at the speed of light (186,000 miles/second or
   299,000 kilometers/second). It was obvious that researchers were dealing with a
   biological phenomenon and that the functioning of nerves and of the brain was
   open to scientific study. Starting from this understanding, Helmholtz’s studies of
   vision and hearing gave “psychologists their first clear idea of what a fully
   mechanistic ‘mind’ might look like” (Fancher, 1979, p. 41). As you will see in
   later chapters, Helmholtz’s ideas were so insightful that even today we refer to
   his theories of vision and hearing as a starting point before describing the current
   ones.

   The Localization Issue
   The second important principle to come out of this period—localization—
   emerged over the first half of the 19th century. Localization is the idea that
   specific areas of the brain carry out specific functions. Fritsch and Hitzig’s
   studies with dogs gave objective confirmation to physicians’ more casual
   observations dating as far back as 17th-century BCE Egypt (Breasted, 1930), but
   it was two medical case studies that really grabbed the attention of the scientific
   community. In 1848, Phineas Gage, a railroad construction foreman, was injured
   when a dynamite blast drove an iron rod through his skull and the frontal lobes
   of his brain (see Chapter 3). Amazingly, he survived with no impairment of his
   intelligence, memory, speech, or movement. But he became irresponsible and
   profane and was unable to abide by social conventions (H. Damasio, Grabowski,
   Frank, Galaburda, & Damasio, 1994). Then, in 1861, the French physician Paul
   Broca (Figure 1.5) performed an autopsy on the brain of a man who had lost the
   ability to speak after a stroke. The autopsy showed that damage was limited to
   an area on the left side of his brain now known as Broca’s area (Broca, 1861).
   I never could keep a promise. . . . It is likely that such a liberal amount of space was given
   to the organ which enables me to make promises that the organ which should enable me to
   keep them was crowded out.
   —Mark Twain, in Innocents Abroad
   By the mid-1880s, additional observations like these had convinced researchers
   about localization (along with some humorists, as the quote from Mark Twain
   shows). But a few brain theorists were already taking the principle of
   localization too far, and we should be on guard lest we make the same mistake.
   At the end of the 18th century, when interest in the brain’s role in behavior was
   really heating up, the German anatomist Franz Gall had come up with an
   extreme and controversial theory of brain localization. According to phrenology,
   each of 35 different “faculties” of emotion and intellect—such as
   combativeness, inhabitiveness (love of home), calculation, and order—was
   located in a precise area of the brain (Spurzheim, 1908). Gall and his student
   Spurzheim determined this by feeling bumps on people’s skulls and relating any
   protuberances to the individual’s characteristics (Figure 1.6). Others, such as
   Karl Lashley (1929), took an equally extreme position at the other end of the
   spectrum; equipotentiality is the idea that the brain functions as an
   undifferentiated whole. According to this view, the extent of damage, not the
   location, determines how much function is lost.
   Figure 1.5 Paul Broca (1824–1880).
   Source: Wikimedia Commons.
   We now know that bumps on the skull have nothing to do with the size of the
   brain structures beneath and that most of the characteristics Gall and Spurzheim
   identified have no particular meaning at the physiological level. But we also
   know that the brain is not equipotential. The truth, as is often the case, lies
   somewhere between these two extremes.
   Today’s research tells us that functions are as much distributed as they are
   localized; behavior results from the interaction of many widespread areas of the
   brain. In later chapters, you will see examples of cooperative relationships
   among brain areas in language, visual perception, emotional behavior, motor
   control, and learning. In fact, you will learn that neuroscientists these days are
   less likely to ask where a function is located than to ask how the brain integrates
   activity from several areas into a single experience or behavior. Nevertheless, the
   locationists strengthened the monist position by showing that language, emotion,
   motor control, and so on are controlled by relatively specific locations in the
   brain (Figure 1.7). This meant that the mind ceased being the explanation and
   became the phenomenon to be explained.

   Understand that the nature and role of the mind are still debated in some
   quarters. For example, some neuroscientists believe that brain research will be
   unable to explain how a material brain can generate conscious experience, and
   that this will spell the final doom of materialism. These nonmaterial
   neuroscientists interpret the brain changes that occur during behavior therapy as
   evidence of the mind changing the brain (J. M. Schwartz, Stoessel, Baxter,
   Martin, & Phelps, 1996; see Chapter 14). Of course, what material
   neuroscientists see is the brain changing the brain (Gefter, 2008). Neuroscience
   has been able to explain a great deal of behavior without any reference to a
   nonmaterial mind, and as you explore the rest of this text you will begin to see
   why most brain scientists would describe themselves as material monists.

   Where do scientists stand on the localization issue?
   Nature and Nurture
   A second extremely important issue in understanding the biological bases of
   behavior is the nature versus nurture question, or how important heredity is
   relative to environmental influences in shaping behavior. Like the mind-brain
   issue, this is one of the more controversial topics in psychology, at least as far as
   public opinion is concerned. The arguments are based on emotion and values
   almost as often as they appeal to evidence and reason. For example, some critics
   complain that attributing behavior to heredity is just a form of excusing actions
   for which the person or society should be held accountable. A surprising number
   of behaviors are turning out to have some degree of hereditary influence, so you
   will encounter this issue again in later chapters. Because there is so much
   confusion about heredity, we need to be sure you understand what it means to
   say that a behavior is hereditary before we go any further.
   How are characteristics inherited?

   The Genetic Code
   The gene is the biological unit that directs cellular processes and transmits
   inherited characteristics. Most genes are found on the chromosomes, which are
   located in the nucleus of each cell, but there are also a few genes in structures
   outside the nucleus, called mitochondria. Each body cell in a human has 46
   chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs (Figure 1.8). Each pair is identifiably distinct
   from every other pair. This is important, because genes for different functions
   are found on specific chromosomes. The chromosomes are referred to by
   number, except for the sex chromosomes; in mammals, females have two X
   chromosomes, while males typically have an X and a Y chromosome. Notice
   that the members of a pair of chromosomes are similar to each other, again with
   the exception that the Y chromosome is much shorter than the X chromosome.
   Unlike the body cells, the male’s sperm cells and the female’s ova (egg cells)
   each have 23 chromosomes. When these sex cells are formed by the division of
   their parent cells, the pairs of chromosomes separate so that each daughter cell
   receives only one chromosome from each pair. When the sperm enters the ovum
   during fertilization, the chromosomes of the two cells merge to restore the
   number to 46. The fertilized egg, or zygote, then undergoes rapid cell division
   and development on its way to becoming a functioning organism. For the
   first eight weeks (in humans), the new organism is referred to as an embryo,
   and from then until birth, as a fetus.
   The mystery of how genes carry their genetic instructions began to yield to
   researchers in 1953, when James Watson and Francis Crick published a proposed
   structure for the deoxyribonucleic acid that genes are made of.
   Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a double-stranded chain of chemical
   molecules that looks like a ladder that has been twisted around itself; this is
   why DNA is often referred to as a double helix (Figure 1.9). Each rung of the
   ladder is composed of two of the four nucleotides—adenine, thymine, guanine,
   and cytosine (A, T, G, C). The order in which these nucleotides appear on the
   ladder forms the code that carries all our genetic information. The four-letter
   alphabet these nucleotides provide is adequate to spell out the instructions for
   every structure and function in your body. How is a microscopic structure
   capable of such a daunting task? The accompanying Application will help you
   appreciate the remarkable complexity of DNA.
   Figure 1.9 Structure of a Strand of DNA.
   We only partially understand how genes control the development of the body
   and its activities, as well as how they influence many aspects of behavior.
   However, we do know that genes exert their influence in a deceptively simple
   manner: They provide the directions for making proteins. Some of these proteins
   are used in the construction of the body, and others are enzymes; enzymes act as
   catalysts, modifying chemical reactions in the body. It is estimated that humans
   differ among themselves in the sequences of nucleotides that make up our DNA
   by only about 0.5% (S. Levy et al., 2007); however, you will see throughout this
   text that this variation leads to enormous differences in development and
   behavior.
   Because all but two of the chromosomes are paired, most genes are as well; a
   gene on one chromosome is paired with a gene for the same function on the
   other chromosome. The exception is that the shorter Y chromosome has only
   1/25th as many genes as the X chromosome. Although paired genes have the
   same type of function, their effects often differ; these different versions of a
   gene are called alleles. In some cases the effects of the two alleles blend to
   produce a result; for example, a person with the allele for type A blood on one
   chromosome and the allele for type B blood on the other will have type AB
   blood.
   In other cases, one allele of a gene may be dominant over the other. A dominant
   allele will produce its effect regardless of which allele it is paired with on the
   other chromosome; a recessive allele will have an influence only when it is
   paired with the same allele. Figure 1.10 illustrates this point. In the example,
   note that one parent is heterozygous for the blood type B allele, which means
   that the two alleles are different; the other parent is heterozygous for the blood
   type A allele. The A and B alleles are dominant over the o allele; as a result, each
   blood type (A, B, AB, or O) has an equal chance (one in four) of occurring in an
   offspring. Individuals with the same phenotype (an observable characteristic
   like blood type B) may differ by genotype (combinations of alleles like B and
   B, or B and O). You can see in the figure that A and B type parents have a one
   in four chance of having a child with different blood types; one of which will be
   homozygous (receiving two identical alleles) for the recessive o allele.
   In the case of unpaired genes on the X chromosome, a recessive gene alone is
   adequate to produce an effect because it is not opposed by a dominant gene. A
   characteristic produced by an unpaired gene on the X chromosome is
   referred to as X-linked. With such a large discrepancy in the number of genes
   on the X and Y chromosomes, you can understand the potential for effects from
   X linkage. One example is that males are eight times more likely than females to
   have a deficiency in red-green color vision. See Chapter 10 for more on this
   deficiency.
   Why do males more often show characteristics that are caused by recessive
   genes?
   Some characteristics—such as blood type and the degenerative brain disorder
   Huntington’s disease—result from a single pair of genes, but many
   characteristics are determined by several genes; they are polygenic. Height is
   polygenic, and most behavioral characteristics such as intelligence and
   psychological disorders are also controlled by a large number of genes.
   We have known from ancient times that animals could be bred for desirable
   behavioral characteristics such as hunting ability or a mild temperament that
   made them suitable as pets. Darwin helped establish the idea that behavioral
   traits can be inherited in humans as well, but the idea fell into disfavor as an
   emphasis on learning as the major influence on behavior became increasingly
   fashionable. In the 1960s and 1970s, however, the tide of strict
   environmentalism began to ebb, and the perspective shifted toward a balanced
   view of the roles of nature and nurture (Plomin, Owen, & McGuffin, 1994). By
   1992, the American Psychological Association was able to identify genetics as
   one of the themes that best represent the present and the future of psychology
   (Plomin & McClearn, 1993).
   Of the behavioral traits that fall under genetic influence, intelligence is the most
   investigated. Most of the behavioral disorders, including alcoholism and drug
   addiction, schizophrenia, major mood disorders, and anxiety, are partially
   hereditary as well (McGue & Bouchard, 1998). The same can be said for some
   personality characteristics (T. J. Bouchard, 1994) and sexual orientation (J. M.
   Bailey & Pillard, 1991; J. M. Bailey, Pillard, Neale, & Agyei, 1993; Kirk,
   Bailey, Dunne, & Martin, 2000).
   What are some of the inheritable behaviors?
   However, you should exercise caution in thinking about these genetic effects.
   Genes do not provide a script for behaving intelligently or instructions for
   homosexual behavior. They control the production of proteins; the proteins in
   turn affect the development of brain structures, the production of neural
   transmitters and the receptors that respond to them, and the functioning of the
   glandular system. We will offer specific examples in later chapters, where we
   will discuss this topic in more depth.
   Figure 1.10 Blood Types in the Offspring of Two Sets of Parents With Type A
   Blood.
   The Human Genome Project
   What is the Human Genome Project, and how successful has it been?
   After geneticists have determined that a behavior is influenced by genes, the
   next step is to discover which genes are involved. The various techniques for
   identifying genes boil down to determining whether people who share a
   particular characteristic also share a particular gene or genes that other people
   don’t have. This task is extremely difficult if the researchers don’t know where
   to look, because the amount of DNA is so great. However, the gene search
   received a tremendous boost in 1990 when a consortium of geneticists at 20
   laboratories around the world began a project to identify all the genes in our
   chromosomes, or the human genome.
   The goal of the Human Genome Project was to map the location of all the
   genes on the human chromosomes and to determine the genes’ codes—that
   is, the order of bases within each gene. In 2000—just 10 years after the project
   began—the project group and a private organization simultaneously announced
   they had produced “rough drafts” (International Human Genome Sequencing
   Consortium, 2001; Venter et al., 2001); within another 5 years, the entire human
   genome had been sequenced (Gregory et al., 2006).
   Landing a person on the moon gave us an extraterrestrial perspective on human life . . .
   and now the human genome sequence gives us a view of the internal genetic scaffold
   around which every human life is molded.

   Application: The Promise of DNA Computing

   Health.
   Some researchers envision a day when computers will be constructed from DNA. They
   recognize that current technology is reaching size, heat, and speed limitations imposed by
   silicon-based components, and they believe DNA has several advantages. In one experiment,
   DNA strands performed basic computing operations almost three times as fast as the world’s
   fastest supercomputer (Srivastava, 2003). DNA’s small size so ideally suits it for parallel
   processing that just 1,018 strands could operate 10,000 times faster than today’s supercomputers
   (J. Parker, 2003). Hypothetically, DNA could enable construction of a computer that would be
   able to investigate all possible solutions to a problem at the same time (Currin et al., 2017). Its
   capability would be limited only by the amount of space it would take up and, since DNA is so
   dense, a blob the size of a sugar cube could store the data that would require a Walmart
   supercenter full of contemporary storage media. As a bonus, the life of the data would be
   centuries rather than the decades typical of current storage methods (Langston, 2016). But DNA
   computing on a grand scale won’t be practical or cost-effective for some time. Ross King and
   his colleagues who study machine intelligence at the University of Manchester acknowledge the
   main problem is that they don’t know how they can program these DNA computers . . . yet
   (Currin et al., 2017). Current efforts are focused instead on constructing relatively simple logic
   devices; these are the building blocks of computers, but their DNA versions could have useful
   applications on their own. For example, chemists at North Carolina State University have used
   DNA to construct an AND gate, a logic device that sends output only if both of its inputs are
   activated. Each input of their DNA version detects one of two genes that are biomarkers for
   multiple types of cancer; each of its two inputs is sensitive to one of the genes, and when both
   are activated the gate releases a fluorescent molecule (Hemphill & Deiters, 2013).
   More recently, researchers in Singapore used DNA to construct a programmable multitasking
   processor that emulates a GPS device. On a map consisting of six locations and multiple
   possible routes, the processor can simultaneously determine the shortest routes between two
   starting points and two destinations (Shu, Wang, Yong, Shao, & Lee, 2015).
   But when it comes to gene functioning, there is still more mystery than
   enlightenment. Only 21,000 of our genes—just 3% of our DNA—have turned
   out to be protein encoding (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012). The lowly
   roundworm has 19,735 protein-coding genes (Hillier, Coulson, & Murray, 2005),
   so, clearly, the number of genes is not correlated with behavioral complexity.
   However, the amount of noncoding DNA—which we used to call noncoding
   DNA—does correlate with behavioral complexity (Andolfatto, 2005; Siepel et
   al., 2005). So what is important about “junk” DNA? Some of it is, in fact,
   nonfunctional, remnants left behind during evolution. But 80% of the non-
   protein-coding DNA is biochemically active, and much of it controls the
   expression of other genes—the translation of their encoded information into
   the production of proteins, thus controlling their functioning (Pennacchio et
   al., 2006). For example, when a stretch of noncoding DNA known as HACNS1—
   which is unique to humans—is inserted into a mouse embryo, it turns on genes
   in the “forearm” and “thumb” (Figure 1.11; Prabhakar et al., 2008). DNA taken
   from the same area in chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys does not have that
   effect. The researchers speculate that the genes that HACNS1 turns on led to the
   evolutionarily important dexterity of the human thumb.
   Do genes lock a person into a particular outcome in life?
   A second question is what the genes do. The gene map doesn’t answer that
   question, but it does make it easier to find the genes responsible for a particular
   disorder or behavior. For example, when geneticists were searching for the gene
   that causes Huntington’s disease in the early 1980s, they found that most of the
   affected individuals in a large extended family shared a couple of previously
   identified genes with known locations on chromosome 4 whereas the disease-
   free family members didn’t. This meant that the Huntington’s gene was on
   chromosome 4 and near these two marker genes (Gusella et al., 1983). Actually
   finding the Huntington’s gene still took another 10 years; now the gene map is
   dramatically reducing the time required to identify genes.
   Identifying the genes and their functions will improve our understanding of
   human behavior and psychological as well as medical disorders. We will be able
   to treat disorders genetically, counsel vulnerable individuals about preventive
   measures, and determine whether a patient will benefit from a drug or have an
   adverse reaction, thus eliminating delays from trying one treatment after another.

   Heredity: Destiny or Predisposition?
   To many people, the idea that several, if not most, of their behavioral
   characteristics are hereditary implies that they are clones of their parents and
   their future is engraved in stone by their genes. This is neither a popular nor a
   comfortable view, and it creates considerable resistance to the concept of
   behavioral genetics. The view is also misleading; a hallmark of genetic influence
   is actually diversity.
   Genes and Individuality
   Although family members do tend to be similar to each other, children share
   only half of their genes with each of their parents or with each other. A sex cell
   receives a random half of the parent’s chromosomes; as a result, a parent can
   produce 2 23 , or 8 million, different combinations of chromosomes. Add to this
   the uncertainty of which sperm will unite with which egg, and the number of
   genetic combinations that can be passed on to offspring rises to 60 or 70 trillion!
   So sexual reproduction increases individuality in spite of the inheritability of
   traits. This variability powers what Darwin (Figure 1.12) called natural
   selection, which means that those whose genes endow them with more
   adaptive capabilities are more likely to survive and transmit their genes to
   more offspring (Darwin, 1859).
   The effects of the genes themselves are not rigid; they can be variable over time
   and circumstances. Genes are turned on and turned off, or their activity is
   upregulated and downregulated, so that they produce more or less of their
   proteins or different proteins at different times. If the activity of genes were
   constant, there would be no smoothly flowing sequence of developmental
   changes from conception to adulthood. A large number of genes change their
   functioning late in life, apparently accounting for many of the changes common
   to aging (Ly, Lockhart, Lerner, & Schultz, 2000), as well as the onset of diseases
   such as Alzheimer’s (Breitner, Folstein, & Murphy, 1986). The functioning of
   some genes is even controlled by experience, which explains some of the
   changes in the brain that constitute learning (C. H. Bailey, Bartsch, & Kandel,
   1996). For the past quarter century, researchers have puzzled over why humans
   are so different from chimpanzees, our closest relatives, considering that 95%–
   98% of our DNA sequences are identical (R. J. Britten, 2002; M.-C. King &
   Wilson, 1975). Part of the answer appears to be that we differ more dramatically
   in which genes are expressed—actually producing proteins—in the brain (Enard
   et al., 2002).
   Figure 1.12 Charles Darwin (1809–1882).
   Source: From Origins, Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin.
   Genes also have varying degrees of effects. Some determine the person’s
   characteristics, whereas others only influence them. A person with the mutant
   form of the huntingtin gene will develop Huntington’s disease, but most
   behavioral traits depend on many genes. For instance, a single gene will account
   for only a slight increase in intelligence or in the risk for schizophrenia. The idea
   of risk raises the issue of vulnerability and returns us to our original question, the
   relative importance of heredity and environment.
   Research Spotlight: Beyond the Human Genome Project
   The completion of the Human Genome Project resulted in the successful sequencing of the 3
   billion DNA base pairs of the human genome. The next logical steps included determining the
   functions of the genes and the remaining 97% of DNA, and turning this research knowledge into
   practical solutions and treatments that can benefit individual humans.
   When the Human Genome Project ended in 2003, it was replaced by the Encyclopedia of DNA
   Elements (ENCODE) Project; its purpose is to determine all the functional elements of the
   human genome and make an initial assessment of what their functions are. Working at 32
   institutions around the world, the project’s teams had churned out more than 400 publications by
   2012 (Maher, 2012; Pennisi, 2012); one of their surprising revelations was that 80% of the
   genome is biochemically active. In addition, ENCODE findings are already giving researchers
   new tools for understanding the etiology of a variety of diseases.
   The Human Genome and ENCODE projects have catapulted us into a new era of genetic
   understanding (National Institutes of Health, 2016), but some geneticists believe the focus needs
   to be narrowed to the parts of the genes that direct protein production. These short sequences of
   DNA, or exons, make up the exome. The 180,000 exons of the human exome constitute only
   about 1% of the entire genome, so sequencing them is faster and cheaper, and scientists believe
   they contain 85% of all disease-causing mutations. Dutch scientists in 2012 reported that
   sequencing the exomes of 262 patients detected disease-causing mutations in half of the cases of
   blindness; 20% of the cases of intellectual disability; 20% of the deafness cases; and 15%–20%
   of the cases of movement disorders (European Society of Human Genetics, 2012). Lead
   researcher Marcel Nelen says that most of these patients have had “a long and worrying journey
   through different doctors and hospitals before they are diagnosed,” and exome sequencing can
   shorten that route.
   A methodological tool that evolved from the Human Genome Project is the genome-wide
   association study (GWAS). A GWAS study compares the genetic makeup of individuals who
   differ on a particular health condition. Over the past few decades, the health effects related to
   obesity have become increasingly obvious. G. Chen and colleagues (2017) hypothesized that
   there might be genetic factors in persons with African ancestry that account for the relatively
   higher rate of obesity seen in African Americans. Their genome-wide study found that
   individuals with a particular variant of the semaphorin-4D (SEMA4D) gene shared by 1% of
   continental Africans and African Americans average six pounds heavier than others without the
   allele.
   Heredity, Environment, and Vulnerability
   To assess the relative contributions of heredity and environment, we need to be
   able to quantify the two influences. Heritability is the percentage of the
   variation in a characteristic that can be attributed to genetic factors. There
   are various ways of estimating heritability of a characteristic. One technique
   involves a comparison of how often identical twins share the characteristic with
   how often fraternal twins share the characteristic. The reason for this comparison
   is that identical twins develop from a single egg and therefore have the same
   genes, while fraternal twins develop from separate eggs and share just 50% of
   their genes, like nontwin siblings. Heritability estimates are around 50% for
   intelligence (Devlin, Daniels, & Roeder, 1997), which means that about half of
   the population’s differences in intelligence are due to heredity. Heritability has
   been estimated at 60%–90% for schizophrenia (Tsuang, Gilbertson, & Faraone,
   1991) and 40%–50% for personality characteristics and occupational interests
   (Plomin et al., 1994). By way of comparison, the genetic influence on behavioral
   characteristics is typically stronger than it is for common medical disorders, as
   Figure 1.13 shows (Plomin et al., 1994).
   Since about half of the differences in behavioral characteristics among people
   are attributable to heredity, approximately half are due to environmental
   influences. Keep in mind that heritability is not an absolute measure but tells us
   the proportion of variability that is due to genetic influence; the measure depends
   on the environmental circumstances of the group we’re looking at as much as its
   genetic characteristics. For example, adoption studies tend to overestimate the
   heritability of intelligence because adopting parents are disproportionately from
   the middle class. Because the children’s adoptive environments are unusually
   similar, environmental influence will appear to be lower and heritability higher
   than typical (McGue & Bouchard, 1998). Similarly, heritability will appear to be
   lower if we look only at a group of closely related individuals.

   Researchers caution us that “we inherit dispositions, not destinies” (R. J. Rose,
   1995, p. 648). This is because the influence of genes is only partial. This idea is
   formalized in the vulnerability model, which has been applied to disorders such
   as schizophrenia (Zubin & Spring, 1977). Vulnerability means that genes
   contribute a predisposition for a disorder, which may or may not exceed the
   threshold required to produce the disorder; environmental challenges such as
   neglect or emotional trauma may combine with a person’s hereditary
   susceptibility to exceed that threshold. The general concept applies to behavior
   and abilities as well, though we wouldn’t use the term vulnerability in those
   contexts. For example, the combination of genes a person receives determines a
   broad range for the person’s potential intelligence; environmental influences
   then will determine where in that range the person’s capability will fall.
   Psychologists no longer talk about heredity versus environment, as if the two are
   competing with each other for importance. Both are required, and they work
   together to make us what we are. As an earlier psychologist put it, “To ask
   whether heredity or environment is more important to life is like asking whether
   fuel or oxygen is more necessary for making a fire” (Woodworth, 1941, p. 1).
   What do we mean by “genetic predisposition”?
   With increasing understanding of genetics, we are now in the position to change
   our very being. This kind of capability carries with it a tremendous
   responsibility. The knowledge of our genetic makeup raises the question of
   whether it is better for a person to know about a risk that may never materialize,
   such as susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, many people worry
   that the ability to do genetic testing on our unborn children means that some
   parents will choose to abort a fetus because it has genes for a trait they consider
   undesirable. Our ability to plumb the depths of the brain and of the genome is
   increasing faster than our grasp of either its implications or how to resolve the
   ethical questions that will arise. We will consider some of the ethical issues of
   genetic research in Chapter 4.

   In Perspective
   In the first issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience, the editors observed that
   brain science still has a “frontier” feel to it. The excitement of exploration is real
   and tangible, and the discoveries and accomplishments are remarkable for such a
   young discipline. The successes come from many sources: the genius of our
   intellectual ancestors, the development of new technologies, the adoption of
   empiricism, and, we believe, a coming to terms with the concept of the mind.
   Evidence of all these influences will be apparent in the following chapters.
   Behavioral neuroscience still has a long way to go. For all our successes, we do
   not fully understand what causes schizophrenia, exactly how the brain is
   changed by learning, or why some people are more intelligent than others. The
   1990s was declared the Decade of the Brain; Torsten Wiesel (whose landmark
   research in vision you will read about later) scoffed at the idea of dedicating a
   decade to the brain as “foolish. . . . We need at least a century, maybe even a
   millennium” (quoted in Horgan, 1999, p. 18). As you read the rest of this book,
   keep in mind that you are on the threshold of that century’s journey, that
   millennium of discovery.
   Chapter Summary
   The Origins of Behavioral Neuroscience
   Behavioral neuroscience (or biopsychology) developed out of physiology and philosophy
   as early psychologists adopted empiricism.
   Most psychologists and neuroscientists treat mind as a product of the brain, believing that
   mental activity can be explained in terms of the brain’s functions.
   Localization describes brain functioning better than equipotentiality, but a brain process is
   more likely to be carried out by a network of structures than by a single structure.
   Nature and Nurture
   We are learning that a number of behaviors are genetically influenced. One does not
   inherit a behavior itself, but genes influence structure and function in the brain and body
   in a way that influences behavior.
   Behavior is a product of both genes and environment. In many cases, genes produce a
   predisposition, and environment further determines the outcome.
   With the knowledge of the genome map, we stand on the threshold of unbelievable
   opportunity for identifying causes of behavior and diseases, but we face daunting ethical
   challenges as well.

   For Further Thought
   Why, in the view of most neuroscientists, is materialistic monism the more productive
   approach for understanding the functions of the mind? What will be the best test of the
   correctness of this approach?
   Scientists were working just as hard on the problems of the brain a half century ago as they are
   now. Why were the dramatic discoveries of recent years not made then?
   What are the implications of knowing what all the genes do and of being able to do a scan that
   will reveal which genes an individual has?
   If you were told that you had a gene that made it 50% likely that you would develop a certain
   disease later in life, what could you do with that knowledge?
   Test Your Understanding
   1. How would a monist and a dualist pursue the study of behavioral neuroscience differently?

   parts of the brain were responsible for specific behaviors?

   Make a matrix like the one in Figure 1.10 to show the genotypes and phenotypes of the
   offspring of an AO parent and a BO parent.

   Things were looking good for Jim and his wife. She was pregnant with their first
   child, and they had just purchased and moved into a new home. After the
   exterminating company treated the house for termites by injecting the pesticide
   chlordane under the concrete slab, Jim noticed that the carpet was wet and there
   was a chemical smell in the air. He dried the carpet with towels and thought no
   more about it, not realizing that chlordane can be absorbed through the skin. A
   few days later, he developed headaches, fatigue, and numbness. Worse, he had
   problems with memory, attention, and reasoning. His physician referred him to
   the toxicology research center of a large university medical school. His
   intelligence test score was normal, but the deficiencies he was reporting showed
   up on more specific tests of cognitive ability. Jim and his wife had to move out
   of their home; at work, he had to accept reduced responsibilities because of his
   difficulties in concentration and adapting to novel situations. The chlordane had
   not damaged the structure of his brain as you might suspect, but it had interfered
   with the functioning of the brain cells by impairing a mechanism called the
   sodium-potassium pump (Zillmer & Spiers, 2001). Jim’s unfortunate case
   reminds us that the nervous system is as delicate as it is intricate. Only by
   understanding how it works will we be able to appreciate human behavior, to
   enhance human performance, and to treat behavioral problems such as drug
   addiction and psychosis.

   The Cells That Make Us Who We Are
   To understand human behavior and the disorders that affect it, you must
   understand how the brain works. And to understand how the brain works, you
   must first have at least a basic understanding of the cells that carry messages
   back and forth in the brain and throughout the rest of the body. Neurons are
   specialized cells that convey sensory information into the brain; carry out
   the operations involved in thought, feeling, and action; and transmit
   commands out into the body to control muscles and organs. It is estimated
   that there are about 86 billion neurons in the human brain (Figure 2.1; Azevedo
   et al., 2009). This means that there are more neurons in your brain than stars in
   our galaxy. But as numerous and as important as they are, neurons make up only
   half of the brain’s cells. The other half are glial cells, which we will discuss later
   in the chapter.
   Neurons
   Neurons are responsible for all the things we do—our movements, our thoughts,
   our memories, and our emotions. It is difficult to believe that anything so simple
   as a cell can measure up to this task, and the burden is on the neuroscientist to
   demonstrate that this is true. As you will see, the neuron is deceptively simple in
   its action but impressively complex in its function.
   Figure 2.1 Estimated Numbers of Neurons in the Brain and Spinal Cord.
   Basic Structure: The Motor Neuron
   First let’s look inside a neuron, because we want to show you that the neuron is a
   cell, very much like other cells in the body. Figure 2.2 is an illustration of the
   most prominent part of the neuron, the cell body or soma. The cell body is
   filled with a liquid called cytoplasm and contains a number of organelles. The
   largest of these organelles is the nucleus, which contains the cell’s chromosomes.
   Other organelles are responsible for converting nutrients into fuel for the cell,
   constructing proteins, and removing waste materials. So far, this could be the
   description of any cell; now let’s look at the neuron’s specializations that enable
   it to carry out its unique role. Figure 2.3 illustrates a typical neuron. “Typical” is
   used guardedly here, because there are three major kinds of neurons and many
   variations within those types. The figure illustrates a motor neuron, which
   carries commands to the muscles and organs. It is particularly useful for
   demonstrating the structure and functions that all neurons have in common.
   What are the parts of the neuron?
   Dendrites are extensions that branch out from the cell body to receive
   information from other neurons. Their branching structure allows them to
   collect information from many neurons. The axon extends like a tail from the
   cell body and carries information to other locations, sometimes across great
   distances. The myelin sheath that is shown wrapped around the axon supports
   the axon and provides other benefits that we will consider later. Branches at the
   end of the axon culminate in swellings called axon terminals. The terminals
   contain chemical neurotransmitters, which the neuron releases to
   communicate with a muscle, an organ or the next neuron in a chain. In our
   examples, we will talk as if neurons form a simple chain, with one cell sending
   messages to a single other neuron, and so on; in actuality, a single neuron
   receives input from many neurons and sends its output to many others.
   Neurons are usually so small that they can be seen only with the aid of a
   microscope. The cell body is the largest part of the neuron, ranging from 0.005
   to 0.1 millimeter (mm) in diameter in mammals. (In case you are unfamiliar with
   metric measurements, a millimeter is about the thickness of a dime.) Even the
   giant neurons of the squid, favored by researchers for their conveniently large
   size, have axons that are only 1 mm in diameter. Typical axons are smaller; in
   mammals, they range from 0.002 to 0.02 mm in diameter. Axons may be as short
   as 0.1 mm or as long as 5 m in the tallest giraffes.
   Figure 2.2 Cell Body of a Neuron.
   Other Types of Neurons
   The second type of neuron is the sensory neuron. Sensory neurons carry
   information from the body and from the outside world into the brain and
   spinal cord. Motor and sensory neurons have the same components, but they are
   configured differently. A motor neuron’s axon and dendrites extend in several
   directions from the cell body, which is why it is called a multipolar neuron.
   Sensory neurons can be either unipolar or bipolar. The sensory neuron in Figure
   2.4a is called a unipolar neuron because of the single short stalk from the cell
   body that divides into two branches. Bipolar neurons have an axon on one side
   of the cell body and a dendritic process on the other (Figure 2.4b). Motor and
   sensory neurons are specialized for transmission over long distances; their
   lengths are not shown here in the same scale as the rest of the cell.
   The third type is neither motor nor sensory. Interneurons connect one neuron
   to another in the same part of the brain or spinal cord. Notice in Figure 2.4c
   that this neuron is also multipolar, but its axon appears to be missing; for some
   interneurons this is so, and when they do have axons, they are often so short that
   they are indistinguishable from dendrites. Because interneurons make
   connections over very short distances, they do not need the long axons that
   characterize their motor and sensory counterparts. In the spinal cord,
   interneurons bridge between sensory neurons and motor neurons to produce a
   reflex. In the brain, they connect adjacent neurons to carry out the complex
   processing that the brain is noted for. Considering the major role they play, it
   should come as no surprise that interneurons are the most numerous neurons.
   Figure 2.3 Components of a Neuron.
   Figure 2.4 Sensory Neurons and an Interneuron.
   The different kinds of neurons operate similarly; they differ mostly in their
   shape, which fits them for their specialized tasks. We will examine how neurons
   work in the next few sections. The types of neurons and their characteristics are
   summarized in Table 2.1.
   The Neural Membrane and Its Potentials
   The most critical factor in the neuron’s ability to communicate is the membrane
   that encloses the cell. The membrane is exceptionally thin—only about 8
   micrometers (millionths of a meter) thick—and is made up of lipid (fat) and
   protein (Figure 2.5). Each lipid molecule has a “head” end and a “tail” end. The
   heads of the molecules are water soluble, so they are attracted to the seawater-
   like fluid around and inside cells. The tails are water insoluble, so they are
   repelled by the fluid. Therefore, as the heads orient toward the fluid and the tails
   orient away from the fluid, the molecules turn their tails toward each other and
   form a double-layer membrane.
   What accounts for the resting potential?
   Figure 2.5 Cross Section of the Cell Membrane of a Neuron.
   The membrane not only holds a cell together but also controls the environment
   within and around the cell. Some molecules, such as water, oxygen, and carbon
   dioxide, can diffuse through the membrane freely. Many other substances are
   barred from entry. Still others are allowed limited passage through protein
   channels (shown in the figure in green) that open and close under different
   circumstances. This selective permeability contributes to the most fundamental
   characteristic of neurons, polarization, which means that there is a difference
   in electrical charge between the inside and outside of the cell. A difference in
   electrical charge between two points, such as the poles of a battery or the
   inside and outside of a cell, is also called a voltage.
   The Resting Potential. Just as you would measure the voltage of a battery, you
   can measure a neuron’s voltage (Figure 2.6). By arbitrary convention, the
   voltage is expressed as a comparison of the inside of the neuron with the outside.
   The difference in charge between the inside and outside of the membrane of
   a neuron at rest is called the resting potential. This voltage is negative and
   varies anywhere from –40 to –80 millivolts (mV) in different neurons but is
   typically around –70 mV. You should understand that neither the inside of the
   neuron nor the outside has a voltage, because a voltage is a difference and is
   meaningful only in comparison with another location. Note that this voltage is
   quite small—the voltage of a 1.5-V flashlight battery is 25 times greater. No
   matter; we’re moving information, and very little power is required.
   Figure 2.6 Recording Potentials in a Neuron.
   Source: Bob Jacobs, Colorado College.
   Figure 2.7 Distribution of Ions Inside and Outside the Resting Neuron.
   The resting potential is due to the unequal distribution of electrical charges on
   the two sides of the membrane. The charges come from ions, atoms that are
   charged because they have lost or gained one or more electrons. Sodium ions
   (Na + ) and potassium ions (K + ) are positively charged. Chloride ions (Cl − ) are
   negative, and so are certain proteins and amino acids that make up the organic
   anions (A − ). The fluid outside the neuron contains mostly Na + and Cl − ions, and
   the ions inside the neuron are mostly K + and A − (Figure 2.7). The inside of the
   neuron has more negative ions than positive ions, whereas the ions on the
   outside are mostly positive, and this makes the resting potential negative.
   If you remember from grade-school science that molecules tend to diffuse from
   an area of high concentration to one of low concentration, then you are probably
   wondering how this imbalance in ion distribution can continue to exist. In fact,
   two forces do work to balance the location of the ions. Because of the force of
   diffusion, ions move through the membrane to the side where they are less
   concentrated. And, as a result of electrostatic pressure, ions are repelled
   from the side that is similarly charged and attracted to the side that is
   oppositely charged.
   In spite of these two forces, a variety of other influences keep the membrane
   polarized. Both forces would move the organic anions out, but they are too large
   to pass through the membrane. Their negative charge then repels the chloride
   ions, so the force of diffusion is unable to move those ions inside. As a result, the
   “real players” then become the potassium and sodium ions. There is a slightly
   greater tendency for potassium to move outward (because its force of diffusion is
   stronger than its electrostatic pressure), while the force of both gradients attracts
   sodium inside. However, ions may cross the membrane only through channels
   like those in Figures 2.7 and 2.8, which are selective for particular ions. In the
   neuron’s resting state, both the sodium channel and the potassium channel are
   closed, so only a few ions trickle through.
   The few ions that do make it through are returned by the sodium-potassium
   pump, which consists of large protein molecules that move sodium ions
   through the cell membrane to the outside and potassium ions back inside. Its
   exchange rate of three sodium ions for every two potassium ions helps keep the
   inside of the membrane more negative than the outside. The pump is a metabolic
   process, which means that it uses energy; in fact, it accounts for an estimated
   40% of the neuron’s energy expenditure. But you will soon see that this energy is
   well spent, because the resting potential stores the energy to power the action
   potential, the major signal in the nervous system.
   Ion Channels and Local Potentials. Before we move on, we need a better
   understanding of how the ion channels work. These are pores in the membrane
   formed by proteins, and they gate the flow of ions between the extracellular and
   intracellular fluids. Chemically gated channels can be opened by ligands
   (neurotransmitters or hormones), and electrically gated channels are opened by a
   change in the electrical potential of the membrane.
   A neuron is usually stimulated by inputs that arrive on the neuron’s dendrites
   and/or cell body from another neuron or from a sensory receptor. The effect may
   be excitatory or inhibitory, depending on the ligand and the characteristics of the
   receptors. An excitatory signal causes a slight partial depolarization, which
   means that the polarity in a small area of the membrane is shifted toward zero.
   This partial depolarization disturbs the ion balance in the adjacent membrane, so
   the disturbance flows down the dendrites and across the cell membrane. This
   looks at first like the way the neuron might communicate its messages through
   the nervous system; however, because a partial depolarization is decremental—it
   dies out over distance—it is effective over only very short distances. For this
   reason, the partial depolarization is often called the local potential. The ion
   channels in the axon are electrically gated, and they have unique physical
   properties. If the local potential exceeds the threshold for activating those
   channels, typically about 10 mV more positive than the resting potential, it will
   initiate an action potential.
   Action Potentials. The action potential is an abrupt depolarization of the
   membrane that allows the neuron to communicate over long distances. The
   voltage across the resting neuron membrane is stored energy, just as the term
   resting potential implies. Imagine countless sodium ions being held outside the
   neuron against the combined forces of diffusion and electrostatic pressure
   (Figure 2.8a). A stimulus that partially depolarizes a segment of membrane
   causes voltage-gated sodium ion channels to open; this allows nearby sodium
   ions to rush into the axon at a rate 500 times greater than normal (Figure 2.8b).
   They are propelled into the cell’s interior so rapidly that the movement is often
   described as explosive. A small area inside the membrane becomes fully
   depolarized to zero; the potential even overshoots to around +30 or +40 mV,
   making the interior at that location temporarily positive.
   Just as abruptly as the neuron “fired,” it begins to recover its resting potential. At
   the peak of the action potential, voltage sensors in the sodium channels detect
   the depolarization and close a gate, inactivating the channel and preventing
   further sodium ion influx (Catterall, 2010). The depolarization also causes
   voltage-gated potassium ion channels to open; the positive charge and the
   concentration of potassium ions inside the membrane combine to force
   potassium ions out. This outward flow of potassium ions returns the axon to its
   resting potential and a bit beyond (Figure 2.8c). The action potential lasts about
   1 millisecond (one thousandth of a second); the actual duration varies among
   individual neurons. (Obviously, these channels are what make the neuron
   operate; the accompanying Application describes how they are exploited by
   nature and in research and medicine.)
   Only the ions in a very thin layer on either side of the membrane have
   participated in the action potential; these dislocated ions diffuse into the
   surrounding fluid, and the membrane potential returns to its resting level (Figure
   2.8d). Eventually, though, the ions must be returned to their locations or the
   neuron cannot continue firing; the sodium-potassium pump takes care of this.
   (Perhaps you can see now why Jim was in such a bad way after his bout with
   chlordane.)
   What is the role of the sodium-potassium pump following an action potential?
   Figure 2.8 Ion Movement and Voltages During the Neural Impulse.
   Figures Brought to Life
   The depolarization that occurs during the action potential triggers nearby sodium
   channels to open as well. Thus, a new action potential is triggered right next to
   the first one. That action potential in turn triggers another farther along, creating
   a chain reaction of action potentials that move through the axon; thus, a signal
   flows from one end of the neuron to the other. Nothing physically moves down
   the axon. Instead, a series of events occurs in succession along the axon’s length,
   much as a line of dominoes standing on end knock each other over when you tip
   the first one. When the action potential reaches the terminals, they pass the
   signal on to the next neuron in the chain (or to an organ or a muscle). The
   transmission of signals from neuron to neuron is covered later; for now, the
   action potential needs to be examined a bit further.
   The action potential differs in two important ways from the local potential that
   initiates it. First, the local potential is a graded potential, which means that it
   varies in magnitude with the strength of the stimulus that produced it. The
   action potential, by contrast, is ungraded; it operates according to the all-or-
   none law, which means that it occurs at full strength or it does not occur at
   all. A larger graded potential does not produce a larger action potential; like the
   fuse of a firecracker, the action potential depends on the energy stored in the
   neuron, in this case due to the difference in ion concentrations between the two
   sides of the membrane. A second difference is that the action potential is
   nondecremental; it travels down the axon without any decrease in size,
   propagated anew and at full strength at each successive point along the way.
   The action potential thus makes it possible for the neuron to conduct information
   over long distances.
   How is an action potential different from a graded potential?
   However, because the action potential is all-or-none, its size cannot carry
   information about the intensity of the initiating stimulus. One way stimulus
   intensity is represented is in the number of neurons firing. The voltage
   sensitivity of sodium channels varies among neurons, resulting in different
   thresholds; a more intense stimulus will recruit firing in neurons with higher
   thresholds and, therefore, in more neurons. There is, though, a way in which the
   individual neuron can encode stimulus strength, as you will see in the discussion
   of refractory periods.

   The Japanese delicacy fugu, or puffer fish, produces an exciting tingling sensation in the diner’s
   mouth; improperly prepared, it causes numbness and weakness and, in some cases, a paralysis
   of the respiratory muscles that has claimed the lives of a few thousand culinary risk takers. The
   fish’s natural poison, tetrodotoxin (TTX), blocks sodium channels and prevents neurons from
   firing (Kandel & Siegelbaum, 2000a). Other neurotoxins (neuron poisons) are found in snake
   venoms, which block sodium, potassium (Benoit & Dubois, 1986; Fertuck & Salpeter, 1974), or
   calcium channels, and scorpion venom, which keeps sodium channels open, prolonging the
   action potential (Catterall, 1984; Chuang, Jaffe, Cribbs, Perez-Reyes, & Swartz, 1998; Pappone
   & Cahalan, 1987).
   Interfering with neuron functioning can be useful, though; for example, most local anesthetics
   prevent neuron firing by blocking sodium channels (Ragsdale, McPhee, Scheuer, & Catterall,
   1994), and some general anesthetics hyperpolarize the neuron by opening potassium channels
   and allowing the potassium ions to leak out (Nicoll & Madison, 1982; A. J. Patel et al., 1999).
   The cone snail of the South Seas can penetrate a wet suit with its proboscis and inject toxins that
   will kill a human in half an hour, but the various species’ hundred or so toxins that target
   sodium, potassium, or calcium channels or block neurotransmitter receptors are in demand by
   researchers developing pain relievers and drugs for epilepsy (L. Nelson, 2004).
   An exciting new research strategy known as optogenetics allows researchers to create light-
   responsive channels (as well as receptors) in neurons so that they can be controlled by
   light. Different types of channels are triggered by different wavelengths of light, which allows
   the researcher either to accelerate or to inhibit firing. The procedure is being used to understand
   the circuitry in a variety of behaviors and brain processes and is showing potential for use in
   therapeutic procedures.
   Refractory Periods
   With the sodium ion channels inactivated at the end of the action potential,
   the neuron cannot generate another impulse for a millisecond or so, a time
   referred to as the absolute refractory period. This delay in responsiveness has
   two important effects. First, the absolute refractory period limits how frequently
   the neuron can generate new action potentials. A neuron that requires a
   millisecond to recover can fire at most a thousand times a second; many neurons
   have much lower firing rate limits. A second effect of this recovery period is that
   the action potential can initiate new potentials only in the forward direction, not
   behind it. This is critical, because backward-moving potentials would “lock up”
   the neuron with a series of repeating action potentials traveling in both directions
   and block responses to newly arriving messages.
   What are the absolute and relative refractory periods?
   A second refractory period plays a role in intensity coding in the axon. The
   potassium channels remain open for a few milliseconds following the absolute
   refractory period. Although enough sodium ion channels have become active to
   support another action potential, the continued exit of potassium ions makes the
   neuron slightly more negative than usual (the “dip” in Figure 2.8). During the
   relative refractory period, another action potential can be generated, but only
   by a stronger-than-threshold stimulus. A stimulus that is greater than this
   temporarily higher threshold will cause the neuron to fire again earlier; with
   increasingly stronger stimuli the neuron will fire earlier and at a higher rate.
   Thus, the axon encodes stimulus intensity not in the size of its action
   potential but in its firing rate, an effect called the rate law.
   Glial Cells
   Glial cells are nonneural cells that provide a number of supporting
   functions to neurons. The name glia is derived from the Greek word for glue,
   which gives you some idea how the role of glial cells has been viewed in the
   past. However, glial cells do much more than hold neurons together. One of their
   most important functions is to increase the speed of conduction in neurons.
   Myelination and Conduction Speed
   Survival depends in part on how rapidly messages can move through the nervous
   system, enabling the organism to pounce on its prey, outrun a predator, or
   process spoken language quickly. The speed with which neurons conduct their
   impulses varies from 1 to 120 meters (m) per second (s), or about 270 miles per
   hour (435 km/hr). This is much slower than the flow of electricity through a wire
   (which can approach 300,000 km/hr), the analogy sometimes used to describe
   neural conduction. Because conduction speed is so critical to survival, strategies
   have evolved for increasing it. One way is to develop larger axons, which
   provide less resistance to the flow of electrical potentials. By evolving motor
   neurons with 0.5 mm thick axons, the squid has achieved conduction speeds of
   30 m/s, compared with 1 m/s in the smallest neurons.
   However, conduction speed does not increase in direct proportion to axon size.
   To reach our four-times-greater maximum conduction speed of 120 m/s, our
   axons would have to be 4 2 = 16 times larger than the squid axon, or 8 mm in
   diameter (the size of a large pea)! Obviously, your brain would be larger than
   you could carry around. In other words, if axon size were the only way to
   achieve fast conduction speed, you would not exist. Vertebrates (animals with
   backbones) have developed another solution, myelination. Two types of glial
   cells produce myelin, a fatty tissue that wraps around the axon (like a
   jellyroll) to insulate it from the surrounding fluid and from other neurons.
   Only the axon is covered, not the cell body. Myelin is produced in the brain
   and spinal cord by a type of glial cell called oligodendrocytes and in the rest
   of the nervous system by Schwann cells (Figure 2.9). Almost 75% of the glial
   cells in the brain are myelin-producing oligodendrocytes (Pillay & Manger,
   2007)
   What are the functions of glial cells?
   Because there are very few sodium channels under the myelin sheath, action
   potentials cannot occur there; conduction in myelinated areas is by graded
   potential (Waxman & Ritchie, 1985). However, myelin appears in segments
   about 1 mm long, with a gap of one or two thousandths of a millimeter between
   segments. The gaps in the myelin sheath are called nodes of Ranvier (see
   Figure 2.9). At each node of Ranvier, where the membrane is exposed and there
   are plenty of sodium channels, the graded potential triggers an action potential.
   Action potentials thus jump from node to node in a form of transmission
   called saltatory conduction.
   This arrangement has three benefits. First, the insulating effect of myelin reduces
   an electrical effect of the membrane called capacitance. Because capacitance
   slows the movement of ions down the axon, the graded potential gets a big boost
   in speed. The overall effect of myelination is the equivalent of increasing the
   axon diameter 100 times (Koester & Siegelbaum, 2000). Second, the breaks in
   the myelination mean that the signal is regenerated by an action potential at
   every node of Ranvier. Third, myelinated neurons use much less energy because
   there is less work for the sodium-potassium pump to do.
   Figure 2.9 Glial Cells Produce Myelin for Axons.
   Some diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, destroy myelin. As myelin is lost, the
   capacitance rises, reducing the distance that graded potentials can travel before
   dying out. The individual is worse off than if the neurons had never been
   myelinated; because there are few voltage-sensitive sodium channels under the
   myelin sheath (Ritchie & Rogart, 1977), action potentials may not be generated
   in the previously myelinated area. Conduction slows or stops in affected
   neurons.
   Other Glial Functions
   There are several types of glial cells, and they make numerous contributions to
   neural functioning. During fetal development, radial glia form scaffolds that
   guide new neurons to their destinations. Later on, microglia provide energy to
   neurons and respond to injury and disease by removing cellular debris. Neurons
   form seven times as many connections in the presence of astrocytes, and they
   start to lose their synapses if astrocytes are removed from the culture dish
   (Pfrieger & Barres, 1997; Ullian, Sapperstein, Christopherson, & Barres, 2001;
   see Figure 2.10). Astrocytes also appear to play a key role in learning, as Figure
   2.11 demonstrates (X. Han et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2011). Later in this chapter
   you will see that glial cells play a direct role in neural activity.
   Mice receiving brain grafts of human glial cells rapidly learned a fear response
   (“freezing” to a tone which signaled an upcoming electric shock), while
   ungrafted controls showed little or no improvement.

   How does myelin speed up conduction in axons?
   How Neurons Communicate With Each Other
   Before the late 1800s, microscopic examination suggested that the brain
   consisted of a continuous web. At that point, however, Camillo Golgi developed
   a new tissue-staining method that helped anatomists see individual neurons by
   randomly staining some entire cells without staining others (see the discussion of
   staining methods in Chapter 4). With this technique, the Spanish anatomist
   Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1937/1989) was able to see that each neuron is a
   separate cell. (See the accompanying In the News feature for more information
   about Ramón y Cajal’s seminal work on describing the nervous system). The
   connection between two neurons is called a synapse, a term derived from the
   Latin word that means “to grasp.” The neurons are not in direct physical
   contact at the synapse but are separated by a small gap called the synaptic
   cleft. Two terms will be useful to us in the following discussion: The neuron
   that is transmitting to another is called the presynaptic neuron; the receiving
   neuron is the postsynaptic neuron (Figure 2.12).
   Figure 2.11 Human Glial Cells Enhance Conditioning in Mice.

   Glial Progenitor Cells Enhances Synaptic Plasticity and Learning in Adult
   Mice,” by Xiaoning Han et al., 2013, Cell Stem Cell, 12, p. 350.
   Chemical Transmission at the Synapse
   Until the 1920s, physiologists assumed that neurons communicated by an
   electrical current that bridged the gap to the next neuron. The German
   physiologist Otto Loewi believed that synaptic transmission was chemical, but
   he did not know how to test his hypothesis. One night Loewi awoke from sleep
   with the solution to his problem (Loewi, 1953). He wrote his idea down so he
   would not forget it, but the next morning he could not read his own writing. He
   recalled that day as the most “desperate of my whole scientific life” (p. 33). But
   the following night he awoke again with the same idea; taking no chances, he
   rushed to his laboratory. There he isolated the hearts of two frogs. He applied
   electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve attached to one of the hearts, which
   slowed the heartbeat. Then he extracted a salt solution that he had placed in the
   heart beforehand to capture any chemical that might have been released. When
   he placed this salt solution in the second heart, that heart slowed, too, just as
   Loewi expected. Then he stimulated the accelerator nerve of the first heart,
   which caused the heart to beat faster. When he transferred the solution from the
   first heart to the second, this time it speeded up (Figure 2.13). So Loewi
   demonstrated that transmission at the synapse is chemical and that neurons
   release at least two different chemicals that have opposite effects.
   In The News: Ramón y Cajal’s Work Received by New Audience
   Paul Fearn/Alamy Stock Photo.
   Santiago Ramón y Cajal’s drawings of neurons have inspired neuroscientists for more than a
   century, but now they are touching a wider audience through an exhibition of his work at the
   Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis (Hamilton, 2017). Although art and science are often
   portrayed as radically different disciplines, in the days before microscopic photography,
   neuroanatomists relied on skilled artwork to portray what they observed of the nervous system.
   Ramón y Cajal had studied art and combined his skills not only to portray the structures he saw
   but also to alter our understanding of those structures. The scientific import of Ramón y Cajal’s
   drawings has long been recognized, as evidenced by the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
   Medicine that he shared with Camillo Golgi for identifying the neuron as the main building
   block of the nervous system, but the artistry of his drawings received little prior attention. The
   “Beautiful Brain” exhibit and the related book, The Beautiful Brain: The Drawings of Santiago
   Ramón y Cajal, show how his drawings of neurons can provoke emotion, even in those with no
   training in the nervous system. Some of the drawings seem almost like trees, with dendritic
   spines extending out across the paper, while others show cell bodies looking like fruit. The
   exhibit’s organizer, Lyndel King, also hopes that the exhibit will show people how art and
   science can work together to improve understanding.
   Thought Questions
   1. How have Ramón y Cajal’s drawings been important in the history of neuroscience?
   2. In what ways do you think scientists and artists might be able to work together to promote
   knowledge?
   For the news story and photographs of Ramón y Cajal’s drawings, visit
   edge.sagepub.com/garrett5e and select the Chapter 2 study resources.
   It turned out later that some neurons do communicate electrically by passing ions
   through channels that connect one neuron to the next; their main function
   appears to be synchronizing activity in nearby neurons (Bennett & Zukin, 2004).
   In addition, some neurons release a gas transmitter. Still, Loewi was essentially
   correct because most synapses are chemical. By the way, if this example
   suggests to you that the best way to solve a problem is to “sleep on it,” keep in
   mind that such insight occurs only when people have paid their dues in hard
   work beforehand!
   I awoke again, at three o’clock, and I remembered what it was. . . . I got up immediately,
   went to the laboratory, made the experiment . . . and at five o’clock the chemical
   transmission of the nervous impulse was conclusively proved.
   —Otto Loewi
   At chemical synapses, neurotransmitters are stored in the terminals in
   membrane-enclosed containers called vesicles; the term means, appropriately,
   “little bladders.” When the action potential arrives at the terminals, it opens
   channels that allow calcium ions to enter the terminals from the extracellular
   fluid. The calcium ions cause the vesicles clustered nearest the membrane to fuse
   with the membrane. The membrane opens there, and the transmitter spills out
   and diffuses across the cleft in a process called exocytosis (Figure 2.14).
   How does synaptic transmission differ from transmission in the axon?
   On the postsynaptic neuron, the neurotransmitter docks with specialized protein
   receptors that match the molecular shape of the transmitter molecules like a key
   in a lock (see Figure 2.14). Activation of these receptors causes ion channels in
   the membrane to open. Ionotropic receptors open the channels directly to
   produce the immediate reactions required for muscle activity and sensory
   processing; metabotropic receptors open channels indirectly and slowly to
   produce longer-lasting effects. Opening the channels is what sets off the graded
   potential that initiates the action potential. You will see in the next section that
   the effect this has on the postsynaptic neuron depends on which receptors are
   activated.
   The chemical jump across the synapse takes a couple of milliseconds; that is a
   significant slowing compared with transmission in the axon. In a system that
   places a premium on speed, inserting these gaps in the neural pathway must have
   some compensating benefit. As you will see in the following sections, synapses
   add important complexity to the simple all-or-none response in the axon.
   Figure 2.12 The Synapse Between a Presynaptic Neuron and a Postsynaptic
   Neuron.
   Excitation and Inhibition
   Opening ion channels on the dendrites and cell body has one of two effects: It
   can cause the local membrane potential to shift in a positive direction toward
   zero, partially depolarizing the membrane, or it can shift the potential farther in
   the negative direction. Partial depolarization, or hypopolarization, is
   excitatory and facilitates the occurrence of an action potential; increased
   polarization, or hyperpolarization, is inhibitory and makes an action
   potential less likely to occur. The value of excitation is obvious, but inhibition
   can communicate just as much information as excitation does. Also, the message
   becomes more complex because input from one source can partially or
   completely negate input from another. In addition, inhibition helps prevent
   runaway excitation; one cause of the uncontrolled neural storms that sweep
   across the brain during an epileptic seizure is a deficiency in receptors for an
   inhibitory transmitter (Baulac et al., 2001).
   What determines whether the effect on the postsynaptic neuron is facilitating or
   inhibiting? It depends on a combination of which transmitter is released and the
   type of receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. A particular transmitter can have
   an excitatory effect at one location in the nervous system and an inhibitory effect
   at another; however, some transmitters typically produce excitation, and others
   most often produce inhibition. If the receptors open sodium channels, this
   produces hypopolarization of the dendrites and cell body, which is an
   excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). Other receptors open potassium
   channels, chloride channels, or both; as potassium moves out of the cell or
   chloride moves in, it produces a hyperpolarization of the dendrites and cell
   body, or an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).
   At this point, there is only a graded local potential. This potential spreads down
   the dendrites and across the cell body to the axon hillock (where the axon joins
   the cell body). At the axon, a positive graded potential that surpasses threshold
   will produce an action potential; a negative graded potential will make it harder
   for the axon to fire. Most neurons fire spontaneously all the time, so EPSPs will
   increase the rate of firing and IPSPs will decrease the rate of firing (Figure 2.15).
   So now another form of complexity has been added at the synapse: The message
   to the postsynaptic neuron can be bidirectional, not just off-on.
   You should not assume that excitation of neurons always corresponds to
   activation of behavior or that inhibition necessarily suppresses behavior. An
   EPSP may activate a neuron that has an inhibitory effect on other neurons, and
   an IPSP may reduce activity in a neuron that has an inhibitory effect on other
   neurons, increasing their activity. An example of this paradox at the behavioral
   level is the effect of Ritalin. Ritalin and many other medications used to treat
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children are in a class of
   drugs called stimulants, which increase activity in the nervous system. Yet they
   calm hyperactive individuals and improve their ability to concentrate and focus
   attention (D. J. Cox, Merkel, Kovatchev, & Seward, 2000; Mattay et al., 1996).
   They probably have this effect by stimulating frontal areas of the brain where
   activity has been found to be abnormally low (Faigel, Szuajderman, Tishby,
   Turel, & Pinus, 1995).
   Figure 2.13 Loewi’s Experiment Demonstrating Chemical Transmission in
   Neurons.
   Figures Brought to Life
   Next you will see that the ability to combine the inputs of large numbers of
   neurons expands the synapse’s contribution to complexity even further.
   What are summation and integration?
   Postsynaptic Integration
   The output of a single neuron is not enough by itself to cause a postsynaptic
   neuron to fire or to prevent it from firing. In fact, an excitatory neuron may
   depolarize the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron by as little as 0.2 to 0.4 mV
   (Kandel & Siegelbaum, 2000b); remember that it takes an approximately 10-mV
   depolarization to trigger an action potential. However, a typical neuron receives
   input from approximately one thousand other neurons (Figure 2.16); because
   each neuron has numerous terminals, this amounts to as many as 10,000 synaptic
   connections in most parts of the brain and up to 100,000 in the cerebellum
   (Kandel & Siegelbaum, 2000a).
   Because a single neuron has a relatively small effect, the postsynaptic neuron
   must combine potentials from many neurons to fire. This requirement is actually
   advantageous: It ensures that a neuron will not be fired by the spontaneous
   activity of a single presynaptic neuron, and it allows the neuron to combine
   multiple inputs into a more complex message. These potentials are combined at
   the axon hillock in two ways. Spatial summation combines potentials
   occurring simultaneously at different locations on the dendrites and cell
   body. Temporal summation combines potentials arriving a short time apart,
   from either the same or separate inputs. Temporal summation is possible
   because a local potential persists for a few milliseconds. Spatial summation and
   temporal summation occur differently, but they have the same result. Summation
   is illustrated in Figure 2.17.
   As you can see in Figure 2.18, summation combines EPSPs so that an action
   potential is more likely to occur. Alternatively, summation of IPSPs drives the
   membrane’s interior even more negative and makes it more difficult for
   incoming EPSPs to trigger an action potential. When both excitatory and
   inhibitory impulses arrive on a neuron, they will summate algebraically. The
   combined effect will equal the difference between the sum of the
   hypopolarizations and the sum of the hyperpolarizations. Spatial summation of
   two excitatory inputs and one inhibitory input is illustrated in Figure 2.19. The
   effect from temporal summation would be similar.
   Because the neuron can summate inputs from multiple sources, it rises above the
   role of a simple message conductor—it is an information integrator. And, using
   that information, it functions as a decision maker, determining whether to fire or
   not. Thus, the nervous system becomes less like a bunch of telephone lines and
   more like a computer. In subsequent chapters, you will come to appreciate how
   important the synapse is in understanding how we see, how we learn, and how
   we succumb to mental illness.
   Terminating Synaptic Activity
   Usually, the transmitter must be inactivated; otherwise, it might “lock up” a
   circuit that must respond frequently, or leak over to other synapses and interfere
   with their functions. Typically, transmitters are taken back into the terminals
   by membrane proteins called transporters in a process called reuptake; they
   are repackaged in vesicles and used again. At some synapses, the transmitter
   in the cleft is absorbed by nearby astrocytes. Other transmitters are partially
   broken down through a process called inactivation. The neurotransmitter
   acetylcholine, for example, is inactivated by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase,
   which splits the molecule into its components of choline and acetate. Choline is
   then taken back into the terminals and used to make more acetylcholine.
   Figure 2.14 A Presynaptic Terminal Releases the Neurotransmitter at the
   Synapse.
   Figures Brought to Life
   Controlling how much neurotransmitter remains in the synapse is one way to
   vary behavior, and many drugs capitalize on this mechanism. Cocaine blocks the
   reuptake of dopamine; some antidepressant medications block the reuptake of
   serotonin, norepinephrine, or both, whereas others (MAO inhibitors) prevent
   monoamine oxidase from inactivating those transmitters as well as dopamine
   and epinephrine; and drugs for treating the muscular disorder myasthenia gravis
   increase acetylcholine availability by inhibiting the action of
   acetylcholinesterase.
   Regulating Synaptic Activity
   The previous description has been of a system that amounts to “neuron A
   stimulates neuron B, neuron B stimulates neuron C,” and so on. However, such a
   simple system cannot transmit the complex information required to solve a math
   equation, write a symphony, or care for a newborn. Not only that, but as
   messages flow from neuron to neuron, activity would soon drift out of control;
   some activity would fade out, while other activity would escalate until it
   engulfed an entire area of the brain. A nervous system that controls complex
   behavior must have several ways to regulate its activity.
   The synapses described so far are referred to as axodendritic and axosomatic
   synapses, because their targets are dendrites and cell bodies. At axoaxonic
   synapses, a third neuron releases transmitter onto the terminals of the
   presynaptic neuron (see #1 in Figure 2.20). The result is presynaptic excitation
   or presynaptic inhibition, which increases or decreases, respectively, the
   presynaptic neuron’s release of neurotransmitter onto the postsynaptic
   neuron. One way an axoaxonic synapse adjusts a presynaptic terminal’s activity
   is by regulating the amount of calcium entering the terminal, which, you will
   remember, triggers neurotransmitter release.
   What are the three ways of regulating synaptic activity?
   Neurons also regulate their own synaptic activity in two ways. Autoreceptors on
   the presynaptic terminals sense the amount of transmitter in the cleft; if the
   amount is excessive, the presynaptic neuron reduces its output (Figure 2.20,
   #2). Postsynaptic neurons participate in regulation of synaptic activity as well.
   When there are unusual increases or decreases in neurotransmitter release,
   postsynaptic receptors change their sensitivity or even their numbers to
   compensate (Figure 2.20, #3). You will see in Chapter 14 that receptor changes
   figure prominently in some psychological disorders, such as schizophrenia.

   Glial cells also contribute to the regulation of synaptic activity. They surround
   the synapse and prevent neurotransmitter from spreading to other synapses, but
   some also remove neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft and recycle it for the
   neuron’s reuse (Figure 2.21). By varying the amount of transmitter they remove,
   glial cells influence postsynaptic excitability (Oliet, Piet, & Poulain, 2001). They
   can even respond to the neurotransmitter level in the synapse by releasing
   transmitters of their own. These gliotransmitters regulate transmitter release
   from the presynaptic neuron or directly stimulate the postsynaptic neuron to
   excite or inhibit it (M. Anderson & Hanse, 2010; E. A. Newman, 2003). Thus,
   rather than simply being neural “glue” as the name implies, glia should be
   considered active partners in neural transmission.
   Neurotransmitters
   Table 2.2 on page 40 lists twelve transmitters, grouped according to their
   chemical structure. This is an abbreviated list; there are other known or
   suspected transmitters, and there are doubtless additional transmitters yet to be
   discovered. This summary is intended to illustrate the variety in
   neurotransmitters and to give you some familiarity with the functions of a few of
   the major ones. You will encounter most of them again in the discussion of
   various behaviors in later chapters.
   Figure 2.17 Spatial and Temporal Summation.
   Stories of Brain & Behavior
   Having a variety of neurotransmitters multiplies the effects that can be produced
   at synapses; the fact that there are different subtypes of the receptors adds even
   more. For example, two types of receptors detect acetylcholine: the nicotinic
   receptor, so called because it is also activated by nicotine, and the muscarinic
   receptor, named for the mushroom derivative that can stimulate it. Nicotinic
   receptors are excitatory; they are found on muscles and, in lesser numbers, in the
   brain. Muscarinic receptors are more frequent in the brain, where they have an
   excitatory effect at some locations and an inhibitory one at others. Other
   transmitters have many more receptor subtypes than acetylcholine does.
   For decades, neurophysiologists labored under the erroneous belief, known as
   Dale’s principle, that a neuron was capable of releasing only one
   neurotransmitter. We now know that many neurons ply their postsynaptic
   partners with more than one chemical messenger (Vaaga, Borisovska, &
   Westbrook, 2014). These neurons may release two fast-acting neurotransmitters,
   a fast-acting neurotransmitter and a slow-acting monoamine, or a fast-acting
   neurotransmitter and a neuromodulator, which alters the effect of the transmitter.
   There is even evidence that some neurons release more than two
   neurotransmitters, for example, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA),
   and glutamate.
   What are two additional ways synapses add information complexity?
   Figure 2.18 Temporal and Spatial Summation.
   The release can occur in three ways. In corelease, the transmitters are packaged
   in the same vesicles. However, this doesn’t mean they’re always released
   equally; in the example in Figure 2.22a, the fusion pores between the vesicle and
   terminal membranes have opened only partially, impeding the release of the
   larger messenger molecules while allowing the smaller molecules to exit freely
   (see M. Braun et al., 2007). In cotransmission, the transmitters are in separate
   vesicles. Vesicles containing different transmitters in the same terminal differ in
   sensitivity to calcium (Ca 2+ ); a low rate of neural impulses will trigger release of
   only one of the messengers, whereas a higher rate will release both of them
   (Figure 2.22b). Finally, the neuron may release different transmitters from its
   various terminals to produce different effects at separate destinations (Figure
   2.22c).
   Figure 2.19 Spatial Summation of Excitatory and Inhibitory Potentials.
   Corelease and cotransmission are not well understood, but we do know they play
   a significant role in neural functioning. For example, release of inhibitory GABA
   dampens the excitatory effects of glutamate during seizures (Trudeau, 2004) and
   counters the arousing effects of histamine to prevent hyperactivity and sustained
   wakefulness (Yu et al., 2015). In addition, direction-detecting cells in the retina
   of the eye release acetylcholine and GABA in response to any movement of a
   visual object, but they release only GABA when the movement is in the cell’s
   “preferred” direction (Lee, Kim, & Zhou, 2010).
   Neural Codes and Neural Networks
   Underlying this discussion has been the assumption that we can explain behavior
   by understanding what neurons do. But we cannot make good on that promise as
   long as we talk as if neural communication is limited to single chains of neurons
   that either fire or don’t fire. In fact, neurons are capable of generating complex
   messages, which they send across intricate networks.
   Coding of Neural Messages
   Neurons don’t just produce a train of equally spaced impulses: They vary the
   intervals between spikes, they produce bursts of varying lengths, and the bursts
   can be separated by different intervals (Cariani, 2004). But do these temporal
   (time-related) variations in firing pattern form a code that the brain can use, or
   are they just “noise” in the system? The best way to answer this question is to
   look at sensory processes, because the researcher can correlate firing patterns
   with sensory input on one end and behavior on the other. A good example is an
   early study done by Patricia Di Lorenzo and her colleague Gerald Hecht (1993).
   First, they recorded the firing patterns in individual taste neurons of rats during
   stimulation with a sucrose (sugar) solution and quinine. As you can see in Figure
   2.23a, these flavors produce different neural activity. Then they duplicated the
   temporal patterns in the form of electrical pulses (Figure 2.23b) and used these
   to stimulate the taste pathways of other rats. The assumption was that if the brain
   uses this information, the unanesthetized rats would behave as if they were
   actually tasting sweet sucrose or bitter quinine. As Figure 2.23c shows, that is
   exactly what happened: The rats licked a water tube at a high rate when they
   were receiving stimulation patterned after sucrose but almost stopped licking—
   even though they were water deprived—when the stimulation was patterned
   after quinine.
   Figure 2.20 Regulating Activity at the Synapse.
   However, this coding apparently is not sufficient to carry the complex
   information involved in brain communication. An additional opportunity for
   coding is provided by the fact that neural information often travels over
   specialized pathways. For example, taste information is carried by at least five
   types of specialized fibers; Di Lorenzo and Hecht (1993) recorded the sucrose
   firing pattern from a “labeled line” specialized for sweet stimuli and the quinine
   pattern from another specialized for bitter stimuli. In later chapters, you will see
   that not only taste but also information about color and about the higher sound
   frequencies is transmitted over a limited number of labeled lines. However, even
   with temporal coding and labeled lines, a significant burden remains for the
   brain if it is to make sense of this information. This leads us to the topic of
   neural networks.
   Neural Networks
   Individual neurons cannot carry enough information to determine the taste of a
   bite of food or the color of an object. Color processing, for example, depends on
   four “labeled lines” carrying information about red, green, blue, and yellow
   light; we can distinguish millions of colors by comparing the relative activity in
   these four pathways. This kind of analysis requires complex interactions among
   a network of neurons. Neural networks are groups of neurons that function
   together to carry out a process; they are where the most complex neural
   processing—the “computing” work of the brain—occurs. Sometimes these
   networks involve a relatively small number of neurons in a single area, such as
   groups of neurons in a part of the rat’s brain called the hippocampus. When rats
   navigate a maze, these networks store their preceding choices and calculate their
   next choice. The networks perform so reliably that the researcher can use their
   activity to predict which way the rat will turn after a delay (Pastalkova, Itskov,
   Amarasingham, & Buzsáki, 2008). As you will see in later chapters, other
   networks combine the activity of widespread brain areas to perform language
   functions (Chapter 9), to identify an object visually and locate it in space
   (Chapter 10), and, some researchers believe, to produce conscious awareness
   (Chapter 15).

   Neurotransmitters are not the only substances that affect the nervous system. The many drugs
   and other compounds that mimic or increase the effect of a neurotransmitter are called
   agonists. Any substance that reduces the effect of a neurotransmitter is called an
   antagonist. Practically all drugs that have a psychological effect interact with a neurotransmitter
   system in the brain, and many of them do so by mimicking, or blocking, the effect of
   neurotransmitters (S. H. Snyder, 1984).
   You have already seen that the effect of acetylcholine (ACh) is duplicated by nicotine and
   muscarine at the two kinds of acetylcholine receptors (nicotinic-ACh and muscarinic-ACh,
   respectively). Opioid drugs such as heroin and morphine also act as agonists, stimulating
   receptors for opiate-like transmitters in the body. The drugs naloxone and naltrexone act as an
   antagonists to opiates, occupying the receptor sites without activating them; consequently,
   naloxone and naltrexone can be used to counteract an overdose.
   The plant toxin curare blocks nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the muscle, causing paralysis
   (A. Trautmann, 1983). Indigenous tribes of Central and South America put curare on the tips of
   their darts and arrows to disable their game. A synthetic version of curare was used as a muscle
   relaxant during surgery before safer and more effective drugs were found (M. Goldberg &
   Rosenberg, 1987). It was even used occasionally in the past to treat the muscle spasms of
   tetanus (lockjaw), which, ironically, is caused by another neurotoxin.
   Understanding these networks is the next big frontier in brain research. Their
   complexity and relative inaccessibility are challenging researchers’ resolve and
   ingenuity, but recent developments in brain imaging capabilities make the goal
   more realistic. The Human Connectome Project is a large-scale, multi-
   university effort to map the brain’s circuits. Its researchers are using a
   combination of four scanning techniques, behavioral measures, and genetic
   analysis to determine the brain’s anatomical and functional connectivity (Van
   Essen et al., 2013). The maps will help researchers understand normal brain
   functioning in realms such as learning and consciousness, as well as disorders in
   functioning, including autism and schizophrenia (Figure 2.24). By the way, it
   took more than a decade to map the roundworm’s brain, with just 300 neurons
   and 7,000 connections, so attempting it for the human brain is a very tall order.
   While we’re waiting for neuroscientists to explain how the brain works, the idea
   of neural networks provides a useful way of thinking about mental processes.
   The next time you are trying to remember a person’s name that is “on the tip of
   your tongue,” imagine your brain activating individual components of a neural
   network until one produces the name you’re looking for. If you visualize the
   person’s face as a reminder, imagine that the name and the image of the face are
   stored in related networks so that activating one memory activates the other. This
   is not just speculation: Electrode recordings from patients preparing for brain
   surgery show that the information triggered by the photo of a familiar person and
   by the person’s written name converge on the same neurons in a critical memory
   area of the brain (Quian Quiroga, Kraskov, Koch, & Fried, 2009)—thanks, of
   course, to neural networks.

   Research Spotlight: DHA for a Better Brain
   The omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a critical component in neural
   membranes and is essential for optimal brain health and functioning. The best sources of DHA
   —fatty fish, such as salmon, and fish oil supplements—are readily available, but average intake
   in the United States is less than a third of the recommended level. Studies show that omega-3
   oils improve cognitive development in children, protect adults from Alzheimer’s disease, and
   improve the quality of life and memory in people affected by dementia (Blaylock, 2008).
   Considerable research suggests that dietary DHA intake can speed neural recovery following
   injury, for example reducing recovery time from spinal cord injury in animals (Zhou-Hao, Yip,
   Priestley, & Michael-Titus, 2017) and by speeding tissue recovery and restoring cognitive
   function following adolescent traumatic brain injury (Schober et al., 2016). DHA also improves
   cognition (Weiser, Butt, & Mohajeri, 2016). Brain scans of 8- to 10-year-old children while they
   worked on a sustained attention task showed that those with higher DHA levels had greater
   functional connectivity, the ability of different areas of the brain to communicate and work with
   each other (Almeida, Jandacek, Weber, & McNamara, 2016). Importantly, these positive
   beneficial effects of DHA continue into adulthood. After 12 months on a high DHA diet, elderly
   individuals (average age of 88) in nursing homes showed lower levels of depression and less
   cognitive impairment than the control group (Hashimoto et al., 2016). Interestingly, the
   psychological and mental state of their elderly caregivers also was greater than the caregivers of
   the control group participants.

   How is information transmitted at the synapse?
   It can be said that integration transforms neurons from a “telephone line” into a computer.
   Explain.
   What difference would it make if there were no regulation of activity at the synapse?
   What is Dale’s principle, and in what way is it incorrect?
   Explain why researchers’ focus is shifting from localized neural activity to brainwide
   connections and activity.
   In Perspective
   It is impossible to understand the brain and impossible to understand behavior
   without first knowing the capabilities and the limitations of the neuron. Although
   more complexity is added at the synapse, a relatively simple device is the basis
   for our most sophisticated capabilities and behaviors. However, what happens at
   the individual neuron is not enough to account for human behavior; neurons
   work in concert with each other, in both local and brainwide networks. With
   modern tools and large cooperative efforts, researchers hope to understand how
   neurons work together to produce thought, memory, emotion, and consciousness.
   In Chapter 3, you will learn about some of the functional structures in the brain
   that are formed by the interconnection of neurons.
   Chapter Summary
   The Cells That Make Us Who We Are
   There are three major kinds of neurons: motor neurons, sensory neurons, and
   interneurons. Although they play different roles, they have the same basic components
   and operate the same way.
   The neural membrane is electrically polarized. This polarity is the resting potential, which
   is maintained by forces of diffusion and electrostatic pressure in the short term and by the
   sodium-potassium pump in the long term.
   Polarization is the basis for the neuron’s responsiveness to stimulation, in the form of the
   graded potential and the action potential.
   The neuron is limited in firing rate by the absolute refractory period and in its ability to
   respond to differing strengths of stimuli by the all-or-none law. More intense stimuli
   cause the neuron to fire earlier during the relative refractory period, providing a way to
   encode stimulus intensity (the rate law).
   Glial cells provide the myelination that enables neurons to conduct rapidly while
   remaining small. They also help regulate activity in the neurons and provide several
   supporting functions for neurons.
   How Neurons Communicate With Each Other
   Transmission from neuron to neuron is usually chemical in vertebrates, involving
   neurotransmitters released onto receptors on the postsynaptic dendrites and cell body.
   The neurotransmitter can create an excitatory postsynaptic potential, which increases the
   chance that the postsynaptic neuron will fire, or it can create an inhibitory postsynaptic
   potential, which decreases the likelihood of firing.
   Through temporal and spatial summation, the postsynaptic neuron integrates its many
   excitatory and inhibitory inputs.
   Regulation of synaptic activity is produced by axoaxonic synapses from other neurons,
   adjustment of transmitter output by autoreceptors, and change in the number or sensitivity
   of postsynaptic receptors.
   Leftover neurotransmitter may be taken back into the presynaptic terminals, absorbed by
   glial cells, or broken down by an enzyme.
   The human nervous system contains a large number of neurotransmitters, detected by an
   even greater variety of receptors. A neuron can release combinations of two or more
   neurotransmitters.
   The computing work of the brain is done in complex neural networks.

   What would be the effect if there were no constraints on the free flow of ions across the neuron
   membrane?
   What effect would it have on neural conduction if the action potential were decremental?
   Sports drinks replenish electrolytes that are lost during exercise. Electrolytes are compounds
   that separate into ions; for example, sodium chloride (table salt) dissociates into sodium and
   chloride ions. What implication do you think electrolyte loss might have for the nervous
   system? Why?
   Imagine what the effect would be if the nervous system used only one neurotransmitter.
   How similar to humans do you think computers are capable of becoming? How much is your
   answer based on how you think human behavior is controlled versus how capable you think
   computers are?

   Karen is a college graduate and holds a job with considerable responsibility. She
   is married and leads a normal life except for occasional epileptic seizures. When
   her doctors ordered a brain scan to find the cause of her seizures, they were
   astounded. The normal person’s brain has many folds on its surface, so it is
   wrinkled like a walnut; Karen’s is perfectly smooth, like the one on the right in
   Figure 3.1. Notice, too, that the dark areas in the middle of the brain (ventricles)
   are enlarged, indicating a deficiency in the amount of brain tissue. People with
   her disorder are usually not only lissencephalic (literally, smooth-brained) and
   epileptic like Karen, but severely impaired intellectually as well (Barinaga,
   1996; Eksioglu et al., 1996). So what really amazed Karen’s doctors was not
   how abnormal her brain is, but that she functions not just normally but well
   above average. How do we explain why some people are able to escape the
   consequences of what is usually a devastating developmental error? The answer
   is that we do not know why; it is one of the mysteries that neuroscientists are
   attempting to solve in order to understand the brain’s remarkable resilience.

   You are now well versed in the functioning of neurons and how they interact
   with each other. What you need to understand next is how neurons are grouped
   into the functional components that make up the nervous system. In the next few
   pages, we will review the physical structure of the nervous system so that you
   will have a road map for more detailed study in later chapters. We will also
   include an overview of major functions to prepare you for the more detailed
   treatments to come in later chapters. First we will look at the two divisions of the
   nervous system before turning our attention to issues such as brain development.

   The Central Nervous System
   The nervous system is divided into two subunits. The central nervous system
   (CNS) includes the brain and the spinal cord. The second part is the
   peripheral nervous system, which we will examine later in the chapter. Before
   we go any further, we need to be sure you understand a couple of terms
   correctly. As we talk about the nervous system, be careful not to confuse nerve
   and neuron. A neuron is a single neural cell; a nerve is a bundle of axons
   running together like a multiwire cable. However, the term nerve is used only
   in the peripheral nervous system; inside the CNS, bundles of axons are called
   tracts. Most of the neurons’ cell bodies are also clustered in groups; a group of
   cell bodies is called a nucleus in the CNS and a ganglion in the peripheral
   nervous system. Table 3.1 should help you keep these terms straight.

   Figure 3.2 is a photograph of a human brain. It will be easier to visualize the
   various structures of the brain if you understand that the CNS begins as a hollow
   tube and preserves that shape as it develops (Figure 3.3). The upper end of the
   tube develops three swellings, which will become the forebrain, midbrain, and
   hindbrain; the lower part of the tube develops into the spinal cord. The forebrain
   appears to be perched on top of the lower structures as it enlarges and almost
   completely engulfs them. By comparing the four drawings in this series, you can
   see that the mature forebrain obscures much of the lower brain from view. You
   will get a better idea of these hidden structures later when we look at an interior
   view of the brain.
   The Forebrain
   The major structures of the forebrain are the two cerebral hemispheres, the
   thalamus, and the hypothalamus. The outer layer of the hemispheres, the cortex,
   is where the highest-level processing occurs in the brain.

   The Cerebral Hemispheres
   The large, wrinkled cerebral hemispheres dominate the brain’s appearance
   (Figure 3.4). They not only are large in relation to the rest of the brain but also
   are disproportionately larger than in other primates (Deacon, 1990). The
   longitudinal fissure that runs the length of the brain separates the two
   cerebral hemispheres, which are nearly mirror images of each other in
   appearance. Often the same area in each hemisphere has identical functions as
   well, but you will see that this is not always the case. The simplest form of
   asymmetry is that each hemisphere receives most of its sensory input from the
   opposite side of the body (or of the world, in the case of hearing and vision) and
   provides most of the control of the opposite side of the body.
   Look again at Figures 3.2 and 3.4. The brain’s surface has many ridges and
   grooves that give it a very wrinkled appearance; the term we use is convoluted.
   Each ridge is called a gyrus; the groove or space between two gyri is called a
   sulcus or, if it is large, a fissure. You can see how the gyri are structured in the
   cross section of a brain in Figure 3.5. The outer surface is the cortex (literally,
   “bark”), which is made up mostly of the cell bodies of neurons; because cell
   bodies are not myelinated, the cortex looks grayish in color, which is why it is
   referred to as gray matter. Remember that neural processing occurs where
   neurons synapse on the cell bodies of other neurons, which indicates why the
   cortex is so important. The cortex is only 1.5 to 4 millimeters (mm) thick, but the
   convolutions increase the amount of cortex by tripling the surface area. The
   convolutions also provide the axons with easier access to the cell bodies than if
   the developing cortex thickened instead of wrinkling. The axons come together
   in the central core of each gyrus, where their myelination gives the area a
   whitish appearance. Notice how the white matter of each gyrus joins with the
   white matter of the next gyrus, creating the large bands of axons that serve as
   communication routes, both within each hemisphere and between the two
   hemispheres.
   Why is a wrinkled brain better than a smooth one?
   One of the key strategies of the nervous system is localization of functions: specific types of
   information are processed in particular regions.

   It will take the rest of this book to start answering that question, but this is a
   good time to mention two ways the brain’s organization helps it to be more
   efficient. First, the cortex in humans and most mammals is arranged in layers;
   the number of layers is usually six, though a particular layer may be absent in
   some areas. The layers stand out from each other because they are separated by
   fibers that serve the cell bodies, but they also differ in appearance: They vary in
   type and size of cells and in the concentration of cell bodies versus axons (see
   Figure 3.6a). There are differences in function as well. Some researchers have
   concluded that layers II and III are associational, IV is sensory, and V and VI
   have motor functions (Buxhoeveden & Casanova, 2002).
   Figure 3.6 Layers and Columns of the Cortex.

   Alternating Compartments of Dense Cat-301 and Calbindin
   Immunoreactivity in Layer 4A,” by Todd M. Preuss and Ghislaine Q.
   Coleman, Cerebral Cortex, 12(7), pp. 671–691,
   doi:10.1093/cercor/12.7.671. (b) Reconstructed neurons from the Blue
   Brain Project © BBP/EPFL.
   Second, the cells of the cortex are organized into groups of 80 to 100
   interconnected neurons, which are arranged in columns running perpendicular to
   the cortical surface (Figure 3.6b; Buxhoeveden & Casanova, 2002). They
   provide a vertical unification of the cortex’s horizontal layers, which contributes
   to their role as the primary information-processing unit in the cortex (Torii,
   Hashimoto-Torii, Levitt, & Rakic, 2009). The cells in a column have a similar
   function; for example, they may receive input from the same area on the skin’s
   surface, while surrounding columns serve adjacent locations. In the visual
   cortex, the cells in a column may detect object edges at a particular orientation,
   while surrounding columns respond to edges at a slightly different orientation.
   Having similar functions grouped close together in well-connected columns
   helps the brain work quickly and efficiently.
   Students often ask whether intelligent people have bigger brains. Bischoff, the
   leading European anatomist in the 19th century, argued that the greater average
   weight of men’s brains was infallible proof of their intellectual superiority over
   women. When he died, his brain was removed and added to his extensive
   collection as his will had specified; ironically, it weighed only 1,245 grams (g),
   less than the average of about 1,250 g for women (“Proof?” 1942). There
   actually is a tendency for people with larger brains to be more intelligent
   (Willerman, Schultz, Rutledge, & Bigler, 1991), but the relationship is small and
   highly variable. What this means is that factors other than brain size are more
   important; otherwise, women would be less intelligent than men as Bischoff
   claimed, but we know from research that this is not the case. When we look at
   brain size more closely in Chapter 13, you will learn that Einstein’s brain was
   even smaller than Bischoff’s.
   Across species, brain size is more related to body size than to intelligence; the
   brains of elephants and sperm whales are five or six times larger than ours. It is a
   brain’s complexity, not its size, that determines its intellectual power. Look at the
   brains in Figure 3.7, and then compare them with the human brain in Figure 3.2.
   You can see two features that distinguish more complex, more highly evolved
   brains from less complex ones. One is that the higher brains are more
   convoluted; the greater number of gyri means more cortex. The other is that the
   cerebral hemispheres are larger in proportion to the lower parts of the brain. It is
   no accident that the cerebral hemispheres are perched atop the rest of the brain
   and the spinal cord. The CNS is arranged in a hierarchy; as you ascend from the
   spinal cord through the hindbrain and midbrain to the forebrain, the neural
   structures become more complex, and so do the behaviors they control.
   The Four Lobes
   The hemispheres are divided into four lobes—frontal, parietal, occipital, and
   temporal—each named after the bone of the skull covering it. The lobes are
   illustrated in Figure 3.8, along with the major functions located within them.
   These divisions are somewhat arbitrary, but they are very useful for locating
   structures and functions, so we will organize our discussion around them.
   Sometimes we need additional precision in locating structures, so you should get
   used to seeing the standard terms that are used; the most important ones are
   illustrated in Figure 3.9a. Also, throughout this text you will see illustrations of
   the nervous system from a variety of perspectives; until you get more
   comfortable with the structure of the nervous system, it may be difficult to tell
   what you are seeing. The images in Figure 3.9b will serve as a guide for
   understanding the orientation of most of these illustrations.
   The frontal lobe is the area anterior to (in front of) the central sulcus and
   superior to (above) the lateral fissure. The functions here are complex and
   include some of the highest human capabilities. A considerable portion of the
   frontal lobes is also involved with the control of movement. And because the
   primary motor area is located along the posterior boundary of the frontal lobe,
   we start our discussion there. (You should continue to refer to Figure 3.8.)
   What functions are found in the frontal lobes?
   The precentral gyrus, which extends the length of the central sulcus, is the
   location of the primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary
   (nonreflexive) movement. The motor area in one hemisphere controls the
   opposite side of the body, though it does exert a lesser control over the same side
   of the body. The parts of the body are “mapped onto” the motor area of each
   hemisphere in the form of a homunculus, which means “little man.” All this
   means is that the cells that control the muscles of the hand are adjacent to the
   cells controlling the muscles of the arm, which are next to those controlling the
   shoulder, and so on (Figure 3.10). The homunculus is distorted in shape,
   however; the parts of the body that make precise movements, such as the hands
   and fingers, have more cortex devoted to their control. The primary motor
   cortex, like other functional areas of the brain, carries out its work in concert
   with adjacent secondary areas. The secondary motor areas are located just
   anterior to the primary area. Subcortical (below the cortex) structures, such as
   the basal ganglia, also contribute to motor behavior.

   Foundation.
   Looking back at Figure 3.8, locate Broca’s area anterior to the motor area and
   along the lateral fissure. Broca’s area controls speech production,
   contributing the movements involved in speech and grammatical structure.
   A patient with damage to this area was asked about a dental appointment; he
   replied, haltingly, “Yes . . . Monday . . . Dad and Dick . . . Wednesday 9 o’clock .
   . . 10 o’clock . . . doctors . . . and . . . teeth” (Geschwind, 1979). Similar
   problems occur in reading and writing. In another example of hemispheric
   asymmetry, language activity is controlled mostly by the left hemisphere in 9 out
   of 10 people.
   The more anterior part of the frontal lobes—the prefrontal cortex in Figure 3.8—
   is functionally complex. It is the largest region in the human brain, twice as large
   as in chimpanzees, and it accounts for 29% of the total cortex (Andreasen et al.,
   1992; Deacon, 1990). The prefrontal cortex is involved in planning and
   organization, impulse control, adjusting behavior in response to rewards
   and punishments, and some forms of decision making (Bechara, Damasio,
   Tranel, & Damasio, 1997; Fuster, 1989; Kast, 2001). Symptoms of impairment
   are varied, depending on which part of the prefrontal area is affected (Mesulam,
   1986), but malfunction often strikes at the capabilities we consider most human.
   Schizophrenia and depression, for example, involve dysfunction in the prefrontal
   cortex.
   People with prefrontal damage often engage in behavior that normal individuals
   readily recognize will get them into trouble. In clinical interviews, they show
   good understanding of social and moral standards and the consequences of
   behavior—for example, they can describe several valid ways to develop a
   friendship, maintain a romantic relationship, or resolve an occupational difficulty
   —but they are unable to choose among the options. In real life, they suffer loss
   of friends, financial disaster, and divorce (A. Damasio, 1994). Research indicates
   that prefrontal damage impairs the ability to learn from reward and punishment
   and to control impulses (Bechara et al., 1997). In addition, those with prefrontal
   damage have reduced behavioral flexibility with respect to choosing possible
   actions based on a particular situation (Ragozzino, 2007).
   Figure 3.8 Lobes and Functional Areas on the Surface of the Hemispheres.
   In spite of the effects of frontal lobe damage, during the 1940s and 1950s,
   surgeons performed tens of thousands of lobotomies, a surgical procedure that
   disconnects the prefrontal area from the rest of the brain. Initially, the surgeries
   were performed on patients with severe schizophrenia, but many overly
   enthusiastic doctors lobotomized patients with much milder problems. Walter
   Freeman, shown in Figure 3.11, did more than his share of the 40,000
   lobotomies performed in the United States and zealously trained other
   psychiatrists in the technique (Valenstein, 1986). The surgery calmed agitated
   patients, but the benefits came at a high price; the patients often became
   emotionally blunted, distractible, and childlike in behavior. In a follow-up study
   of patient outcomes, 49% were still hospitalized, and less than a fourth of the
   others were living independently (A. Miller, 1967). Lack of success with
   lobotomy and the introduction of psychiatric drugs in the 1950s made the
   surgery a rare therapeutic choice. Now psychosurgery, the use of surgical
   intervention to treat cognitive and emotional disorders, is generally held in
   disfavor, unlike brain surgery to treat problems such as tumors. The
   accompanying Application describes the most famous case of accidental
   lobotomy.
   The parietal lobes are located superior to the lateral fissure and between the
   central sulcus and the occipital lobe. The primary somatosensory cortex,
   located on the postcentral gyrus, processes the skin senses (touch, warmth,
   cold, and pain) and the senses that inform us about body position and
   movement (see Figure 3.8 again). Like the motor cortex, the somatosensory area
   serves primarily the opposite side of the body. The somatosensory cortex also is
   organized as a homunculus, but in this case, the size of each area depends on the
   sensitivity in that part of the body. When we discuss the senses of vision and
   hearing in later chapters, you will learn that this mapping is a principle of brain
   organization. Also, this is a good place to point out that the sensory areas of the
   brain are often referred to as projection areas, as in somatosensory projection
   area.
   What functions are found in the parietal lobes?
   Each of the lobes contains association areas, which carry out further
   processing beyond what the primary area does, often combining
   information from other senses. Parietal lobe association areas receive input
   from the body senses and from vision; they help the person identify objects by
   touch, determine the location of the limbs, and locate objects in space. Damage
   to the posterior parietal cortex may produce neglect, a disorder in which the
   person ignores objects, people, and activity on the side opposite the damage.
   This occurs much more frequently when the damage is in the right parietal lobe.
   The person may fail to shave or apply makeup on the left side of the face. In
   some cases, a stroke patient with a paralyzed arm or leg will deny that anything
   is wrong and even claim that the affected limb belongs to someone else.
   Figure 3.9 Terms Used to Indicate Direction and Orientation in the Nervous
   System.
   The lateral fissure separates the temporal lobe from the frontal and parietal
   lobes. The temporal lobes contain the auditory projection area, visual and
   auditory association areas, and an additional language area (see Figure 3.8).
   The auditory cortex, which receives sound information from the ears, lies on
   the superior (uppermost) gyrus of the temporal lobe, mostly hidden from
   view within the lateral fissure. Just posterior to the auditory cortex is
   Wernicke’s area, an association area that interprets language input arriving
   from the nearby auditory and visual areas; it also generates spoken
   language through Broca’s area and written language by way of the motor
   cortex. When Wernicke’s area is damaged, the person has trouble understanding
   speech or writing; the person can still speak, but the speech is mostly
   meaningless. Like Broca’s area, this structure is found in the left hemisphere in
   most people.
   What functions are found in the temporal lobes?

   The inferior temporal cortex, in the lower part of the lobe as the name
   implies, plays a major role in the visual identification of objects. People with
   damage in this area have difficulty recognizing familiar objects by sight, even
   though they can give detailed descriptions of the objects. They have no difficulty
   identifying the same items by touch. They may also fail to recognize the faces of
   friends and family members, though they can identify people by their voices.
   The neurologist Oliver Sacks (1990) described a patient who talked to parking
   meters, thinking they were children. Considering his strange behavior, it seems
   remarkable that he was unimpaired intellectually. As you read about cases like
   this one and hear of patients who do things like denying ownership of their
   paralyzed leg, you may begin to understand that human capabilities are
   somewhat independent of each other because they depend on different parts of
   the brain.
   When the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield (1955) stimulated patients’ temporal
   lobes, he often elicited what appeared to be memories of visual and auditory
   experiences. Penfield was doing surgery to remove malfunctioning tissue that
   was causing epileptic seizures. Before the surgery, Penfield would stimulate the
   area with a weak electrical current and observe the effect; this allowed him to
   distinguish healthy tissue and important functional areas from the diseased tissue
   he wished to remove (Figure 3.12).
   The patients were awake because their verbal report was needed for carrying out
   this mapping; since brain tissue has no pain receptors, patients require only a
   local anesthetic for the surgery. Stimulation of primary sensory areas provoked
   only unorganized, meaningless sensations, such as tingling, lights, or buzzing
   sounds. But when Penfield stimulated the association areas of the temporal
   cortex, 25% of the patients reported hearing music or familiar voices or,
   occasionally, reliving a familiar event. One time, the patient hummed along with
   the music she was “hearing,” and the nurse, recognizing the tune, joined in by
   supplying the lyrics. (Does this not sound like a scene from a Monty Python
   movie—a sing-along during brain surgery?) People with epileptic activity or
   brain damage in their temporal lobes sometimes hear familiar tunes as well.
   Unfortunately, Penfield made no attempt to verify whether the apparent
   memories were factual or a sort of electrically induced dream; we will see in
   Chapter 12, however, that part of the temporal lobe has an important role in
   memory.
   Application: The Case of Phineas Gage
   In 1848, Phineas Gage, a 25-year-old railroad construction foreman in Cavendish, Vermont, was
   tamping explosive powder into a blasting hole when the charge ignited prematurely and drove
   the 3½-foot-long (1.15-m) tamping iron through his left cheek and out the top of his skull. Gage
   not only regained consciousness immediately and was able to talk and to walk with the aid of
   his men but also survived the accident with no impairment of speech, motor abilities, learning,
   memory, or intelligence. However, his personality was changed dramatically. He became
   irreverent and profane, and although Gage previously was the most capable man employed by
   the railroad, he no longer was dependable and had to be dismissed. He wandered about for a
   dozen years, never able to live fully independently, and died in the care of his family.
   Almost a century and a half later, Hanna Damasio and her colleagues carried out a belated
   postmortem examination of Gage’s skull (H. Damasio et al., 1994). Combining measurements
   from the skull with a three-dimensional computer rendering of a human brain, they
   reconstructed the path of the tamping iron through Gage’s brain (see the accompanying figure).
   They concluded that the accident damaged the part of both frontal lobes involved in processing
   emotion and making rational decisions in personal and social matters. More recently, Jack Van
   Horn and colleagues at UCLA extended Damasio’s work by calculating how much the white
   matter pathways—the myelinated axons that create the circuitry of the brain—would have been
   damaged by Gage’s accident (Van Horn et al., 2012). They determined that whereas about 4% of
   the cerebral cortex was disrupted by the passage of the rod through his brain, the white matter
   pathways suffered greater damage, with more than 10% of the myelinated fibers damaged by the
   rod. At the time of Gage’s accident, physiologists were debating whether different parts of the
   brain have specific functions or are equally competent in carrying out functions. Gage’s
   experience had such an important influence in tipping the balance toward localization of
   function that in 1998 scientists from around the world gathered in Cavendish to commemorate
   the 150th anniversary of the event (Vogel, 1998).

   Finally, the occipital lobes are the location of the visual cortex, which is where
   visual information is processed (see Figure 3.8). The primary projection area
   occupies the posterior tip of each lobe; anterior to the primary area are four
   association areas that detect individual components of a scene, such as color,
   movement, and form; this information is then combined and processed further in
   other association areas, particularly in the temporal and parietal lobes. Just as the
   somatosensory and motor areas are organized to represent the shape of the body,
   the visual cortex contains a map of visual space because adjacent receptors in the
   back of the eye send neurons to adjacent cells in the visual cortex.
   Now that you are familiar with the four lobes and some of the functions located
   in the cortex, we will direct our tour to structures below the surface.
   The Thalamus and Hypothalamus
   Deep within the brain, the thalamus lies just below the lateral ventricles,
   where it receives information from all the sensory systems except olfaction
   (smell) and relays it to the respective cortical projection areas. (Figure 3.13
   is a sagittal view of a brain sliced down the middle to show the structures
   described in this section.) Many other neurons from the thalamus project more
   diffusely throughout the cortex and help arouse the cortex when appropriate.
   Actually there are two thalami, a right and a left, lying side by side. We will
   discuss additional functions for the thalamus in later chapters.
   The hypothalamus, a smaller structure just inferior to the thalamus, plays a
   major role in controlling emotion and motivated behaviors such as eating,
   drinking, and sexual activity (see Figure 3.13). The hypothalamus exerts this
   influence largely through its control of the autonomic nervous system, which we
   will consider shortly. The hypothalamus also influences the body’s hormonal
   environment through its control over the pituitary gland. In Figure 3.13, the
   pituitary appears to be hanging down on its stalk just below the hypothalamus.
   The pituitary is known as the master gland because its hormones control other
   glands in the body. The hypothalamus, which like the thalamus is paired,
   contains perhaps the largest concentration of nuclei important to behavior in the
   entire brain.
   What functions do the thalamus and hypothalamus perform?
   What functions are found in the occipital lobes?
   Just posterior to the thalamus is the pineal gland. You can see in Figure 3.13 why
   it was Descartes’s best candidate for the seat of the soul (see Chapter 1): It is a
   single, unpaired structure, attached by its flexible stalk just below the
   hemispheres. In reality, the pineal gland secretes melatonin, a hormone that
   induces sleep. It controls seasonal cycles in nonhuman animals and
   participates with other structures in controlling daily rhythms in humans.
   The Corpus Callosum
   If you were to look inside the longitudinal fissure between the two cerebral
   hemispheres, you would see that the hemispheres are distinctly separate from
   each other. A couple of inches below the brain’s surface, the longitudinal fissure
   ends in the corpus callosum, a dense band of fibers that carry information
   between the hemispheres. The corpus callosum is visible in Figure 3.13; you
   can see it from another perspective, along with a smaller band of crossing fibers,
   the anterior commissure, by looking back at Figure 3.5. You know that the two
   hemispheres carry out somewhat different functions, so you can imagine that
   they must communicate with each other constantly to integrate their activities. In
   addition, incoming information is often directed to one hemisphere—visual
   information appearing to one side of your field of view goes to the hemisphere
   on the opposite side, just as information from one side of your body does. This
   information is “shared” with the other hemisphere through the crossing fibers,
   especially the corpus callosum; the car that is too close on your left is registered
   in your right hemisphere, but if you are steering with your right hand, it is your
   left hemisphere that must react.
   Figure 3.13 Sagittal View of the Interior Features of the Human Brain.
   Figure 3.14 A Patient With Severed Corpus Callosum Identifying Objects by
   Touch.
   Occasionally, surgeons have to sever the corpus callosum in patients with
   incapacitating epileptic seizures that cannot be controlled by drugs. The surgery
   prevents the out-of-control neural activity in one hemisphere from engulfing the
   other hemisphere as well. The patient is then able to maintain consciousness
   during seizures and to lead a more normal life. These patients have been very
   useful for studying differences in the functions of the two hemispheres, because
   a stimulus can be presented to one hemisphere and the information will not be
   shared with the other hemisphere. Studies of these individuals have helped
   establish, for example, that the left hemisphere is more specialized for language
   than the right hemisphere and the right hemisphere is better at spatial tasks and
   recognizing faces (Gazzaniga, 1967; Nebes, 1974). An example is shown in
   Figure 3.14. We will explore this topic further when we discuss consciousness in
   Chapter 15.
   The Ventricles
   During development, the hollow interior of the nervous system develops into
   cavities called ventricles in the brain and the central canal in the spinal cord.
   The ventricles are filled with cerebrospinal fluid, which carries material
   from the blood vessels to the CNS and transports waste materials in the
   other direction. The lateral ventricles (Figures 3.13 and 3.15) extend forward
   deeply into the frontal lobes and in the other direction into the occipital lobes
   before they curve around into the temporal lobes. Below the lateral ventricles
   and connected to them is the third ventricle; it is located between the two
   thalami and the two halves of the hypothalamus, which form the ventricle’s
   walls. The fourth ventricle is not in the forebrain, so we will locate it later.
   Figure 3.15 The Ventricles of the Brain.
   The Midbrain and Hindbrain
   The midbrain contains structures that have secondary roles in vision,
   hearing, and movement (Figures 3.13 and 3.16). The superior colliculi, for
   example, help guide eye movements and fixation of gaze, and the inferior
   colliculi help locate the direction of sounds. One of the structures involved in
   movement is the substantia nigra, which projects to the basal ganglia to
   integrate movements; its dopamine-releasing cells degenerate in Parkinson’s
   disease (see Chapter 11). Another is the ventral tegmental area, which plays a
   role in the rewarding effects of food, sex, drugs, and so on (see Chapter 5). The
   midbrain also contains part of the reticular formation, which is described below.
   Passing through the midbrain is the cerebral aqueduct, which connects the third
   ventricle above with the fourth ventricle below (see Figure 3.15). Notice in
   Figure 3.16 that the brain takes on a more obvious tubular shape here, reminding
   us of the CNS’s origins. Considering the shape of these structures and the
   appearance of the cerebral hemispheres perched on top, you can see why this
   part of the brain is referred to as the brain stem.
   Figure 3.16 The Brain Stem.
   The hindbrain is composed of the pons, the medulla, and the cerebellum (see
   Figures 3.13 and 3.16). The pons contains centers related to sleep and
   arousal, which are part of the reticular formation. The reticular formation is
   a collection of many nuclei running through the middle of the hindbrain
   and the midbrain; besides its role in sleep and arousal, it contributes to
   attention and to aspects of motor activity, including reflexes and muscle tone.
   The word pons means “bridge” in Latin, which reflects not only its appearance
   but also the fact that its fibers connect the two hemispheres of the cerebellum;
   the pons also has pathways connecting higher areas of the brain with the brain
   stem. The medulla forms the lower part of the hindbrain; its nuclei are
   involved with control of essential life processes, such as cardiovascular
   activity and respiration (breathing).
   The cerebellum is the second most distinctive-appearing brain structure (see
   Figures 3.2, 3.8, 3.13, and 3.20). Perched on the back of the brain stem, it is
   wrinkled and divided down the middle like the cerebral hemispheres—thus its
   name, which means “little brain.” The most obvious function of the cerebellum
   is refining movements initiated by the motor cortex by controlling their
   speed, intensity, and direction. A person whose cerebellum is damaged has
   trouble making precise reaching movements and walks with difficulty because
   the automatic patterning of movement routines has been lost. It is not unusual for
   individuals with cerebellar damage to be arrested by the police because their
   uncoordinated gait is easily mistaken for drunkenness. The cerebellum also plays
   a role in motor learning, and research implicates it in other cognitive processes
   and in emotion (Fiez, 1996). With 70% of the brain’s neurons in its fist-sized
   volume, it would be surprising if it did not hold a number of mysteries waiting to
   be solved.
   We have admittedly covered a large number of structures. It may help to see
   them and their major functions summarized in Table 3.2. But as you review these
   functions, remember the caveat about localization from Chapter 1 that a behavior
   is seldom the province of a single brain location but instead results from the
   interplay of a whole network of structures.
   The Spinal Cord
   The spinal cord is a finger-sized cable of neurons that carries commands
   from the brain to the muscles and organs and sensory information into the
   brain. Its role is more complicated than that, though. It controls the rapid
   reflexive response when you withdraw your hand from a hot stove, and it
   contains pattern generators that help control routine behaviors such as walking.
   Notice the appearance of the interior of the spinal cord in Figure 3.17; it is
   arranged just the opposite of the brain, with the white matter on the outside and
   the gray matter in the interior. The white exterior is made up of axons—
   ascending sensory tracts on their way to the brain and descending motor tracts
   on their way to the muscles and organs.
   Sensory neurons enter the spinal cord through the dorsal root of each spinal
   nerve. The sensory neurons are unipolar; clustering of their cell bodies in the
   dorsal root ganglion explains the dorsal root’s enlargement. The sensory neuron
   in Figure 3.17 could be as much as 1 meter (m) long, with its other end out in a
   fingertip or a toe. The H-shaped structure in the middle of the spinal cord is
   made up mostly of unmyelinated cell bodies. The cell bodies of motor neurons
   are located in the ventral horns, which is why the ventral horns are enlarged.
   The axons of the motor neurons pass out of the spinal cord through the
   ventral root. The dorsal root and the ventral root on the same side of the cord
   join to form a spinal nerve that exits the spine between adjacent vertebrae (the
   bones that make up the spine).
   What is the structure of the spinal cord?
   Figure 3.17 Horizontal Cross Section of the Spinal Cord, With Reflex Circuit.
   Figures Brought to Life
   Most of the motor neurons receive their input from the brain, either from the
   motor cortex or from nuclei that control the activity of the internal organs.
   Notice in Figure 3.17, however, that in some cases sensory neurons from the
   dorsal side connect with motor neurons, either directly or through an
   interneuron. This pathway produces a simple, automatic movement in
   response to a sensory stimulus; this is called a reflex. For example, when you
   touch a lighted match with your hand, input travels to the spinal cord, where
   signals are directed out to the muscles of the arm to produce reflexive
   withdrawal. Many people use the term reflex incorrectly to refer to any action a
   person takes without apparent thought; however, the term is limited to behaviors
   that are controlled by these direct sensory-motor connections. Besides not
   requiring thought, reflexive acts occur much more rapidly than the same
   response produced voluntarily. Reflexes originate in the brain as well as in the
   spinal cord, and reflexes also affect the internal environment—for example,
   reducing blood pressure when it goes too high.
   Protecting the Central Nervous System
   The brain and the spinal cord are delicate organs, vulnerable to damage from
   blows and jostling, to poisoning by toxins, and to disruption by mislocated or
   excessive neurotransmitters. Both structures are enclosed in a protective three-
   layered membrane called the meninges. The space between the meninges and
   the CNS is filled with cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions the neural tissue from
   the trauma of blows and sudden movement. The brain and spinal cord literally
   float in the cerebrospinal fluid, so the weight of a 1,200- to 1,400-g brain is in
   effect reduced to less than 100 g. The tough meninges and the cerebrospinal
   fluid afford the brain some protection from occasional trauma, but the blood-
   brain barrier, which limits passage between the bloodstream and the brain,
   provides constant protection from toxic substances and from
   neurotransmitters circulating in the blood such as norepinephrine, which
   increases during stress.
   Figure 3.18 The Blood-Brain Barrier.
   Outside the brain, the cells that compose the walls of the capillaries (small blood
   vessels) have gaps between them that allow most substances to pass rather freely.
   In the brain, these cells are joined so tightly that easy passage is limited to small
   molecules such as carbon dioxide and oxygen and to substances that can dissolve
   in the lipid (fat) of the capillary walls (Figure 3.18). Fat solubility accounts for
   the effectiveness of most drugs, both therapeutic and abused. Most substances
   needed by the brain are water soluble and cannot pass through on their own, so
   glucose, iron, amino acids (the building blocks that proteins are made of), and
   many vitamins must be actively carried through the walls by specialized
   transporters.
   Not all brain areas are protected by the barrier, however. This is particularly true
   of brain structures surrounding the ventricles. One of them is the area postrema;
   when you ingest something toxic, such as an excess of alcohol, the substance
   passes from the bloodstream into the area postrema. Because the area postrema
   induces vomiting, your stomach empties quickly—ideally before too much harm
   is done.

   The Peripheral Nervous System
   The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is made up of the cranial nerves, which
   enter and leave the underside of the brain, and the spinal nerves, which
   connect to the sides of the spinal cord at each vertebra. From a functional
   perspective, the PNS can be divided into the somatic nervous system and the
   autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system includes the motor
   neurons that operate the skeletal muscles—that is, the ones that move the
   body—and the sensory neurons that bring information into the CNS from
   the body and the outside world. The autonomic nervous system (ANS)
   controls smooth muscle (stomach, blood vessels, etc.), the glands, and the
   heart and other organs. The diagram in Figure 3.19 will help you keep track of
   these divisions and relate them to the CNS. We dealt with the spinal nerves when
   we discussed the spinal cord, and we have said all we need to for now about the
   somatic system, so we will give the rest of our attention to the cranial nerves and
   the ANS.
   The Cranial Nerves
   The cranial nerves enter and exit on the ventral side of the brain (Figure 3.20).
   Whereas the spinal nerves are concerned exclusively with sensory and motor
   activities within the body, some of the cranial nerves convey sensory information
   to the brain from the outside world. Two of these, the olfactory nerves and the
   optic nerves, are often considered part of the brain. One reason for this special
   status is the brainlike complexity of the olfactory bulb and of the retina at the
   back of the eye; another is that their receptor cells originate in the brain during
   development and migrate to their final locations. As a consequence, the olfactory
   and optic nerves are sometimes referred to as tracts.

   The Autonomic Nervous System
   The functions of the ANS are primarily motor; its sensory pathways provide
   internal information for regulating its own operations. The ANS is composed of
   two branches. The sympathetic nervous system activates the body in ways that
   help it cope with demands such as emotional stress and physical
   emergencies. Your most recent emergency may have been when you overslept
   on the morning of a big exam. As you raced to class, your heart and breathing
   sped up to provide your body the resources it needed. Your blood pressure
   increased as well, and your peripheral blood vessels constricted, shifting blood
   supply to the internal organs, including your brain. Your muscles tensed to help
   you fight or flee, and your sweat glands started pouring out sweat to cool your
   overheating body. All this activity was just the sympathetic nervous system at
   work. The parasympathetic nervous system not only slows the activity of most
   organs to conserve energy but also activates digestion to renew energy.
   The sympathetic branch rises from the middle (thoracic and lumbar) areas of the
   spinal cord (Figure 3.21). Most sympathetic neurons pass through the
   sympathetic ganglion chain, which runs along each side of the spine; there
   they synapse with postsynaptic neurons that rejoin the spinal nerve and go out to
   the muscles or glands they serve. (The others pass directly to ganglia in the body
   cavity before synapsing.) Because most of the sympathetic ganglia are highly
   interconnected in the sympathetic ganglion chain, this system tends to respond as
   a unit. Thus, when you were rushing to your exam, your whole body went into
   hyperdrive. As you can see in Figure 3.21, the parasympathetic branch rises
   from the extreme ends of the PNS—in the cranial nerves and in the spinal nerves
   at the lower (sacral) end of the spinal cord. The parasympathetic ganglia are not
   interconnected but are located on or near the muscles and glands they control; as
   a result, the components of the parasympathetic system operate more
   independently than those of the sympathetic system.
   What are the functions of the autonomic nervous system?
   Organs are innervated by both branches of the ANS, with the exception of the
   sweat glands, the adrenal glands, and the muscles that constrict blood vessels,
   which receive only sympathetic activation. It is not accurate to assume that one
   branch is active at a time and the other completely shuts down. Rather, both are
   active to some degree all the time, and the body’s general activity reflects the
   balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation.

   Development and Change in the Nervous System
   Nothing rivals the human brain in complexity, which makes the development of
   the brain the most remarkable construction project that you or we can imagine.
   During development, its 100 billion neurons must find their way to destinations
   throughout the brain and the spinal cord; then they must make precise
   connections to an average of a thousand target cells each (Tessier-Lavigne &
   Goodman, 1996). How this is accomplished is one of the most intriguing
   mysteries of neurology, but it is a mystery that is being solved a little at a time.
   The Stages of Development
   You already know that the nervous system begins as a hollow tube that later
   becomes the brain and the spinal cord. The nervous system begins development
   when the surface of the embryo forms a neural groove (Figure 3.22). The edges
   of this groove curl upward until they meet, turning the groove into a neural tube.
   Development of the nervous system then proceeds in four distinct stages: cell
   proliferation, migration, circuit formation, and circuit pruning.
   Proliferation and Migration
   During proliferation, the cells that will become neurons divide and multiply
   at the rate of 250,000 new cells every minute. Proliferation occurs in the
   ventricular zone, the area surrounding the hollow tube that will later become the
   ventricles and the central canal. During migration, these newly formed
   neurons move from the ventricular zone outward to their final location.
   They do so with the aid of specialized radial glial cells (Figure 3.23 on page
   69). Remember Karen from the beginning of the chapter? This is where
   development went awry in her brain. The neurons that would have formed her
   cortex failed to migrate properly and got off their radial glial cell scaffolds too
   early (J. W. Fox et al., 1998).
   How do neurons find their correct destination?
   The functional role that a neuron will play depends on its location and the time
   of its “birth”; different structures form during different stages of fetal
   development. Prior to birth and for a time afterward, the neurons retain
   considerable functional flexibility, however. In fact, fetal brain tissue can be
   transplanted into a different part of an adult brain, and the transplanted neurons
   will form synapses and assume the function of their new location.
   Circuit Formation
   During circuit formation, the axons of developing neurons grow toward their
   target cells and form functional connections. For example, axons of motor
   neurons grow toward the spinal cord, and cells in the retina of the eye send their
   axons to the thalamus, where they form synapses with other neurons. To find
   their way, axons form growth cones at their tip, which sample the
   environment for directional cues (Figure 3.24 on page 70). Chemical and
   molecular signposts attract or repel the advancing axon, coaxing it along the way
   (Tessier-Lavigne & Goodman, 1996). By pushing, pulling, and hemming
   neurons in from the side, the chemical and molecular forces guide the neurons to
   intermediate stations and past inappropriate targets until they reach their final
   destinations.
   Figure 3.22 Development of the Neural Tube.
   Source: Photos by Kathryn Tosney.
   The path to the developing axon’s destination is not necessarily direct, but
   thanks to changing genetic control, it is able to make direction changes along the
   way. This is most strongly illustrated by an axon whose destination is on the
   opposite side of the midline. Ordinarily, a migrating axon will grow parallel to
   the midline without crossing over, because it is repelled by a midline chemical
   that is under the control of the gene Robo1. But at the appropriate location, the
   gene Robo3 becomes active; the axon is then attracted to the midline and turns
   and enters it. At that point, Robo3 is downregulated; the axon is repelled again
   and, continuing in the same direction, exits the midline and will not recross (C.
   G. Woods, 2004).

   What determines which synapses will survive?
   Circuit Pruning
   The brain produces extra neurons, apparently as a means of compensating for the
   errors that occur in reaching targets. This overproduction is not trivial: The
   monkey’s visual cortex contains 35% more neurons at the time of birth than in
   adulthood, and the number of axons crossing the corpus callosum is four times
   what it will be later in life (LaMantia & Rakic, 1990; R. W. Williams, Ryder, &
   Rakic, 1987). The next stage of neural development, circuit pruning, involves
   the elimination of excess neurons and synapses. Neurons that are unsuccessful
   in finding a place on a target cell, or that arrive late, die; the monkey’s corpus
   callosum alone loses 8 million neurons a day during the first 3 weeks after birth.
   In a second step of circuit pruning, the nervous system refines its organization
   and continues to correct errors by eliminating large numbers of excessive
   synapses. For example, in mature mammals, neurons from the left and right eyes
   project to alternating columns of cells in the visual cortex, but the connections
   made during development are indiscriminate. Synapses are strengthened or
   weakened depending on whether the presynaptic neuron and the postsynaptic
   neuron fire together. Because a single neuron cannot by itself cause another
   neuron to fire, this is likely to happen when neighboring neurons are also firing
   and adding summating inputs through overlapping terminals. If a neuron is not
   firing at the same time as its neighbors, it has probably made its connection in
   the wrong neighborhood. It is thought that the postsynaptic neuron sends
   feedback to the presynaptic terminals in the form of neurotrophins, chemicals
   that enhance the development and survival of neurons.
   In the visual system, sensory stimulation provides neuronal activation that
   contributes to this refinement. However, pruning of synapses begins in some
   parts of the visual system even before birth. How can this stimulation occur
   when visual input is impossible? The answer is that waves of spontaneous neural
   firing sweep across the fetal retina, providing the activation that selects which
   synapses will survive and which will not (Hooks & Chen, 2007; Huberman,
   2007). In the first few years of the rhesus monkey’s life, 40% of the synapses in
   the primary visual cortex are eliminated, at the stunning rate of 5,000 per second
   (Bourgeois & Rakic, 1993). This process of producing synapses that will later be
   eliminated seems wasteful, but targeting neurons’ destinations more precisely
   would require prohibitively complex chemical and molecular codes. Later, the
   plasticity (ability to be modified) of these synapses decreases; a practical
   example is that recovery from injury to the language areas of the brain is greatly
   reduced in adulthood. However, the synapses in the cortical association areas are
   more likely to retain their plasticity, permitting later modification by experience
   —in other words, learning (Kandel & O’Dell, 1992; W. Singer, 1995).
   As impressive as is the brain’s ability to organize itself during development,
   mistakes do occur and for a variety of reasons. Periventricular heterotopia, the
   problem Karen had (see beginning of the chapter), is caused by any one of a
   variety of gene mutations that cause developing neurons to clump near the
   ventricles rather than migrate to the cortex. Fetal alcohol syndrome, which
   often produces intellectual disability, is caused by the mother’s use of
   alcohol during a critical period of brain development. The brains of
   individuals with fetal alcohol syndrome are often small and malformed, and
   neurons are dislocated (Figure 3.25). During migration, many cortical neurons
   fail to line up in columns as they normally would because the radial glial cells
   revert to their more typical glial form prematurely; other neurons continue
   migrating beyond the usual boundary of the cortex (Clarren, Alvord, Sumi,
   Streissguth, & Smith, 1978; Gressens, Lammens, Picard, & Evrard, 1992; P. D.
   Lewis, 1985). Exposure to ionizing radiation, such as that produced by nuclear
   accidents and atomic blasts, also causes intellectual impairment by interfering
   with both proliferation and migration. The offspring of women who were in the
   8th through 15th weeks of pregnancy during the bombing of Hiroshima and
   Nagasaki and during the meltdowns at the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear
   generating stations were the most vulnerable, because the rates of proliferation
   and migration are highest then (Schull, Norton, & Jensh, 1990).
   Figure 3.24 Neurons With Growth Cones.

   An additional step is required for full maturation of the nervous system:
   myelination. In the brain, it begins with the lower structures and then proceeds to
   the cerebral hemispheres, moving from occipital lobes to frontal lobes.
   Myelination starts around the end of the third trimester of fetal development but
   is not complete until late adolescence or beyond (Sowell, Thompson, Holmes,
   Jernigan, & Toga, 1999). This slow process has behavioral implications—for
   instance, contributing to the improvement through adolescence on cognitive
   tasks that require the frontal lobes (H. S. Levin et al., 1991). Considering the role
   of the prefrontal cortex in impulse control and the fact that this area is the last to
   mature (Sowell et al., 1999), it should come as no surprise that parents are often
   baffled by their adolescents’ behavior.
   How Experience Modifies the Nervous System
   Stimulation continues to shape synaptic construction and reconstruction
   throughout the individual’s life. For example, training rats to find their way
   through a maze or just exposing them to a complex living environment causes
   increased branching of synapses in the cortex (Greenough, 1975). Humans lose
   neurons as they age, but they develop more synapses (Buell & Coleman, 1979),
   presumably as the result of experience.
   Experience-induced change can involve reorganization, a shift in connections
   that changes the function of an area of the brain. For example, in blind
   people who read Braille, the space in the brain devoted to the index (reading)
   finger increases, at the expense of the area corresponding to the other fingers on
   the same hand (Pascual-Leone & Torres, 1993). In a brain scan study,
   researchers discovered that blind individuals who excel at sound localization had
   recruited the unused visual area of their brains to aid in the task (Gougoux,
   Zatorre, Lassonde, Voss, & Lepore, 2005). This rewiring is not random: In blind
   individuals, trying to locate sounds or touch activated the area normally involved
   in visual localization; when cats deaf from birth located objects or detected
   motion visually they used areas that ordinarily perform those functions with
   sounds (Lomber, Meredith, & Kral, 2010; Renier et al., 2010). Much of our brain
   plasticity is lost after the age of two or three (Bedny, Konkle, Pelphrey, Saxe, &
   Pascual-Leone, 2010), but dramatic changes can occur in adulthood. And some
   of them take place rapidly, as we see in a study of individuals born with a
   condition called syndactyly, in which the fingers are attached to each other by a
   web of skin. Use of the fingers is severely limited, and the fingers are
   represented by overlapping areas in the somatosensory cortex. Figure 3.26 shows
   that after surgery, the representations of the fingers in the cortex became separate
   and distinct in just seven days (Mogilner et al., 1993).

   The 19th-century philosopher and psychologist William James speculated that if
   a surgeon could switch your optic nerves with your auditory nerves, you would
   then see thunder and hear lightning (James, 1893). James was expressing
   Johannes Müller’s doctrine of specific nerve energies from a half century earlier
   —that each sensory projection area produces its own unique experience
   regardless of the kind of stimulation it receives. This is why you “see stars”
   when your skateboard shoots out from under you and the back of your head
   (where the visual cortex is located) hits the pavement.
   But during early development, even this basic principle of brain operation can
   fall victim to reorganization. In people blind from birth, the visual cortex has
   nothing to do; as a result, some of the somatosensory pathways take over part of
   the area, so the visual cortex is activated by touch. But in this case, does the
   visual cortex produce a visual experience, or one of touch? To find out,
   researchers stimulated the visual cortex of blind individuals by applying an
   electromagnetic field to the scalp over the occipital area (L. G. Cohen et al.,
   1997). In sighted people, this disrupted visual performance, but in the blind
   individuals, the procedure distorted their sense of touch and interfered with their
   ability to identify Braille letters. Apparently, their visual area was actually
   processing information about touch in a meaningful way!
   Reorganization does not always produce a beneficial outcome. When kittens
   were reared in an environment with no visual stimulation except horizontal
   stripes or vertical stripes, they didn’t develop the ability to respond to objects in
   the other orientation. A cat reared, for example, with vertical stripes would play
   with a rod held vertically and ignore the rod when it was horizontal. Electrical
   recording indicated that the cells in the visual cortex that would have responded
   to horizontally oriented stimuli had reorganized their connections in response to
   the limited stimulation. In Chapter 11, we will explain the related phenomenon
   of phantom pain, in which people who have a limb amputated often experience
   pain that seems to be located in the missing limb. It appears to be caused by
   sensory neurons from a nearby part of the body growing into the somatosensory
   area that had served the lost limb (Flor et al., 1995).
   In The News: Breastmilk Consumption Is Good for the Brain
   Breastfeeding can be difficult for mothers, particularly those who return to work shortly after
   giving birth, and societal support for breastfeeding remains mixed. However, there is increasing
   evidence that breastmilk provides nutrition that promotes healthy nervous system development.
   One study followed preterm infants (those born 10 or more weeks early) for their first seven
   years to determine the impacts of early breastmilk consumption (Belfort et al., 2016). The
   researchers discovered that the more breastmilk infants consumed during their first 28 days, the
   greater the volume of gray matter in their brains at the time of their due date (when they would
   have been born if they were full term). At the age of seven years the children who had high
   breastmilk consumption also had higher IQ scores, working memory performance, motor
   abilities, math performance, and increased intercranial volume. These findings are important
   because they suggests that breastmilk consumption may help infants make up for some of the in-
   utero brain development that they missed by being born early.
   Other researchers have approached investigations of breastmilk benefits in the gut (reported in
   Yong, 2016), showing that human breastmilk provides hundreds of human milk oligosaccharides
   (complex sugars) that promote development of good bacteria in the gut and protect against
   infections. You might think of gut bacteria as being important solely for digestion, but a host of
   studies have found associations between the type of bacteria found in the gut and psychological
   functions including stress, anxiety, and cognition (Mayer, Knight, Mazmanian, Cryan, &
   Tillisch, 2014). In fact, neuroscientists are now looking at ways that the collection of bacteria
   found in the gut (the gut microbiome) can influence brain activity, via signals sent through the
   vagus nerve. This research is clarifying the mechanism by which breastmilk could have
   profound impacts on later brain functioning.
   Thought Questions
   1. How do scientists think breastmilk is able to influence later brain functioning in children
   who had early breastmilk consumption?
   2. What special characteristic of breastmilk seems important in promoting babies’ health and
   development?

   Damage and Recovery in the Central Nervous System
   One reason neuroscientists are interested in the development of the nervous
   system is because they hope to find clues about how to repair the nervous system
   when it is damaged by injury, disease, or developmental error. It is difficult to
   convey the impairment and suffering that results from brain disorders, but the
   staggering financial costs in Table 3.3 will give you some idea. Here we will
   focus mostly on stroke and trauma and leave the other sources of injury for later
   chapters.
   Stroke, also known as cerebrovascular accident, is caused by a loss of blood
   flow in the brain. Most strokes are ischemic, caused by blockage of an artery by
   a blood clot or other obstruction; hemorrhagic strokes occur when an artery
   ruptures. The neurons are deprived of oxygen and glucose, of course, but most of
   the damage is due to excitotosis (not to be confused with exocytosis, mentioned
   in Chapter 2). In excitotosis, dying neurons release excess glutamate, which
   overstimulates the surrounding neurons. The neurons then die as large amounts
   of calcium enter the cells. Further impairment is caused by edema, an
   accumulation of fluid that causes increased pressure on the brain. Stroke is the
   fourth leading cause of death in the United States (Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention, 2015a) and a leading cause of long-term disability, including
   paralysis and loss of language and other functions (Heron et al., 2009). In the
   accompanying Application, we discuss a novel treatment for breaking up
   ischemic clots when recovery is most likely.

   Note: Includes direct costs of care and treatment and indirect costs such as crime, lost wages, and
   financial assistance. Differences between the U.S. and European data are due to a variety of factors,
   including incidence rate, greater cost of direct health care in the United States, and which indirect
   costs were included in each study.
   Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by an external mechanical force such
   as a blow to the head, sudden acceleration or deceleration, or penetration.
   TBIs cause 52,000 deaths each year in the United States; about 35% of TBIs are
   caused by falls, and another 17% result from traffic accidents (Faul, Xu, Wald, &
   Coronado, 2010). Besides the direct damage to neurons, edema and ischemia
   (loss of blood supply due to blood clots) take an additional toll. Mild traumatic
   injury, or concussion as it is more commonly known, is the most common TBI.
   It results from blows and acceleration-deceleration that occur in automobile
   accidents, sports activities, and battlefield explosions. Whether or not these
   traumas are sufficient to cause loss of consciousness, they are often followed by
   headache, drowsiness, and memory loss, which usually go away if the individual
   rests for three weeks following the injury. Repeated concussions can cause
   cumulative brain damage. The expression “punch-drunk” refers to dementia
   pugilistica, the impairment suffered by boxers who didn’t know when to quit.
   However, even a single concussion severe enough to cause brief
   unconsciousness or amnesia produces brain atrophy detectable one year later and
   correlated with memory and attention deficits (Y. Zhou et al., 2013).
   TBI has been very much in the news recently because of its high incidence in
   sports. A research project at Boston University has found signs of Alzheimer’s-
   like brain disease in autopsies of 87 out of 91 former National Football League
   (NFL) players (Breslow, 2015a); a suit by thousands of ex-players has resulted in
   a settlement that will cost the NFL upwards of $1 billion (Breslow, 2015b). But
   risk of brain damage isn’t limited to professional contact sports. Even heading
   the ball in women’s youth and college soccer can produce impacts 40 to 63 times
   the force of gravity (Hanlon & Bir, 2012; Lynall et al., 2016), and frequent
   heading is associated with white matter abnormalities and memory deficits
   (Lipton et al., 2013).
   Limitations on Recovery
   Nervous system repair is no problem for some species, particularly amphibians.
   For example, when Sperry (1943, 1945) severed the optic nerves of frogs, the
   eyes made functional reconnections to the brain even when the disconnected eye
   was turned upside down or transplanted into the other eye socket. Regeneration,
   the growth of severed axons, also occurs in mammals, at least in the PNS. So
   when you fell skateboarding, if you broke your arm so badly that a nerve was
   severed, the disconnected part of the cut axon would have died, but the part
   connected to the cell body would have survived and regrown. Myelin provides a
   guide tube for the sprouting end of a severed neuron to grow through (W. J.
   Freed, de Medinaceli, & Wyatt, 1985), and the extending axon is guided to its
   destination much as it would be during development (Horner & Gage, 2000).
   What limits central nervous system repair? How might repair be encouraged?
   But in the mammalian CNS, damaged neurons encounter a hostile environment.
   If your skateboarding accident severed neurons in your spinal cord, the axon
   stumps would sprout new growth, but they would make little progress toward
   their former target. This is partly because the CNS in adult mammals no longer
   produces the chemical and molecular conditions that stimulate and guide
   neuronal growth. In addition, scar tissue produced by glial cells blocks the
   original pathway, glial cells also produce axon growth inhibitors, and immune
   cells move into the area and possibly interfere with regrowth (D. F. Chen,
   Schneider, Martinou, & Tonegawa, 1997; Horner & Gage, 2000; Thallmair et al.,
   1998).
   Application: Ultrasound Surgery
   Source: AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Frank Gunn.
   Brain disorders often require surgery, which has its own drawbacks. The use of focused
   ultrasound is making intervention noninvasive, safer, and more precise. The energy is focused
   on the target area by an acoustic lens, much the same way as a magnifying glass focuses beams
   of sunlight. An individual acoustic beam by itself has no effect, but when multiple intersecting
   beams of ultrasound are focused on a target they can produce important biological effects. The
   warming produced can be detected on a brain scan, which allows the surgeon to readjust the
   location. Targets can be as small as 1 mm 2 or up to 150 mm 2 . Increasing the energy level
   generates enough heat to destroy the target, and the technique can be used to break up blood
   clots or destroy tumors and other diseased tissue, as well as to silence neural circuits to treat
   disabling tremors and unbearable pain (Monteith, Gwinn, & Newell, 2015).
   Recent work suggests that these techniques can also be applied to neuropsychiatric disorders
   such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, which historically have relied on drugs and
   invasive treatments (Leinenga, Langton, Nisbet, & Götz, 2016). The therapeutic effects are
   immediate and without the recovery and side effects typically seen with traditional surgery or
   radiation treatments. Researchers are also using the technique with transgenic mice that develop
   the brain pathology and memory deficits characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease (Burgess et al.,
   2014). Their strategy is to activate glial cells and open the blood-brain barrier near memory
   structures, to allow immune cells to enter the brain and help clear away cellular damage caused
   by the disease.
   In the adult centres the nerve paths are something fixed, ended and immutable.
   Everything may die, nothing may be regenerated. It is for the science of the future to
   change, if possible, this harsh decree.
   —Santiago Ramón y Cajal, 1928
   Another way the nervous system could repair itself is by neurogenesis, the
   birth of new neurons. Neurogenesis occurs in several areas of adult animal
   brains (Kahn, Hough, Ten Eyck, & Bingman, 2003; C. D. Fowler, Liu, & Wang,
   2007), but research indicates that it is most extensive in two places. One is the
   hippocampus, and the other is near the lateral ventricles, supplying the olfactory
   bulb (Gage, 2000). This research was done by administering bromodeoxyuridine
   (BrdU), which is taken up in the DNA of cells as they divide; the animals were
   then sacrificed, and the presence of BrdU in neurons in the brain indicated robust
   neurogenesis, especially in the hippocampus. In 1998, Peter Eriksson and his
   colleagues were able to use this technique with deceased cancer patients who
   had been given BrdU to track the spread of tumors, and they found the first
   evidence of neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus. The use of BrdU in
   humans was banned shortly after that, making replication of the study difficult
   and leaving other researchers skeptical. Then a team at Stockholm’s Karolinska
   Institute hit upon the idea of measuring carbon 14 (C14), which was absorbed by
   individuals around the world between 1945 and 1963 as a result of above-ground
   nuclear testing (Spalding et al., 2013). Cellular levels of C14 correspond to
   atmospheric levels, so the researchers were able to date the birth of new neurons
   and determine that our hippocampi add 1,400 new neurons every day.
   Neurogenesis in human olfactory bulbs has been controversial, apparently
   because it occurs at a much lower rate there than in other locations (Maheu et al.,
   2015).
   These new neurons apparently contribute to the neural plasticity required in
   learning: Blocking neurogenesis in the hippocampus interferes with certain types
   of learning that involve that structure, and doing so in the olfactory bulbs impairs
   learning associations with odors (Lazarini & Lledo, 2011; Ming & Song, 2011).
   There is no guarantee that this neurogenesis contributes to brain repair following
   injury. However, neural precursor cells migrate to damaged areas in rats’ brains
   following experimentally induced stroke and appear to replace damaged neurons
   (Parent, 2003). Furthermore, increased neurogenesis has been observed at
   damage sites in the brains of deceased Alzheimer’s patients and Huntington’s
   disease patients (Curtis et al., 2003; Jin et al., 2004). Results such as these
   suggest that if we could enhance neurogenesis, it might provide a means of self-
   repair.
   Compensation and Reorganization
   Although axons do not regenerate and neuron replacement is limited at best,
   considerable recovery of function can occur in the damaged mammalian CNS.
   Much of the improvement in function following injury is nonneural in nature and
   comes about as swelling diminishes and glia remove dead neurons (Bach-y-Rita,
   1990). The simplest recovery that is neural in nature involves compensation
   as uninjured tissue takes over the functions of lost neurons. Presynaptic
   neurons sprout more terminals to form additional synapses with their targets
   (Fritschy & Grzanna, 1992; Goodman, Bogdasarian, & Horel, 1973), and
   postsynaptic neurons add more receptors (Bach-y-Rita, 1990). In addition,
   normally silent side branches from other neurons in the area become active
   within minutes of the injury (Das & Gilbert, 1995). These synaptic changes are
   similar to those occurring during learning; this would explain why physical
   therapy can be effective in promoting recovery after brain injury.
   What forms of recovery are possible in the human CNS?
   A more dramatic form of neural recovery involves reorganization of other brain
   areas. During recovery of language ability following brain damage or surgery,
   the functions apparently are assumed by nearby brain areas or, in the case of
   massive damage, by the other hemisphere (Guerreiro, Castro-Caldas, & Martins,
   1995). Occasionally, an entire hemisphere must be removed because it is
   diseased. The patients typically do not reach normal levels of performance after
   the surgery, but they often recover their language and other cognitive skills and
   motor control to a remarkable degree (Glees, 1980; J. Ogden, 1989). In these
   cases, malfunction in the removed hemisphere dated back to infancy, so
   presumably the reorganization began then rather than at the time of surgery in
   late adolescence or early adulthood. In rare instances, people are born entirely
   lacking a corpus callosum. A further tribute to the brain’s plasticity is that 75%
   of these individuals develop normally and fewer than 12% are severely impaired
   (Sotiriadis & Makrydimas, 2012).
   Recovery from aphasia and periventricular heterotopia challenges our
   understanding of how the brain works. Hydrocephalus provides another such
   example. Hydrocephalus occurs when the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid is
   blocked and the accumulating fluid interferes with the brain’s growth,
   typically producing severe intellectual impairment. If detected in time, the
   condition can be treated by installing a drain that shunts the excess fluid into the
   bloodstream. However, the occasional individual somehow avoids impairment
   without this treatment. The British neurologist John Lorber described a 26-year-
   old college student with hydrocephalus whose ventricles were so enlarged that
   the cerebral walls (between his ventricles and the outer surface of his brain) were
   less than 1 mm thick, compared with the usual 45 mm (Figure 3.27). Yet he had
   a superior IQ of 126, had earned an honors degree in mathematics, and was
   socially normal (Lewin, 1980). It is unclear how these individuals can function
   normally in the face of such enormous brain deficits. What is clear is that
   somewhere in this remarkable plasticity lies the key to new revelations about
   brain function.

   Possibilities for CNS Repair
   In 1995, Christopher Reeve, the movie actor best known for his role as
   Superman, was paralyzed from the neck down when he was thrown from his
   horse during a competition. Three quarters of his spinal cord was destroyed at
   the level of the injury (J. W. McDonald et al., 2002). He had no motor control
   and almost no sensation below the neck; like 90% of similarly injured patients,
   he experienced little functional improvement over the next few years. Chicago
   Bears wide receiver Johnny Knox also suffered a severely damaged spinal cord,
   when a Seattle Seahawks lineman bent him backwards almost in half during a
   game in 2011 (Figure 3.28). Many people thought he would not be able to walk
   again due to the amount of damage; but unlike Reeve, through intensive
   treatment by properly trained staff at the time of injury and during the recovery
   process, and advances in spinal fusion surgery, he was able to regain the ability
   to walk despite shattering several vertebrae and severely bruising his spinal cord.
   Although we cannot yet repair severed spinal cords, we have made significant
   advances in helping injured ones heal.
   Figure 3.28 Johnny Knox.

   In spite of Ramón y Cajal’s declaration that there is no regeneration in the CNS,
   scientists nearly a century later are pursuing several strategies for inducing self-
   repair following damage like Reeve’s and Knox’s. These efforts include
   minimizing the initial damage, encouraging regrowth and new connections, and
   —the holy grail of stroke and spinal cord treatment—replacing lost neurons. As
   one example, administering a newly developed molecule shortly after induced
   stroke in rats reduced glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, which in turn reduced
   the area of damage by 40% and minimized the loss of motor functions (Bach et
   al., 2012). Although the brain releases gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to
   defend against excitotoxicity, GABA’s effect at receptors elsewhere on the
   neuron is to reduce later plasticity. Researchers at UCLA have found a way to
   block GABA’s effect outside the synapse, while leaving its synaptic inhibition
   intact; as a result, mice treated with the drug recovered 50% more motor
   function than controls (Clarkson, Huang, MacIsaac, Mody, & Carmichael,
   2010).
   Several strategies for encouraging axon regrowth are under investigation. One
   option is to block receptors for the protein Nogo-A, which inhibits regeneration
   following injury. In monkeys with surgically induced spinal cord damage, a
   Nogo-A inhibitor produced axon growth across the injured area, and the
   monkeys recovered 80% of the use of their paralyzed hands (P. Freund et al.,
   2006; P. Freund et al., 2007). In rats with induced stroke, combining this Nogo-A
   blocker with inosine doubled the compensatory growth of axon branches into the
   spinal cord from the intact hemisphere; this restored the rats’ skilled reaching to
   preoperative levels (Zai et al., 2011). The drug company Novartis has begun a
   phase 2 clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a Nogo-A blocker, indicating that
   its phase 1 safety trial was successful, though those results have not been
   published yet.
   Figure 3.29 Embryonic Stem Cells.

   The most graphic axon regrowth results were in a study with rats whose severed
   spinal cords were treated with electrical stimulation and drugs that increased
   neural excitability (van den Brand et al., 2012). When the rats were suspended in
   a sling, circuits in the lower spinal cord enabled them to step in response to a
   moving treadmill but not to walk voluntarily. But when the electrochemical
   stimulation was combined with the temptation of a chocolate treat, they were
   able after four to five weeks of training not only to walk but to sprint up rat-sized
   stairs. Compared with untrained rats and rats trained on the treadmill alone, they
   had an increase in axonal projections around the lesion site that equaled 45% of
   the original fibers, plus an almost fourfold increase in projections from the
   cortex to brain-stem motor areas.
   The most exciting possibility involves the use of stem cells to replace injured
   neurons. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can develop into
   specialized cells such as neurons, muscle, or blood cells. Stem cells in the
   embryo (Figure 3.29) are pluripotent, which means that they can differentiate
   into any cell in the body. The developing cell’s fate is determined by chemical
   signals from its environment that turn on specific genes and silence others. Later
   in life, stem cells lose most of their flexibility and are confined to areas with a
   high demand for cell replacement, such as the skin, the intestine, and bone
   marrow (the source of blood cells). In the brain, stem cells are the source of the
   neurogenesis we discussed earlier. When embryonic stem cells are placed into an
   adult nervous system, they tend to differentiate into neurons appropriate to that
   area; researchers are also learning how to coax adult stem cells to do the same.
   Researchers in Portugal and an international team operating in Panama have
   reported encouraging improvements in spinal cord patients treated with stem
   cells, including the ability to transfer to and from a wheelchair, the ability to step
   with assistance, and return of bowel and urinary control and sexual function
   (Ichim, 2010; Lima et al., 2006). By contrast, the U.S. biotech company Geron
   has called off its stem cell clinical trial; the company cited financial reasons, but
   critics have suggested that at this stage of our understanding it is too early even
   to venture into this form of treatment (Coghlan, 2011).
   Five years after his injury, Christopher Reeve undertook an intensive
   rehabilitation program called activity-based recovery (J. W. McDonald et al.,
   2002). The therapy involved using electrical stimulation to exercise critical
   muscle groups. For example, electrodes placed over three muscles of each leg
   were activated sequentially to allow him to pedal a customized exercise bike.
   This effort appeared futile; no spinal cord patient classified as Grade A (the
   category of greatest impairment) had ever recovered more than one grade after
   two years. But after three years of this therapy, two thirds of Reeve’s touch
   sensation had returned, and he was able to walk in an aquatherapy pool and
   make swimming movements with his arms; as a result, he was reclassified to
   Grade C. It even seemed possible that Reeve might achieve his goal of walking
   again, but he died of heart failure in October 2004. The Christopher Reeve
   Paralysis Foundation continues his work toward lifting Ramón y Cajal’s decree.
   But since that day appears far off, researchers in the meantime are merging
   neurons with electronics to give back to patients control of their bodies (see the
   accompanying Research Spotlight on the next page).
   The word impossible is not in the vocabulary of contemporary neuroscience.

   In Perspective
   We could end this chapter by talking about how much is known about the brain
   and its functions. Or we could tell you about how little is known. Either point of
   view would be correct; it is the classic case of whether the glass is half full or
   half empty. As we said in Chapter 1, remarkable progress has been made during
   the past few years. The functions of most areas of the brain are known. We have
   a good idea how the brain develops and how neurons find their way to their
   destinations and make functional connections. And we’re getting closer to
   understanding how the neurons form complex networks that carry out the brain’s
   work.
   But questions remain: How does the brain combine activity from widespread
   areas to bring about an action or a decision or a conscious experience. What is a
   thought? How do we fix a broken brain? But, of course, there is hope, and for
   good reason. You will see in the following chapters that a vast amount of
   knowledge has already been gathered and that researchers have a solid
   foundation for making remarkable advances in our lifetime and revolutionary
   ones in yours.
   If the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that
   we couldn’t.

   Faced with the daunting challenge of coaxing axons to regrow and stem cells to take over the
   duties of brain cells, some researchers are turning to computer chips, and their results have been
   encouraging. For example, neuroscientists at Northwestern University simulated spinal injury in
   two monkeys by temporarily anesthetizing nerves in their arms at the elbow. Then they used an
   electrode array to pick up signals from the hand area of the motor cortex, which were then
   amplified and delivered to muscles in the forearm. With this arrangement the monkeys were
   able to grasp and pick up a ball and drop it into an opening almost as well as they had done
   before the anesthesia (Figure a; Ethier, Oby, Bauman, & Miller, 2012).
   Moving these experimental accomplishments out of the laboratory and into the patient’s
   everyday life will take years, but the potential of computer brain interfaces (BCI) is proceeding
   rapidly. The possibility of using thought to control external devices promises some degree of
   independence for individuals with limited limb mobility. After implantation of an electrode
   array in the arm area of his motor cortex, a 25-year-old quadriplegic (both arms and legs
   paralyzed) was able to move a cursor on a computer screen to read emails and to play a simple
   computer game (Hochberg et al., 2006). Later refinements have allowed two patients to control
   a robotic arm to pick up and manipulate objects, including drinking from a water bottle (see
   Figure b; Hochberg et al., 2012).
   Although the ability to accomplish a task in and of itself may seem like an adequate goal, the
   reality is that being able to accomplish tasks with speed comparable to unimpaired individuals is
   often a practical limitation for technological advances to be adopted and implemented on a
   wider scale. Recent work by neurosurgeon Jaimie Henderson at Stanford, part of the Brain Gate
   consortium, implanted tiny electrode arrays onto the surface of the motor cortex in individuals
   who either were quadriplegic or had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou
   Gehrig’s disease). The individuals performed free typing tasks, assessed in terms of words per
   minute typed, and importantly without any word completion suggestions from software
   algorithms. These individuals typed up to eight words per minute, which may seem slow
   compared with professional writers but is approximately half as fast as individuals can type out
   messages on their cell phones.
   Chapter Summary
   The Central Nervous System
   The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord.
   The CNS is arranged in a hierarchy, with physically higher structures carrying out more
   sophisticated functions.
   The cortex is the location of the most sophisticated functions; the convoluted structure of
   the cerebral hemispheres provides for the maximum amount of cortex.
   See Table 3.2 for the major structures of the brain and their functions.
   Although localization is an important functional principle in the brain, most functions
   depend on the interaction of several brain areas.
   The spinal cord contains pathways between the brain and the body below the head and
   provides for sensory-motor reflexes.
   The meninges and the cerebrospinal fluid protect the brain from trauma; the blood-brain
   barrier blocks toxins and blood-borne neurotransmitters from entering the brain.
   The Peripheral Nervous System
   See Figure 3.19 for a summary of the divisions of the nervous system.
   The PNS consists of the cranial and spinal nerves or, alternatively, the somatic
   nervous system and the ANS.
   The somatic nervous system consists of the sensory nerves and the nerves
   controlling the skeletal muscles.
   The sympathetic branch of the ANS prepares the body for action; the
   parasympathetic branch conserves and renews energy.
   Interconnection in the sympathetic ganglion chain means that the sympathetic nervous
   system tends to function as a whole, unlike the parasympathetic branch.
   Development and Change in the Nervous System
   Prenatal development of the nervous system involves
   proliferation, the multiplication of neurons by division;
   migration, in which neurons travel to their destination;
   circuit formation, the growth of axons to, and their connection to, their targets; and
   circuit pruning, the elimination of excess neurons and incorrect synapses.
   Myelination continues through adolescence or later, with higher brain levels myelinating
   last.
   Experience can produce changes in brain structure and function.
   Although some recovery of function occurs in the mammalian CNS, there is little or no
   true repair of damage by either neurogenesis or regeneration; enhancing repair is a major
   research focus.

   For Further Thought
   Patients with damage to the right parietal lobe, the temporal lobe, or the prefrontal cortex may
   have little or no impairment in their intellectual capabilities, yet they show deficits in behavior
   that seem inconsistent for an otherwise intelligent individual. Does this modify your ideas
   about how we govern our behavior?
   Like the heroes in the 1966 science fiction movie Fantastic Voyage, you and your crew will
   enter a small submarine to be shrunk to microscopic size and injected into the carotid artery of
   an eminent scientist who is in a coma. Your mission is to navigate through the bloodstream to
   deliver a lifesaving drug to a specific area in the scientist’s brain. The drug can be designed to
   your specifications, and you can decide where in the vascular system you will release it. What
   are some of the strategies you could consider to ensure that the drug will enter the brain and be
   effective?

   Ashanthi DeSilva developed her first infection just two days after her birth.
   There would be many more. At the age of two, her frequent illnesses and poor
   growth were diagnosed as being due to severe combined immunodeficiency
   (SCID)—better known as the “bubble-boy disease” after an earlier victim who
   had to live in a sterile environment in a plastic tent (Figure 4.1). Her immune
   system was so compromised that she suffered from frequent infections and
   gained weight slowly; because traditional enzyme treatments were inadequate, at
   the age of four her parents enrolled her in a revolutionary experimental therapy.
   SCID is caused by a faulty gene, so the doctors transferred healthy genes into
   her immune cells (Blaese et al., 1995). Ashanthi is a grown woman now and
   living a normal life in suburban Cleveland (Springen, 2004), her health and
   normal resistance to disease a silent testimonial to the power of genetic research.

   Just a few years ago, cures like Ashanthi’s and the gene therapies and stem cell
   therapies that you will read about in this chapter and others seemed like
   miracles. These breakthroughs are products of the ingenuity of medical and
   neuroscience researchers, who have built on the accumulated knowledge of their
   predecessors. Their accomplishments are also the result of more powerful
   research methods, including research design as well as technology. This is the
   story of the role that research methodology plays in the field of biopsychology,
   and of the increasing ethical implications of our advancing knowledge. But first,
   we need to take a few minutes to review some important points about research in
   the context of behavioral neuroscience.
   Science, Research, and Theory
   Science is not distinguished by the knowledge it produces but by its method of
   acquiring knowledge. We learned in Chapter 1 that scientists’ primary method is
   empiricism; this means that they rely on observation for their information rather
   than on intuition, tradition, or logic (alone). Descartes started out with the
   traditional assumption that there was a soul, and then he located the soul in the
   pineal gland because it seemed the logical place for the soul to control the brain.
   Aristotle, using equally good logic, had located the soul in the heart because the
   heart is so vital to life. (He thought that the brain’s function was to cool the
   blood!) Observation—which is a much more formal activity in science than the
   term suggests—is more objective than alternative ways of acquiring knowledge;
   this means that two observers are more likely to reach the same conclusion about
   what is being observed (though not necessarily about its interpretation) than if
   they were using intuition or logic.
   Figure 4.1 The Original “Bubble Boy.”
   Source: Bettmann/Getty Images.
   Biopsychologists, and scientists in general, have great confidence in observation
   and all the methods in their arsenal. But in scientific writings, you will often see
   statements beginning with “It appears that . . .,” “Perhaps . . .,” or “The results
   suggest. . . .” So you might well wonder, Why do scientists always sound so
   tentative?
   Theory and Tentativeness in Science
   One reason for the tentativeness is that the field is very complex, so it is always
   possible that a study is flawed or that new data will change how previous studies
   are interpreted. A second reason is that scientists base their conclusions on
   samples of subjects and samples of data from those subjects; the laws of
   probability tell us that even well-designed studies will occasionally include a
   few unusual participants or a slight but important shift in behavior may occur
   that has nothing to do with the variable under study.
   Why are scientists so tentative?
   Scientists recognize that knowledge is changing rapidly and the cherished ideas
   of today may be discarded tomorrow. A case in point is that, until recently, no
   one accepted that there was regrowth of severed axons or any neurogenesis in
   the mammalian central nervous system (Rakic, 1985), beliefs that you now know
   are incorrect. You seldom hear scientists using the words truth and proof,
   because these terms suggest final answers. Such uncertainty may feel
   uncomfortable to you, but centuries of experience have shown that certainty
   about truth can be just as uncomfortable. “Certainty” has an ugly way of stifling
   the pursuit of knowledge.
   One way the researcher has of making sense out of ambiguity is through theory.
   A theory integrates and interprets diverse observations in an attempt to
   explain some phenomenon. For example, schizophrenia researchers noticed
   that people who overdosed on the drug amphetamine were being misdiagnosed
   as having schizophrenia when they were admitted to emergency rooms with
   hallucinations and paranoia. They also knew that amphetamine increases activity
   in neurons that release dopamine as the neurotransmitter. This led several
   researchers to propose that schizophrenia is due to excess dopamine activity in
   the brain.
   A theory explains existing facts, but it also generates hypotheses that guide
   further research. One hypothesis that came from dopamine theory was that drugs
   that decrease dopamine activity would improve functioning in schizophrenia.
   This hypothesis was testable, which is a requirement for a good theory. The
   hypothesis was supported in many cases of schizophrenia, but not in others. We
   now realize that the dopamine theory is an incomplete explanation for
   schizophrenia. However, even a flawed theory inspires further research that will
   yield more knowledge and additional hypotheses. But remember that the best
   theory is still only a theory; theory and empiricism are the basis of science’s
   ability to self-correct and its openness to change and renewal.
   Now we will examine one of the knottiest issues of research, one that you will
   need to think about often as you evaluate the research evidence discussed
   throughout this text.
   Experimental Versus Correlational Studies
   Observation has a broad meaning in science. A biological psychologist might
   observe aggressive behavior in children on the playground to see if there are
   differences between boys and girls (naturalistic observation), report on the brain
   scan of a patient who had violent outbursts following a car accident that caused
   brain injury (case study), use a questionnaire to find out whether some women
   are more aggressive during the premenstrual period (survey), or stimulate a part
   of rats’ brains with electricity to see what parts of the brain control aggressive
   behavior (experiment). These different research strategies fall into the broad
   categories of correlational and experimental studies.
   What is the advantage of experimental studies over correlational studies?
   An experiment is a study in which the researcher manipulates a condition
   (the independent variable) that is expected to produce a change in the
   subject’s behavior (the dependent variable). The experimenter also eliminates
   extraneous variables that might influence the behavior or equates them across
   subjects—for example, by removing environmental distractions, instructing
   participants not to use caffeine or other stimulants beforehand, and “running”
   subjects at the same time of day. In a correlational study, the researcher does
   not control an independent variable but observes whether two variables are
   related to each other. When we use brain scans to determine that violent
   criminals more often have impaired frontal lobe activity, we are conducting a
   correlational study. If we induce the impairment in monkeys (independent
   variable) and then observe whether this increases aggression (dependent
   variable), we are doing an experiment.
   Figure 4.2 illustrates some of the differences between a correlational and an
   experimental study of aggressive behavior. Based on observations that violent
   criminals often have impaired frontal lobe functioning, we might identify a large
   group of impaired individuals (using brain scans or behavioral and cognitive
   tests) and see if they have a record of violent crimes. We would very likely find
   that they do, but Figure 4.2a reveals a problem with interpretation: For all we
   know, the individuals’ brain damage may have been incurred in the process of
   committing their violent acts rather than the other way around. Or both frontal
   lobe damage and violent behavior could stem from any number of third
   variables, such as physical abuse during childhood, long-term drug use, or a
   genetic predisposition to engage in risky behaviors. These variables are
   potentially confounded with each other, so we cannot separate their effects. In
   other words, we cannot draw conclusions about cause and effect from a
   correlational study.
   Figure 4.2 Correlational Versus Experimental Studies.
   What about doing this research as an experimental study? For ethical reasons, of
   course, we would not induce brain damage in humans, but remember the study
   described in Chapter 3 in which researchers used an electromagnetic field to
   disrupt activity in the visual cortex of blind individuals. Let’s use this
   transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt temporarily our hypothetical
   volunteers’ frontal lobe functioning. Granted, we won’t see them become
   physically violent in the laboratory, but we can borrow a technique from a
   similar study we will see later in Chapter 8, on emotion: We will administer
   several mild shocks to the subject under the pretense that the shocks are being
   controlled by another (fictitious) player, and we will record the intensity of
   shocks our participant delivers in retaliation. Because we selected our research
   participants and induced the brain impairment, we have controlled the
   confounding variables that plagued us in the correlational study. That is, the
   variables are likely to be similar between the impaired group and an unimpaired
   control group, especially if we make sure factors such as age and gender are
   similar between the groups. Now if we see higher levels of shock administered
   by subjects while their frontal activity is being disrupted, we can be fairly
   confident that the frontal lobe impairment is causing the increase in the
   aggressive behavior.
   Of course, we could quibble about how well this study mirrors real brain damage
   and violent aggression; the greater control afforded by experimental studies
   often carries a cost of some artificiality. Experimentation is the most powerful
   research strategy, but correlational studies also provide unique and valuable
   information, such as the observation that children of parents who have
   schizophrenia have a high incidence of the disorder even when they are reared in
   normal adoptive homes. To advance our understanding in biopsychology, we
   need correlational studies as well as experimental research, but we equally need
   to be careful about interpreting their results—a point you should keep in mind as
   we explore various research techniques and as we look at research in later
   chapters.

   What is the value of empiricism? What is the value of theory?
   A scientist speaking to a group of students says, “I do not expect my research to find the truth.”
   Why?
   What advantages do correlational studies have over experiments?
   You hear the newscaster say, “Physicians are urging people to stay active in retirement,
   because researchers have found that people who are more physically and socially active are
   less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease.” What should you be thinking?
   Research Techniques
   The brain does not give up its secrets easily. If we remove a clock from its case
   and observe the gears turn and the spring expand, we can get a pretty good idea
   how a clock measures time. But if we open the skull, how the brain works
   remains just as much a mystery as before. This is where research technique
   comes in, extending the scientist’s observation beyond what is readily accessible.
   Your understanding of the information that fills the rest of this book—and of the
   limitations of that information—will require some knowledge of how the
   researchers came to their conclusions. The following review of a few major
   research methods is abbreviated, but it will help you navigate through the rest of
   the book, and we will add other methods as we go along.
   Staining and Imaging Neurons
   It didn’t take long to exhaust the possibilities for viewing the nervous system
   with the naked eye, but the invention of the microscope took researchers many
   steps beyond what the pioneers in gross anatomy could do. Unfortunately,
   neurons are greatly intertwined and are difficult to distinguish from each other,
   even when magnified. The Golgi stain method randomly stains about 5% of
   neurons, placing them in relief against the background of seeming neural
   chaos (Figure 4.3a). As we saw in Chapter 2, the Italian anatomist Camillo
   Golgi developed this technique in 1875 and, shortly after, his Spanish
   contemporary Santiago Ramón y Cajal used it to discover that neurons are
   separate cells. Golgi and Ramón y Cajal jointly received the 1906 Nobel Prize in
   physiology and medicine for their contributions.
   What major discovery did Golgi staining enable?
   Other staining methods add important dimensions to the researcher’s ability to
   study the nervous system. Myelin stains are taken up by the fatty myelin that
   wraps and insulates axons; the stain thus identifies neural pathways. In
   Figure 4.3b, the slice of brain tissue is heavily stained in the inner areas where
   many pathways converge, but it is stained lightly or not at all in the perimeter
   where mostly cell bodies are located. Nissl stains do the opposite; they identify
   cell bodies of neurons (Figure 4.3c).
   Later-generation techniques are used to trace pathways to determine their origin
   or their destination—that is, which part of the brain is communicating with
   another. These procedures take advantage of the fact that neurons move
   materials up and down the axon constantly. For example, if we inject the
   chemical fluorogold into a part of the brain, it will be taken up by the terminals
   of neurons and transported up the axons to the cell bodies. Under light of the
   appropriate wavelength, fluorogold will fluoresce—radiate light—so it will
   show up under a microscope and tell us which brain areas receive neural input
   from the area we injected. For example, fluorogold injected into a rat’s superior
   colliculi will show up a few days later among the neurons at the back of the eye.
   These staining and tracing procedures reveal fine anatomy, but they do not tell us
   anything about function. Autoradiography makes neurons stand out visibly
   just as staining does, but it also reveals which neurons are active, and this
   information can be correlated with the behavior the animal was engaged in.
   In this procedure, the animal is injected with a substance that has been made
   radioactive, such as a type of sugar called 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). Then, the
   researcher usually stimulates the animal, for instance, by presenting a visual
   pattern or requiring the subject to learn a task. Active neurons take up more
   glucose, and because 2-DG is similar to glucose, the neurons involved in the
   activity become radioactively “labeled.” In Chapter 10, you will see an example
   of this technique, in which vision researchers mapped the projections to the
   visual cortex from light-receptive cells in the eye (Tootell, Silverman, Switkes,
   & De Valois, 1982). After injecting monkeys with radioactive 2-DG, they
   presented the subjects with a geometric visual stimulus. The animals were
   euthanized (killed painlessly), and a section of their visual cortical tissue was
   placed on photographic film. The radioactive areas exposed the film and
   produced an image of the original stimulus. This confirmed that just as the
   somatosensory projection area contains a map of the body, the visual cortex
   maps the visual-sensitive retina and, thus, the visual world (Figure 4.4a).
   What advantage does autoradiography have?

   A variation of this method is used to determine the location and quantity of
   receptors for a particular drug or neurotransmitter. Candace Pert used this
   procedure to find out whether there are receptors in the brain for opiate drugs (a
   class containing opium, morphine, and heroin), which seemed like the best
   explanation for the drugs’ potency in relieving pain (Herkenham & Pert, 1982;
   Pert & Snyder, 1973). First, she soaked rat brains in radioactive naloxone, a drug
   that she knew counteracts the effects of opiates, on the assumption that it does so
   by blocking the hypothesized receptors. She then placed thinly sliced sections of
   the brains on photographic film. Sure enough, an image of the brain formed,
   highlighting the locations of opiate receptors (Figure 4.4b). This procedure not
   only established that the receptors exist but also implied that the brain makes its
   own opiates!
   Instead of using radioactivity, immunocytochemistry uses antibodies attached
   to a dye to identify cellular components such as receptors,
   neurotransmitters, or enzymes. The technique takes advantage of the fact that
   antibodies, which attack foreign intruders in the body, can be custom designed to
   be specific to any cellular component. The dye, which is usually fluorescent,
   makes the antibodies’ targets visible when the tissue is removed and examined
   under a microscope. Night-migrating birds use the earth’s magnetic field to
   navigate, and earlier evidence suggested that the magnetic detectors might be
   cryptochromes, which are molecules found in some neurons in the birds’ retinas.
   Henrik Mouritsen and his colleagues (2004) in Germany have provided strong
   supporting evidence. Using immunocytochemistry, they found that during the
   day, cryptochromes were plentiful in the retinas of both garden warblers and
   zebra finches; at night, however, cryptochromes diminished virtually to zero in
   the nonmigratory finches but increased in the eyes of the night-migrating
   warblers (Figure 4.5).

   But before they could do this study, Mouritsen’s team had to decide which of
   two kinds of cryptochrome to focus their efforts on, CRY1 or CRY2. So they
   used another powerful research technique that determines where particular genes
   are active, in this case the cry1 and cry2 genes. Remember from Chapter 1 that
   genes control the production of proteins; the instructions for protein
   production are carried from the nucleus into the cytoplasm of a cell by
   messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which is a copy of one strand of the
   gene’s DNA. So, when we locate specific mRNA, we know that the gene is
   active in that place; this is done by in situ hybridization. In situ hybridization
   involves constructing strands of complementary DNA, which will dock with
   strands of mRNA. Because the complementary DNA is first made radioactive,
   autoradiography can then be used to determine the location of gene activity
   (Figure 4.6). The researchers found that the protein product CRY2 was being
   constructed in cell nuclei, whereas CRY1 was being constructed outside the
   nucleus. Because a magnetoreceptor was more likely to function outside the
   nucleus, they limited their study to that cryptochrome.
   Light and Electron Microscopy
   For more than three centuries, the progress of biological research closely
   paralleled the development of the light microscope. The microscope evolved
   from a device that used a drop of water as the magnifier, through the simple
   microscope with a single lens, to the compound microscope with multiple lenses.
   At that point, investigators were able to see the gross details of neurons: cell
   bodies, dendrites, axons, and the largest organelles. But the capability of the light
   microscope is limited, not due to the skills of the lens maker but due to the
   nature of light. Increases in magnification beyond about 1,500 times yield little
   additional information.
   The electron microscope, by contrast, magnifies up to about 250,000 times and
   can distinguish features as small as a few hundred millionths of a centimeter.
   The transmission electron microscope works by passing a beam of electrons
   through a thin slice of tissue; different parts of the tissue block or pass
   electrons to different degrees, so the electrons produce an image of the
   object on photographic film or on a video screen. It uses magnets to bend the
   electron beams to magnify the image up to a million times; this allows us to see
   details such as the synaptic vesicles in an axon terminal. Engineers have
   enhanced the technique in the scanning electron microscope. The beam of
   electrons induces the specimen to emit electrons itself, and these are
   captured just as the conventional microscope collects reflected light.
   Magnification is half that of the transmission electron microscope, but the
   images have a three-dimensional (3-D) appearance that is helpful in visualizing
   details. You can see this feature in Figure 4.7, as well as in Figure 2.16.
   Microscopic technology continues to evolve, for example, in the confocal laser
   scanning microscope and the two-photon microscope. These microscopes image
   specific kinds of tissue, depending on the fluorescent dye the tissue is stained
   with (a fluorescent dye emits light when radiated with light within a specific
   range of wavelengths). These microscopes have the advantage that they are not
   limited to very thin slices of tissue. They can be used with thicker tissue samples
   and can even image details in the upper layers of the exposed living brain; with
   optical probes, they can image neurons as deep as 1 centimeter below the
   surface. As an example, researchers using a dye specific for calcium were able to
   measure movement-related neural activity in the brains of mice running on a
   treadmill (Dombeck, Khabbaz, Collman, Adelman, & Tank, 2007). As the
   accompanying Research Spotlight reveals, techniques for viewing the brain are
   getting a significant boost.

   Measuring and Manipulating Brain Activity
   You learned in previous chapters that it is easy to stimulate the surface of the
   brain with electricity to produce movement, sensations, and even apparent
   memories. We can also record electrical activity from the surface of the brain or
   even from the scalp. Studying deeper structures will require more inventive
   techniques, which we will look at after we discuss electroencephalography.
   Electroencephalography
   In 1929, the German psychiatrist Hans Berger invented the
   electroencephalograph and used it to record the first electroencephalogram from
   his young son’s brain. Since then, the technique has proved indispensable in
   diagnosing brain disorders such as epilepsy and brain tumors; it has also been
   valuable for studying brain activity during various kinds of behavior, from sleep
   to learning. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is recorded from two electrodes
   on the scalp over the area of interest; an electronic amplifier detects the
   combined electrical activity of all the neurons between the two electrodes
   (popularly known as “brain waves”; see Figure 4.8). Usually, the researcher
   applies a number of electrodes and monitors activity in multiple brain areas at
   the same time.
   The temporal (time) resolution of the EEG is one of its best features; it can
   distinguish events only 1 millisecond (ms) apart in time, so it can track the
   brain’s responses to rapidly changing events. However, its spatial resolution, or
   ability to detect precisely where in the brain the signal is coming from, is poor.
   This problem can be alleviated somewhat by applying electrodes directly to the
   brain, which removes the interference of the skull. Of course, this procedure is
   used only with animals or with humans undergoing surgery. So although the
   EEG provides relatively gross measurements, its advantages are good time
   resolution, ease of use, and lower cost than the imaging techniques we will
   consider shortly.
   Figure 4.6 DNA, Proteins, and In Situ Hybridization.

   EEGs are most useful for detecting changes in arousal, as in the example in
   Figure 4.8. They are not good at detecting the response to a brief stimulus, such
   as a spoken word; the time resolution is adequate, but the “noise” of the brain’s
   other ongoing activity drowns out the response, so the tracing looks much like
   the “awake” recording in the figure. However, by combining
   electroencephalography with the computer, the researcher can average the EEG
   over several presentations of the stimulus to produce an event-related
   potential, like the one in Figure 4.9. Averaging over many trials cancels out the
   ongoing noise, leaving only the unique response to the stimulus. In this example,
   Shirley Hill (1995) repeatedly presented a low-pitched tone to her research
   participants and occasionally interjected a high-pitched tone. Averaging showed
   a large dip in the electrical potential following the novel (high-pitched) stimulus.
   In Chapter 5, you will learn that this dip is smaller in alcoholics than in
   nonalcoholics, as well as in the young children of alcoholics, which suggests an
   inherited vulnerability to alcoholism. Another example is that biopsychologists
   have used the technique to confirm that spoken words produce a greater response
   in the left hemisphere, just as you would expect, than in the right hemisphere.
   As computer analysis has become more sophisticated, it has allowed researchers
   to combine activity from several electrodes and generate dynamic, rapidly
   changing images of the brain’s activity. Some innovative applications of this
   technology are described in the accompanying In the News feature.

   Research Spotlight: Looking Into the Brain
   Neuroscientists have many holy grails, and one of them is the ability to peer into the brain, to
   visualize the neurons and their all-important connections. Chapter 2 described methods for
   imaging white-matter pathways, but the resolution is poorer than researchers would like. Light
   microscopy provides more detail, but brain tissue is mostly opaque so it must be sliced into very
   thin sections that limit ability to trace pathways. There have been attempts to make brain tissue
   transparent by extracting the lipids that make up the cell membranes, but the process also
   removes proteins and the cells fall apart.
   Now a team at Stanford University led by psychiatrist and bioengineer Karl Deisseroth has
   come up with a solution in the form of a process they call, appropriately, CLARITY (Chung et
   al., 2013; Tomer, Ye, Hsueh, & Deisseroth, 2014). The brain is placed in a solution of
   acrylamide, which binds to the brain’s proteins and holds them together while the lipids are
   removed. By then the tissue is totally transparent, as you can see in the figure. In the next step,
   the neurons are “labeled” with fluorescent antibodies, which attach to specific proteins and
   make particular structures visible; the third panel of the figure shows the neurons in an intact
   mouse hippocampus (the curved structure in the image). The procedure has allowed the team to
   visualize lesions in the brain of a deceased Alzheimer’s patient (K. Ando et al., 2014). The
   acrylamide increases the tissue’s resilience, so that the labels can be removed and replaced with
   others to highlight different types of neurons. This means that the precious few brains available
   from people with particular disorders can be used over and over again.
   More recently, a Caltech research team headed by Viviana Gradinaru (C. Xiao et al., 2016) has
   used CLARITY techniques to identify and label circuits of neurons involved in controlling
   motor activity that is commonly dysfunctional in people with Parkinson’s disease. Once the
   specific neurons were traced from their place of origin to their destination, the researchers used
   optogenetic techniques (see Chapter 3) in a separate experiment to show that activation of these
   circuits could regulate the impaired motor function. These research findings provide specific
   targets to neurosurgeons who may then attempt to implant artificial stimulators into the brains of
   Parkinson’s patients so that they can lead more productive lives with fewer motor impairments.

   Stimulation, Recording, and Stereotaxic Techniques
   Most of the structures of interest to brain scientists are well below the surface of
   the brain; reaching them requires the use of various kinds of electrical, chemical,
   and light probes. Usually this work is done with animals, and the researcher uses
   a map of the brain called a stereotaxic atlas to determine where to locate the
   probe. To construct an atlas, first a large number of brains are sliced into very
   thin coronal sections; drawings are prepared that show the average location of
   brain structures on each section (Figure 4.10). The researcher typically uses a
   stereotaxic instrument, a device that allows precise positioning of an
   electrode or other probe in the brain. Figure 4.11 shows a stereotaxic
   instrument for rats; the instrument secures the anesthetized rat’s head and allows
   the investigator to insert the probe through a small hole drilled in the skull at the
   precise location and depth specified by the atlas.
   What are the different ways a stereotaxic instrument is used?
   Often the probe is a fine-wire electrode, electrically insulated except at its tip,
   that is used to activate the structure with very low voltage electricity. While the
   still-anesthetized animal’s brain is being stimulated, the researcher can monitor
   responses in other parts of the brain or in the body. If the animal must be awake
   to test the effect, the electrode can be anchored to the skull; the wound is closed,
   and after a couple of days of recovery, the rat’s behavior can be observed during
   stimulation. In Chapter 5 you will learn about research in which animals were
   willing to press a lever to deliver electrical stimulation to certain parts of their
   own brains. (The stimulation isn’t painful, because the brain lacks pain
   receptors.)
   Figure 4.9 Event-Related Potential Produced by a Novel Tone.
   A similar electrode arrangement is used to record neural activity; the
   biopsychologist might subject the animal to a learning task, present visual or
   auditory stimuli, or introduce a member of the other sex while monitoring
   activity in an appropriate brain location. Electrodes ordinarily will record from
   all the surrounding neurons, but microelectrodes have tips so fine that they can
   record from a single neuron and can even be inserted into the neuron. Most
   microelectrodes are glass micropipettes filled with a solution that is similar to
   the intracellular fluid of the cell and electrically conducting. The tip can be as
   small as 1 micron (millionth of a meter). Stimulating and recording electrodes
   may be placed in the brain temporarily in an anesthetized animal, or they may be
   mounted in a socket cemented to the animal’s skull to permit recording in the
   unanesthetized, behaving subject.
   In The News: Portable EEG Reveals Real-Life Brain Activity
   Brain imaging studies provide invaluable dynamic images of the active, behaving brain, but the
   cumbersomeness of fMRI and PET equipment limits research to the artificial environment of the
   laboratory, with participants performing tasks that bear little resemblance to real life. In the past
   few years, portable EEG devices have allowed researchers to begin examining the brains of
   people in more naturalistic settings, providing insights into new brain-behavior interactions. One
   brand of equipment, the EMOTIV system, uses a simple headband with 5 to 14 electrodes to
   detect brain activity from several locations; it then sends these signals wirelessly to a computer
   for analysis (EMOTIV, n.d.). This type of equipment allows researchers to make recordings in
   real-life social situations. Suzanne Dikker and her colleagues discovered that when students
   interacted with each other in the classroom, their brain activity fell into similar, synchronized
   patterns (Cell Press, 2017). Cognitive psychologist David Strayer has even taken the equipment
   on three-day camping trips to study how the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex, rejuvenates
   itself in the relaxing environment of nature (F. Williams, 2016). As behavioral evidence of this
   rejuvenation, an Outward Bound group performed 50% better on creative reasoning tasks by the
   third day. Now that studies of brain activity are no longer confined to the laboratory, the
   possibilities for insight into the neural correlates of human behavior seem limitless.
   Thought Questions
   1. How has portable EEG technology helped advance our understanding of the nervous
   system?
   2. In addition to the two examples mentioned here, what is another behavior that you
   believe could be better understood through the use of portable EEG technology?

   Optogenetic techniques (see Chapter 2) have significant advantages over
   electrical stimulation. The light-sensitive channels can be inserted in specific
   types of neurons, so the procedure offers more precise control than electrical
   stimulation, which activates all neurons in the area. And, unlike electrical
   stimulation, light activation doesn’t interfere with simultaneous recording of the
   resulting neural activity. Neurons near the brain’s surface can be stimulated
   through an opening in the skull, or the light can be directed to deeper structures
   via optical fibers. Both techniques allow the study of awake, freely moving
   subjects. The channels are usually introduced by inserting genes from algae or
   bacteria. Channels derived from these sources are activated by opsins, the same
   light-sensitive proteins that enable our eyes to detect light; in the original hosts,
   their roles include orientation to light and control of day-night rhythms, as well
   as vision (F. Zhang et al., 2011). Optogenetics is not limited to stimulation; by
   genetically introducing the appropriate sensors, researchers can detect and
   measure several aspects of neural activity, including membrane voltage,
   neurotransmitters, and release of transmitters from vesicles (Mancuso et al.,
   2010; Treger, 2015).
   Figure 4.11 A Stereotaxic Instrument.
   Optogenetics has turned out to be a very powerful technique. It has been used to
   study the neural bases of brain activities ranging from movement regulation to
   memory, the role of rhythmic neural activity in behavior and information
   processing, and the contribution of neural activity to myelination and adult
   neurogenesis (Deisseroth, 2015). It is also helping us understand the recovery
   processes following stroke, as well as a wide range of disorders including
   Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety, depression, and addiction
   (Deisseroth, 2015; Steinberg, Christoffel, Deisseroth, & Malenka, 2015).
   Therapeutic applications are on the horizon, as well. The first clinical trials
   began in March 2016, when doctors injected light-sensitive algae into patients’
   eyes in hopes of restoring some vision to blind individuals (“RetroSense
   Therapeutics Doses First Patients,” 2016).
   Figure 4.12 A Cannula for Microdialysis.
   Chemical stimulation of the brain can be carried out by inserting a small-
   diameter tube called a cannula. Chemical stimulation has a special advantage
   over electrical stimulation in that it acts only at the dendrites and cell bodies of
   neurons. This means that the researcher can simulate the effects of a
   neurotransmitter or block a transmitter’s effects at the synapses. Often the tube is
   not used to deliver the drug but is cemented in place and used later as a guide for
   inserting a smaller drug-delivery cannula; this arrangement can be used for
   stimulation later on multiple occasions. The same technique is used for
   microdialysis, in which brain fluids are extracted for analysis, but a more
   elaborate dual cannula is required. As Figure 4.12 shows, the brain fluids seep
   through a porous membrane into the lower chamber of the cannula; a
   biologically neutral fluid (very similar to seawater) is pumped through one of the
   dual tubes, and it flushes the brain fluid out the other tube for analysis. In
   Chapter 5, you will see results from both of these techniques, when researchers
   deliver abused drugs to rats’ brains or monitor the release of brain
   neurotransmitters after an animal is injected with a drug.
   Some clinical situations require doctors to insert an electrode or cannula into the
   brain of a human patient—for example, to identify functional areas by recording
   electrical activity prior to brain surgery, to lesion malfunctioning tissue in
   patients with epilepsy, or to stimulate the brain in patients with Parkinson’s
   disease. Sometimes, though, a patient undergoing brain surgery will volunteer to
   have unrelated measurements done at the time for research purposes. Placement
   of the probe can be done visually using one of the brain scanning techniques, but
   stereotaxic atlases of the human brain are published for this purpose, and there
   are human stereotaxic instruments as well, usually designed to mount on the
   head, as shown in Figure 4.13.

   Ablation and Lesioning
   Historically, one of the most profitable avenues of brain research has been the
   study of patients who have sustained brain damage. Brain damage can occur in a
   variety of ways: gunshot wounds, blows to the head, tumors, infection, toxins,
   and strokes. Although these “natural experiments” have been extremely valuable
   to neuroscientists, they also have major disadvantages. Most important, the
   damage doesn’t coincide neatly with the functional area; it will affect a smaller
   area or overlap with other functional areas. Fortunately, the pattern of damage
   varies from patient to patient, so if the neuroscientist studies a large number of
   patients, it may be possible to identify the location of damage common to people
   with the same deficits.
   Because of these and other difficulties in studying patients with brain damage,
   researchers often resort to producing the damage themselves in animals. In some
   cases, a whole area of the brain may be removed; removal of brain tissue is
   called ablation. Ablation can be done with a scalpel, but aspiration is a more
   precise technique, and it allows access to deeper structures. The skull is opened,
   and a fine-tipped glass micropipette connected to a vacuum pump is used to suck
   out neural tissue. Usually, however, lesioning is preferred in place of ablation
   because the damage can be controlled more precisely. Lesions, or damage to
   neural tissue, can be produced by electrical current, heat, or injection of a
   neurotoxin (using a stereotaxic instrument) or by using a knife or a fine wire to
   sever connections between areas. “Reversible lesions” can be produced by
   chilling a brain area or by injecting certain chemicals; this means that the
   animal’s behavior can be observed before and during treatment and again after
   recovery.
   Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
   Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a relatively new noninvasive
   brain stimulation technique that uses a magnetic coil to induce a voltage in
   brain tissue. The device is held close to the scalp over the target area, as in
   Figure 4.14. TMS is pulsed at varying rates; frequencies of 1/s or lower decrease
   brain excitability, and frequencies of 5/s or higher increase excitability.
   TMS has demonstrated its usefulness mostly as a research instrument. By
   making clever combination of TMS stimulation and brain imaging techniques
   (described in the next section), researchers have teased out the neural
   modifications that account for recovery in stroke patients (Gerloff et al., 2006)
   and confirmed that making visual-spatial judgments involves not just the parietal
   area but rather a broader network that includes frontal regions (A. T. Sack et al.,
   2007). Clinically, TMS has shown effectiveness in treating the symptoms of
   Parkinson’s disease (Y. Chou, Hickey, Sundman, Song, & Chen, 2015),
   depression and pain (Lefaucheur et al., 2014), and migraine headache (Bhola et
   al., 2015).
   A simpler and less expensive alternative, transcranial direct current stimulation
   (tDCS), involves application of direct current electrical stimulation through
   electrodes placed on the scalp (Sparing & Mottaghy, 2008). Unlike TMS, tDCS
   does not excite neurons to fire. Instead, it activates astrocytes (Monai et al.,
   2016), increasing neuronal excitability and functional connectivity (Cosmo et al.,
   2015). Studies indicate that it can improve attention (Coffman, Trumbo, &
   Clark, 2012) and memory (Prehn-Kristensen et al., 2014). The U.S. military
   reportedly is experimenting with tDCS for improving training and enhancing
   performance (E. Young, 2014).
   Brain Imaging Techniques
   In Broca’s day, and in fact until fairly recently, a researcher had to wait for a
   brain-damaged patient to die in order to pinpoint the location of the damage.
   There was little motivation to do exhaustive observations of the patient’s
   behavior when the patient might outlive the researcher or the body might not be
   available to the researcher at death. All that changed with the invention of
   imaging equipment that could produce a picture of the living brain showing the
   location of damage.
   The first modern medical imaging technique came into use in the early 1970s.
   Computed tomography (CT) scanning produces a series of X-rays taken from
   different angles; a computer combines the series of two-dimensional
   horizontal cross sections, or “slices,” so that the researcher can scan
   through them as if they are a 3-D image of the entire organ (Figure 4.15).
   “False colors” are often added to the achromatic image to make features more
   distinguishable. Imaging soft tissue such as the brain requires injecting a dye that
   will show up on an X-ray; the dye diffuses throughout the tiny blood vessels of
   the brain, so it is really the differing density of blood vessels that forms the
   image. A major drawback of earlier equipment was its extreme slowness, but
   newer models of CT scanners are fast, and they provide detailed images. CT
   scans are also popularly known as CAT scans.

   Another imaging technique, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), works by
   measuring the radio-frequency waves emitted by the nuclei of hydrogen
   atoms when they are subjected to a strong magnetic field. Most of that
   hydrogen is in the water that composes 78% of the brain, but the water content
   varies in different brain structures, so these emissions from hydrogen nuclei can
   be used to form a detailed image of the brain (Figure 4.16a). The MRI is
   reasonably fast, and it can image small areas. Recent increases in power permit
   more versatile imaging by detecting elements other than hydrogen, including
   sodium, phosphorus, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. MRI scanners can cost up to
   $3 million and require a suite costing hundreds of thousands more, but more
   sensitive magnetic field detectors are making low-power, portable scanners
   available for use in the field. A variant of MRI, diffusion tensor imaging,
   measures the movement of water molecules; because water moves easily
   along the length of axons, this technique is useful for imaging brain
   pathways and measuring their quality (Figure 4.16b). As you read through the
   rest of this text, you will learn how the ability to quantify white matter is helping
   us understand mental disorders and psychological functions such as intelligence
   and learning.

   CT and MRI added tremendous capability for detecting tumors and correlating
   brain damage with behavioral symptoms. However, CT and MRI lack the ability
   to detect changing brain activity (as EEG does, for instance). The two remaining
   techniques add that capability.
   Positron emission tomography (PET) involves injecting a radioactive
   substance into the bloodstream, which is taken up by parts of the brain
   according to how active they are. The scanner captures the positrons emitted
   by the radioactive substance to form an image that is color coded to show the
   relative amounts of activity (Figure 4.17). Radioactive 2-DG is often the
   substance that is injected because increased uptake of 2-DG by active neurons
   provides a measure of metabolic activity. Other radioactive substances can be
   used to monitor blood flow or oxygen uptake, and if a neurotransmitter is made
   radioactive, it can be used to determine the locations and numbers of receptors
   for the transmitter. Usually, the researcher produces a “difference scan” by
   subtracting the activity occurring during a neutral control condition from the
   activity that occurred during the test condition; this produces an image that uses
   a color scale to show where activity increased or decreased in the brain.
   PET equipment is expensive and requires a sophisticated staff to operate it; the
   facility must also be near a cyclotron, which produces the radioactive substance,
   and there are few of those around. The advantage that justifies this expense is
   that PET is able to track changing activity in the brain. However, PET cannot
   detect changes during behaviors that are briefer than 30 seconds. PET also does
   not image the brain tissue itself, so the results are often displayed overlaid on a
   brain image produced by another means, such as MRI.
   What advantage do PET and fMRI have over CT and MRI?

   A modification of MRI takes advantage of the fact that oxygenated blood has
   magnetic properties that are different from those of blood that has given up its
   oxygen to cells. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures
   brain activation by detecting the increase in oxygen levels in active neural
   structures (Figure 4.18). MRI and fMRI have the advantage over PET and CT
   because they involve no radiation, so they are safe to use in studies that require
   repeated measurements. In addition, fMRI measures activity, like PET, and
   produces an image of the brain with good spatial resolution, like MRI;
   researchers can detect activity in cortical areas as small as 1 millimeter
   (Barinaga, 1997). The fMRI machines are particularly pricey though, which
   limits their usefulness for research. The techniques described here are
   summarized in Table 4.1.

   Brain imaging has been referred to as “the predominant technique in behavioral
   and cognitive neuroscience” (Friston, 2009, p. 399). That said, you will not be
   surprised to see many examples of its use throughout this text—though none will
   be as unusual as the one in the accompanying Application. However, some
   investigators are urging caution in interpreting results; their focus has been
   mostly on fMRI, but their criticisms apply more broadly. For one thing,
   comparison of fMRI data with data from electrode recording in monkeys showed
   that fMRI misses a great deal of information; this is due to its lower sensitivity
   as well as to chance factors such as the distance of the neurons from a blood
   vessel (Logothetis, 2002). A related problem is that test-retest reliability is often
   low. For example, when researchers showed volunteers pictures of fearful faces,
   correlations of amygdala activity in sessions two weeks apart ranged from .4 to
   .7, indicating a disappointing level of consistency (Johnstone et al., 2005). (We
   discuss the meaning of correlations in more detail in the next section.)
   Perhaps more important, some researchers have been criticized for the way they
   select their data. Ideally, researchers should decide in advance to obtain data
   from a specific area, such as the amygdala, but often researchers do not have
   enough information to make this selection beforehand and therefore scan the
   whole brain. Then they divide the scan into tiny cube-shaped areas called voxels
   and determine which voxels’ activity is correlated with performance on a task or
   with a characteristic of the subjects. This involves calculating literally thousands
   of correlations; if you have even a basic understanding of probability, you know
   that this procedure guarantees finding several voxels whose activity correlates
   with the dependent variable even when no relationship exists. Thus, to ensure
   reliability of the results, the researcher should repeat the experiment focusing
   only on those areas to rule out the possibility the original correlations occurred
   by chance.

   Application: Scanning King Tut
   In January 2005, King Tutankhamun, pharaoh of Egypt 3,000 years ago, was removed from his
   tomb in the Valley of the Kings for the first time in almost 80 years. The trip was a short one, to
   a nearby van where his mummified body was subjected to a CT scan to determine whether Tut’s
   death at the age of 19 might have resulted from murderous intrigue within the royal family.
   An X-ray conducted in the tomb 30 years earlier had found pieces of his skull inside the
   cranium, adding to the murder theory. But if Tut had died from a blow to the head, the bone
   fragments would have been caught up in the embalming material. Instead, the scan showed them
   lodged between the skull and the now solidified embalming fluid. More likely the archaeologist
   Howard Carter, who discovered Tut’s tomb in 1922, damaged the skull while prying away the
   golden mask that was stuck to the skull by solidified resins. The scans also found no mineral
   deposits in the bone, which some poisons would leave behind, though other poisons could not
   be ruled out. The most promising evidence was that one leg had been broken, within days of his
   death judging by the lack of healing. The break was severe enough to cause an open wound, so
   King Tut’s death could have been caused by an infection. A study by an interdisciplinary
   research team suggested that Tut’s overall health was already a liability. By combining CT scans
   with genetic evidence from his and some of his relatives’ mummies, they concluded that he may
   have had multiple disorders, including a weakened immune system, and that he probably needed
   the numerous ornamental canes left in his tomb to walk (Hawass, 2010).

   The single most critical piece of equipment is still the researcher’s own brain. . . . What is
   badly needed now, with all these scanners whirring away, is an understanding of exactly
   what we are observing, and seeing, and measuring, and wondering about.
   —Endel Tulving
   However, researchers sometimes choose the easier approach of simply reporting
   the correlations they found in that one session. In an analysis of 53 studies that
   reported correlations of fMRI activity with social or emotional measures (such
   as distress from social rejection), more than half used the flawed nonindependent
   approach, and they accounted almost entirely for the highest correlations (Vul,
   Harris, Winkielman, & Pashler, 2009; see also the similar results of
   Kriegeskorte, Simmons, Bellgowan, & Baker, 2009). Nikos Logothetis has
   warned that erroneous claims of brain areas specialized for everything from
   empathy to neuroticism are leading to a phrenology that is even more dangerous
   than the 19th-century variety because it is cloaked in the respectability of brain
   imaging (Spinney, 2002).
   Still, these problems do not undermine the potential of imaging studies for
   understanding behavior. The fact that five people won Nobel Prizes for their
   work in developing scanning technology indicates the importance of imaging
   techniques, and you can be sure that many important future developments in
   neuroscience will depend on brain imaging, just as they have for the past 20
   years.
   Research Spotlight: Growing a Model Brain From Skin Cells
   Rene Anand and his team at Ohio State University coaxed stem cells derived from human skin
   cells to develop into a nearly complete human brain comparable to that of a 5-week-old fetus
   (Caldwell, 2015). More appropriately called a brain organoid, it has all the major regions of a
   brain, functioning neurons, glial cells, a retina, and even a spinal cord.
   Recently Jessica Mariani and her colleagues (2015) at Yale University used this strategy in an
   attempt to learn why autism develops in some individuals without a clear genetic cause. To do
   this they focused on a subtype of autism in which individuals have slightly enlarged heads,
   which affects about 20% of those with autism. They cultured stem cells from these autistic
   individuals to grow into organoids and compared them with organoids grown from non-autistic
   biological relatives. The scientists observed that after about a month of development, the
   organoids growing from autistic individuals were overproducing GABA-releasing neurons, due
   to overexpression of the FOXG1 gene. This was the first clear identification of a neural
   mechanism that leads to the development of autism. Although there are still many hurdles
   ahead, having a cellular target during development may lead to earlier identification of factors
   that could result in developmental disorders like autism.
   A deficiency of all these technologies is that they show what the brain is doing at
   the current time. To understand many brain processes and disorders such as
   schizophrenia, we also need to watch the brain as it develops. The accompanying
   Research Spotlight describes an important step in that direction.
   Investigating Heredity
   We looked at the interplay of heredity and environment in shaping behavior in
   Chapter 1. Now we need to understand some of the techniques scientists use to
   do genetic research. The idea that behavior can be inherited is an ancient one,
   but most of the methods for genetic research were introduced or came into
   maturity in the past three or four decades. Until then, the work was not much
   more sophisticated than observing that a characteristic runs in families.
   Genetic Similarities: The Correlational Approach
   In a family study, which determines how strongly a characteristic is shared
   among relatives, we would find that intelligent parents usually have intelligent
   children. However, as one researcher put it, “Cake recipes run in families, but
   not because of genes” (Goodwin, 1986, p. 3). This is a good example of the
   problem with correlational research. People who have similar genes often share a
   similar environment, so the effects of heredity are confounded with the effects of
   environment. Still, the fact that family members are similar in a characteristic
   tells researchers that it would be worthwhile to pursue more complicated and
   costly research strategies. We will look at ways to reduce the confounding of
   heredity with environment, but first we need a way to quantify the results.
   Quantification is a simple matter for characteristics that can be treated as present
   or absent, such as schizophrenia. We can say, for instance, that the rate of
   schizophrenia is about 1% in the general population but increases to around 13%
   among the offspring of a schizophrenic parent (Gottesman, 1991). For variables
   that are measured on a numerical scale, such as height and IQ (intelligence
   quotient, a measure of intelligence), we express the relationship with a statistic
   called the correlation coefficient. Correlation is the degree of relationship
   between two variables, measured on a scale between 0.0 and ±1.0. The
   strength of the relationship is indicated by the absolute value—how close the
   correlation is to either 1.0 or −1.0. A positive correlation means that when one
   variable is high, the other tends to be high as well. For example, the correlation
   between the IQs of parents and their children averages about .42 across studies,
   and the correlation between brothers and sisters in the same family is about .47
   (T. J. Bouchard & McGue, 1981). A negative value indicates the opposite
   tendency—when one value is high, the other tends to be low—not that the
   relationship is weaker. Now we can consider how to separate the effects of
   heredity from those of the environment.
   Adoption studies eliminate much of the confounding of heredity and
   environment that occurs in family studies. Adoption studies compare the
   similarity between adopted children and their biological parents with their
   similarity to their adoptive parents. This kind of study is often called a natural
   experiment, but it lacks the control of a real experiment because we do not
   manipulate the adoption variable. As a result, environmental confounding can
   still occur. For example, families that must be split up by adoption may differ
   from the control families in important ways. Additional confounding occurs
   because children are often adopted into similar family environments and because
   adoption is frequently delayed until after critical developmental periods have
   passed. Nevertheless, the technique has yielded extremely valuable information,
   such as the fact that rearing children apart from their biological parents results in
   a drop in the correlation between their IQs from .42 to about .22 (T. J. Bouchard
   & McGue, 1981). The drop in correlation indicates a substantial influence of
   environment; the remaining correlation indicates genetic influence.
   How are adoption and twin studies superior to family studies?
   An environmental confound that adoption studies don’t control is the prenatal
   environment, which can bring about long-term alterations in nervous system
   functioning. Animal researchers get around this problem by cross-fostering,
   implanting a fetus or an egg into another female. Of course, this strategy is
   unavailable in human research, or at least it was until in vitro fertilization
   became so widespread. British researchers examined the medical records of 800
   children conceived by in vitro fertilization; in one-fourth of the cases, the egg or
   embryo was donated by another woman, so the offspring was unrelated to the
   mother. With this strategy, the researchers were able to conclude that the low
   birth weight previously observed in babies whose mothers smoked during
   pregnancy is environmental, whereas antisocial behavior (tantrums, fighting,
   lying, etc.) in children of smoking mothers has a genetic origin (F. Rice et al.,
   2009).
   Twin studies assess how similar twins are in some characteristic; their similarity
   is then compared with that of nontwin siblings, or the similarity between
   identical twins is compared with the similarity between fraternal twins.
   Remember that fraternal twins are produced from two separately fertilized eggs
   (dizygotic), whereas identical twins result from a single egg that splits and
   develops into two individuals (monozygotic). Fraternal twins, like nontwin
   siblings, share only half their genes with each other; identical twins share 100%
   of their genes. Because both identical twins and fraternal twins share a common
   environment for the most part, a greater similarity between identical twins in a
   characteristic is probably due to their greater genetic similarity. Investigations of
   intelligence provide particularly good examples of the value of twin studies. For
   example, the correlation between fraternal twins’ IQs is about .60, and for
   identical twins it increases to around .86 (T. J. Bouchard & McGue, 1981). (Of
   course, we have to select fraternal pairs that are of the same sex, because
   identical twins are of the same sex.) Criticisms of twin studies include the
   possibility that identical twins might be treated more similarly than fraternal
   twins, and the fact that they usually share the same placenta and sometimes the
   amniotic sac makes their prenatal environment more similar.
   Figure 4.19 The Genain Quadruplets.
   Source: Associated Press.
   A useful measure for identifying genetic influence is concordance rate, the
   frequency with which relatives are alike in a characteristic. An example of
   this measure is that when one fraternal twin is schizophrenic, the second twin
   will also be diagnosed with schizophrenia about 17% of the time; in identical
   twins this measure almost triples, to 48% (Figure 4.19; Gottesman, 1991). But,
   because the correlation falls short of a perfect 1.0, even the identical twin of a
   person with schizophrenia escapes schizophrenia about half of the time; for the
   same reason, identical twins will rarely have exactly the same IQ. The
   incomplete influence of heredity means that environmental effects are also
   operating. Family, adoption, and twin studies are compared in Table 4.2.
   Genetic Engineering: The Experimental Approach
   Although adoption and twin studies reduce confounding, they still share some of
   the disadvantages of correlational studies. Genetic engineering involves
   manipulation of the organism’s genes or their functioning. Studies using this
   technology qualify as experiments. At present, genetic engineering is employed
   mostly with mice, because their genetic makeup is well known and their
   embryos are more successfully manipulated.
   What advantage does genetic engineering have over adoption and twin studies?
   An obvious way to find out what a gene does is to disable it and see what effect
   this has on the animal. In the knockout technique, a nonfunctioning mutation
   is introduced into the isolated gene, and the altered gene is transferred into
   embryos. Subsequent mating of the resulting animals is required to produce
   animals that are homozygous for the gene. Another strategy is to disable the
   gene by interfering with its messenger RNA. The antisense RNA procedure
   blocks the participation of messenger RNA in protein construction. This is
   accomplished by inserting strands of complementary RNA into the animal,
   which dock with the gene’s messenger RNA (Figure 4.20). The cell recognizes
   this newly formed molecule as abnormal and releases an enzyme that destroys
   the RNA.
   In gene transfer, a gene from another organism is inserted into the
   recipient’s cells. An important research tool is the transgenic animal, created by
   inserting the gene into the developing embryo. Again, mating of these animals is
   required to integrate the gene into all the cells. Researchers observe the effects in
   recipient animals to determine the transferred gene’s function. One fascinating
   new way to investigate the connections in the nervous system is Brainbow,
   which is described in the accompanying Research Spotlight.
   Gene therapy, the treatment of disorders by manipulating genes, does not
   allow the luxury of multiple generations to distribute the gene to all the cells.
   Typically the gene is carried into the individual by a vector, most often a
   disabled virus, which is injected directly into the diseased tissue or into the
   bloodstream near the target organ. Alternatively, the possibility of an immune
   response can be reduced by inserting the genes into cells removed from the
   patient’s body, which are then returned to the patient. An adaptation of a strategy
   that bacteria use as a defense against an invading virus is enabling researchers to
   manipulate genes with much more precision. The bacteria send a strand of RNA
   to join with the virus’s DNA; an enzyme then cuts the DNA, disabling the virus.
   The adaptation, known as CRISPR, can be used to delete or disable a defective
   gene or to insert a beneficial gene at the location.
   Figure 4.20 Antisense RNA.
   Research Spotlight: The Brainbow Connection
   Genetic engineering has enabled researchers to develop a major new technique for labeling and
   visualizing neurons, appropriately called Brainbow. Genes that produce phosphorescent proteins
   in three or four colors are inserted into an animal’s genome; these combine in random
   combinations in neurons, labeling individual cells in as many as 100 different hues. Using light
   microscopy, the researcher is able to trace a neuron’s path and view and photograph the
   connectome.
   For more information, Brainbow images, and a related video, visit edge.sagepub.com/garrett5e
   and select the Chapter 4 study resources.
   In spite of some disastrous setbacks along the way, genetic engineering is
   becoming a therapeutic reality. Gene therapy for a type of SCID has just been
   approved by the European Commission after trial patients had a 100 percent
   survival rate, some as long as 13 years following treatment (Nield, 2016). A new
   gene insertion procedure has halted the brain myelin–destroying disease
   adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) in all but one of 17 boys (J. Kaiser, 2016). A
   family’s struggle to save their son from ALD was the subject of the 1992 movie
   Lorenzo’s Oil. Though CRISPR has been used to treat diseases only in animal
   models so far, researchers recently took a major step when they were able to
   replace a blindness-causing gene mutation in stem cells that had been derived
   from a patient who had retinitis pigmentosa. Returning the stem cells to the
   patient might have cured the disease, but human trials have not been approved
   yet (Bassuk, Zheng, Li, Tsang, & Mahajan, 2016). In Chapter 12, you will see
   that doctors are having some success using gene transfer to treat Alzheimer’s
   disease. Although these results are promising, the ability to manipulate our
   genome carries tremendous risks and raises important ethical questions.
   There will be a gene-based treatment for essentially every disease within 50 years.

   Research Ethics
   As important a topic as research ethics is, it usually gets pushed into the
   background by the excitement of scientific accomplishments and therapeutic
   promise. To place ethics at the forefront where it belongs, the major scientific
   and medical organizations have adopted strict guidelines for conducting
   research, for the treatment of subjects, and for communicating the results of
   research (see, for example, American Psychological Association, 2010; “Policies
   on the Use of Animals and Humans in Neuroscience Research,” n.d.; “Public
   Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,” 2015;
   “Research Involving Human Subjects,” n.d.).
   What are the main issues in research integrity?
   Plagiarism and Fabrication
   The success of research in answering questions and solving problems depends
   not only on the researchers’ skill in designing studies and collecting data but also
   on their accuracy and integrity in communicating results. Unfortunately, research
   is sometimes misrepresented intentionally; the two cardinal sins of research are
   plagiarism and the fabrication of data.
   Plagiarism is the theft of another’s work or ideas. Plagiarism denies
   individuals the credit they deserve and erodes trust among the research
   community. The infraction may be as simple as failing to give appropriate credit
   through citations and references (like those you see throughout this text), but
   occasionally a researcher literally steals another’s work. In a recent high-profile
   case, for example, German education minister Annette Schavan resigned after
   the University of Düsseldorf revoked her Ph.D. due to plagiarism. According to
   the university, large parts of her 1980 dissertation were closely paraphrased from
   other sources without crediting those sources (“German Education Minister
   Quits,” 2013).
   Fabrication, or faking, of results is more serious than plagiarism because it
   introduces erroneous information into the body of scientific knowledge. As a
   result, the pursuit of false leads by others consumes scarce resources and
   sidetracks researchers from more fruitful lines of research. More important,
   fabrication in clinical research can slow therapeutic progress and harm lives. In
   1998, Andrew Wakefield published a study implicating a preservative in some
   vaccines as a cause of autism. No one could replicate the results, and later
   investigation revealed numerous instances of data fabrication and
   misrepresentation in the research (Deer, 2011). The article was retracted and
   Wakefield lost his medical license, but the repercussions continue today. Many
   parents have become suspicious of vaccines and are failing to have their children
   immunized. As one result, although measles was declared eliminated from the
   United States in 2000, 1,400 people were infected between 2010 and 2016
   (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016).
   Falsification is far more serious because it always corrupts the scientific record. It is a
   crime against science, indeed a crime against all humanity, when it legitimizes science that
   is false.
   —David Crowe
   Although such cases are rare (E. Marshall, 2000b), they undermine confidence in
   scientific and medical research. Increasingly, concerned government agencies
   are taking steps to educate researchers about research ethics (R. Dalton, 2000),
   setting aside $1 million of grant money to support studies on research integrity
   (E. Marshall, 2000c) and discouraging ties between scientists and the companies
   whose products they are testing (Agnew, 2000). In a fascinating development, a
   social psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania has devised a statistical
   method to detect suspicious patterns in research data. Using this method, he
   accused a psychologist at the University of Rotterdam of data tampering, which
   led to a university investigation, withdrawal of two papers, and the
   psychologist’s resignation (Enserink, 2012).
   Protecting the Welfare of Research Participants
   All the scientific disciplines that use live subjects in their research have adopted
   strict codes for the humane treatment of both humans and animals. The specifics
   of the treatment of human research participants and even the legitimacy of
   animal research are controversial, however. These are not abstract issues. As a
   student, you are a consumer of the knowledge that human and animal research
   produces, and you benefit personally from the medical and psychological
   advances, so you are more than just a neutral observer.
   Research With Humans
   In 1953, the psychologist Albert Ax performed a study that was as significant for
   its ethical implications as for its scientific results. He was attempting to
   determine whether all emotions result in the same general bodily arousal or each
   emotion produces a unique pattern of activation. To do so, he measured several
   physiological variables sensitive to emotional arousal, such as heart rate,
   breathing rate, and skin temperature, while inducing anger in the individuals at
   one time and fear at another. If Ax had told the research participants what would
   happen during the study, it would have altered their behavior, so he said he was
   doing a study of blood pressure.
   What are the principal ethical concerns in human research?
   In the “anger” condition, the research participant was insulted by Ax’s assistant,
   who complained at length that the person was not a very good experimental
   subject. The “fear” situation was more intense. During the recordings, the
   individual received a mild electrical shock through the recording electrodes,
   while sparks jumped from nearby equipment. The experimenter acted alarmed as
   he explained that there was a dangerous high-voltage short circuit. Later
   interviews indicated that both ruses worked. Ax (1953) reported that one
   participant kept pleading during the fear treatment, “Please take the wires off.
   Oh! Please help me.” Another said of the anger treatment, “I was just about to
   punch that character on the nose” (p. 435). You will find the results of Ax’s
   research described in Chapter 8; here we will look at the issues of informed
   consent and deception in relation to his study.
   Occasionally, research involves some pain, discomfort, or even risk. Before
   proceeding with a study, current standards require the researcher to obtain the
   participant’s informed consent. Informed consent means that the individual
   voluntarily agrees to participate after receiving information about any risks,
   discomfort, or other adverse effects that might occur. However, sometimes
   the nature of a study requires the researcher to use deception, failing to tell the
   participants the exact purpose of the research or what will happen during
   the study, or actively misinforming them. According to the American
   Psychological Association (APA), deception is acceptable only when the value
   of the study justifies it, alternative procedures are not available, and the
   individuals are correctly informed afterward. The APA’s guidelines are also clear
   that psychologists should not deceive subjects about research that is reasonably
   expected to cause physical pain or severe emotional distress (American
   Psychological Association, 2010). Some researchers and subjects’ rights
   advocates believe that deception is never justified. Ax’s study would probably
   not be permitted today, but we will see in Chapter 8 that researchers have found
   interesting alternatives for doing this kind of research.
   Research With Animals
   Psychological and medical researchers have perhaps no more important resource
   than the laboratory animal. As the American Medical Association (1992)
   concluded, “Virtually every advance in medical science in the twentieth century,
   from antibiotics and vaccines to anti-depressant drugs and organ transplants, has
   been achieved either directly or indirectly through the use of animals in
   laboratory experiments” (p. 11). Psychologists have used animals to investigate
   behavior, aging, pain, stress, and cognitive functions such as learning and
   perception (D. Blum, 1994; F. A. King, Yarbrough, Anderson, Gordon, & Gould,
   1988; N. F. Miller, 1985). It may seem that the best subjects for that purpose
   would be humans, but animals are useful because they live in a controlled
   environment and have a homogeneous history of experience, as well as a briefer
   development and life span. In addition, researchers feel that it is more ethical to
   use procedures that are painful or physically or psychologically risky on other
   animals than on humans. As a result, in the mid-1980s, U.S. scientists were
   using 20 million animals a year: 90% of them were rodents, mostly mice and
   rats, and around 3.5% were primates, mostly monkeys and chimpanzees (U.S.
   Congress Office of Technology Assessment, 1986).
   What are the opposing views on animal research?
   The preference for inflicting discomfort or danger on nonhuman animals rather
   than on humans is based on the assumption that the well-being of animals is less
   important than that of humans. Animal rights activists have called this dual
   ethical standard speciesism (H. A. Herzog, 1998), a term chosen to be
   intentionally similar to racism. Some activists work hand in hand with
   researchers to improve conditions for research animals; others have been more
   aggressive, breaking into labs, destroying equipment and records, and releasing
   animals (typically resulting in the animals’ death). In Europe and Britain, death
   threats have forced some researchers to move their work behind high fences
   (Koenig, 1999; Schiermeier, 1998). At the University of California at Santa
   Cruz, one animal researcher’s home was firebombed, and another’s car was
   burned (G. Miller, 2008). Activists have been shifting their attacks from
   laboratories to the researchers themselves; since the 1990s, attacks on
   individuals have risen from 9% of incidents to 46% (“Animal Rights Extremists
   Increasingly Targeting Individuals,” 2014).
   Every one has heard of the dog suffering under vivisection, who licked the hand of the
   operator: this man, unless he had a heart of stone, must have felt remorse to the last hour of
   his life.
   —Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, 1871
   Animal research guidelines provide for humane housing of animals, attention to
   their health, and minimization of discomfort and stress during research
   (American Psychological Association, 2010; “Guidelines for Ethical Conduct in
   the Care and Use of Animals,” n.d.; “Policies on the Use of Animals and
   Humans in Neuroscience Research,” n.d.). But critics point out that researchers
   sometimes do not live up to the standards of their professional organizations.
   The Behavioral Biology Center in Silver Spring, Maryland, was engaged in
   research that involved severing the sensory nerve in one arm of monkeys to
   study the reorganization that occurs in the brain. The lab’s contributions drew the
   praise of neuroscientists and led to the design of routines for extensive exercise
   of an afflicted limb to help people recover from brain injuries. But in 1981, a
   student summer employee informed the police of what he considered to be abuse
   of the lab’s animals, and the police carried out the first raid on a research
   laboratory in the United States (“A Brighter Day for Edward Taub,” 1997;
   Orlans, 1993). The director, Edward Taub, was convicted of animal abuse
   because of poor postoperative care, but the conviction was overturned because
   the state lacked jurisdiction over federally supported scientific research. The
   National Institutes of Health withdrew Taub’s funding, and Congress enacted
   more stringent animal protection laws. In spite of the controversy, Taub received
   the William James Award from the American Psychological Society. However,
   he points out that the award was for work that is no longer permitted and that
   animal welfare rules enacted by Congress prevent him from taking
   measurements in the brain of the one remaining monkey for the length of time
   that would be needed.
   The conflict between animal welfare and research needs is obviously not a
   simple issue and is strongly felt on both sides (Figure 4.21). Although
   psychologists and neuroscientists do not condone mistreatment of research
   animals, most of them argue that the distress that does occur is justified by the
   benefits animal research has produced. The 2000 Nobel Prize in physiology or
   medicine was shared by three neuroscientists: Arvid Carlsson, for his discovery
   of the role of dopamine as a neurotransmitter in the brain; Paul Greengard, for
   identifying how dopamine and related neurotransmitters produce their effect on
   neurons; and Eric Kandel, for his work on the molecular changes that occur in
   the brain during learning. The work of all three prize winners relied heavily on
   animal research.
   It is unlikely that animal research will be banned as the more extreme activists
   demand, but animal care and use guidelines have been tightened and outside
   monitoring increased, and states have passed more stringent laws. In addition,
   researchers have become more sensitive to the welfare of animals, adopting
   more humane methods of treatment and turning to tissue cultures and computer
   simulations in place of live animals when possible. In a survey of articles
   published in major biomedical journals between 1970 and 2000, the proportion
   of studies using animal subjects had fallen by one third, and in the studies that
   did use animals, the average number had decreased by half (Carlsson, Hagelin,
   & Hau, 2004). The National Institutes of Health is furthering that trend by
   withdrawing all support from biomedical research on chimpanzees and
   relocating its animals to a retirement colony in Louisiana (National Institutes of
   Health, 2015).
   Figure 4.21 Animal Research Controversy.
   Source: Foundation of Biomedical Research.
   Human research has typically generated less controversy than the use of animals,
   largely because scientists are more restrained in their treatment of humans, and
   humans are able to refuse to participate and to bring lawsuits. The balance of
   concern is shifting, though, particularly as treatments move from the research lab
   to the clinic.
   Gene Therapy
   Gene therapy has enjoyed glowing press reviews because of its potential for
   correcting humanity’s greatest handicaps and deadly diseases. But a distinct chill
   fell over the research in 1999, when Jesse Gelsinger, an 18-year-old patient
   volunteer, became the first human to die as the direct result of gene research
   (Lehrman, 1999; E. Marshall, 2000a). The study was using a deactivated form of
   adenovirus, which causes the common cold, to transport a gene into the liver in
   an experimental attempt to correct a genetic liver enzyme deficiency. Gelsinger
   developed an immune reaction to the adenovirus, which resulted in his death.
   What are the problems with gene research and gene therapy?
   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was overseeing the study,
   reprimanded the researchers for not consulting with the FDA when most of the
   patients developed mild adverse reactions and for not informing the research
   participants that two monkeys had died in an earlier study after receiving much
   larger doses of adenovirus (“U.S. Government Shuts Down Pennsylvania Gene
   Therapy Trials,” 2000). The university was assessed a $1 million fine, and the
   three principal investigators had restrictions placed on their human research until
   2010 (Check, 2004). The case slowed gene therapy research across the country,
   but a positive outcome is that it has led to stricter supervision of human studies.
   There are privacy issues as well, including the potential abuse of information in
   a person’s DNA. In the United States, it is now illegal for insurers and employers
   to discriminate against people based on their DNA (“Genetic Information
   Nondiscrimination Act of 2008,” n.d.). In the United Kingdom it is illegal to
   analyze a person’s DNA without the person’s consent (“Sneaky DNA Analysis to
   Be Outlawed,” 2004). In the United States, 17 states limit nonconsensual
   analysis and 27 limit disclosure without consent (Congressional Research
   Service, 2008). An additional concern is that, because gene therapy is very
   expensive, it is likely to increase inequalities further between the haves and
   have-nots in our society. Some observers worry that its application will not be
   limited to correcting disabilities and disease but will be used to enhance the
   beauty, brawn, and intelligence of the offspring of well-to-do parents. The
   science fiction movie Gattaca (whose title is a play on the four letters of the
   genetic code) depicts a society in which privilege and opportunity are reserved
   for genetically enhanced “superior” individuals. Fortunately, the U.S. Congress
   wisely set aside 5% of the Human Genome Project budget to fund the study of
   the ethical, legal, and social implications of genetic research (Jeffords &
   Daschle, 2001).

   There are more significant concerns that gene manipulation could affect the
   reproductive cells and change the genome of nonconsenting future generations.
   A gene-editing summit called by CRISPR co-discoverer Jennifer Doudna and 17
   other scientists, the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, and several U.S.
   government agencies has urged researchers to forgo gene editing that could
   modify the germ line until its safety and ethical implications can be determined
   (Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, 2015a, 2015b). How many laboratories
   will step back from ongoing projects remains to be seen. In the meantime,
   Chinese scientists have used the CRISPR technique to modify a gene in a human
   embryo (Liang et al., 2015), and a U.K. government agency has given a research
   team in London the go-ahead for a similar project (Joseph, 2016). Most
   countries, however, ban editing embryos for a pregnancy.
   Stem Cell Therapy
   You learned in Chapter 3 that embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated cells that
   have the potential for developing into any other body cell. Stem cells have been
   used successfully to treat spinal cord damage (J. W. McDonald et al., 1999) and
   brain damage (Ren et al., 2000) in rats; they have also tracked down tumors in
   the brains of mice and delivered interleukin 12, making it easier for immune
   cells to kill the tumors (Ehtesham et al., 2002). In humans, heart functioning
   improved in patients with congestive heart failure after injection of stem cells
   (A. N. Patel et al., 2004). Medical researchers hope that stem cells can
   eventually be used to grow human organs in the laboratory to supply organ
   transplants and to allow genetic researchers to watch a gene produce a diseased
   organ rather than working backward from the diseased patient to the gene. An
   estimated 28 million people in the United States alone have diseases that are
   potentially treatable by stem cell therapy (Perry, 2000).
   So if stem cells hold such wonderful potential, why are they being discussed
   under the topic of ethics? Extracting stem cells destroys the embryo, so right-to-
   life advocates oppose this use of human embryos, even though most are “extras”
   resulting from fertility treatment and would otherwise be discarded (Figure
   4.22). Stem cell research was crippled for years in the United States by the
   George W. Bush administration’s refusal to fund research on stem cell lines
   derived from embryos after August 2001; however, the earlier lines were too
   contaminated for human use (M. J. Martin, Muotri, Gage, & Varki, 2005). This
   policy was reversed in 2009 by President Barack Obama and, after a three-year
   court battle, a federal appeals court ruled that government funding of research
   with human embryonic stem cells does not violate existing U.S. law (J. Kaiser,
   2012). Research with embryonic stem cells is still controversial in the United
   States, and future government leaders may slow (or stop) stem cell research;
   further, views differ across the European Union’s 28 member nations as much as
   they do in the United States (Drumi, 2009). Due to this controversy and the
   limited availability of embryonic stem cells, other sources are being sought; for
   example, the stem cells used to treat the heart patients were taken from their own
   bone marrow. Mature cells can be turned into embryonic-like induced
   pluripotent stem cells by increasing the expression of four genes, but only about
   10% of cells are transformed in this procedure. Israeli scientists discovered that
   the protein Mbd3 acts as a brake on reprogramming; by mutating the Mbd3 gene
   or decreasing its expression, they have been able to increase the transformation
   rate to almost 100% (Rais et al., 2013).
   What are the promise and problems associated with stem cell therapy?
   Implementation of gene and stem cell therapies slowed following the Jesse
   Gelsinger case and after three children being treated for SCID developed
   leukemia and one died, apparently because the retrovirus used to transfer the
   gene activated a gene involved in cell proliferation (“Therapy Setback,” 2005).
   Critics suggest that there are unknown dangers as well; for example, sometimes
   stem cells injected into animals have found their way into tissues throughout the
   body, and we don’t know what all the consequences might be. There is no
   question the therapies are becoming safer, but when the implications of research
   are so far-reaching, restraint is as valuable as enthusiasm and commitment.
   Concept Check
   Take a Minute to Check Your Knowledge and Understanding
   What are the effects of dishonesty in research?
   How do researchers justify their use of animals in research?
   What do you think about genetically modifying a nonviable embryo to learn how the gene
   causes a deadly disease? Modifying an embryo to prevent a severe mental deficiency, before
   implanting in the mother? Modifying an embryo to increase the child’s intelligence or athletic
   ability?
   Why is there an ethical issue with human stem cell research? How might it be resolved?
   In Perspective
   Early progress in psychology and in biopsychology relied on the wit and
   perspiration of the pioneering researchers. Now they are aided by sophisticated
   equipment and methods that are escalating discovery at an unprecedented pace
   and taking research into areas that were barely conceivable a few decades ago.
   Knowledge is power, and with power comes responsibility. For the scientists
   who study behavior, that responsibility is to the humans and animals that provide
   the source of our knowledge and to the people who may be healed or harmed by
   the new treatments resulting from research.
   Chapter Summary
   Science, Research, and Theory
   Researchers respect uncertainty but try to reduce it through research and the use of
   theory.
   Of the many research strategies at their disposal, biopsychologists favor the experimental
   approach because of the control it offers and the ability to determine cause and effect.
   Correlational techniques have value as well, particularly when the researcher cannot
   control the situation.
   Research Techniques
   Staining and labeling techniques make neurons more visible, emphasize cell bodies or
   axons, trace pathways to or from a location, and identify active areas or specific
   structures such as receptors.
   Light microscopy is extremely useful, but electron microscopy reveals more detail,
   scanning electron microscopy adds three-dimensionality, and confocal and two-photon
   microscopy produce images at greater depths.
   The EEG sums the neural activity between two electrodes to assess arousal level and
   detect damage and some brain disorders. Event-related potentials measure averaged
   responses to brief stimuli.
   Brain functioning can be studied by observation of brain-damaged individuals, electrical
   and chemical stimulation (using stereotaxic techniques), destruction of neural tissue
   (ablation and lesioning), and microdialysis of brain chemicals.
   Brain imaging using CT and MRI depicts structure, for example, to assess damage,
   whereas PET and fMRI are capable of measuring activity.
   Family studies, adoption studies, and twin studies are correlational strategies for
   investigating heredity. Family studies determine whether a characteristic runs in families,
   while adoption studies assess whether adopted children are more like their adoptive
   parents or their biological parents in a characteristic. Twin studies contrast the similarity
   of fraternal twins with the similarity of identical twins.
   Genetic engineering includes gene transfer and gene-disabling techniques (knockout and
   antisense RNA). Although experimental, it is already showing therapeutic promise.
   Research Ethics
   A major concern in biopsychology is maintaining the integrity of research; plagiarism and
   fabrication of data are particularly serious infractions.
   Both the public and the scientific community are increasingly concerned about protecting
   the welfare of humans and animals in research. The various disciplines have standards for
   subject welfare, but the need for more monitoring and training is evident.
   Stem cell technology is promising for treating brain and spinal cord damage and a variety
   of diseases, but it is controversial because obtaining stem cells often involves destroying
   embryos. Gene therapy also holds much promise, but it has dangers and could be abused.
   Study Resources
   For Further Thought
   Pay close attention as you read through this text, and you will notice that human studies are
   more likely than animal studies to be correlational. Why do you think this is so?
   Genetic engineering is mostly a research technique now. What practical uses can you imagine
   in the future?
   Is it unreasonable coercion (a) to require a student in an introductory psychology course to
   participate in research, (b) to require a student in a research methods course to participate in
   research exercises during the laboratory sessions as a part of the educational experience, or (c)
   to offer money and a month’s housing and meals to a homeless person to participate in a risky
   drug study?
   Do you think the rights of humans and animals are adequately protected in research? Why or
   why not? What do you think would be the effect of eliminating the use of animal subjects?

   Honoré de Balzac (Figure 5.1) wrote a phenomenal 45 novels in 20 years. He
   was aided in his long writing marathons by large amounts of a stimulant drug
   whose effects pleased him so much that he advocated its use to others. However,
   he died at the age of 51 in part because of this unrelenting stimulation. What was
   the powerful drug that contributed both to his success and to his untimely death?
   According to his physician, Balzac died from a heart condition, aggravated by
   “the use or rather the abuse of coffee, to which he had recourse in order to
   counteract man’s natural propensity to sleep” (“French Roast,” 1996, p. 28).

   There is good reason to consider caffeine an addictive drug. Coffee may have
   milder effects than the other drugs coming out of Colombia, but strength of
   effect and illegality are not the criteria for classifying a substance as addictive.
   As you will see, a drug’s effect on the brain is the telling feature, and that is our
   reason for discussing drugs at this particular point: It provides the opportunity to
   tie together our preceding discussions of brain structures and neural (particularly
   synaptic) functioning.
   You illustrious Human Candles . . . who consume your own brilliant selves with the heat
   and light of your minds . . . I have discovered a horrible, rather brutal method that I
   recommend only to men of excessive vigor, men with thick black hair and skin covered with
   liver spots, men with big square hands and with legs shaped like bowling pins.
   —Balzac (1839/1996)
   Psychoactive Drugs
   A drug is a substance that on entering the body changes the body or its
   functioning. Drugs fall into one of two general classes, according to their effect
   on a transmitter system. As we saw in Chapter 2, an agonist mimics or enhances
   the effect of a neurotransmitter. It can accomplish this by having the same effect
   on the receptor as the neurotransmitter, by increasing the transmitter’s effect on
   the receptor, or by blocking the reuptake or the degradation of the transmitter.
   An antagonist may occupy the receptors without activating them, simultaneously
   blocking the transmitter from binding to the receptors. Or it may decrease the
   availability of the neurotransmitter, for example, by reducing its production or its
   release from the presynaptic terminals.
   Psychoactive drugs are those that have psychological effects, such as anxiety
   relief or hallucinations. The focus of this chapter is primarily on abused
   psychoactive drugs, although many of the principles discussed here are
   applicable more generally. We will discuss several psychotherapeutic drugs in
   the chapter on psychological disorders (Chapter 14). The effects of abused drugs
   are extremely varied, but whether they arouse or relax, expand the consciousness
   or dull the senses, addictive drugs produce a sense of pleasure in one form or
   another, at least initially. They also have several other effects in common;
   reviewing those effects will give us the language we need for a discussion of
   how the drugs work.

   Most of the abused drugs produce addiction, which is identified by
   preoccupation with obtaining a drug, compulsive use of the drug in spite of
   adverse consequences, and a high tendency to relapse after quitting. Many
   abused drugs also produce withdrawal reactions. Withdrawal is a negative
   reaction that occurs when drug use is stopped. Withdrawal symptoms are due
   at least in part to the nervous system’s having adapted to the drug’s effects, so
   they are typically the opposite of the effects the drug produces. For example, the
   relaxation, constipation, chills, and positive mood of heroin are replaced by
   agitation, diarrhea, fever, and depression during withdrawal.
   Regular use of most abused drugs results in tolerance, which means that the
   individual becomes less responsive to the drug and requires increasing
   amounts of the drug to produce the same results. Like withdrawal, tolerance
   results from compensatory adaptation in the nervous system, mostly a reduction
   in receptor number or sensitivity. Tolerance is one reason for overdose, because
   tolerance can develop in response to the drug’s pleasurable effects without
   developing in response to others. Thus, if the drug abuser takes larger doses of
   heroin to achieve the original sense of ecstasy while the tendency to produce
   sleep and respiratory arrest are undiminished, overdose is nearly inevitable, and
   the consequences can be deadly.
   Opiates
   The opiates are drugs derived from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum,
   see Figure 5.2). Opiates have a variety of effects: They are analgesic (pain
   relieving) and hypnotic (sleep inducing, which is where it gets its scientific
   name), and they produce a strong euphoria (sense of happiness or ecstasy).
   Their downside is their addictive potential due to the euphoria. Opium has been
   in use since around 5700 BCE (Merlin, 2003). Originally it was eaten, but when
   explorers carried the American Indians’ practice of pipe smoking of tobacco
   back to their native countries, opium users adopted this technique. Morphine was
   extracted from opium poppies at the beginning of the early 1800s and has been
   extremely valuable as a treatment for the pain of surgery, battle wounds, and
   cancer. Heroin was synthesized from morphine in the late 1800s. At the turn of
   the century, it was marketed by the Bayer Drug Company of Germany as an
   over-the-counter analgesic until its dangers were recognized. It is now an illegal
   drug in the United States but is prescribed as a pain reliever in Great Britain and
   is used there and in a few European countries as a replacement drug in addiction
   treatment. Codeine, another ingredient of opium, has been used as a cough
   suppressant, and dilute solutions of opium, in the form of paregoric and
   laudanum (literally, “something to be praised”), were once used to treat diarrhea
   and to alleviate pain; paregoric was even used to quiet fretful children. Morphine
   continues to be used with cancer patients and is showing promise of safe use
   with milder pain in a time-release form that virtually eliminates the risk of
   addiction. Aside from morphine, opiates have mostly been replaced by
   synthetics. These are called opioids, to indicate that they are not derived from
   opium, at least not directly, though the term is increasingly used to include all
   substances that affect the endogenous receptors. Although the synthetic opioids
   are safer, they too are subject to abuse. You probably recognize OxyContin
   because of its reputation for abuse rather than for its pain-relieving ability.
   Do opiates have any legitimate use?
   Heroin is the most notoriously abused opiate, due to its intense effect: a glowing,
   orgasm-like sensation that occurs within seconds, followed by drowsy relaxation
   and contentment. Because heroin is highly soluble in lipids, it passes the blood-
   brain barrier easily; the rapid effect increases its addictive potential. The major
   danger of heroin use comes from overdose—either from the attempt to maintain
   the pleasant effects in the face of increasing tolerance or because the user
   unknowingly obtains the drug in a purer form than usual. In a 33-year study of
   581 male heroin addicts, 49% were dead at the end of the study, with an average
   age at death of 46 years (Hser, Hoffman, Grella, & Anglin, 2001). Nearly a
   fourth of those had died of drug overdoses (mostly from heroin); 19.5% died
   from homicide, suicide, or accident; and 15% died from chronic liver disease.
   Half of the survivors who could be interviewed were still using heroin, and the
   high likelihood of returning to usage even after 5 years or more of abstinence
   suggested to the researchers that heroin addiction may be a lifelong condition.
   Despite the representation of the horrors of heroin withdrawal in movies and on
   the Internet, it is best described as similar to a bad case of flu, so fear of
   withdrawal apparently is not the prime motivator for continued heroin addiction.
   Opioid addiction has become epidemic in the United States, with a two- to
   threefold increase in overdose deaths just between 2010 and 2012 (Rudd et al.,
   2014). The severity of the crisis has led to several corrective measures described
   in the accompanying Application.

   As tolerance to a drug develops, it also becomes associated with the person’s
   drug-taking surroundings and circumstances. This learned or conditioned
   tolerance does not generalize completely to a new setting; when the person buys
   and takes the drug in a different neighborhood, the usual dose can lead to
   overdose (Macrae, Scoles, & Siegel, 1987; Siegel, 1984). Heroin is a particularly
   good example of this situational tolerance effect; an amount of heroin that killed
   32% of rats injected in their customary drug-taking environment killed 64% of
   rats injected in a novel environment (Siegel, Hinson, Krank, & McCully, 1982).
   We saw in Chapter 4 that neuroscientist Candace Pert discovered why opioid
   drugs are so effective as pain relievers: The body has receptors that are specific
   for these drugs, because it manufactures its own endogenous (generated within
   the body) opioids, known as endorphins. One effect of endorphins is pain
   relief, as you will see in Chapter 11. Stimulation of endorphin receptors triggers
   some of the positive effects of opiates; others occur from indirect activation of
   dopamine pathways.
   Depressants
   Depressants are drugs that reduce central nervous system activity. The
   group includes sedative (calming) drugs, anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) drugs,
   and hypnotic drugs. Alcohol, of course, is the most common and is the most
   abused in this class, so we start there.
   What are the uses and dangers of depressant drugs?
   Alcohol
   Ethanol, or alcohol, is a drug fermented from fruits, grains, and other plant
   products; it acts at many brain sites to produce euphoria, anxiety reduction,
   sedation, motor incoordination, and cognitive impairment (Koob & Bloom,
   1988). Alcohol is the oldest of the abused drugs. There is evidence of beer
   making in the mountains of Iran as far back as 3500 BCE (Wilkins & Hill,
   2006), but alcohol consumption likely began when early humans discovered the
   pleasant effects of eating fruit after it had fallen and fermented. Drunkenness
   from this source has even been reported in animals, from elephants to butterflies
   (Dudley, 2002)! Alcohol has historically played a cultural role in celebrations
   and ceremonies, provided a means of achieving religious ecstasy, and, especially
   in primitive societies, permitted socially sanctioned temporary indulgence in
   hostility and sexual misbehavior. In modern societies, controlled group drinking
   has been replaced by uncontrolled individual abuse.
   Application: Government Agencies Act to Curb Overdose Deaths
   Since the year 2004, the number of deaths in the United States due to overdose of prescription
   opioid pain relievers has almost doubled; for heroin the rate has increased fivefold (National
   Institute on Drug Abuse, 2015). One reason for the increase is that taking opioids paradoxically
   increases pain and prolongs it long after the injury has healed and the drug has been
   discontinued; recent work shows that the drugs produce an immune response that generates
   painful inflammatory signals in the spinal cord (P. M. Grace et al., 2016). Drug companies are
   working on formulations that will counteract this effect. But critics have also blamed the U.S.
   Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approving the drugs too readily, as well as physicians’
   willingness to prescribe the drugs, which has closely paralleled the increase in deaths. Under
   pressure from public opinion and from Congress, the FDA (Dennis, 2016), the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the U.S. Department of Justice are overhauling their
   policies. Under this plan, the FDA will improve follow-up regarding safety and effectiveness of
   long-term opioid use; extend training of doctors; obtain outside advice before approving new
   opioid drugs that do not have “abuse deterrent” properties; and encourage development of
   painkillers that are difficult to crush, break, or dissolve (tactics that allow addicts to ingest large
   amounts quickly by injecting or snorting the drug). In addition, the CDC released new
   guidelines in 2016 that discourage primary care physicians from prescribing opioid medications
   for chronic pain (Dowell, Haegerich, & Chou, 2016). Moreover, the Drug Enforcement
   Administration (2016) is reducing manufacturing quotas by 25%–33% for the vast majority of
   all Schedule II opioids in an attempt to minimize the supplies of drugs for diversion and illicit
   use while providing adequate supplies for medical needs.
   Alcohol is valued by moderate users as a social lubricant and as a disinhibitor of
   social constraints, owing largely to its anxiolytic effect. Like many drugs, its
   effects are complex. At low doses, say, a couple of drinks, it turns off the
   inhibition the cortex normally exerts over behavior, resulting in behavioral
   stimulation, but it also has a direct stimulatory effect by increasing dopamine
   release (Hendler, Ramchandani, Gilman, & Hammer, 2013). As intake increases,
   alcohol begins to have a sedative or even hypnotic effect; behavior moves from
   relaxation to sleep or unconsciousness. Later, after the bout of drinking has
   ended, the alcohol is metabolized back to a low blood level and it becomes a
   stimulant again. That is why a few drinks in the evening may help you get to
   sleep at bedtime only to awaken you later in the night. And as discussed in the
   accompanying Application, some individuals have a condition called auto-
   brewery syndrome, in which they improperly metabolize sugar into alcohol,
   appearing to be intoxicated without imbibing alcohol.
   I had booze, and when I was drinking, I felt warm and pretty and loved—at least for a
   while.

   Because it interferes with cognitive and motor functioning as well as judgment,
   alcohol-impaired driving accounts for one third of all U.S. traffic fatalities
   (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2015). In the United States
   and Canada, a person is legally considered too impaired to drive when the blood
   alcohol concentration (BAC) reaches 0.08%. Alcohol is also closely linked with
   violent crime, accounting for an estimated 37% of violent victimizations
   (Greenfeld & Henneberg, 2001). Besides affecting judgment, alcohol reduces the
   anxiety that normally inhibits aggression (Pihl & Peterson, 1993).
   Alcohol carries with it a host of health and behavioral problems. High levels of
   any depressant drug have the potential to shut down the brain stem, resulting in
   coma or death; a BAC of 0.30%–0.40% is life threatening, and BACs over
   0.45% will usually be fatal (“BAC Measurement,” n.d.). A common result of
   chronic alcoholism is cirrhosis of the liver, which in its severest form is fatal. In
   addition, the vitamin B1 deficiency that is associated with chronic alcoholism
   can produce brain damage and Korsakoff syndrome, which involves severe
   memory loss along with sensory and motor impairment (Figure 5.3). Binge
   drinkers are more likely to be impulsive and to have learning and memory
   impairments (Stephens & Duka, 2008). Alcohol is the fifth leading cause of
   premature death and disability globally, and first among people between the ages
   of 15 and 49 (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2016). In the
   United States, the death toll is 88,000 each year (Stahre, Roeber, Kanny, Brewer,
   & Zhang, 2014). Even abstinence can be dangerous for people with alcoholism.
   Alcohol withdrawal involves tremors, anxiety, and mood and sleep disturbances;
   more severe reactions are known as delirium tremens—hallucinations,
   delusions, confusion, and, in extreme cases, seizures and possible death.
   Considering the health risks, violence, and disruption of homes and livelihoods,
   alcohol is more costly to society than any of the illegal drugs. Excessive drinking
   costs the United States $249 billion—about $2.05 per drink—three quarters of it
   resulting from binge drinking (Sacks, Gonzales, Bouchery, Tomedi, & Brewer,
   2015). In view of all the dangers of drinking, it seems amazing now that in 1961
   a speaker at a symposium of psychiatrists and physicians on drinking expressed
   the group’s consensus that “alcohol is the safest, most available tranquilizer we
   have” (“Paean to Nepenthe,” 1961, p. 68).

   and Health, 31, pp. 362–376.
   Alcohol provides a good example of the complex effects that drugs have on
   multiple receptor and neurotransmitter systems. First, it inhibits the release of
   glutamate (Hoffman & Tabakoff, 1993; G. Tsai, Gastfriend, & Coyle, 1995). You
   may remember from Chapter 2, Table 2.2, that glutamate is the most prevalent
   excitatory neurotransmitter. Glutamate reduction produces a sedating effect; then
   there is a compensatory increase in the number of glutamate receptors, which
   probably accounts for the seizures that sometimes occur during withdrawal.
   Alcohol also increases the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the
   most prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter (Wan, Berton, Madamba,
   Francesconi, & Siggins, 1996). The combined effect at these two receptors is
   sedation, anxiety reduction, muscle relaxation, and inhibition of cognitive and
   motor skills. Alcohol also affects opiate receptors (in turn increasing dopamine
   release), serotonin receptors, and cannabinoid receptors, which are also excited
   by marijuana (Julien, 2008); these actions likely account for the pleasurable
   aspects of drinking.
   Application: The Auto-Brewery Syndrome
   The woman insisted she’d had very little to drink, but her BAC was 0.40%, so the policeman
   rushed her to the hospital (LaMotte, 2015). She should have been unconscious or worse, but she
   was only a bit woozy. In later testing with no alcohol, her BAC was double the legal limit at
   9:15 a.m., triple the limit at 6 p.m., and more than four times the limit at 8:30 p.m. She was
   diagnosed with auto-brewery syndrome, also known as gut fermentation syndrome, which is a
   rare condition in which the intestines produce intoxicating levels of ethanol (Doucleff, 2013).
   With only 12 cases reported prior to 1972 (Iwata, 1972), there was skepticism about the
   legitimacy of the diagnosis (Logan & Jones, 2000). However, a recent review of cases has
   linked the symptoms to physiological conditions such as bowel dilation, short bowel syndrome,
   and an overabundance of intestinal yeast (B. T. Welch, Coelho Prabhu, Walkoff, & Trenkner,
   2016). Treatments have included antibiotics, carbohydrate control, and antifungal therapy; the
   woman described above is being treated with antifungal medications and a yeast-free diet with
   no sugar, no alcohol, and low carbohydrates (Herbeck, 2015).
   Figure 5.4 The GABA A Receptor Complex.
   What prenatal effects does alcohol have?
   Alcohol specifically affects the A subtype of GABA receptor. Because the
   GABA A receptor is important in the action of other drugs, we give it special
   attention here. It is actually a receptor complex, composed of five different kinds
   of receptor sites (Figure 5.4). One receptor, of course, responds to GABA. Its
   activation opens the receptor’s chloride channel, and the influx of chloride ions
   hyperpolarizes the neuron. Other receptors in the complex respond to alcohol, to
   barbiturates, and to benzodiazepines; these drugs enhance the binding of GABA
   to its receptor and thus its ability to open the chloride channel. Now you can
   understand why it is so dangerous to mix alcohol with barbiturates or
   benzodiazepines.
   Alcohol passes easily through the placenta, raising the BAC of a fetus to about
   the same level as the mother’s. You saw in Chapter 3 that prenatal exposure to
   alcohol can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS; see Figure 5.5), which is the
   leading cause of intellectual impairment in the Western world (Abel & Sokol,
   1986). Besides being intellectually impaired, FAS children are irritable and have
   trouble maintaining attention. Regular alcohol abuse apparently is not required
   to produce damage. In one study, mothers who had FAS children did not drink
   much more on average than the mothers of normal children, but they did report
   occasional binges of five or more drinks at a time (Streissguth, Barr, Bookstein,
   Sampson, & Olson, 1999). Just having three or more drinks at any one time
   during pregnancy more than doubles the offspring’s risk of a drinking disorder
   during adulthood (Alati et al., 2006). No safe level of alcohol intake during
   pregnancy has been established, so most authorities recommend total abstention.
   (Refer to Figure 3.25 to see the developmental effects of FAS on a mouse brain.)

   Barbiturates and Benzodiazepines
   Like alcohol, barbiturates in small amounts act selectively on higher cortical
   centers, especially those involved in inhibiting behavior; in low doses, they
   produce talkativeness and increased social interaction, and in higher doses,
   they are sedatives and hypnotics. Barbiturates have been used to treat insomnia
   and prevent epileptic seizures, and from 1912 to 1960, they were the drug of
   choice for treating anxiety and insomnia (Julien, 2008). They are not addictive in
   prescribed doses, but tolerance leads the person to increase the dosage, resulting
   in addictive symptoms similar to those of alcoholism. Like alcohol, barbiturates
   act at the GABA A complex, though at the barbiturate receptor, but unlike alcohol
   they can open chloride channels on their own in the absence of GABA. As a
   result, the line between therapeutic and toxic levels is a fine one, and their use
   has been fraught with accidental and intentional overdose (including famous
   cases such as Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, and Jimi Hendrix). As a result,
   barbiturates were mostly replaced by much safer benzodiazepines.
   Benzodiazepines act at the benzodiazepine receptor on the GABAA complex
   to produce anxiety reduction, sedation, and muscle relaxation. They reduce
   anxiety by suppressing activity in the limbic system, a network of structures we
   will consider in more detail in the chapter on emotion (Chapter 8). Their effect in
   the brain stem produces relaxation, while GABA activation in the cortex and
   hippocampus results in confusion and amnesia (Julien, 2008). They are
   considerably safer than barbiturates because they do not open chloride channels
   on their own.
   There are several benzodiazepine drugs, the best known of which are Valium
   (diazepam), Xanax (alprazolam), and Halcion (triazolam). One of the
   benzodiazepines, Rohypnol (roofies or rophies), has gained notoriety as the date
   rape drug. Because benzodiazepines are addictive and can produce mental
   confusion, safer alternatives have replaced them, and new drugs are actively
   being developed.
   Stimulants
   Stimulants activate the central nervous system to produce arousal, increased
   alertness, and elevated mood. They include a wide range of drugs, from the
   legal (caffeine) to the illegal (cocaine), which vary in the degree of risk they
   pose. The greatest danger lies in how they are used.
   Cocaine
   Cocaine, which is extracted from the South American coca plant, produces
   euphoria, decreases appetite, increases alertness, and relieves fatigue. It is
   processed with hydrochloric acid into cocaine hydrochloride, the familiar white
   powder that is usually administered intranasally (“snorted”), or mixed with water
   and injected. Pure cocaine, or freebase, can be extracted from cocaine
   hydrochloride by chemically removing the hydrochloric acid. When freebase is
   smoked, the cocaine enters the bloodstream and reaches the brain rapidly.
   Developed in the 1970s, a simpler chemical procedure yielded crack, which is
   less pure but produces pure cocaine vapor when it is smoked. The low cost of
   crack has spread its use into poor urban communities where users could not
   afford cocaine.
   Cocaine has not always been viewed as a dangerous drug. The coca leaf has
   been chewed by South American Indians for centuries as a means of enduring
   hardship and impoverishment. When cocaine was isolated in 1855, it was
   initially injected as a local anesthetic. It soon found its way into over-the-counter
   medications (Figure 5.6), and from 1886 to 1906, Coca-Cola owed much of its
   refreshment to 60 milligrams of cocaine in every serving (M. S. Gold, 1997).
   Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, championed the use of cocaine,
   giving it to his fiancée, sisters, friends, and colleagues and prescribing it to his
   patients. He even wrote an essay, which he called a “song of praise” to cocaine’s
   virtues as an antidepressant, a fighter of chronic fatigue, and even a treatment for
   morphine addiction. He gave up the use of the drug, both personally and
   professionally, when he realized its dangers (Brecher, 1972). As a result of rising
   cocaine abuse and its links to criminal activity in the United States, Congress in
   1914 enacted the Harrison Narcotics Act, which regulated its sale and use.

   Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine and serotonin at synapses, potentiating
   their effects. Dopamine usually has an inhibitory effect, so cocaine reduces
   activity in much of the brain, as the positron emission tomography (PET) scans
   in Figure 5.7 show (London et al., 1990). Presumably, cocaine produces
   euphoria and excitement because dopamine removes the inhibition the cortex
   usually exerts on lower structures. Reduced cortical activity is typical of drugs
   that produce euphoria, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, amphetamines,
   alcohol, and morphine, although localized activation is often reported in frontal
   areas (R. Z. Goldstein & Volkow, 2002; London et al., 1990). Brain metabolism
   rises briefly during the first week of abstinence but then falls again during
   prolonged withdrawal; however, during craving, activity increases in several
   areas, as we will see later (R. Z. Goldstein & Volkow; S. Grant et al., 1996;
   Volkow et al., 1991, 1999).
   Injection and smoking produce an immediate and intense euphoria, which
   increases the addictive potential of cocaine. After the end of a cocaine binge, the
   user crashes into a state of depression, anxiety, and cocaine craving that
   motivates a cycle of continued use. Withdrawal effects are typically mild,
   involving anxiety, lack of motivation, boredom, and lack of pleasure. Three
   decades ago, addiction was defined in terms of a drug’s ability to produce
   withdrawal, and because cocaine’s withdrawal symptoms are so mild, it was not
   believed to be addictive (Gawin, 1991). As usage increased in the population, we
   learned that cocaine is one of the most addictive of the abused drugs. The
   intensity of the drug’s effect makes treatment for addiction very difficult, and no
   treatment is generally accepted as successful. Complicating rehabilitation is the
   fact that cocaine addicts typically abuse other drugs, and they have a very high
   rate of psychological disorders, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder,
   and posttraumatic stress disorder (Julien, 2008).
   Cocaine provides a good example of selective tolerance: While increasing
   amounts of the drug are required to produce the desired psychological effects,
   the person becomes supersensitive to the effect that produces seizures. It is
   possible that the risks of cocaine relative to other drugs have been
   underestimated. In one study, rats were allowed to press a lever that caused
   heroin or cocaine to be injected into their bloodstream; after 1 month, 90% of
   rats receiving cocaine had died of self-administered overdose, compared with
   36% of rats receiving heroin (Bozarth & Wise, 1985).

   Cocaine users have impairments in memory and in executive functions,
   including impulse control, decision making, and assessment of emotional
   stimuli. These deficits are accompanied by reduced activity in the prefrontal
   cortex (Beveridge, Gill, Hanlon, & Porrino, 2008), and by a loss of gray matter
   in prefrontal and temporal areas during middle age that is almost twice as fast as
   in nonusers (3.1 ml/year versus 1.7 ml/year; Ersche, Jones, Williams, Robbins,
   & Bullmore, 2012). Also, like alcohol, cocaine passes through the placenta
   easily, where it interferes with fetal development. It is difficult to separate the
   effects of abused drugs on a child’s development from the effects of frequently
   co-occurring poverty and neglect, but a Toronto group was able to control
   environmental factors by studying 26 cocaine-exposed children who had been
   adopted. Compared with control children matched for the mother’s IQ and
   socioeconomic status, the cocaine-exposed children had lower IQs, poorer
   language development, and greater distractibility (Nulman et al., 2001). In
   addition, we have evidence from animal studies that prenatal exposure to cocaine
   results in abnormal circuit formation among dopamine neurons (L. B. Jones,
   2000).
   What neurotransmitter system is involved in the effects of all stimulant drugs?
   Amphetamines
   Amphetamines are a group of synthetic drugs that produce euphoria and
   increase confidence and concentration. The group includes amphetamine
   sulfate (marketed as Benzedrine), the three to four times more potent
   dextroamphetamine sulfate (marketed as Dexedrine), and the still more powerful
   methamphetamine (known on the street as meth, speed, crank, and crystal). Like
   cocaine, methamphetamine can be purified to its smokable, freebase form called
   ice. Because they dull the appetite, reduce fatigue, and increase alertness,
   amphetamines have shown up in weight-loss drugs and have been used by truck
   drivers, pilots, soldiers, and students to postpone sleep. They have also been
   used to treat ailments such as narcolepsy, a disorder of uncontrollable daytime
   sleepiness.
   Amphetamines increase the release of norepinephrine and dopamine, and they
   mimic the actions of epinephrine. Increased release of dopamine exhausts the
   store of transmitter in the vesicles, which accounts for the period of depression
   that follows. The effects of amphetamine injection are so similar to those of
   cocaine that individuals cannot tell the difference between the two (Cho, 1990).
   Heavy use can cause hallucinations and delusions of persecution that are so
   similar to the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia that even trained
   professionals cannot recognize the difference (resulting in occasional emergency
   room mistreatment). In laboratory studies, psychotic symptoms develop after
   one to four days of chronic amphetamine administration. In one study, a
   volunteer on amphetamine was convinced that a “giant oscillator” in the ceiling
   was controlling his thoughts. Another believed his ex-wife had hired an assassin
   to kill him and was perturbed when the doctor would not guard the window
   while he stood watch at the door (Griffith, Cavanaugh, Held, & Oates, 1972; S.
   H. Snyder, 1972). After an amphetamine psychosis subsides, the person may be
   left with a permanently increased sensitivity to the drug so that using even a
   small amount years later can revive symptoms (Sato, 1986).
   Safety concerns have been raised in recent years by bath salts, a variety of
   synthetic derivatives of the Catha edulis plant (khat). Chewing khat leaves for
   their stimulant effects is popular in Middle Eastern countries; in the movie
   Captain Phillips, it was the mainstay of the Somali pirates as they held the
   captain of the Maersk Alabama for ransom. Although bath salts produce positive
   effects similar to those of amphetamines, they can also lead to hallucinations,
   delusions, paranoia, anxiety, or depression, as well as impaired memory,
   attention, and concentration; seizures and death have also been reported. As the
   popularity of bath salts has increased, there have been several media reports
   linking them to violent and sometimes bizarre crimes (Dolak, 2012).
   Nicotine
   Nicotine is the primary psychoactive and addictive agent in tobacco.
   Tobacco is ingested by smoking, chewing, or inhaling (as snuff, a finely
   powdered form). Nicotine has an almost unique effect (Schelling, 1992): When
   tobacco is smoked in short puffs, it has a stimulating effect; when inhaled
   deeply, it has a tranquilizing or depressant effect. In large doses, nicotine can
   cause nausea, vomiting, and headaches; in extremely high doses, it is powerful
   enough to produce convulsions and even death in laboratory animals.
   The withdrawal reactions are well known because smokers “quit” so often. The
   most prominent symptoms are nervousness and anxiety, drowsiness,
   lightheadedness, and headaches. The United Kingdom annually observes a “No
   Smoking Day,” similar to the “Great American Smokeout,” in which people
   voluntarily abstain from smoking for a day; apparently as a result of impairment
   from withdrawal symptoms, the number of workplace accidents increases by 7%
   on that day (Waters, Jarvis, & Sutton, 1998). People who try to give up smoking
   are usually able to abstain for a while but then relapse; only about 20% of
   attempts to stop are successful after 2 years. Before bans on public and
   workplace smoking, about 80% of male smokers and two thirds of female
   smokers smoked at least one cigarette per waking hour (Brecher, 1972).
   In part because usage is more continuous with tobacco than with other drugs, the
   health risks are particularly high. The health risks from smoking are not the
   result of nicotine but of some of the 4,000 other compounds present in tobacco
   smoke. For example, a metabolite of benzo-[a]pyrene damages a cancer-
   suppressing gene, resulting in lung cancer (Denissenko, Pao, Tang, & Pfeifer,
   1996). Other cancers resulting from smoking occur in the larynx, mouth,
   esophagus, liver, and pancreas. Smoking can also cause Buerger’s disease,
   constriction of the blood vessels that may lead to gangrene in the lower
   extremities, requiring progressively higher amputations. Although abstinence
   almost guarantees a halt in the disease’s progress, surgeons report that it is not
   uncommon to find a patient smoking in the hospital bed after a second or third
   amputation (Brecher, 1972). Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death,
   accounting for 480,000 premature deaths annually in the United States and 6
   million worldwide; the health and lost-productivity costs in the United States
   add up to $326 billion (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015b).
   Tobacco use is the greatest potentially remediable problem throughout the world.
   —R. Gregory Lande
   Cigarette package warnings aimed at expectant mothers are not just propaganda.
   Infants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy have lower birth weight,
   a higher incidence of asthma, and up to 56% greater mortality (Gilliland, Li, &
   Peters, 2001; Kleinman, Pierre, Madans, Land, & Schramm, 1987; F. Rice et al.,
   2009). One study of 6- to 8-year-old children whose mothers smoked throughout
   pregnancy found reductions in cortical gray matter and overall brain volume,
   cortical thinning in prefrontal areas, and a tendency for depression (El Marroun
   et al., 2013). We cannot be sure from these results alone that maternal smoking
   caused the problems in offspring. In Chapter 4 we described a unique study of
   cross-fostered children that confirmed a causal relationship between maternal
   smoking and low birth weight but determined that the link with conduct disorder
   is genetic (F. Rice et al.). The association with conduct disorder probably arises
   because women with a genetic predisposition for impulse control problems are
   also more likely to smoke. A causal relationship for El Marroun’s findings
   receives some credibility from the fact that children of women who quit smoking
   when they learned they were pregnant were no different from the children of
   nonsmoking mothers (El Marroun et al.), though there may be important genetic
   differences between mothers who were able to give up smoking and those who
   weren’t. These findings illustrate why we shouldn’t be too quick to accept the
   “obvious” interpretation when two variables are correlated.
   How might nicotine affect developing brains?
   As described in Chapter 2, nicotine stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
   In the periphery, it activates muscles and may cause twitching. Centrally, it
   produces increased alertness and faster response to stimulation. Neurons that
   release dopamine contain nicotinic receptors, so they are also activated, resulting
   in a positive mood effect (Svensson, Grenhoff, & Aston-Jones, 1986).
   Caffeine
   Caffeine, the active ingredient in coffee and tea, produces arousal, increased
   alertness, and decreased sleepiness. It is hardly the drug that amphetamine and
   cocaine are, but as you saw in Balzac’s case, it is subject to abuse. It blocks
   receptors for the neuromodulator adenosine, increasing the release of dopamine
   and acetylcholine (Silinsky, 1989; S. H. Snyder, 1997). Because adenosine has
   sedative and depressive effects, blocking its receptors contributes to arousal.
   Withdrawal symptoms include headaches, fatigue, anxiety, shakiness, and
   craving, which last about a week. Withdrawal is not a significant problem,
   because caffeinated beverages are in plentiful supply, but heavy drinkers may
   wake up with a headache just from abstaining overnight. Because 80% of
   Americans drink coffee, researchers at the Mayo Clinic once recommended
   intravenous administration of caffeine to patients recovering from surgery to
   eliminate postoperative withdrawal headaches (“Caffeine Prevents Post-op
   Headaches,” 1996).
   Psychedelics
   Psychedelic drugs are compounds that cause perceptual distortions in the
   user. The term comes from the Greek words psyche (“mind”) and delos
   (“visible”). “Visible mind” refers to the expansion of the senses and the sense of
   increased insight that users of these drugs report. Although the drugs are often
   referred to as hallucinogenic, they are most noted for producing perceptual
   distortions: Light, color, and details are intensified; objects may change shape;
   sounds may evoke visual experiences; and light may produce auditory
   sensations. Psychedelics may affect the perception of time, as well as self-
   perception; the body may seem to float or to change shape, size, or identity.
   These experiences are often accompanied by a sense of ecstasy, which makes
   recreational use of these substances common. Psychedelics fall into three classes
   in terms of their pharmacological effects: serotonin receptor agonists, serotonin
   releasers, and NMDA antagonists.
   The “classic” psychedelics are similar in structure and function to the
   neurotransmitter serotonin (Jacobs, 1987), and they work by stimulating the 5-
   HT 2A serotonin receptor. As you will see in this chapter and in later chapters,
   serotonin has a variety of psychological functions. Typical experiences include
   sensory distortions, such as warping of surfaces, repetitive geometric shapes, and
   intense colors. One of the best-known classic psychedelics, lysergic acid
   diethylamide (LSD), was popularized in the student peace movement of the
   1960s and championed by the psychologist Timothy Leary. Although LSD is
   serotonergic, its ability to stimulate dopamine receptors makes it unusual among
   psychedelics. Other classic psychedelics include psilocybin and psilocin (LSD-
   like drugs from the mushroom Psilocybe mexicana); DMT (a chemical extracted
   from a native flowering vine in the Brazilian Amazon); and mescaline, the active
   ingredient in the “button” on the top of the peyote cactus. Some of these
   psychedelics have been authorized for religious use as protected First
   Amendment religious rights: The Native American Church uses peyote in
   religious ceremonies (Julien, 2008), and DMT-containing tea is permitted in
   several religions originating from Brazil (“Supreme Court Rules . . . ,” 2006).
   The serotonin releasers are referred to as empathogen-enactogens, because they
   produce feelings of openness, euphoria, empathy, and self-awareness.
   Chemically, they are substituted phenethylamines, a class that includes the
   neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Examples are the
   synthetic drugs ecstasy and 2C-B. Ecstasy is the street name of
   methylenedioxymethamphetamine (let’s just call it MDMA!); it is a popular drug
   among young people, especially at dance clubs and “raves.” Structurally similar
   to amphetamine, at low doses it is a psychomotor stimulant that increases energy,
   sociability, and sexual arousal; at higher doses it produces hallucinatory effects
   like serotonergic psychedelics (Liechti & Vollenweider, 2000). What’s worse is
   that high doses are toxic to serotonergic neurons, at least in monkeys (Figure 5.8;
   McCann, Lowe, & Ricaurte, 1997), and it impairs serotonin function in the
   hippocampus even in new users (D. Wagner, Becker, Koester, Gouzoulis-
   Mayfrank, & Daumann, 2013). A meta-analysis of 422 studies showed small but
   persistent effects on cognitive performance, especially memory deficits (Rogers
   et al., 2009). Although health effects are usually minimal, MDMA increases
   heart rate and blood pressure and causes hyperactivity, which leads to numerous
   deaths annually. One bright spot about MDMA is that evidence indicates that the
   drug, coupled with psychotherapy, may be useful for treating posttraumatic
   stress disorder (we will elaborate on this in Chapter 14).

   Central Nervous System,” by U. D. McCann, K. A. Lowe, and G. A.
   Ricaurte, 1997, The Neuroscientist, 3, pp. 399–411.
   NMDA receptor antagonist psychedelics are known as dissociatives, because
   they cause more intense depersonalization and a sense of unreality. For example,
   ketamine produces a feeling of being disconnected from one’s body and the
   environment. A better known dissociative psychedelic is phencyclidine (PCP,
   angel dust, or crystal), which was developed as an anesthetic but abandoned
   because it produced disorientation and hallucinations that were almost
   indistinguishable from the symptoms of schizophrenia (J. B. Murray, 2002). PCP
   increases activity in dopamine pathways and inhibits a subtype of glutamate
   receptors (Carlezon & Wise, 1996; E. D. French, 1994). Research with PCP has
   led scientists and psychologists to revise their theories of schizophrenia (Jentsch
   & Roth, 1999).
   The field has seen a rapid expansion of synthetic or “designer” drugs, which are
   created from chemicals rather than natural ingredients. Synthetic drugs are a
   special problem because the ingredients themselves are often legal and their use
   is disguised, for example, by labeling them as “bath salts” or “plant food” and
   including the warning “not for human consumption.” As lawmakers outlaw these
   drugs, underground chemists simply concoct new ones. Examples of synthetic
   psychedelics include LSD, MDMA, PCP, and 2C variants (including the most
   widely used 2C-B, commonly sold as ecstasy at raves). The organic chemist
   Alexander Shulgin, who discovered the 2C family of phenethylamines, created
   many of these new drugs in the late 20th century. Through his research (mostly
   using himself and his friends as subjects), he described the psychological effects
   of more than 100 different drugs (Shulgin & Shulgin, 1991, 1997).
   Marijuana
   Marijuana is the dried and crushed leaves and flowers of the Indian hemp
   plant, Cannabis sativa (Figure 5.9). The hemp plant was cultivated heavily in
   the United States during World War II as a source of material for making rope,
   and it is still found occasionally growing wild along midwestern roadsides.
   Marijuana is usually smoked but can be mixed in food and eaten. The major
   psychoactive ingredient is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is
   particularly concentrated in the dried resin from the plant, called hashish.
   THC is a cannabinoid, a group of compounds that includes two known
   endogenous cannabinoids, anandamide and 2-arachidonyl glycerol, or 2-AG
   (Devane et al., 1992; di Tomaso, Beltramo, & Piomelli, 1996; Mechoulam et al.,
   1995). Cannabinoid receptors are found on axon terminals; cannabinoids are
   released by postsynaptic neurons and act as retrograde messengers, regulating
   the presynaptic neuron’s release of neurotransmitter (R. I. Wilson & Nicoll,
   2001). The receptors are widely distributed in the brain and spinal cord, which
   probably accounts for the variety of effects that marijuana has on behavior. The
   pleasurable sensation is likely due to the drug’s ability to increase dopamine
   levels (Tanda, Pontieri, & Di Chiara, 1997). Receptors in the frontal cortex
   probably account for impaired cognitive functioning and distortions of time
   sense and sensory perception, receptors in the hippocampus disrupt memory, and
   those in the basal ganglia and cerebellum impair movement and coordination
   (Herkenham, 1992; Howlett et al., 1990; W. Y. Ong & Mackie, 1999). Although
   drugs may reveal a great deal about brain functioning, the pattern of effects they
   produce is usually unlike normal functioning; drugs affect wide areas of the
   brain indiscriminately, whereas normal activation tends to be more discrete and
   localized.

   Marijuana may have a greater impact on users than previously thought. Long-
   term heavy users have various brain anomalies, including reduced volume in the
   hippocampus and amygdala and impaired white matter connectivity in the
   hippocampus and corpus callosum (Yücel et al., 2008; Zalesky et al., 2012).
   These findings are correlational, leaving open the possibility that the deficits
   were preexisting and contributed to excessive marijuana use; however, several
   animal studies have shown that cannabis does have neurotoxic effects on the
   hippocampus (cited in Yücel et al., 2008). Longitudinal studies also get around
   the correlational issue; one study showed that individuals who smoked five
   joints a day had an average 4-point decline in IQ from childhood to young
   adulthood (Fried, Watkinson, James, & Gray, 2002). In another study,
   individuals who used marijuana from their teens to age 38 lost an average of 6
   IQ points (Meier et al., 2012). Abstinence apparently led to recovery of the
   losses in the first study but not in the second, probably due to longer use. In
   addition, the illegality of marijuana led to the development of synthetic
   marijuana, often with life-threatening results. In the summer of 2016, 33
   individuals in Brooklyn were hospitalized after taking a form of synthetic
   marijuana called K2 (Rosenberg & Schweber, 2016).
   There has been much less research on prenatal effects of marijuana, most likely
   because the impairments are not as obvious as those caused by prenatal exposure
   to cocaine and alcohol. Indeed, the studies that have been done found no deficits
   until about 4 years of age. Then, and through adolescence, data reveal behavioral
   problems, including impulsiveness and hyperactivity; decreased performance on
   visual-spatial tasks; and deficits in attention, memory, and language
   comprehension (P. A. Fried, 1995; C.-S. Wu, Jew, & Lu, 2011). These studies
   also suffer from being correlational, but experiments with animals have
   produced similar results.
   Legalization is the major controversy surrounding marijuana; it is a battle that is
   being waged on two very different fronts. Because of the drug’s mild effects,
   many people contend that its use should be unrestricted. Others, citing reports
   that it reduces pain, the nausea of chemotherapy, and the severity of the eye
   disease glaucoma, believe it should be available by a doctor’s prescription. The
   medical claims have been controversial but are gaining acceptance, and both
   public and governmental attitudes are changing, as the accompanying
   Application indicates.
   What are the two controversies about marijuana?
   Another controversy concerns whether marijuana is addictive. The importance of
   this debate is that it requires us to define just what we mean by the term
   addiction. Addiction has traditionally been equated with a drug’s ability to
   produce withdrawal symptoms; because marijuana’s withdrawal symptoms are
   very mild, its compulsive use was attributed to “psychological dependence,” a
   concept also invoked to explain the habitual use of other drugs that do not
   produce dramatic withdrawal symptoms, like nicotine and caffeine. Withdrawal
   symptoms are mild because cannabinoids dissolve in body fats and leave the
   body slowly. However, monkeys will press a lever to inject THC into their
   bloodstream in amounts similar to doses in marijuana smoke inhaled by humans
   (Tanda, Munzar, & Goldberg, 2000). Researchers are reluctant to attribute drug
   self-administration in animals to psychological dependence and usually consider
   it evidence of addiction. Earlier we defined addiction in terms of the drug’s hold
   on the individual, without reference to its ability to produce withdrawal
   symptoms. Next, we examine the reasons for taking this position.
   Application: Changing Attitudes Toward Marijuana
   Although marijuana remains illegal under federal law, the U.S. Department of Justice has not
   been prosecuting medical use in states that have legalized it, or recreational use as long as
   legalizing states maintain strict procedures for the sale of the drug. This reflects changing public
   attitudes toward marijuana as well as a desire to remove the criminal element and reduce
   demand for the more dangerous synthetic marijuana as well as other drugs. Data from the Pew
   Research Center (Geiger, 2016) suggest that a significant majority (57%) of U.S. adults support
   legalization of marijuana, while 37% of adults endorse marijuana remaining illegal. Perhaps not
   surprisingly, young adults have had a large impact on this shift in public perception; 71% of
   millennials support marijuana legalization. The youngest generation may be the most supportive
   of new attitudes toward legalized and medical marijuana, but individuals from Gen X (aged 36–
   51 in 2016) and Baby Boomers (aged 52–70 in 2016) have shown considerable increases as
   well. A majority (57%) of Baby Boomers support marijuana legalization, representing a nearly
   threefold increase from 17% in 1990 (Pew Research Center, 2015). So far, 29 states and
   Washington, D.C., have legalized marijuana for medical purposes, and recreational use has been
   approved in seven of those jurisdictions (“Marijuana Legalized for Fun . . . ,” 2016; Wattles,
   2016). Several other states are considering changes to their laws.

   Concept Check
   Take a Minute to Check Your Knowledge and Understanding
   How does tolerance develop, and how does it increase a drug’s danger?
   Why does alcohol increase the danger of barbiturates?
   How are the effects of amphetamine and cocaine at the synapse alike? How are they different?
   Addiction
   It is an oversimplification to assume that chronic drug use is motivated primarily
   by the pleasurable effects of the drug. In fact, individuals who engage in
   compulsive drug taking often report that they no longer enjoy their drug
   experience. Their casual drug use has progressed into the compulsive disorder of
   addiction. The common belief that addiction is fueled by the drug user’s desire
   to avoid withdrawal symptoms also has several flaws. First, it does not explain
   what motivates the person to use the drug until addiction develops. Second, we
   know that many addicts go through withdrawal fairly regularly to reset their
   tolerance level so they can get by with lower and less costly amounts of the drug.
   Third, it does not explain why many addicts return to a drug after a long period
   of abstinence and long after withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Finally, the
   addictiveness of a drug is unrelated to the severity of withdrawal symptoms
   (Leshner, 1997). Cocaine is a good example of severe addictiveness but mild
   withdrawal, while a number of drugs—including some asthma inhalers, nasal
   decongestants, and drugs for hypertension and angina pain—produce withdrawal
   symptoms but are not addictive (S. E. Hyman & Malenka, 2001).
   Why does the avoidance of withdrawal symptoms fail to explain addiction?
   The Neural Basis of Reward
   Reward refers to the positive effect an object or a condition—such as a drug,
   food, sexual contact, or warmth—has on the user. Reward is accompanied by
   a tendency to repeat the behavior that brought about the reward and, typically, by
   feelings of pleasure. The most important reward circuit is the mesolimbic
   pathway, which consists of dopaminergic neurons originating in the ventral
   tegmental area and connecting to several targets in the limbic system,
   especially the nucleus accumbens (Figure 5.10). Microdialysis studies show
   that natural rewards—food, water, and sexual stimulation—increase dopamine
   levels in the nucleus accumbens of rats (Carelli, 2002; Damsma, Pfaus,
   Wenkstern, & Phillips, 1992). Other structures also participate in reward,
   including the amygdala, the hippocampus, the hypothalamus, and parts of the
   frontal cortex.
   Electrical stimulation affects the same areas (Fibiger, LePiane, Jakubovic, &
   Phillips, 1987). In electrical stimulation of the brain (ESB), animals and,
   sometimes, humans learn to press a lever to deliver mild electrical
   stimulation to brain areas where the stimulation is rewarding. Drugs that
   block dopamine receptors interfere with learning to press a lever to obtain this
   stimulation (Wise, 2004). ESB is thought to reflect “natural” reward processes
   because, for example, effective sites are often in areas where experimenter-
   delivered stimulation evokes eating or sexual activity, and because self-
   stimulation rate in the posterior hypothalamus varies with experimenter-induced
   sexual motivation (Caggiula, 1970). The most sensitive areas are where the
   density of dopaminergic neurons is greatest (D. Corbett & Wise, 1980).
   However, ESB has a much more powerful effect than natural rewards. Animals
   will ignore food and water and tolerate painful shock to stimulate their brains
   with electricity, sometimes pressing a lever thousands of times in an hour. Drugs
   are similarly powerful: Humans will sacrifice their careers, relationships, and
   lives in the interest of acquiring and using drugs. While food and sex increase
   dopamine in the nucleus accumbens by 50%–100%, drugs and electrical
   stimulation can have a three- to sixfold greater effect (A. G. Phillips et al., 1992;
   Wise, 2002).
   The Neural Basis of Addiction
   Rats will learn to press a lever to inject abused drugs into the reward areas
   (Bozarth & Wise, 1984; Hoebel et al., 1983), and lesioning the nucleus
   accumbens reduces reward effects for many drugs (Kelsey, Carlezon, & Falls,
   1989). All abused drugs target the mesolimbic dopamine system and increase
   dopaminergic activity. If dopamine activity is blocked, rats will not learn to press
   a lever for a drug injection, and those that have learned previously will stop lever
   pressing after receiving the dopamine-blocking drug (Wise, 2004). In PET scan
   studies, human volunteers who had the greatest increase in dopamine in the
   general area of the nucleus accumbens during drug administration also
   experienced the most intense “highs” (Volkow, Fowler, & Wang, 2003). In one
   study, participants began reporting that they felt “high” when cocaine had
   blocked 47% of the dopamine reuptake sites in the nucleus accumbens (Volkow
   et al., 1997).
   How is the reward system involved in addiction?
   Figure 5.10 The Mesolimbic and Mesocortical Dopamine Systems.
   Drug researchers have expanded their attention to a broader area, the
   mesolimbocortical dopamine system, which consists of the mesolimbic
   pathway and the mesocortical pathway, dopaminergic neurons which project
   from the ventral tegmental area to several areas in the frontal cortex (see
   Figure 5.10). Through this system, chronic exposure to abused drugs changes the
   brain in several ways (Nestler, 2005). First, baseline levels of dopamine activity
   decrease in the system, resulting in tolerance and a decreased response to normal
   rewarding stimuli (Figure 5.11; Volkow, Fowler, Wang, & Swanson, 2004);
   however, the drug and drug-related stimuli produce greater increases in
   dopamine transmission. This sensitization to the drug and associated stimuli can
   last long after the person stops taking the drug, making the individual prone to
   relapse. Another effect is hypofrontality, reduced activity in several frontal
   regions—prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex—
   which control working memory, attention, behavioral inhibition, and the
   individual’s response to the environment. The impulsivity and compulsivity that
   characterize hypofrontality plus the decreased effectiveness of natural rewards
   refocus the individual’s life on obtaining and taking the drug. Stopping the drug
   activates neurons in the amygdala that mediate fear and other aversive states,
   producing the negative emotions and many of the bodily symptoms that
   characterize withdrawal.
   Although dopamine is the primary transmitter in the reward/addiction circuit, it
   is not the only one. Stimulants and nicotine act directly on dopaminergic neurons
   in the nucleus accumbens, but others increase dopamine transmission indirectly
   —alcohol through GABAergic neurons and opiate-releasing neurons, and
   opiates by stimulating opioid receptors and inhibiting GABAergic neurons.
   Regardless of a drug’s initial effect, the final pathway involves the nucleus
   accumbens and increased dopamine transmission (Lüscher, 2016).
   Drugs of abuse create a signal in the brain that indicates, falsely, the arrival of a huge
   fitness benefit.
   —Randolph Nesse and Kent Berridge
   Brain Plasticity and Learning in Addiction
   Reward is an essential factor in early drug taking, but it does not appear to be
   what maintains long-term drug abuse (Volkow & Fowler, 2000; Wise, 2004).
   Rather, researchers believe that addictive behavior is maintained by learning,
   potentially lifelong changes in brain functioning that are initiated during the
   earlier stages. A key player in this process is glutamate, an excitatory transmitter
   involved in the remodeling of synapses during learning. A single administration
   of cocaine modifies glutamate receptors on dopamine neurons in the ventral
   tegmental area, increasing the effectiveness of glutamate activity for a week
   (Mameli et al., 2009) and sensitizing response to further drug exposure (S. Jones
   & Bonci, 2005). Chronic administration of amphetamine or cocaine leads to
   more enduring neural changes, in the form of increased dendrite length and
   greater synaptic complexity in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex
   (Robinson, Gorny, Mitton, & Kolb, 2001; Robinson & Kolb, 1997).
   It is as if drugs have hijacked the brain’s natural motivational control circuits.
   —Alan Leshner
   The power of drug-induced learning is most obvious in craving, especially in its
   ability to persist years after drug use has ceased. Even viewing drug
   paraphernalia is enough to evoke craving in addicts (Garavan et al., 2000; S.
   Grant et al., 1996; Maas et al., 1998) and often triggers relapse; PET scans show
   that the sight of drug-related stimuli shifts the addict’s typically low brain
   metabolism to hyperactive in areas involved in learning and emotion (Figure
   5.12; R. Z. Goldstein & Volkow, 2002; S. Grant et al., 1996; Volkow, Fowler, &
   Wang, 2004). The hippocampus, which has inputs to the nucleus accumbens, is
   particularly important in learning associations with environmental stimuli like
   those involved in drug taking. After rats have given up pressing a lever because
   the drug delivery mechanism has been disconnected, electrical stimulation of the
   hippocampus results in a 30-minute-long release of dopamine in the nucleus
   accumbens and a return to lever pressing (Vorel, Liu, Hayes, Spector, & Gardner,
   2001).

   An intriguing feature of craving is that it increases progressively over the first
   weeks or months of drug abstinence, a phenomenon referred to as incubation of
   craving (Pickens et al., 2011). Incubation results from a number of factors, but
   changes in inputs to the nucleus accumbens are a good illustration of drug-
   induced plasticity. Over the course of addiction, glutamatergic pathways to the
   nucleus accumbens from the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala develop “silent”
   synapses. The synapses are capable of releasing glutamate, but they lack the
   necessary receptors on the postsynaptic side; during withdrawal, the synapses
   mature and become functional. Unsilencing of these pathways produces craving,
   as evidenced by the rats’ increased drug seeking in the presence of drug-related
   cues (S.-Y. Lee et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2014).
   Treating Drug Addiction
   Synanon, the residential community for the treatment of addictions, supplied its
   residents with all their food, clothing, and other necessities including, until 1970,
   cigarettes—which alone cost $200,000 annually (Brecher, 1972). But then
   Synanon’s founder and head Charles Dederich had a chest X-ray that showed a
   cloudy area in his lungs. He quit smoking and, realizing that residents as young
   as 15 were learning to smoke under his watch, stopped supplying cigarettes and
   banned their use on the premises. Giving up smoking was more difficult for the
   residents than expected. About 100 people left during the first 6 months rather
   than do without cigarettes. Some of the residents who quit smoking noticed that
   they got over withdrawal symptoms from other drugs in less than a week but the
   symptoms from smoking hung around for at least 6 months. As one resident
   said, it was easier to quit heroin than cigarettes.
   The proneness to relapse is based on changes in brain function that continue for months or
   years after the last use of the drug.
   —Charles O’Brien
   The hardest thing I do every day is not take cocaine. You don’t get cured of addiction—
   you’re just in remission.
   —Aaron Sorkin, screenwriter, producer, and playwright
   Freud had a similarly difficult experience (Figure 5.13). He smoked as many as
   20 cigars a day and commented that his passion for smoking interfered with his
   work. Although he quit cocaine with apparent ease, each time he gave up
   smoking he relapsed. He developed cancer of the mouth and jaw, which required
   33 surgeries, but he continued smoking. After replacement of his jaw with an
   artificial one, he was in constant pain and sometimes unable to speak, chew, or
   swallow, but still he smoked. He quit smoking when he died of cancer in 1939
   (Brecher, 1972).
   The first step in quitting drug use is detoxification. This means giving up the
   drug and allowing the body to cleanse itself of the drug residues. This is
   admittedly difficult with nicotine or opiates, but withdrawal from alcohol is
   potentially life threatening; medical intervention with benzodiazepines to
   suppress the withdrawal syndrome may be necessary (C. P. O’Brien, 1997). Still,
   withdrawal is often easier than the subsequent battle against relapse. The addict’s
   impulsiveness, accompanied by atrophy and reduced activity in the orbitofrontal
   cortex, are even more pronounced in those who relapse (Beck et al., 2012; Dom,
   Sabbe, Hulstijn, & van den Brink, 2005), making therapy all the more difficult.
   However, in spite of the challenges, the relapse rate is no higher for drug
   addiction than for other chronic diseases such as hypertension, asthma, and type
   2 diabetes (McLellan, Lewis, O’Brien, & Kleber, 2000). Fortunately, the number
   of treatment options is increasing, reflecting our improving knowledge of how
   addiction works.
   Treatment Strategies
   Agonist treatments replace an addicting drug with another drug that has a
   similar effect; this approach is the most common defense against drug craving
   and relapse. For example, nicotine gum and nicotine patches provide controlled
   amounts of the drug without the dangers of smoking, and their use can be
   reduced systematically over time. Opiate addiction is often treated with a
   synthetic opioid called methadone. This treatment is controversial because it
   substitutes one addiction for another, but methadone is a milder and safer drug
   and the person does not have to resort to crime to satisfy the habit. As a side
   note, methadone was developed in World War II Germany as a pain-relieving
   replacement for morphine, which was not available; it was called adolphine,
   after Adolph Hitler (Bellis, 1981). Addicts who do not benefit from methadone
   are sometimes given pharmaceutical-grade prescription heroin or the synthetic
   pain reliever hydromorphone as a means of deterring street use and criminal
   activity (Oviedo-Joekes et al., 2016).

   Antagonist treatments, as the name implies, involve drugs that block the
   effects of the addicting drug. Drugs that block opiate receptors, such as
   naltrexone, are used to treat opiate addictions and alcoholism because they
   reduce the pleasurable effects of the drug. The potential for this type of treatment
   is illustrated dramatically in Figure 5.14 (Suzdak et al., 1986). However,
   antagonist treatment has a distinct disadvantage compared with agonist
   treatment. Because the treatment offers no replacement for the abused drug’s
   benefit, success depends on the addict’s motivation to quit and willingness to
   comply with treatment. That could be changing as the FDA continues to approve
   medication implants, which last three to six months.
   Other receptor-targeting strategies are in the experimental stage. For example,
   the muscle relaxant baclofen activates GABA B receptors on dopaminergic
   neurons and dampens the reward system (Addolorato et al., 2011; Bock, 2010);
   drugs that enhance activity at glutamate receptors help addicts “unlearn” the
   association between drug-related stimuli and craving (Cleva, Gass, Widholm, &
   Olive, 2010; “Cognitive Enhancement and Relapse Prevention in Cocaine
   Addiction,” 2012). Baclofen is currently undergoing clinical trials. Genetic
   intervention is another possibility for turning down receptor functioning. Rats
   trained to binge drink stopped drinking almost immediately after researchers
   blocked a gene for the GABA A receptor in their amygdalae (J. Liu et al., 2012).
   Rather than blocking the effects of a drug, aversive treatments cause a negative
   reaction when the person takes the drug. For example, Antabuse interferes
   with alcohol metabolism, so drinking alcohol makes the person ill. Similarly,
   adding silver nitrate to chewing gum or lozenges makes tobacco taste bad. As
   with antagonist treatments, success depends on the addict’s motivation and
   treatment compliance.
   All of these approaches have problems: Alcoholics often fail to take Antabuse;
   methadone is itself addictive; naltrexone works with only a subset of addicts;
   and the anti-nicotine drugs Chantix and Zyban have been associated with
   hostility, depression, and suicidal thoughts. An attractive alternative is antidrug
   vaccines. Antidrug vaccines consist of molecules that attach to the drug and
   stimulate the immune system to make antibodies that will degrade the drug.
   These treatments avoid the side effects that occur when receptors in the brain are
   manipulated. Another benefit is that the antibodies are expected to last from
   weeks to years, which means that therapeutic success will not depend on the
   addict’s decision every morning to take an anti-addiction drug. In rats, vaccines
   reduced the amount of cocaine reaching the brain by 80% (Carrera et al., 1995)
   and the amount of nicotine by 65% (Pentel et al., 2000); early human trials
   showed promise as well, but larger, more definitive trials were disappointing
   (Martinez & Trifilieff, 2014). A significant problem with vaccines is that they do
   not reduce craving, and the number of antibodies produced is limited; the addict
   can increase drug intake and continue to get high.
   Several abused drugs produce their own immune response in the brain when glia
   respond by initiating inflammation. Anti-inflammatory treatment is used to ease
   the symptoms of withdrawal but, because inflammation increases the excitability
   of dopaminergic neurons, it also may be effective against the addiction itself.
   Ibudilast, an inhibitor of glial activation, reduces self-administration of alcohol,
   methamphetamine, and opioids in rodents (Jacobsen, Hutchinson, & Mustafa,
   2016), and clinical trials are under way with methamphetamine addiction (“Trial
   of Ibudilast for Methamphetamine Dependence (IBUD ph II),” 2016).
   The number of drugs approved for treating addictions is quite limited, as Table
   5.1 shows. Because addiction is so difficult to treat, researchers must remain
   open to novel approaches. One intriguing new avenue involves disrupting drug-
   related memory. Injecting the memory inhibitor Latrunculin A into the
   amygdalae of rats and mice disrupted their preference for the location where
   methamphetamine had been administered, without affecting other memories
   motivated by food reward or shock (E. J. Young et al., 2014). Another novel
   approach, described in the accompanying In the News feature, is an attempt to
   lessen withdrawal and keep addicts in treatment by applying electrical
   stimulation to the ear.
   Source: National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2014.
   Addiction will eventually be seen as analogous to other medical illnesses—as complex
   constructs of genetic, environmental, and psychosocial factors that require multiple levels
   of intervention for their treatment and prevention.

   In The News: Targeting the Brain to Lessen Drug Withdrawal
   The current opioid epidemic in the United States is a major public safety problem that has law
   enforcement officials stymied. At the same time, it is a health concern that has sent doctors
   scrambling to find more effective treatments. One innovative approach involves reducing opioid
   withdrawal symptoms so that patients are more likely to remain in treatment. Adrian Miranda
   and Arturo Taca (2017) used a neurostimulation device called the BRIDGE, originally
   developed to treat pain, in order to electrically stimulate peripheral nerves in the ear. They
   believed these nerves might feed into brain areas involved in fear and pain and that stimulating
   them could modify the patient’s emotional perceptions during withdrawal. Over the five days
   that opioid-addicted patients wore the BRIDGE, withdrawal symptoms such as sweating,
   tremors, anxiety, and restlessness decreased significantly. This study was an important first step
   in suggesting that noninvasive neurostimulation might promote adherence to opioid treatment.
   Because treatment with the BRIDGE is nonpharmaceutical, it also avoids the controversy about
   replacing one addicting substance with another (as occurs when using methadone as a
   treatment).
   Thought Questions

   Effectiveness and Acceptance of Pharmacological
   Treatment
   Pharmacological intervention increases treatment effectiveness dramatically.
   Methadone combined with counseling produces abstinence rates of 60%–80% in
   heroin addiction, compared with 10%–30% for programs that rely on behavioral
   management alone (Landry, 1997). This is not an argument for pharmacological
   treatment alone. Drug addiction is almost always accompanied by environmental
   problems and emotional issues that must be dealt with, and therapeutic benefits
   are greater when medication is combined with psychosocial support (Strang et
   al., 2012).
   A major difficulty in treating addiction is comorbidity with personality disorders,
   either mental or emotional. This means that drug abusers are likely to have other
   problems that complicate their rehabilitation. In a study of 43,000 people, 18%
   of drug abusers had an anxiety disorder, 20% had a mood disorder (most often
   depression), and 48% had a personality disorder (most often antisocial
   personality disorder) (B. F. Grant et al., 2004a, 2004b). These symptoms could
   be partly a by-product of the ravages of addiction, but drug abuse can also be the
   result of another disorder, for instance, when the person uses drugs as an escape
   or as a way to self-medicate the symptoms. However, it is more likely that the
   addiction and the personality disorder have a common genetic, neurological, or
   environmental cause.
   Science has yet to defeat the mind/body problem—or those who view psychological
   problems as failures of will and values.
   —Maia Szalavitz
   Drug substitution treatment for addiction to heroin and other opioids has the
   strongest evidence of effectiveness (Strang et al., 2012), but giving a drug to
   combat a drug is controversial in some segments of society. Some people believe
   that recovery from addiction should involve the exercise of will and that
   recovery should not be easy. According to this perspective, Antabuse is okay
   because it causes the backslider to suffer, but methadone is not okay because it
   continues the pleasures of drug taking (Szalavitz, 2000). The counterargument is
   that the bottom line in drug treatment is effectiveness. Addiction costs an
   estimated $600 billion each year in the United States alone (National Institute on
   Drug Abuse, 2012). Even when the outcome of treatment is not abstinence, it
   can enable the addict to lead a healthy and productive lifestyle and avoid
   criminal activity. Besides the obvious social and personal benefits, treatment
   saves $7 for every dollar invested (Ettner et al., 2006).

   The Role of Genes in Addiction
   Much of the research on what predisposes a person to addiction has focused on
   alcoholism to the neglect of other drugs. This is understandable, because
   alcoholism is such a pervasive problem in our society. Also, alcoholics are
   readily accessible to researchers because their drug use is legal. We are
   beginning to accumulate the same kind of information for other drugs, but as you
   will see, the study of alcoholism has served as a good model for other addiction
   research.
   Separating Genetic and Environmental Influences
   The heritability of addiction was first established with alcoholism. However, the
   role of heredity in alcoholism was controversial for a long time, because studies
   yielded inconsistent results. One reason for the inconsistency is that researchers
   typically treated alcoholism as a unitary disorder; they would study whatever
   group they had access to, such as hospitalized alcoholics, and generalize to all
   alcoholics. An important breakthrough came when Robert Cloninger and his
   colleagues included in their study all 862 men and 913 women who had been
   adopted by nonrelatives at an early age (average, 4 months) in Stockholm,
   Sweden, between 1930 and 1949 (Bohman, 1978; Cloninger, 1987).
   How do hereditary and environmental contributions differ in the two types of
   alcoholism?
   Cloninger identified two groups of alcoholics. Individuals with Type 1
   alcoholism tended to be cautious and emotionally dependent; their problem
   drinking typically began after the age of 25 and was characterized by periods of
   abstinence followed by binge drinking fraught with guilt. Those with Type 2
   alcoholism began drinking at a young age, drinking frequently and with little
   guilt. They showed signs of antisocial personality disorder: They were
   impulsive, uninhibited, confident, and socially and emotionally detached, and
   they frequently got into bar fights and were arrested for reckless driving. Most of
   them were male, and they made up most of the hospitalized population.
   Later research showed that alcoholics do not always fit neatly into the two
   categories (Wennberg, Berglund, Berggren, Balldin, & Fahlke, 2014), but
   Cloninger produced groundbreaking revelations when he examined the offspring
   of the two groups. Those in the late-onset group were likely to become alcoholic
   only if they were reared in a home where there was alcohol abuse. But for the
   offspring of those with early-onset alcoholism, the rearing environment made no
   difference—evidence of a strong genetic influence that had eluded previous
   researchers. Cloninger highlighted the complexity of heredity and environment
   in addiction. A more recent example comes from research with the Met158 allele
   of the COMT gene. The gene is responsible for an enzyme that metabolizes
   dopamine, and Met158 is associated with an anxious, sensitive, and cautious
   personality. This greater anxiety and cautiousness apparently confers some
   protection from alcoholism in American Plains Indians, but among European
   Caucasian men, who tend to drink socially on a daily basis as a means of
   relaxing, Met158 predisposes them to late-onset alcoholism (Enoch, 2006).
   What Is Inherited?
   Obviously, not everyone who tries a drug becomes addicted; percentages run
   about 4% for inhalants, 9% for marijuana, 15% for alcohol, 17% for cocaine,
   23% for heroin, and 32% for tobacco (Anthony, Warner, & Kessler, 1994).
   About 50% of addiction is due to heredity; the rest is attributable to a host of
   environmental factors, including stress, social pressure, and drug exposure and
   availability (Wang, Kapoor, & Goate, 2012). Genetics research has implicated
   most of the major neurotransmitter systems (D. Dick & Agrawal, 2008), but, for
   obvious reasons, genes that influence activity in the dopamine reward system
   have received the most attention. Kenneth Blum and his colleagues (2017) have
   developed a Genetic Addiction Risk Score based on 11 alleles of 10 genes; these
   alleles reduce activity in the dopamine system and produce a reward deficiency
   syndrome. The amino acid nutrient compound KB220 influences dopamine
   homeostasis mechanisms to increase reward functioning; administering KB220
   has resulted in improvement in prefrontal networks, activation of the nucleus
   accumbens, and reduced drug craving and relapse.
   Genetic influences may increase an individual’s vulnerability or provide
   protection; genes increase or decrease transmitter levels, regulate the number
   and sensitivity of receptors (for both neurotransmitters and the drug itself), and
   control metabolism of the drug. A study of 120,000 coffee drinkers is illustrative.
   The researchers identified eight gene locations that contribute to caffeine
   addiction (Coffee and Caffeine Genetics Consortium et al., 2015); their functions
   range from regulating the activity of dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin, to the
   rapid metabolism of caffeine so that the drinker is ready for another cup sooner.
   Four of the locations had previously been linked to smoking and obesity.
   Together, these gene locations explain only about 1.3% of the variation in
   caffeine intake. This suggests that many more genes are involved in caffeine
   addiction alone, and we can assume the same is true for other forms of
   dependence.
   Whether drug use will lead to addiction depends largely on how the individual
   reacts to the drug. For example, people with a particular allele of the CHRNA5
   acetylcholine receptor gene get a pleasurable rush during early experimentation
   with tobacco and are more likely to become heavy smokers (Sherva et al., 2008).
   An allele of the opioid receptor gene OPRMI confers a similar euphoria from
   drinking and triples the risk of alcohol abuse (L. A. Ray & Hutchison, 2004); the
   risk is quadrupled in people resistant to the negative effects of alcohol (Schuckit,
   1994). Many Asians are protected from alcoholism because they experience
   intense flushing, nausea, and increased heart rate when drinking. This is due to
   excess oxidation of the alcohol to its toxic metabolite, acetaldehyde, or to
   reduced conversion of the acetaldehyde to acetate. Three responsible gene
   variants are prevalent among Asians, and possession of one or more of them
   leads to a four- to ninefold reduction in alcohol dependence (Eng, Luczak, &
   Wall, 2007).
   Impulsiveness, a major characteristic of the “addictive personality,” is about
   49% heritable (D. E. Gustavson, Miyake, Hewitt, & Friedman, 2014), and there
   is evidence linking impulsiveness to functional and structural brain anomalies in
   drug users. For example, individuals with two specific alleles of the GABRA2
   gene, which influences GABA A receptor functioning, are higher in
   impulsiveness and have more symptoms of alcohol dependence (Villafuerte et
   al., 2012). When anticipating a reward or loss, they showed more activity in the
   insular cortex, an area involved in food and drug craving, than did non-addicted
   individuals. People addicted to stimulant drugs have abnormal white fiber
   connectivity in prefrontal areas associated with impulse control, along with gray
   matter increases in temporal lobe areas involved in both addiction and learning
   (Ersche, Jones, Williams, Turton, Robbins, & Bullmore, 2012). The same
   characteristics are also found in non-addicted siblings of addicted individuals,
   which suggests they are genetic in origin and predate the onset of addiction.

   Alcoholics have a diminished P300 (P3) response, which is a dip in the EEG
   event-related potential that occurs about 300 milliseconds after an unexpected
   stimulus (Figure 5.15; Hesselbrock, Begleiter, Porjesz, O’Connor, & Bauer,
   2001; S. Hill, 1995; W. G. Iacono, Carlson, Malone, & McGue, 2002). Reduced
   P3 has an estimated heritability of 64% (Hicks et al., 2007); in boys at age 17 it
   predicts the development of drug abuse disorders by the age of 20 (W. G. Iacono
   et al., 2002). Reduced P3 amplitude is seen in a variety of disorders
   characterized by behavioral disinhibition, the most distinctive characteristic of
   which is impulsivity. These include additional forms of drug abuse, as well as
   childhood conduct disorder and adult antisocial behavior.
   This discussion would be incomplete if we left the impression that the link
   between genes and drug use is unidirectional; drugs also change the way our
   genes function. A recent study of smokers and former smokers found more than
   7,000 genes whose functioning had been modified by the process of methylation
   (Joehanes et al., 2016); methylation is the attachment of a methyl group to
   DNA, which suppresses a gene’s activity. The changes were found most
   reliably on genes associated with smoking-related diseases, including
   cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. Although most of these
   changes had disappeared after five years of nonsmoking, some persisted as long
   as 30 years, which may explain why smoking-related diseases can occur decades
   after a person stops smoking. Even more disturbing is that a mother’s smoking
   has similar effects on the genes of her unborn fetus (Joubert et al., 2016). The
   genes affected are related to lung and nervous system development; smoking-
   related cancers; and birth defects associated with prenatal smoking, such as cleft
   lip and cleft palate.
   Implications of Addiction Research
   The study of drug abuse and addiction has practical societal importance, but it is
   worthwhile for other reasons as well, particularly in shedding light on other
   kinds of vulnerability and principles of behavioral inheritance. For example, the
   fact that genetic and environmental influences operate differently in different
   types of alcoholism and in different cultural settings demonstrates that no
   behavior is simple or simply explained. Even after we understand the relative
   roles of heredity and environment, there is further complexity, because we must
   also understand the mechanisms—the neurotransmitters, receptors, pathways,
   enzymes, and so on. In other words, the causes of addiction, and of behavior in
   general, are many and complex. Finally, we must look beyond simple appeals to
   willpower in explaining the self-defeating behavior of the addict, just as we must
   do when we try to understand other kinds of behavior. Our brief look at
   addiction is a good preparation for our inquiries into the physiological systems
   behind other human behaviors and misbehaviors.

   How did the failure to recognize two types of alcoholism create misunderstandings about
   hereditary and environmental influences and gender distribution in alcoholism?
   How can lowered sensitivity to a drug increase the chances of addiction?
   What are two kinds of evidence that some people are predisposed to alcoholism from birth?
   In Perspective
   The costs of drug abuse include untold suffering; loss of health, productivity, and
   life; and billions of dollars in expenses for treatment and incarceration. The only
   upsides are that the study of drug abuse reveals the workings of the synapses and
   brain networks and helps us recognize that powerful biological forces are
   molding our behavior. This knowledge in turn helps us understand the behaviors
   that are the subject of the remaining chapters, including the disorders covered
   there, and guides research into developing therapeutic drugs.
   Chapter Summary
   Psychoactive Drugs
   Most abused drugs produce addiction, which is usually (but not always) accompanied by
   withdrawal symptoms when drug use is stopped.
   Tolerance can increase the dangers of drugs because tolerance to life-threatening effects
   may not develop.
   The opiates have their own receptors, which are normally stimulated by endorphins.
   The opiates are particularly addictive and dangerous.
   Depressants reduce activity in the nervous system. Some of them have important uses,
   but they are also highly abused.
   Stimulants increase activity in the nervous system. They encompass the widest range of
   effects and include nicotine, most notable for its addictiveness and its association with
   deadly tobacco.
   Psychedelic drugs are interesting for their perceptual/hallucinatory effects, which result
   from their transmitter-like structures.
   Marijuana is controversial not just in terms of the issue of legalization but also because it
   raises questions about what constitutes addiction.
   Addiction
   The mesolimbocortical dopamine system is implicated by several lines of research as a
   reward center that plays a role in drug addiction, feeding, sex, and other behaviors.
   Dopamine may also contribute to addiction through its role in learning by modifying
   neural functioning.
   Treatment of addiction is very difficult; effective programs combine psychological
   support with pharmacological strategies, including agonist, antagonist, and aversive
   treatments and, potentially, drug vaccines and genetic intervention.
   The Role of Genes in Addiction
   Research suggests that addiction is partially hereditary and that the inherited vulnerability
   is not necessarily drug specific.
   Heredity research indicates that there are at least two kinds of alcoholism, with different
   genetic and environmental backgrounds.
   Alcoholics often have dopamine and serotonin irregularities that may account for the
   susceptibility, and some have a deficiency in evoked potentials that appears to be
   inherited.
   Addicts have transmitter and receptor irregularities and structural and functional brain
   anomalies that appear to be genetic in origin.

   For Further Thought
   Is the legality or illegality of a drug a good indication of its potential for abuse?
   Is it morally right to treat addictions with drug antagonists, aversive drugs, and antidrug
   vaccines? Is your opinion the same for drug agonists?
   You work for an agency that has the goal of substantially reducing the rate of drug abuse in
   your state through education, family support, and individualized treatment. Based on your
   knowledge of addiction, what elements should the program include?
   Test Your Understanding
   1. Describe the two proposed roles for dopamine in addiction and give two pieces of evidence for
   each.
   2. What are the practical and ethical considerations in using drugs to treat addiction?
   3. Sally and Sam have alcoholism. Sally seldom drinks but binges when she does and feels guilty
   later. Sam drinks regularly and feels no remorse. What other characteristics would you expect
   to see in each, and what speculations can you make about their environments?
   Select the best answer:
   1. In the study of conditioned tolerance to heroin,
   1. human subjects failed to show the usual withdrawal symptoms.
   2. human subjects increased their drug intake.
   3. rats were unresponsive to the drug.
   4. rats tolerated the drug less in a novel environment.
   2. Withdrawal from alcohol
   1. can be life threatening.
   2. is about like a bad case of flu.
   3. is slightly milder than with most drugs.
   4. is usually barely noticeable.
   3. Alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are deadly when taken together because they
   1. affect the thalamus to produce almost total brain shutdown.
   2. have a cumulative effect on the periaqueductal gray.
   3. affect the same receptor complex.
   4. increase dopamine release to dangerous levels.
   4. Psychedelic drugs often produce hallucinations by
   1. inhibiting serotonin neurons.
   2. stimulating serotonin receptors.
   3. stimulating dopamine receptors.
   4. blocking dopamine reuptake.
   5. Marijuana was the subject of disagreement among researchers because some of them
   1. believed it is more dangerous than alcohol or tobacco.
   2. believed it is highly addictive.
   3. thought it failed to meet the standard test for addictiveness.
   4. overstated its withdrawal effects.
   6. Evidence in the text that addiction does not depend on the drug’s ability to produce withdrawal
   symptoms is that
   1. they never occur together with the same drug.
   2. they are produced in different parts of the brain.
   3. either can be produced without the other in the lab.
   4. addiction occurs in the cortex, but withdrawal occurs in the peripheral nervous system.
   5. the same addictive drug can cause withdrawal in some people, but not others.
   7. When rats trained to press a lever for electrical stimulation of the brain are given a drug that
   blocks dopamine receptors, lever pressing
   1. increases.
   2. decreases.
   3. increases briefly and then decreases.
   4. remains the same.
   8. The best argument that caffeine is an addictive drug like alcohol and nicotine is that
   1. it is used regularly by most of the population.
   2. users progressively increase their intake.
   3. it affects the same processes in the brain.
   4. it stimulates dopamine receptors directly.
   9. The most obvious indication that learning and brain plasticity are involved in addiction is seen
   in
   1. activity increases in the prefrontal cortex.
   2. loss of synapses between the hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens.
   3. craving.
   4. withdrawal.
   10. Agonist treatments for drug addiction
   1. mimic the drug’s effect.
   2. block the drug’s effect.
   3. make the person sick after taking the drug.
   4. reduce anxiety so that there is less need for the drug.
   11. Critics of treating drug addiction with drugs believe that
   1. getting over addiction should not be easy.
   2. drugs like Antabuse are dangerous themselves.
   3. the drugs are not very effective and delay effective treatment.
   4. a and b
   5. b and c
   12. The type of alcoholism in which the individual drinks regularly is associated with
   1. behavioral rigidity.
   2. perfectionism.
   3. feelings of guilt.
   4. antisocial personality disorder.
   13. Alcoholics often
   1. have reduced serotonin and dopamine functioning.
   2. are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol.
   3. are unusually lethargic and use alcohol as a stimulant.
   4. have an inherited preference for the taste of alcohol.

   When Christopher was born, it was obvious there was something wrong (Lyons,
   2001). He was a “floppy baby,” lying with his arms and legs splayed lifelessly
   on the bed, and he didn’t cry. Doctors thought he might never walk or talk, but
   he seemed to progress all right until grade school, when he was diagnosed with
   Prader-Willi syndrome. The disorder occurs when a small section of the father’s
   chromosome 15 fails to transfer during fertilization. The exact contribution of
   those genes is not known, but the symptoms are clearly defined, and Christopher
   had most of them. He stopped growing at 5 feet, 3 inches (1.6 meters), he had
   learning difficulties, and he had difficulty with impulse control.

   —Christopher Theros
   More obviously, Christopher could never seem to recognize when he had eaten
   enough, so he ate constantly. He even stole his brother’s paper-route money to
   buy snacks at the corner store. At school, he would retrieve food from the
   cafeteria garbage can and wolf it down; his classmates would taunt him by
   throwing a piece of food in the trash to watch him dive for it. The only way to
   protect a person like Christopher is to manage his life completely, from locking
   the kitchen to institutionalization. State law did not permit institutionalization for
   Christopher, because his average-level IQ did not fit the criterion for inability to
   manage his affairs. He lived in a series of group homes but was thrown out of
   each one for rebelliousness and violence, behaviors that are characteristic of the
   disorder. When he died at the age of 28, he weighed 500 pounds (227 kg; Figure
   6.1).
   In Chapter 5, we puzzled over why people continue to take drugs that are
   obviously harming them. Now we are forced to wonder why a person would be
   so out of control that he would literally eat himself to death. When we ask why
   people (and animals) do what they do, we are asking about their motivation.

   Motivation and Homeostasis
   Motivation, which literally means “to set in motion,” refers to the set of
   factors that initiate, sustain, and direct behaviors. The need for the concept
   was prompted by psychologists’ inability to explain behavior solely in terms of
   outside stimuli. Assuming various kinds of motivation, such as hunger or
   achievement need, helped make sense of differing responses to the same
   environmental conditions.
   Keep in mind, though, that motivation is a concept psychologists have invented
   and imposed on behavior. We should not expect to find a single “motivation
   center” in the brain or even a network whose primary function is motivation. The
   fact that we sometimes cannot distinguish motivation from other aspects of
   behavior, like emotion, is evidence of how arbitrary the term can be. Still, it is a
   useful concept for organizing ideas about the sources of behavior.
   After a brief overview of some of the ways psychologists have approached the
   problem of motivation, we will take a closer look at temperature regulation,
   thirst, and hunger as examples before taking up the topics of sexual behavior in
   Chapter 7 and emotion and aggression in Chapter 8.
   Theoretical Approaches to Motivation
   Greeks relied heavily on the concept of instinct in their attempts to explain
   human behavior. An instinct is a complex behavior that is automatic,
   unlearned, and unmodifiable, and occurs in all the members of a species
   (Birney & Teevan, 1961). Migration and parental behavior are good examples
   of instinctive behaviors in animals. According to early instinct theorists, humans
   were guided by instincts, too, waging war because of an aggressive instinct,
   caring for their young because of a parental instinct, and so on. At first blush,
   these explanations sound meaningful. But if we say that a person is combative
   because of an aggressive instinct, we know little more about what makes the
   person fight than we did before; if we cannot then analyze the supposed
   aggressive instinct, we have simply dodged the explanation. Contemporary
   students of behavior have used stringent requirements of evidence to identify a
   few instincts in animals, such as homing and flight in birds. But most
   psychologists believe that, in human evolution, instincts have been for the most
   part replaced by learned behaviors.
   Several theories have been proposed as a replacement to instinct. The first, drive
   theory, deals with motivation in terms of needs arising from physical conditions
   such as hunger, thirst, and body temperature. According to drive theory, the
   body maintains a condition of homeostasis, in which any particular system is
   in balance or equilibrium (C. L. Hull, 1951). Any departure from homeostasis,
   such as depletion of nutrients or a drop in temperature, produces an aroused
   condition, or drive, which impels the individual to engage in appropriate action
   such as eating, drinking, or seeking warmth. Incentive theory recognizes that
   people are motivated by external stimuli, not just internal needs (Bolles,
   1975). Incentives can meet a biological need (such as food, clothing, or mates)
   or can be things that are valuable to the individual (such as money or good
   grades). According to the theory, motivation is mostly geared toward seeking
   and acquiring external rewards, or incentives. Then again, sometimes we do
   things without either an obvious drive or an incentive. The first author’s wife
   once jumped out of an airplane for the thrill of plummeting toward the earth,
   only to be saved at the last minute by a flimsy parachute. Observations like this
   have led to the arousal theory, which states that people behave in ways that
   keep them at their preferred level of stimulation (Fiske & Maddi, 1961).
   Different people have different optimum levels of arousal, and some seem to
   have a need for varied experiences or the thrill of confronting danger
   (Zuckerman, 1971). This sensation seeking finds expression in anything from
   travel and unconventional dress to skydiving, drug use, risky behaviors,
   violence, and eating fugu (see Chapter 2). Both of these theories share a common
   neural mechanism of increased release of dopamine in the brain, which can
   result in addiction (see Chapter 5).
   What do homeostasis and drive mean?
   In the face of challenges to drive theory, psychologists have shifted their
   emphasis to drives as states of the brain rather than as conditions of the tissues
   (Stellar & Stellar, 1985). This approach nicely accommodates sexual behavior,
   which troubled drive theorists because it does not involve a tissue deficit. Even
   eating behavior is better understood as the result of a brain state. Hunger
   ordinarily occurs when a lack of nutrients in the body triggers activity in the
   brain. However, an incentive like the smell of a steak on the grill can also cause
   hunger, apparently by activating the same brain mechanisms that tissue deficits
   do. In addition, the person feels satisfied and stops eating long before the
   nutrients have reached the deficient body cells. Similarly, if the brain is not
   “satisfied,” it little matters how much the person has eaten. In other words, if the
   information that reserves are excessive fails to reach the brain or to have its
   usual effect there, the person may, like Christopher, eat to obesity and still feel
   hungry. In the following pages, we will look at the regulation of body
   temperature, fluid levels, and energy supply from the perspective of drive and
   homeostasis.
   Simple Homeostatic Drives
   To sustain life, a number of conditions, such as body temperature, fluid levels,
   and energy reserves, must be held within a fairly narrow range. Accomplishing
   that requires a control system. A mechanical control system that serves as a good
   analogy is a home heating and cooling system. Control systems have a set point,
   which is the point of homeostasis (or equilibrium) to which the system
   returns. For the heating and cooling system, the set point is the temperature
   selected on the thermostat. The result of a departure in the room temperature
   from the set point is analogous to a drive; the thermostat initiates an action,
   turning on the furnace or the air conditioner. Larger deviations from the system’s
   set point trigger stronger drives to return to it. When the room temperature
   returns to the preset range, the system is “satisfied” in the technical sense of the
   word; homeostasis has been achieved, so the system goes into a neutral state
   until there is another departure from the set point.
   Temperature Regulation
   Not only is the regulation of body temperature superficially similar to our
   thermostat analogy; it is almost as simple. All animals have to maintain internal
   temperature within certain limits to survive, and they operate more effectively
   within an even narrower range; this is their set point. How they respond to
   departures from homeostasis is much more variable than with the home heating
   and cooling system, however. Ectothermic animals, such as snakes and lizards,
   are unable to regulate their body temperature internally, so they adjust their
   temperature behaviorally by sunning themselves, finding shade, burrowing in the
   ground, and so on. Endothermic animals, which include mammals and birds, use
   some of the same strategies, such as building nests or houses, moving to warmer
   or cooler areas, and wearing clothing. However, endotherms are also able to use
   their energy reserves to maintain a nearly constant body temperature
   automatically. In hot weather, their temperature regulatory system reduces body
   heat by causing sweating, reduced metabolism, and dilation of peripheral blood
   vessels. In cold weather, it induces shivering, increased metabolism, and
   constriction of the peripheral blood vessels. To say that we make these
   adjustments because we feel hot or cold suggests that the responses are
   intentional behaviors, but, of course, that is not the case. So how do these
   behaviors occur?
   How is body temperature regulated?
   In mammals, the major “thermostat” is located in the preoptic area of the
   hypothalamus, which contains separate warmth-sensitive and cold-sensitive
   cells (Figure 6.2; Nakashima, Pierau, Simon, & Hori, 1987). Some of these
   neurons respond directly to the temperature of the blood flowing through the
   area; others receive input from temperature receptors in other parts of the body,
   including the skin. The preoptic area integrates information from these two
   sources and initiates temperature regulatory responses, such as panting,
   sweating, shivering, increasing or decreasing blood flow to the extremities, and
   building winter fat reserves as insulation against the cold (for a summary, see
   Morrison, 2016). We will be talking about several nuclei in the hypothalamus in
   this chapter, so you may want to refer to Figure 6.2 often.
   Thirst
   The body is about 70% water, so it seems obvious that maintaining water
   balance is critical to life. Water is needed to maintain the cells of the body, to
   keep the blood flowing through the veins and arteries, to transport nutrients, and
   to dispose of waste. You can live for weeks without eating but for only a few
   days without water, in part because of the constant loss through evaporation,
   urination, and defecation. The design of your nose, which could have been just a
   pair of nostrils on your face, is testimonial to the body’s efforts to conserve
   water. As you breathe, you exhale valuable moisture; but as your breath passes
   through the much cooler blood-rich passages of your nose, some of the moisture
   condenses and is reabsorbed. The next time you get a sinus cold that interferes
   with water absorption, you will be surprised by how much water your runny
   nose isn’t recycling.

   central nervous system (3rd Rev. ed.). Berlin, Germany: Springer-Verlag.
   It is also obvious that you drink when your mouth and throat feel dry, but at most
   a dry mouth and throat determine only when you drink, not how much you drink.
   There are two types of thirst generated by a drop in water content, one from
   inside the body’s cells (osmotic) and the other from the blood (hypovolemic).
   Drinking remedies both kinds of deficits, but the fluid levels in the two
   compartments vary independently and so the brain manages them separately.
   Osmotic thirst occurs when the fluid content decreases inside the body’s
   cells. If you eat a salty meal, the excess blood solutes (salt and other dissolved
   substances) contrast with the lower solutes inside the cells. Since water flows
   freely across cell membranes, but solutes do not, water corrects this osmotic
   difference by leaving the cells and flowing into the bloodstream. Hypovolemic
   thirst occurs when the blood volume drops due to a loss of extracellular
   water. This can be due to breathing, sweating, vomiting, urination, defecation,
   or a loss of blood. That is why you might feel thirsty after donating blood,
   exercising, or spending a few hours at the beach. (For relative amounts of water
   loss at rest versus exercise, see Tam & Noakes, 2013, for a review.)
   How does the body regulate its water reserves?
   The reduced water content of cells that contributes to osmotic thirst is
   detected primarily in areas bordering the third ventricle, particularly in the
   organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT; Figure 6.3). Injecting saline
   (salt solution) into the bloodstream draws water out of the cells and induces
   drinking, but this effect is dramatically reduced when the OVLT is damaged
   (Thrasher & Keil, 1987). This is because the OVLT communicates the osmotic
   loss to the median preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which triggers
   thirst.
   Hypovolemia is detected by pressure receptors (baroreceptors) located where the
   large veins connect to the left and right atria of the heart; these receptors increase
   activity when blood pressure rises and decrease when blood pressure falls
   (Fitzsimons & Moore-Gillon, 1980). Information about the reduced blood
   volume that accompanies hypovolemia is conveyed by the vagus nerve to the
   nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) in the medulla. From there, the signal goes to
   the median preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus (Figure 6.3; Stricker & Sved,
   2000).
   Lowered blood volume is also detected by kidney receptors, which trigger the
   release of the hormone renin. Renin then increases production of the hormone
   angiotensin II in the bloodstream. Angiotensin II informs the brain of the drop
   in blood volume. It stimulates the subfornical organ (SFO), a structure
   bordering the third ventricle and one of the few areas not protected by the
   blood-brain barrier (see Figure 6.3). Again, thirst is induced by the nearby
   median preoptic nucleus (Fitzsimons, 1998; Stricker & Sved, 2000). Injecting
   angiotensin into the SFO increases drinking; lesioning the SFO blocks this effect
   but has no effect on thirst in response to osmotic thirst (J. B. Simpson, Epstein,
   & Camardo, 1978).
   Figure 6.3 Thirst Control Signals and Brain Centers.
   So far we’ve been talking about what initiates drinking; we still must ask how
   we know when to stop drinking. Based on what you’ve just learned, you might
   think that we stop drinking when the deficit is eliminated and the initiating
   signals subside. However, that takes 10 to 20 minutes to occur; if we continued
   to drink until the cellular need was satisfied, we’d be in danger of water
   intoxication, which would mean headache, confusion, alterations in behavior and
   personality, and possibly death. So how do we explain satiety, the satisfaction
   of appetite? Like humans, dogs drink an amount of water according to their
   cellular need and then stop (reviewed in G. Fink, Pfaff, & Levine, 2012). They
   will continue to drink this way even when a tube in the stomach allows the water
   to drain out as quickly as it is ingested, so we can rule out the intestines as the
   source of the stop signal. Injecting water directly into the stomach doesn’t inhibit
   drinking, so the stomach isn’t involved, either. Researchers concluded that the
   act of drinking somehow signals the brain about the intake of water; recent
   studies with mice revealed what that neural mechanism is (Zimmerman et al.,
   2016). The SFO not only assesses the fluid levels of the body but also anticipates
   the consequences of a water meal on those water reserves. Drinking inhibits
   thirst-activating neurons in the SFO, with activity beginning to decline with the
   very first lick of water. Cool water is more effective than warm water; salty
   water inhibits the SFO as much as pure water, but this is reversed about a minute
   later as receptors detect the water’s concentration.

   How do temperature regulation and thirst qualify as homeostatic drives?
   Receptors are able to do their jobs because they are specialized for specific types of stimuli.
   What are the specializations of the receptors we have seen so far?
   Hunger: A Complex Drive
   Although hunger can be described in terms of drive and homeostasis just like
   temperature regulation and thirst, the differences almost overshadow the
   similarities. Hunger is more complicated in a variety of ways. Eating provides
   energy for activity, fuel for maintaining body temperature, and materials needed
   for growth and repair of the tissues. In addition, the set point is so variable that
   you might think there is none. This is not surprising, because the demands on our
   resources change with exercise, stress, growth, and so on. A changing set point is
   not unique to hunger, of course. For example, our temperature set point changes
   daily, decreasing during our normal sleep period (even if we fly to Europe and
   are awake during normal sleep time). It also increases during illness to produce a
   fever to kill invading bacteria. What is unusual about hunger is that the set point
   can undergo dramatic and prolonged shifts, for instance, in obesity.
   Another difference is that the needs in temperature regulation and thirst are
   unitary, whereas hunger involves the need for a variety of different and specific
   kinds of nutrients. Making choices about what foods to eat can be more difficult
   than knowing when to eat and when to stop eating.
   You are what you eat.
   —popular adage
   Gustation: The Role of Taste
   Selecting the right foods is no problem for some animals. Some herbivores
   (plant-eating animals) can get all the nutrients they need from a single source;
   koalas, for instance, eat only eucalyptus leaves, and giant pandas eat nothing but
   the shoots of the bamboo plant. Carnivores (meat eaters) also have it rather easy;
   they achieve a balanced diet because their prey eats a balanced diet. We are
   omnivores; we are able to get the nutrients we need from a variety of plants and
   animals. Being able to eat almost anything is liberating but simultaneously a
   burden: We must distinguish among foods that may be nutritious, non-nutritious,
   or toxic, and we must vary our diet among several sources to meet all our
   nutritional requirements. Choosing the right foods and in the right amounts can
   be a real challenge.
   It is possible that you plan your diet around nutritional guidelines, but probably
   you rely more on what you learned at the family table about which foods and
   what combinations of foods make an “appropriate” meal in your culture. Have
   you ever wondered where these traditions came from, or why they survive when
   each new generation seems to delight in defying society’s other customs? Long
   before humans understood the need for vitamins, minerals, proteins, and
   carbohydrates, your ancestors were using a “wisdom of the body” to choose a
   reasonably balanced diet that ensured their survival and your existence. That
   wisdom is reflected in cultural food traditions, which usually provide a balanced
   diet (Rozin, 1976), sometimes by dictating unattractive (to us) choices such as
   grub worms or cow’s blood. As you will see, the internal forces that guide our
   selection of a balanced diet are more automatic than the term choice usually
   suggests, but they are also subtle and easily overcome by the allure of modern
   processed foods, which emphasize taste over nutrition.
   The simplest form of dietary selection involves distinguishing between foods
   that are safe and nutritious and those that are either useless or dangerous. This is
   where the sense of taste comes in. In humans, all taste experience is the result of
   just five taste sensations: sour, sweet, bitter, salty, and the more recently
   discovered umami (Kurihara & Kashiwayanagi, 1998). The first four need no
   explanation; umami is often described as “meaty” or “savory.” These five
   sensations are called primaries; more complex taste sensations are made up of
   combinations of the primaries. There may be other taste primaries; recent
   research, for example, has found evidence that we can distinguish the taste of
   starches (Lapis, Penner, & Lim, 2016) and fats (Besnard, Passily-Degrace, &
   Khan, 2016).
   It is easy to see why we have evolved taste receptors with these particular
   sensitivities, because they correspond closely to our dietary needs. We will
   readily eat foods that are sweet, which include fruits and carbohydrates. We also
   prefer foods that are a bit salty; salt provides the sodium and chloride ions
   needed for cellular functioning and for neural transmission. Mountain gorillas
   get 95% of their sodium by eating decaying wood—while avoiding similar wood
   with lower sodium content (Rothman, Van Soest, & Pell, 2006). Umami
   receptors aid in our selection of proteins. One type responds to amino acids, and
   two respond to glutamate (Chaudhari, Pereira, & Roper, 2009), which is found in
   meats, cheese, and soy products (as well as in the flavor enhancer monosodium
   glutamate). Just as we are attracted to useful foods by taste, we avoid others.
   Overly sour foods are likely to be spoiled, and bitter foods are likely to be toxic.
   You do not have to understand these relationships, much less think about them;
   they operate quietly, in the neural background.
   Taste receptors are located on taste buds, which in turn are found on the surface
   of papillae; papillae are small bumps on the tongue and elsewhere in the mouth
   (Figure 6.4). Taste neurons travel through the thalamus to the insula, the primary
   gustatory (taste) area in the frontal lobes. But on their way, they pass through the
   NST in the medulla, which we saw in Figure 6.3 in relation to drinking and will
   soon see plays an important role in feeding behavior. Back in Chapter 2, you saw
   research indicating that taste neurons encode different taste stimuli in unique
   time patterns of impulses, but there is another, more important, way the system
   informs the brain of what we are tasting. Each of the primary taste stimuli is
   detected by receptors that are specialized for that stimulus; information from the
   different receptors travels to the brain via separate pathways to distinct areas in
   the insular cortex (Figure 6.5; X. Chen, Gabitto, Peng, Ryba, & Zuker, 2011;
   Schoenfeld et al., 2004). You will see in later chapters that other sensory systems
   exploit this labeled line coding of stimuli and that the brain combines primary
   sensations into more complex sensory experiences.

   Besides the nutritional and safety benefits we have already mentioned, the taste
   sense contributes to dietary selection in three additional ways: sensory-specific
   satiety, learned taste aversion, and learned taste preferences.
   In what ways does taste contribute to selection of a proper diet?
   Sensory-Specific Satiety: Varying the Choices
   When Bob Garrett was a youngster, a neighbor child joined the family for lunch.
   At the end of the meal, she enjoyed a bowl of homemade apple cobbler, then
   another, and another. Halfway through the third serving, she observed in
   puzzlement that the last serving wasn’t nearly as good as the first. Barbara and
   Edmund Rolls call this experience sensory-specific satiety. Sensory-specific
   satiety means that the more of a particular food an individual eats, the less
   appealing the food becomes. Humans rate a food less favorably after they have
   consumed it, and they eat more if they are offered a variety of foods instead of a
   single food (Rolls, Rolls, Rowe, & Sweeney, 1981).
   The effect sounds trivial, but it is not; sensory-specific satiety is the brain’s way
   of encouraging you to vary your food choices, which is necessary for a balanced
   diet. Back in the 1920s, Clara Davis (1928) allowed three newly weaned infants
   to choose all their meals from a tray of about 20 healthy foods. They usually
   selected only two or three foods at one meal and continued choosing the same
   foods for about a week. Then they would switch to another two or three foods
   for a similar period. Their self-selected diet was adequate to prevent any
   deficiencies from developing over a period of six months. By the way, the “taste
   map” you’ve almost certainly seen suggesting that different tastes are detected at
   different locations on the tongue is a myth. It resulted from Harvard psychologist
   Edward G. Boring’s misinterpretation of a 1901 German study that then became
   a part of scientific folklore.
   Figure 6.5 Localization of Taste Responses in the Cortex.
   Source: From “Functional Magnetic Resonance Tomography Correlates of
   Taste Perception in the Human Primary Taste Cortex,” by M. A. Schoenfeld
   et al., 2004, Neuroscience, 127, pp. 347–353. Used with permission from
   Elsevier.
   Sensory-specific satiety takes place in the NST. Place a little glucose (one of the
   sugars) on a rat’s tongue, and it produces a neural response there. But if glucose
   is injected into the rat’s bloodstream first, sugar placed on the tongue has less
   effect in the NST (Giza, Scott, & Vanderweele, 1992). The brain automatically
   motivates the rat—or you—to switch to a new flavor and a different nutrient.
   Learned Taste Aversion: Avoiding Dangerous Foods
   Learned taste aversion, the avoidance of foods associated with illness or poor
   nutrition, was discovered when researchers were studying bait shyness in
   rats. Farmers know that if they put out poisoned bait in the barn, they will kill a
   few rats at first but the surviving rats will soon start avoiding the bait (thus the
   term bait shyness). Rats eat small amounts of a new food; a poison will more
   likely make them ill instead of killing them, and they will avoid that food in the
   future. Learned aversion is studied in the laboratory by giving rats a specific
   food and then making them nauseous with a chemical like lithium chloride or
   with a dose of X-ray radiation. Later they refuse to eat that food.
   Learned taste aversion helps wild animals and primitive-living humans avoid
   dangerous foods (see the accompanying Application). Modern-living humans
   experience learned taste aversions, too. In a study of people with strong
   aversions to particular foods, 89% could remember getting sick after eating the
   food, most often between the ages of 6 and 12 (Garb & Stunkard, 1974).
   However, in civilized settings, learned aversions have little value in identifying
   dangerous foods. Instead, we usually get sick following a meal because we left
   the food out of the refrigerator too long or because we happened to come down
   with stomach flu. Learned taste aversion appears to be one reason chemotherapy
   patients lose their appetite. Among children who were given a uniquely flavored
   ice cream before a chemo session, 79% later refused that flavor, compared with
   33% of children receiving chemotherapy without the ice cream; the effect was
   just as strong four months later (I. L. Bernstein, 1978).
   Learned taste aversion may not be very useful to modern humans for avoiding
   dangerous foods, but it may help us avoid non-nutritious ones. When rats are fed
   a diet that is deficient in a particular nutrient, such as thiamine (vitamin B), they
   start showing an aversion to their food; they eat less of it, and they spill the food
   from its container in spite of indications they are hungry, like chewing on the
   wire sides of their cage (Rozin, 1967). Even after recovery from the deficit, the
   rats prefer to go hungry rather than eat the previously deficient food. But
   aversion to a nutrient-deficient food is just the first step toward selecting a
   nutritious diet.
   Learned Taste Preferences: Selecting Nutritious Foods
   Although rats, and presumably humans, can detect salt, sugars, and fat directly
   by their taste (A. T. Beck & Galef, 1989), they must learn to select the foods
   containing other necessary nutrients. This apparently requires the development
   of a learned taste preference, which is a preference not for the nutrient itself
   but for the flavor of a food that contains the nutrient. In an early study, rats
   were fed a diet deficient in one of three vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, or
   pyridoxine); later they learned to prefer a food enriched with that vitamin, which
   was flavored distinctively by adding anise (which tastes like licorice). When the
   anise was switched to the vitamin-deficient food, the rats began eating that food
   instead (E. M. Scott & Verney, 1947). This type of learning requires pairing of a
   taste with some benefit, such as recovery from a dietary deficiency, and usually
   requires constant pairing over a period of several days (T. R. Scott, 2011). A
   diet-deficient rat enhances its chances of learning which foods are beneficial by
   eating a single food at a time (Rozin, 1969). (Notice how similar this is to the
   sampling behavior of Davis’s infants who were allowed to choose their own
   food.)
   Application: Predator Control Through Learned Taste Aversion
   Source: © Janet Haas/Rainbow.
   The principles of classical conditioning and learned taste aversion have been put to practical use
   in an unlikely context: predator control. As a novel and humane (compared with extermination)
   means of controlling the frequency of wolves and coyotes killing sheep, Carl Gustavson and
   colleagues fed captive predators sheep carcasses laced with lithium chloride (see the photo),
   which made them sick. When they were placed in a pen with sheep, the wolves and coyotes then
   avoided the sheep instead of attacking them. One coyote threw up just from smelling a lamb,
   and two hesitant wolves were chased away by a lamb that turned on them (Gustavson, Garcia,
   Hankins, & Rusiniak, 1974; Gustavson, Kelly, Sweeney, & Garcia, 1976). In a three-year study
   on 10 ranches in Saskatchewan, coyote predation of sheep decreased 87% (Gustavson, Jowsey,
   & Milligan, 1982). These interventions also have benefits for conservation efforts since other
   endangered species (e.g., California condors, black-footed ferrets) are spared the traditional uses
   of traps and poisons that are intended for predators but sometimes kill other animals.
   How much humans are able to make use of these abilities is unclear; certainly
   we often choose an unhealthy diet over a healthy one. These bad selections may
   not be due so much to a lack of ability to make good choices as they are to the
   distraction of tasty, high-calorie foods that are not found in nature. Even rats
   have trouble selecting the foods that are good for them when the competing
   foods are flavored with cinnamon or cocoa (A. T. Beck & Galef, 1989), and they
   become obese when they are offered human junk food (Rolls, Rowe, & Turner,
   1980). Wisdom of the body is inadequate in the face of the temptation of French
   fries and ice cream.
   Now a caveat: You have most likely read that taste is largely a matter of smell,
   and perhaps even tested the idea by holding your nose while tasting familiar
   foods. In this context, it is important to distinguish between taste, which is the
   experience you get from your taste receptors, and flavor, which depends on a
   combination of taste and smell. Smell does have a significant effect; how much
   depends on the specific food and, to our knowledge, has never actually been
   quantified (in spite of authoritative-sounding statements to the contrary). We will
   take up the topic of the sense of smell in Chapter 7.
   Digestion and the Two Phases of Metabolism
   What happens during the absorptive and fasting phases?
   Here we confront the inadequacy in our thermostat analogy again. To maintain
   consistent temperature, the thermostat calls on the furnace to cycle on and off
   frequently. Some species of animals do behave like the home furnace; they have
   to eat steadily, with only brief pauses, to provide the constant supply of nutrients
   the body needs. Humans do not; we eat a few discrete meals and fast in between.
   Eating discrete meals leaves us free to do other things with our time, but it
   requires a complex system for storing nutrient reserves, allocating the reserves
   during the fasting periods, and monitoring the reserves to determine the timing
   and size of the next meal.
   Figure 6.6 The Digestive System.
   The Digestive Process
   Digestion begins in the mouth, where food is ground fine and mixed with saliva.
   Saliva provides lubrication and contains an enzyme that starts the breakdown of
   food. Digestion proceeds in the stomach as food is mixed with the gastric juices
   hydrochloric acid and pepsin. The partially processed food is then released
   gradually so that the small intestine has time to do its job. (Figure 6.6 shows the
   organs of the digestive system.)
   The stomach provides another opportunity for screening toxic or spoiled food
   that gets past the taste test. If the food irritates the stomach lining sufficiently,
   the stomach responds by regurgitating the meal. Some toxins don’t irritate the
   stomach, and they make their way into the bloodstream. If so, a part of the brain
   often takes care of this problem; the area postrema is one of the places in the
   brain that is outside the blood-brain barrier, so toxins can activate it to
   induce vomiting. The result can be surprisingly forceful; projectile vomiting
   usually means that you’ve got hold of something really bad. On the other hand,
   college students have been known to incorporate this adaptive response into a
   drinking game called “boot tag,” the details of which I will leave to your
   imagination.
   Digestion occurs primarily in the small intestine, particularly the initial 25 cm
   of the small intestine called the duodenum. There food is broken down into
   usable forms. Carbohydrates are metabolized into simple sugars,
   particularly glucose. Proteins are converted to amino acids. Fats are
   transformed into fatty acids and glycerol, either in the intestine or in the liver.
   The products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal wall into the blood
   and transported to the liver via the hepatic portal vein. Digestion requires the
   food to be in a semiliquid mix, and the body can ill afford to give up the fluid;
   the large intestine’s primary job is absorbing the excess water.
   This process is under the control of the autonomic nervous system, so digestion
   is affected by stress or excitement, as you probably well know. If too much acid
   is secreted into the stomach, you’ll take your course exam with an upset
   stomach. If food moves too slowly through the system, constipation will be the
   result. Too fast, and there isn’t time to remove the excess water, so you may be
   asking to leave the room in the middle of your exam to go to the bathroom.
   Because diarrhea causes the body to lose water, you may have to drink more
   liquids to avoid dehydration. You also lose electrolytes, compounds that provide
   the ions your neurons and other cells need, which is why your doctor may
   recommend a sports drink as the replacement liquid.
   Figure 6.7 Summary of the Absorptive and Fasting Phases.
   The Absorptive Phase
   The feeding cycle is divided into two phases, the absorptive phase and the
   fasting phase. For a few hours following a meal, the body lives off the
   nutrients arriving from the digestive system; this period is called the
   absorptive phase. Following a meal, the blood level of glucose, our primary
   source of energy, rises. The brain detects the increased glucose and shifts the
   autonomic system from predominantly sympathetic activation to predominantly
   parasympathetic activity. As a result, the pancreas starts secreting insulin, a
   hormone that enables body cells to take up glucose for energy and certain
   cells to store excess nutrients. (Actually, because of conditioning, just the sight
   and smell of food is enough to trigger insulin secretion, increased salivation, and
   release of digestive fluids into the stomach. Remember the incentive theory?)
   The cells contain insulin receptors, which activate transporters that carry glucose
   into the cells. Diabetes results when the pancreas is unable to produce
   enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or the body’s tissues are relatively
   unresponsive to insulin (type 2 diabetes). The diabetic’s blood contains plenty
   of glucose following a meal, but due to insulin resistance, the cells of the body
   are unable to make use of it and the diabetic is chronically hungry.
   During the absorptive phase, the body is also busy storing some of the nutrients
   as a hedge against the upcoming period of fasting. Some of the glucose is
   converted into glycogen and stored in a short-term reservoir in the liver and
   surrounding the muscles. Any remaining glucose is converted into fats and
   stored in fat cells, also known as adipose tissue. Fats arriving directly from the
   digestive system are stored there as well. Storage of both glucose and fat is
   under the control of insulin. After a small proportion of amino acids is used to
   construct proteins and peptides needed by the body, the rest is converted to fats
   and stored.
   The Fasting Phase
   Eventually the glucose level in the blood drops. Now the body must fall back
   on its energy stores, which is why this is called the fasting phase. The
   autonomic system shifts to sympathetic activity. The pancreas ceases secretion of
   insulin and starts secreting the hormone glucagon, which causes the liver to
   transform stored glycogen back into glucose. Because the insulin level is low
   now, this glucose is available only to the nervous system. To meet the rest of the
   body’s needs, glucagon triggers the breakdown of stored fat into fatty acids and
   glycerol. The fatty acids are used by the muscles and organs, while the liver
   converts glycerol to more glucose for the brain. During starvation, muscle
   proteins can be broken down again into amino acids, which are converted into
   glucose by the liver. The two phases of metabolism are summarized in Figure
   6.7.
   The oscillations of eating and fasting and the shifts in metabolism that
   accompany them are orchestrated for the most part by two particularly important
   areas in the hypothalamus. The lateral hypothalamus initiates eating and
   controls several aspects of feeding behavior as well as metabolic responses.
   It controls chewing and swallowing through its brainstem connections;
   salivation, acid secretion, and insulin production through autonomic pathways in
   the medulla and spinal cord; and cortical arousal, which likely increases
   locomotion and the possibility of encountering food (Currie & Coscina, 1996;
   Saper, Chou, & Elmquist, 2002; Willie, Chemelli, Sinton, & Yanagisawa, 2001).
   The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) initiates eating, though less effectively
   than the lateral hypothalamus, and regulates metabolic processes such as
   body temperature, fat storage, and cellular metabolism (Broberger &
   Hökfelt, 2001; Sawchenko, 1998). You can see where these structures are
   located in the brain in Figure 6.8, which we will refer to throughout this
   discussion.

   nucleus; CCK = cholecystokinin.
   Figures Brought to Life
   After the body has lived for a few hours off of its stores, the falling level of
   nutrients signals the brain that it is time to eat again. However, by then you
   probably have already headed for lunch, cued by the clock rather than a brain
   center. In the modern, highly structured world, physiological motivations have
   been so incorporated into social customs that it is difficult to tell where the
   influence of one leaves off and the other begins. We will turn the power of
   research to answering the questions “What makes a person eat?” “How does a
   person know when to stop eating?” and “How does a person regulate weight?”
   As you will learn, the answers are not simple ones; even what you see here will
   be an abbreviated treatment.
   Signals That Start a Meal
   When we ask students in class what being hungry means, the favorite answer is
   that their stomach feels empty. Your stomach often does feel empty when you
   are hungry, but we don’t eat to satisfy the stomach. The stomach is not even
   necessary for hunger to occur; people who have had their stomach removed
   because of cancer still report feeling hungry and still eat much as everybody
   else, though they have to take smaller meals (Ingelfinger, 1944). So what does
   make us feel hungry?
   What stimuli initiate eating?
   There are three major signals for hunger. One tells the brain of a low supply of
   glucose, or glucoprivic hunger; the second indicates a deficit in fatty acids, or
   lipoprivic hunger; and the third does informs us that the stomach’s store of
   nutrients has been depleted. The liver monitors the glucose level and the fatty
   acids in the blood passing to it from the small intestine via the hepatic portal
   vein. As you can see in Figure 6.8 (#1), signals of glucose and fatty acid are
   carried by the vagus nerve from the liver to the NST in the medulla. Blocking
   the metabolism of fatty acids or creating a glucose deficit (by displacing it in the
   cells with 2-deoxyglucose, or 2-DG) causes an animal to start eating and to eat
   more than control animals. Lesioning the NST eliminates both of these
   increases; if the vagus nerve is cut, blocking fatty acids no longer increases
   feeding, nor does injection of 2-DG in amounts that are effective with intact
   control animals (S. Ritter & Taylor, 1990). Larger amounts of 2-DG do increase
   feeding in vagotomized animals, after a delay of about an hour (Novin,
   VanderWeele, & Rezek, 1973; S. Ritter & Taylor); apparently the larger dosage
   depletes glucose in the brain, which has glucose receptors in the hypothalamus
   and the brain stem, including in the NST (Marty, Dallaporta, & Thorens, 2007).

   Circuitries Regulating Food Intake,” by C. Broberger and T. Hokfelt, 2001,
   Physiology and Behavior, 74, p. 670. Used with permission from Elsevier.
   The hypothalamus is the master regulator of the energy system. Information
   about glucose and fatty acid levels is relayed from the NST to the arcuate
   nucleus, a vital hypothalamic structure for monitoring the body’s nutrient
   condition (see Figures 6.2, 6.8, and 6.9; Saper et al., 2002; Sawchenko, 1998).
   The arcuate nucleus sends neurons to the PVN and the lateral hypothalamus to
   regulate both feeding and metabolism.
   The third major signal for hunger is ghrelin, a hormone that is synthesized in
   the stomach and released into the bloodstream as the stomach empties
   during fasting. Circulating ghrelin reaches the arcuate nucleus because it passes
   readily through the blood-brain barrier (Broberger & Hökfelt, 2001). Injecting
   ghrelin into rats’ ventricles caused them to eat more and to gain weight four
   times faster than rats injected with saline (Kamegai et al., 2001). In humans,
   ghrelin levels in the blood rose almost 80% before each meal and dropped
   sharply after eating (Figure 6.10; Cummings et al., 2001). Ghrelin may account
   for the uncontrollable appetite of people like Christopher; ghrelin levels are 2.5
   times higher in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome than in lean controls and
   4.5 times higher than the depressed levels found in equally obese individuals
   without the syndrome (Cummings et al., 2002).

   All three of these hunger signals exert their influence through NPY/AgRP
   neurons in the arcuate nucleus; these neurons release neuropeptide Y (NPY) and
   agouti-related protein (AgRP), both of which excite neurons in the PVN and
   the lateral hypothalamus to increase eating and reduce metabolism (see
   Figure 6.8, #3; Horvath & Diano, 2004; Kamegai et al., 2001). Rats that receive
   NPY injections in the paraventricular nucleus double their rate of eating and
   increase their rate of weight gain sixfold (B. G. Stanley, Kyrkouli, Lampert, &
   Leibowitz, 1986). They are so motivated for food that they will tolerate shock to
   the tongue to drink milk and they will drink milk adulterated with bitter quinine
   (Flood & Morley, 1991). The fact that their weight gain is three times greater
   than their increase in food intake attests to NPY’s ability to reduce metabolism.
   During extreme deprivation, NPY conserves energy further by reducing body
   temperature (Billington & Levine, 1992) and suppressing sexual motivation (J.
   T. Clark, Kalra, & Kalra, 1985). If you think about it, sexual activity is a
   particularly unnecessary luxury during food shortage because it expends energy
   and produces offspring that compete for the limited resources.
   Signals That End a Meal
   Just as with drinking, there must be a satiety mechanism that ends a meal well
   before nutrients reach the tissues. It might seem obvious that we stop eating
   when we feel “full,” and that answer is partly right. R. J. Phillips and Powley
   (1996) used a small inflatable cuff to close the connection between the stomach
   and intestines of rats. Infusing glucose into the stomach reduced the amount of
   food the rats ate later, but saline had just as much effect as glucose; this meant
   that, in the stomach, volume and not nutrient value is important. Distension of
   the stomach activates stretch receptors that send a signal by way of the vagus
   nerve to the NST (see Figure 6.8, #4; Broberger & Hökfelt, 2001; B. R. Olson et
   al., 1993).
   What stimuli terminate eating?
   But a full stomach cannot produce long-term satiation by itself; otherwise,
   drinking water would satisfy us. Humans and other animals also adjust the
   amount of food they eat according to the food’s nutritional value. To a small
   extent, this involves oral factors and learning. A high-calorie soup produces a
   greater reduction in hunger if it is drunk than if it is infused into the stomach,
   and high-calorie drinks are more satisfying than noncaloric drinks (S. E. French
   & Cecil, 2001).
   Optimal satiation, however, requires the interaction of mouth, stomach, and
   intestinal factors. When R. J. Phillips and Powley (1996) opened the cuff so that
   the stomach’s contents could flow into the intestines, nutrient value did make a
   difference in the amount of food consumed in a subsequent 30-minute feeding
   period. Glucose reduced subsequent eating more than saline did, and higher
   concentrations of the glucose had a greater effect (Figure 6.11). The stomach and
   intestines respond to food by releasing peptides, which the brain uses to monitor
   nutrients. About a dozen different peptides have this function; different peptides
   are released in response to carbohydrates, fats, proteins, or mixtures of these
   nutrients. They induce the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder to secrete the
   appropriate enzymes into the duodenum to digest the specific nutrient, and at
   least some of them inform the brain as to which nutrient needs are being met (S.
   C. Woods, 2004), via either the vagus nerve or the bloodstream.
   Figure 6.11 Effect of Nutrient Concentration on Later Meal Size.

   Inhibits Food Intake,” by R. J. Phillips and T. L. Powley, American Journal
   of Physiology, 271, pp. R766–R799. © 1996 American Physiological
   Society. Used with permission.
   The best known of these satiety signals is cholecystokinin (CCK), a peptide
   hormone released as food passes into the duodenum. CCK detects fats and
   causes the gallbladder to inject bile into the duodenum; the bile breaks down
   the fat so that it can be absorbed. When researchers injected CCK into the
   bloodstream of obese humans, they ate less at the next meal (Pi-Sunyer,
   Kissileff, Thornton, & Smith, 1982). CCK stimulates receptors on the vagus
   nerve; as Figure 6.8 (#5) indicates, the vagus conveys the signal to the NST, and
   from there it passes to the hypothalamus (S. C. Woods, 2004).
   However, don’t look for CCK to appear on the market as a weight loss drug.
   Although rats given CCK eat smaller meals, they eat more often and maintain
   their weight (West, Fey, & Woods, 1984). This means that CCK’s role is limited
   to meal size; there must be other controls that exert a more long-term effect.
   Long-Term Controls
   Another appetite-suppressing peptide hormone released in the intestines in
   response to food is peptide YY3–36 (PYY). PYY is carried by the bloodstream
   to the arcuate nucleus, where it inhibits the NPY-releasing neurons (see Figure
   6.8, #6; Batterham et al., 2002). Unlike CCK, PYY’s nonneural route to the
   brain means that its action is too slow to limit the current meal; instead, it
   decreases caloric intake by about a third over the following 12 hours.
   What are the signals for controlling body weight?
   Over longer periods, humans and animals regulate their eating behavior by
   monitoring their body weight or, more precisely, their body fat. But how they
   sense their fat level has not always been clear. In 1952, G. R. Hervey surgically
   joined pairs of rats so that they shared a very small amount of blood circulation;
   animals joined like this are called parabiotic. Then Hervey operated on one
   member of each pair to destroy the ventromedial hypothalamus. This surgery
   increases parasympathetic activity in the vagus nerve and enhances insulin
   release (Weingarten, Chang, & McDonald, 1985). This creates a persistent
   absorptive phase in which most incoming nutrients are stored rather than being
   available for use; as a result, the animal has to overeat to maintain a normal
   energy level. The rat becomes obese, sometimes tripling its weight (Figure 6.12).
   Hervey’s lesioned rats overate and became obese as expected, but their pairmates
   began to undereat and lose weight. In fact, in two of the pairs the lean rat starved
   to death. The message was clear: The obese rat was producing a blood-borne
   signal that suppressed eating in the other rat, a signal to which the brain-
   damaged obese rat was insensitive.
   What that signal was remained a mystery until a half-century later, when
   researchers discovered that fat cells secrete a hormone called leptin that
   inhibits eating. The amount of leptin in the blood is proportional to body fat; it
   is about four times higher in obese than non-obese individuals (Considine et al.,
   1996). Like cholecystokinin, leptin helps regulate meal size, but it does so in
   response to the long-term stores of fat rather than to the nutrients contained in
   the meal.
   Figure 6.12 A Rat With Lesioned Ventromedial Hypothalamus.
   Source: Neal Miller, Yale University.
   Insulin levels also are proportional to the size of fat reserves (M. W. Schwartz &
   Seeley, 1997) and provide a similar function. Together, leptin and insulin put the
   brakes on feeding in the arcuate nucleus, by inhibiting NPY/AgRP neurons
   (Berthoud & Morrison, 2008) and activating POMC neurons (which release
   proopiomelanocortin). POMC neurons then reduce feeding by inhibiting neurons
   in the PVN and lateral hypothalamus (see Figure 6.8, #7 and #8; Elmquist, 2001;
   Gao & Horvath, 2007; M. W. Schwartz & Morton, 2002). We now understand
   that when Hervey destroyed the ventromedial hypothalamus in rats, he also
   severed fibers passing through it and disconnected the arcuate nucleus from the
   PVN (see Figure 6.2 again to see how this could happen).
   An additional contributor to the control of feeding and body weight is orexin, a
   neuropeptide that increases appetite and induces eating. Some researchers
   prefer to use the alternate term, hypocretin, but because the name orexin is
   derived from orexis, the Greek word for “appetite,” it seems more appropriate
   here. Orexin is released when leptin or glucose is low and when ghrelin is high
   (Sakurai, 2007; Tsujino & Sakurai, 2009); thus, orexin is a hybrid that responds
   to both short-term and long-term indicators of nutrient reserves. Orexin-releasing
   neurons are located in the lateral hypothalamus; they project to the arcuate
   nucleus, where they increase feeding by activating NPY neurons and inhibiting
   POMC neurons.
   Table 6.1 summarizes the factors that influence hunger and feeding that we have
   just covered, and the accompanying Research Spotlight makes the point that
   these pathways respond to more than just energy needs.
   Until now, we have been considering the ideal situation, the regulation of
   feeding and weight when all goes well. But in many cases, people eat too much,
   they eat the wrong kinds of foods, or they eat too little. As we will see, these
   behaviors are not just personal preferences or inconvenient quirks of behavior;
   too often, they are health-threatening disorders.

   Obesity
   Between 1975 and 2014, the worldwide obesity rate doubled in men and tripled
   in women (Figure 6.13; NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, 2016). The number of
   people who are overfed and overweight now exceeds the number who are
   hungry and underweight, leading the World Health Organization to declare
   obesity a global epidemic. In developed countries the picture is staggering. In the
   United States, for example, the obesity rate is 38% for adults, 21% among
   adolescents, and 17% for children (Flegal, Kruszon-Moran, Carroll, Fryar, &
   Ogden, 2016; C. L. Ogden et al., 2016). There are many causes of obesity, but an
   abundance of food has also been accompanied by the availability of high-calorie
   junk food. Although the percentage of underweight people has decreased
   globally (Figure 6.13), the numbers of people who are malnourished has been
   reported as almost double the numbers who are undernourished (G. Gardner &
   Halweil, 2000).
   Most researchers use the World Health Organization’s BMI calculation to
   quantify leanness and obesity. Body mass index (BMI) is calculated by
   dividing the person’s weight in kilograms by the squared height in meters. If
   you don’t know your measurements in metric units, you can use the table in
   Figure 6.14, which also shows the World Health Organization categories based
   on health risks. BMI is an inaccurate measure in some individuals; because
   muscle is heavier than fat, a healthy, bulked-up athlete will have a high BMI
   score. A more complete analysis would include a body fat measure and the
   waist-to-hip ratio.
   Obesity is most important because of its health risks. It is a major risk factor for
   diabetes, and as overweight and obesity increase, so does the incidence of
   diabetes. Rates of the disease more than doubled from 1990 to 2008, but in
   recent years have leveled off, with a little over 8% of the U.S. population
   diagnosed with diabetes (Geiss et al., 2014). Being overweight also increases the
   likelihood of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and colon cancer (Field
   et al., 2001; Must et al., 1999). Obesity is also linked to cognitive decline and
   risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Swedish researchers found that in women with
   lifelong obesity, for every one-point increase in BMI there was a 13%–16%
   increase in the risk of temporal lobe shrinkage due to cell loss (Gustafson,
   Lissner, Bengtsson, Björkelund, & Skoog, 2004). The degeneration could have
   been the result of impaired blood flow to the brain or excess release of the stress
   hormone cortisol. The cost of obesity in the United States may be as high as
   $305 billion annually; according to one analysis, medical costs account for $190
   billion, workplace absenteeism and reduced productivity cost $65 billion, and
   obesity-related health education adds another $50 billion (Blake, 2014). It is no
   wonder that researchers are open to even the most novel sources for treatments,
   like the one described in the accompanying Research Spotlight.
   Research Spotlight: How Nicotine and Marijuana Affect Appetite
   Monitoring the body’s energy reserves is a complex task requiring intricately complex
   mechanisms. But this system is made up of multipurpose components, so they also respond to
   signals from a number of unrelated sources. That is why smoking tobacco helps people keep
   their weight down and cancer and AIDS patients smoke marijuana to keep theirs up.
   Researchers at Yale and Baylor Colleges of Medicine traced nicotine’s appetite-suppressing
   effects to a particular variety of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the arcuate nucleus, called
   a3β4 (Mineur et al., 2011). When nicotine stimulates these receptors, POMC neurons are
   activated and curtail appetite (Picciotto et al., 2013); mice given a drug that targets a3β4 ate half
   as much as untreated mice in the next two hours, and over a month their body fat dropped 15%–
   20%. Areas important in hunger and feeding—the arcuate nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus,
   and the ventromedial hypothalamus—also have an abundance of cannabinoid receptors, whose
   activation induces feeding (Koch et al., 2015). Injecting anandamide or THC into these areas
   caused satiated mice to resume eating (Di Marzo, Ligresti, & Cristino, 2009). In human
   subjects, smoking marijuana cigarettes produced hunger-inducing increases in ghrelin levels and
   decreases in PYY.
   There are several reasons for not smoking tobacco or marijuana, but understanding which
   cannabinoid and nicotinic receptors affect appetite should enable pharmaceutical researchers to
   develop safer substitutes; for example, there are already alternative ways of administering THC,
   such as with inhalers. The mechanisms of appetite regulation are obviously very complex, and
   targeting the nicotinic and cannabinoid receptors might not be the best approaches to weight
   control, but the problems have been so daunting that researchers are always looking for new
   solutions.

   Research Spotlight: Diabetes, the Duck-Billed Platypus, and the Cone Snail
   Insulin is often used to regulate blood sugar level in people with diabetes; the gut hormone
   glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an attractive alternative because it increases insulin
   naturally, but it is degraded too rapidly to be useful as a diabetes treatment. Enter the platypus,
   an animal so strange looking that when scientists first saw one in 1799 they believed it was a
   fake cleverly sewn together from several animals. The male of the species produces GLP-1, too,
   not only in the gut but also in a painful venom that it delivers from spurs on its hind feet when
   fighting other males during mating season. To serve that function, the platypus has evolved a
   more stable form of GLP-1, which is degraded by a different mechanism from the one in
   humans and would be more stable in the human body (Tsend-Ayush, 2016).
   Another possible source for an insulin substitute is the venom of one species of marine cone
   snail (see Chapter 2). It is an insulin-like protein that produces hypoglycemic shock, a
   physiological state in which extremely low blood sugar induces a mild sedation in its prey
   (Safavi-Hemani et al., 2015). Just encountering the venom free-floating in seawater makes
   zebrafish sluggish, and injecting the venom immediately sends them into shock. The research
   has been funded in part by Sanofi, a pharmaceutical company that makes the long-acting insulin
   Lantus.
   In other words, the diabetic patient’s unlikely future best friends could be a duck-billed, web-
   footed, egg-laying mammal from Australia and a venomous snail hiding in a deceptively
   beautiful shell.
   Health declines mean more than reduced quality of life. For every 5-point
   increase in BMI over 25, the risk of death increases by 31% (de Gonzalez et al.,
   2010); the result is a shortening of lifespan between 2 and 10 years, depending
   on the degree of overweight (Prospective Studies Collaboration, 2009). Between
   1990 and 2008, longevity declined, likely due to the effects of obesity and drug
   use; this was the first time in a century that life expectancy failed to increase
   (Olshansky et al., 2012). The average loss of a tenth of a year was driven by
   larger losses in certain groups; for example, among people with less than a high
   school education the loss was three years for men and five years for women. But
   there was another 0.1-year decrease during 2015 alone; it could be just a
   statistical blip, but this time the loss was significant for all groups (Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention, 2016a).
   Just as obesity is detrimental to health, caloric restriction without malnutrition
   appears to be beneficial, even in people who aren’t obese. As you would expect,
   limiting the number of calories by around 30% reduces cholesterol, triglycerides,
   and circulating levels of insulin and glucose. But it also lowers blood pressure
   and improves heart health and functioning (P. K. Stein et al., 2012; Trepanowski,
   Canale, Marshall, Kabir, & Bloomer, 2011), and in elderly subjects verbal
   memory improved 20% (Witte, Fobker, Gellner, Knecht, & Flöbel, 2009).
   Feeding restriction increases the lifespan of rats and mice by 20%–60%
   (Kennedy, Steffen, & Kaeberlein, 2007). Extending these results to primates has
   been difficult, because the 40- to 50-year lifespan of laboratory monkeys means
   that studies must last two or three decades. The handful of studies that have been
   conducted generally support disease reduction and life extension by restricting
   caloric intake (Colman et al., 2014). Some people believe the health benefits of
   dietary restriction will translate into longer lives for humans as well, but we’ll
   have to wait a few more years to find out whether they’re right. Because few
   people are willing to undergo the required diet restriction, biogerontologists are
   experimenting with drugs that produce similar changes in gene expression and
   improved health measures (Magalhães, Wuttke, Wood, Plank, & Vora, 2011).
   The Myths of Obesity
   Because obesity is dangerous to the person’s health as well as an occasion for
   social and career discrimination, it is important to ask why people become
   overweight and why obesity rates are rising so dramatically. Although the causes
   have been difficult to document, most authorities believe that the global increase
   in obesity has a simple explanation: People are eating more and richer foods and
   exercising less (J. O. Hill & Peters, 1998; J. O. Hill, Wyatt, Reed, & Peters,
   2003). The cause of obesity seems straightforward enough, then: Energy in
   exceeds energy out, and the person gains weight. But we would miss the point
   entirely if we assumed that people become obese just because they cannot resist
   the temptation to overeat. Research has not supported the popular opinion that
   obesity is completely under voluntary control (Volkow & Wise, 2005) or that it
   can be characterized simply as lack of impulse control, inability to delay
   gratification, or maladaptive eating style (Rodin, Schank, & Striegel-Moore,
   1989). In fact, as we will see later, obesity has a number of features in common
   with drug addiction.
   Is obesity due to a lack of willpower?
   Another popular belief is that obese children learn overindulgence from their
   family. Obesity does run in families, and body mass index and other measures
   are moderately related among family members. However, the evidence
   consistently points to genetic rather than environmental influences as more
   important (Grilo & Pogue-Geile, 1991). To the extent that environment does play
   a role, it is mostly from outside the family.
   Most forms of obesity are likely to result not from an overwhelming lust for food or lack of
   willpower, but from biochemical defects at one or more points in the system responsible for
   the control of body weight.
   —Michael Schwartz and Randy Seeley
   The Contributions of Heredity and Environment
   Two environmental influences on weight and obesity are obvious—diet and
   activity level. During the last three decades of the 20th century, advancing
   prosperity and improved agricultural production led to greater food availability,
   and per-capita calorie consumption increased by 1% or more per year in most
   areas of the world (Rosen, 1999). But this abundance turned out to be a mixed
   blessing, due to unhealthy dietary choices; for example, by the year 2000, half of
   calorie consumption in the United States consisted of carbohydrates, and fat
   made up another third (Wright, Kennedy-Stephenson, Wang, McDowell, &
   Johnson, 2004). This increased consumption added about 200 calories a day to
   the average U.S. diet (Wright et al., 2004), while decreasing energy demands on
   the job reduced daily energy expenditure by more than 100 calories (Church et
   al., 2011). As people drive rather than walk and spend more time on electronic
   devices and in front of televisions, activity levels are decreasing to the point that
   most world populations could be classified as sedentary within the next few
   years (Ng & Popkin, 2012). Physical activity begins to decline in adolescence,
   and reduced physical activity during that time is a strong predictor of obesity at
   age 25 (Pietiläinen et al., 2008).
   Is obesity hereditary?
   A less obvious influence is sleep deprivation. Over the last century, average
   sleep time has decreased from around 9 hours per night to 6 hours and 40
   minutes, a loss of 35%. Adults who sleep less than 6 hours a night on workdays
   have a 41% obesity rate, compared with 28% for 8-hour sleepers, and each hour
   of lost sleep during adolescence increases the risk of obesity by 80% (reviewed
   in McAllister et al., 2009). Sleep loss reduces leptin levels and increases ghrelin
   secretion, both of which cause a craving for high-calorie foods (Greer, Goldstein,
   & Walker, 2013). Remember that these hormone shifts also trigger the release of
   orexin, which is an additional reason appetite increases.
   More surprising than the sleep connection is the possibility that some obesity is
   the result of infection. The human adenovirus-36, which causes respiratory and
   eye infections, is three times more prevalent among obese individuals (Atkinson
   et al., 2005), and in one study the presence of antibodies for four common
   viruses accounted for 9% of subjects’ fat mass (Fernández-Real, Ferri, Vendrell,
   & Ricart, 2007). Animal research tells us that the viruses increase glucose uptake
   by fat cells; and because animals can be made obese by infecting them with the
   viruses, the viruses likely cause obesity in humans rather than being a result of it
   (McAllister et al., 2009). Bacteria also appear to play a role. When researchers
   transferred gut bacteria from obese humans to mice that had no gut microbes of
   their own, the mice increased their body fat by 10%, even though they were
   eating the same amount of food as mice that received microbes from the human
   donors’ lean twins (Ridaura et al., 2013). Bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes are
   the likely culprit; animal studies suggest they enhance the ability to harvest
   energy from nutrients. In a study of childhood obesity, obese children had a
   higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteriodetes, the other major phylum of gut
   bacteria (Bervoets et al., 2013). Bacteriodetes, by contrast, may have a
   protective function. Cohousing the two mice treated with human microbes later
   in the study allowed them to eat each other’s feces, which they have the
   unsavory habit of doing. In this situation, Bacteriodetes invaded the intestines of
   the overweight mice, dominated the Firmicutes in number, and prevented the
   mice from gaining further weight. However, that happened only in mice fed the
   usual high-fiber/low-fat lab chow, not a high-fat diet. Genetic analysis indicated
   the likely reason: The lean mice had more genes expressed that are involved in
   breaking down dietary fiber.
   Both adoption studies and twin studies demonstrate the influence of heredity on
   body weight. Adopted children show a moderate relationship with their
   biological parents’ weights and BMIs, and little or no similarity to their adoptive
   parents (Grilo & Pogue-Geile, 1991). In a meta-analysis of several studies
   involving 75,000 individuals, correlations for BMI averaged .74 for identical
   twins and .32 for fraternal twins (Maes, Neale, & Eaves, 1997). Even when
   identical twins are reared apart, the correlation drops only to .62 (Grilo & Pogue-
   Geile, 1991), still almost double that for fraternal twins reared together (Figure
   6.15). Across 88 estimates from twin studies, heritability of BMI varied from .47
   to .90 (Elks et al., 2012). The authors attributed the variation to methodological
   differences, but others have pointed out that heritability of obesity can vary
   greatly across populations (W. Yang, Kelly, & He, 2007). Interestingly, the
   correlation increased during childhood, likely due to increasing gene expression,
   and decreased through adulthood, possibly as subjects adopted individual dietary
   and exercise habits.

   Forty years ago, it was known that the so-called obesity gene on chromosome 6
   and the diabetes gene on chromosome 4 cause obesity in mice. Mice that are
   homozygous for the recessive obesity gene (ob/ob) or the recessive diabetes
   gene (db/db) have the same symptoms: overeating, obesity, and susceptibility to
   diabetes (Figure 6.16). To find out how the two genes produced these symptoms,
   Coleman (1973) used parabiotic pairings of the two kinds of mice and normals
   (Figure 6.17). When a db/db mouse was paired with a normal mouse, the normal
   mouse starved to death. The same thing happened to the ob/ob mouse when it
   was paired with the db/db mouse. These results suggested that the db/db mouse
   was producing a fat signal that it was incapable of responding to itself. The
   ob/ob mouse had no effect on a normal mouse, but its own rate of weight gain
   slowed. The ob/ob mouse apparently was sensitive to a fat signal that it did not
   produce. It was another 20 years before researchers discovered that the fat signal
   in Coleman’s study (and Hervey’s 1952 lesioning study) was leptin. Following
   that discovery, they were able to test Coleman’s hypothesis. Injecting leptin into
   ob/ob mice reduced their weight 30% in just 2 weeks, while db/db mice were not
   affected by the injections (Halaas et al., 1995). We now understand that the ob
   gene encodes the production of leptin, and the db gene is responsible for the
   receptor.

   Those genes are rare in the population, however, and account for relatively few
   cases of obesity. By contrast, 16% of the population has two copies of the A
   allele of the FTO (fat mass and obesity–associated) gene, and this increases their
   risk of obesity by nearly 70%; even a single copy ups the risk by 30% (Frayling
   et al., 2007). Variants of the MC4R gene add 12% to the risk for obesity in
   women (Loos et al., 2008) and account for 6% of cases of severe childhood
   obesity (Farooqi et al., 2003). Both of these genes promote obesity by increasing
   calorie intake (Loos et al.; Speakman, Rance, & Johnstone, 2008). Other variants
   of FTO shift individuals into hunger mode by reducing leptin levels, while
   increasing ghrelin levels (Benedict et al., 2014), sensitivity of leptin receptors
   (Stratigopoulos et al., 2014), or insulin sensitivity (Heni et al., 2016). Four
   variants of the Mrap2 gene found in severely obese individuals apparently
   interfere with functioning of the receptor for Mc4r, a protein involved in
   regulating appetite and energy expenditure (Asai et al., 2013). These mutations
   likely account for less than 1% of cases of obesity, however. More than 40
   genetic variants are known to contribute to obesity and fat distribution (Herrera,
   Keildson, & Lindgren, 2011), and additional candidates turn up regularly. The
   research reminds us that there are many paths to obesity, including increased
   appetite, diminished satiety, reduced metabolism, and increased fat storage;
   accordingly, obesity results from the contributions of many genes.
   All the known genes account for only a small proportion of obesity, and
   heritability measures leave room for significant environmental influence; indeed,
   we must recognize that the recent surge in obesity is due to nongenetic factors,
   such as diet and activity level. Even the tendency of overweight women to give
   birth to overweight babies cannot be attributed entirely to inheritance (M. H.
   Black, Sacks, Xiang, & Lawrence, 2013; Hochner et al., 2012); children born to
   women after they have lost weight through bariatric surgery are only one third as
   likely to be obese, compared with their siblings born before the surgery (J. Smith
   et al., 2009). The reason this discussion is occurring here is that environmental
   influences often work by altering gene activity. Epigenetic characteristics are
   inheritable traits that result from modifications of gene expression, rather
   than changes in the individual’s DNA sequence. One mechanism of epigenetic
   change is methylation, the attachment of molecules called methyl groups to a
   gene, which makes it more difficult for the gene to function. A recent study
   found that body mass index is correlated with methylation of a handful of genes
   that had previously been linked to obesity and diabetes (A. P. Feinberg et al.,
   2010). In another study, methylation of the RXRA gene at birth accounted for
   more than 25% of variation in childhood weight; the methylation apparently was
   due to low carbohydrate intake by the mothers during early pregnancy (Godfrey
   et al., 2011).

   You can see a graphic demonstration of the effects of methylation in Figure 6.18.
   Both mice have a mutation in the agouti gene, which is responsible for the
   agouti-related peptide mentioned earlier; the mutation produces obesity and an
   atypical yellow coat. But during pregnancy, the mother of the mouse on the right
   was fed supplements high in methyl groups (folic acid and vitamin B12); the
   resulting methylation downregulated the mutant gene (Waterland & Jirtle, 2003).
   But the most dramatic example comes from the Dutch hunger winter of 1944–
   1945, when Germany blockaded food shipments to western Holland and 20,000
   people died from starvation. A study of young men whose mothers were exposed
   to famine during early pregnancy found that they were more often obese than
   unexposed control subjects (Ravelli, Stein, & Susser, 1976). More recent follow-
   up studies discovered the likely reason: In individuals exposed during early
   gestation, several genes that control prenatal growth showed modest increases or
   decreases in methylation, the remnants of epigenetic changes that occurred six
   decades earlier (Tobi et al., 2009; Tobi et al., 2012). Hunger winter offspring also
   had twice the typical rate of schizophrenia (Susser et al., 1996). In the following
   chapters, we will see growing evidence of the role of epigenetic influences on
   our lives and in our well-being. Meanwhile, the accompanying Application
   describes another influence on eating and weight gain that will likely also turn
   out to be epigenetic.

   Application: The Sweet Taste of Obesity
   Source: iStock/mvp64.
   People who are obese like sweet and fatty foods more than lean people do (Bartoshuk, Duffy,
   Hayes, Moskowitz, & Snyder, 2006). That’s no surprise, but the fact that they are less sensitive
   to these tastes than the rest of us might surprise you. When asked to rate sweet stimuli, obese
   children rate them lower in flavor than other children do, plus they have trouble identifying all
   the primary flavors (Overberg, Hummel, Krude, & Wiegand, 2012). In addition, adults with
   lower sensitivity to the taste of fat consume more fatty foods and have higher BMIs (Stewart et
   al., 2010).
   This might remind you of what we saw in Chapter 5: Both liking for cocaine and chronic drug
   use are associated with a less sensitive dopamine reward system, and evidence suggests that this
   reduced sensitivity is a cause rather than a result of drug abuse. So, do people eat more sweet
   and fatty foods because their taste is blunted, or has a high-calorie diet modified the obese
   person’s palate? Whereas taste ability is largely innate, personal taste preferences begin
   developing during the prenatal and postnatal periods (Beauchamp & Menella, 2009); for
   example, children whose mothers drank carrot juice regularly during either late pregnancy or
   initial breastfeeding ate more carrot-flavored cereal than other children (Menella, Jagnow, &
   Beauchamp, 2001). According to a study with rats, exposure to novel flavors produces long-
   term changes in the gustatory projection area (Swank & Sweatt, 2001).
   So, experience can influence taste preferences, but to answer our question about what causes the
   relationship between obesity and taste sensitivity, we need to look at a study in which
   researchers induced lean rats to become obese by offering them access to a high-fat diet. After
   10 weeks, the mice were 30%–40% heavier than their littermates; they also were less sensitive
   to sweet tastes, and fewer of their taste cells were physiologically responsive to the sweet
   stimuli (Maliphol, Garth, & Medler, 2013).
   Obesity and Reduced Metabolism
   Accounts of dieting are all too often stories of failure; overweight people report
   slavishly following rigorous diets without appreciable weight loss, or they lose
   weight and then gain it back within a year’s time. One factor in the failures may
   be dieters’ misrepresentation of their efforts, whether intentional or not. One
   group of diet-resistant obese individuals underreported the amount of food they
   consumed by 47% and overreported their physical activity by 51% (Lichtman et
   al., 1992).
   But another critical element that can make weight loss difficult is a person’s rate
   of energy expenditure. In the average sedentary adult, about 75% of daily energy
   expenditure goes into resting or basal metabolism, the energy required to fuel
   the brain and other organs and to maintain body temperature; the remainder
   is spent about equally in the two remaining components of metabolism, physical
   activity and digestion of food (Bogardus et al., 1986).
   Differences in basal metabolism may be a key element in explaining differences
   in weight. When 29 women who claimed they could not lose weight were
   isolated and monitored closely while they were restricted to a diet of 1,500
   kilocalories (kcal; a measure of food’s energy value, popularly called calorie),
   19 did lose weight, but 10 did not (D. S. Miller & Parsonage, 1975). The 10 who
   failed to lose weight turned out to have a low basal metabolism rate (BMR).
   Heredity accounts for about 40% of people’s differences in BMR (C. Bouchard,
   1989). When identical twins were overfed 1,000 calories a day for three months,
   the differences in weight gain within pairs of twins were only one third as great
   as the differences across pairs (C. Bouchard et al., 1990). As a result, some
   medical professionals have called for labeling obese individuals with low BMR
   as suffering from a disorder called metabolic syndrome.
   However, a person’s metabolism can shift when the person gains or loses weight.
   In an unusual experimental manipulation, researchers had both obese and never-
   obese individuals either lose weight or gain weight (Leibel, Rosenbaum, &
   Hirsch, 1995). Those who lost weight shifted to reduced levels of energy
   expenditure (resting plus nonresting), and the ones who gained weight increased
   their energy expenditure. This was expected, because your weight affects how
   much energy is required to move around and even to sit or stand. However, the
   energy expenditure changes were greater than the weight changes would require,
   suggesting that the individuals’ bodies were defending their original weight (see
   Keesey & Powley, 1986). Individuals also defend against weight gain by
   increasing their physical activity, mostly through casual walking, fidgeting, and
   spontaneous muscle contraction (F. R. Levine, Eberhardt, & Jensen, 1999).
   Among volunteers overfed 1,000 calories a day, those who increased their
   energy expenditure the least gained 10 times as much weight.
   What is a wisdom of the body in times of deprivation becomes a foolishness in our modern
   environment.
   —Xavier Pi-Sunyer
   So why doesn’t this defense of body weight prevent people from becoming
   obese? One reason is that the body defends less against weight gain than against
   weight loss (J. O. Hill et al., 2003; J. O. Hill & Peters, 1998). Humans evolved in
   an environment in which food was sometimes scarce, so it made sense for the
   body to store excess nutrients during times of plenty and to protect those
   reserves during famine. Such a system is adaptive when humans are at the mercy
   of nature, but it is a liability when modern agriculture and global transportation
   provide a constant supply of more food than we need.
   Obese people tend to be more sedentary, sitting for longer periods of time—two
   hours longer in one study (J. A. Levine et al., 2005). And compared with
   obesity-resistant individuals, those who are obesity prone respond to overfeeding
   by reducing their level of fat oxidation during the night (Schmidt, Kealey,
   Horton, VonKaenel, & Bessesen, 2013) and, three days following overfeeding,
   significantly decreasing the amount of time they spend walking (S. L. Schmidt,
   Harmon, Sharp, Kealey, & Bessesen, 2012).
   Prolonged weight gain may reset a person’s set point at a higher level. Barbara
   Rolls and her colleagues fattened rats on highly palatable, high-energy junk food
   (chocolate chip cookies, potato chips, and cheese crackers) for 90 days (Rolls et
   al., 1980). Surprisingly, when the rats were returned to their usual lab chow they
   did not lose weight. The rats maintained their increased weight for the four-
   month duration of the study—while eating the same amount of food as the
   control rats. They were defending a new set point. The researchers suggested
   that the variety of the foods offered, the length of the fattening period, and lack
   of exercise all contributed to the rats’ failure to defend their original weight. In
   view of the difficulties in shedding excess weight, one obesity researcher pointed
   out that even modest weight loss reduces risk for chronic disease, and suggested
   that a goal of 10% weight reduction is more practical than a return to normal
   weight (Pi-Sunyer, 2003).
   Treating Obesity
   There is no greater testimony to the difficulty of losing weight than the lengths
   to which patients and doctors have gone to bring about weight loss. These
   include wiring the jaws shut, surgically reducing the stomach’s capacity, and
   removing fat tissue. The standard treatment for obesity, of course, is dietary
   restriction. However, we have seen that the body defends against weight loss,
   and dieters are usually frustrated. Exercise burns fat, but it takes a great deal of
   effort to use just a few hundred calories. On the other hand, exercise during
   dieting may increase resting metabolic rate or at least prevent it from dropping
   (Calles-Escandón & Horton, 1992). Dieters who exercise lose more weight than
   dieters who do not exercise (Figure 6.19; J. O. Hill et al., 1989). In a study of
   formerly obese women, 90% of those who maintained their weight loss
   exercised, compared with 34% of those who regained their lost weight (Kayman,
   Bruvold, & Stern, 1990).
   How can obesity be treated effectively?
   Figure 6.19 The Effect of Exercise on Weight Loss.
   Source: Based on data from J. O. Hill et al. (1989).
   Another option in the treatment of obesity is medication. However, it has not
   been a particularly promising alternative. Lack of effectiveness is one problem,
   and because the drugs manipulate metabolic and other important body systems,
   they often have adverse side effects. The approval of dexfenfluramine in 1996
   was the first by the FDA in 20 years. It was withdrawn just a year later, along
   with the older fenfluramine, after reports they caused heart valve leakage
   (Campfield, Smith, & Burn, 1998). Sibutramine was linked to increased risk of
   heart attack and stroke (“Abbot Laboratories Agrees to Withdraw . . . ,” 2010),
   and rimonabant to serious psychiatric disorders (D. Taylor, 2009), resulting in
   withdrawal of both. In the United States, only orlistat remained available.
   Because it blocks fat absorption, it can cause digestive discomfort, and there
   have been rare reports of liver damage (U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
   2010). After a lapse of 13 years, new drugs began arriving in 2012. Their
   mechanisms are varied; different ones enhance serotonin transmission, increase
   leptin, control blood sugar, and slow stomach emptying. Although these drugs
   are safer than most of their predecessors, their potential side effects include
   suicidal thoughts, dizziness, confusion, pancreatitis, and birth defects in
   offspring (“These 5 Weight-Loss Drugs . . . ,” 2016; “Weight Loss Drugs . . . ,”
   2015). What is more, the drugs are no panacea; weight loss is modestly greater
   than with diet and exercise, which, by the way, are still part of the regimen.
   Serotonin plays an interesting role in weight control. Carbohydrate regulation
   involves a feedback loop; eating carbohydrates increases serotonin levels, which
   inhibits a person’s appetite for carbohydrates (Leibowitz & Alexander, 1998),
   apparently by reducing NPY activity (Dryden, Wang, Frankish, Pickavance, &
   Williams, 1995). Drugs that block serotonin reuptake reduce carbohydrate
   intake, but only in the group of obese individuals who crave carbohydrates and
   eat a large proportion of their diet in carbohydrates (Lieberman, Wurtman, &
   Chew, 1986; Wurtman, Wurtman, Reynolds, Tsay, & Chew, 1987). Serotonin
   also enhances mood in some people, and people who have trouble maintaining
   weight loss often say that they use food to make themselves feel better when
   they are upset (Kayman et al., 1990). A high-carbohydrate meal also improves
   mood only in carbohydrate cravers; it actually lowers the mood of noncravers
   and makes them feel fatigued and sleepy (Lieberman et al., 1986). So serotonin
   dysregulation may be an important contributor to obesity in a subset of people.
   By now you should be asking, “Why not try the body’s own hormones as weight
   loss drugs?” And, of course, researchers have thought of that as well. Although
   gastric bypass patients who lost the most weight also showed elevated PYY
   levels (Buchwald et al., 2009), attempts to use PYY have so far been
   unsuccessful, because of either a lack of effect or extreme nausea (De Silva &
   Bloom, 2012). Leptin is particularly attractive to obesity researchers because,
   unlike food restriction, it increases metabolism (N. Levin et al., 1996), and it
   targets fat reduction while sparing lean mass (P. Cohen & Friedman, 2004).
   Leptin was administered to three severely obese children who produced no leptin
   at all due to a mutation in the ob gene (Farooqi et al., 2002). Their body weights
   decreased throughout treatment although they were increasing in age; more than
   98% of the weight loss was in fat mass, while lean mass increased. Figure 6.20
   shows how dramatic the effects were in one of the children. Unfortunately, leptin
   treatment benefits only the 5%–10% of obese people who are leptin deficient;
   the rest are resistant to leptin’s effects, apparently as a result of long-term high-
   fat consumption (Enriori et al., 2007; Maffei et al., 1995). Many obesity
   researchers now believe that leptin’s main role is in protecting the individual
   against weight loss during times of deprivation rather than against weight gain
   during times of plenty (Marx, 2003).

   A more recent therapeutic approach involves treating obesity as an addictive
   behavior. Compulsive overeating and drug addiction share several behavioral
   and neurophysiological similarities, including high relapse rate, responsiveness
   to stress, dopamine release in response to cues, reduced numbers of dopamine
   D 2 receptors (Figure 6.21) with associated decreases in metabolism in prefrontal
   areas involved in impulse control, and continued drug taking and compulsive
   eating when the behaviors are self-destructive and no longer pleasurable (V. H.
   Taylor, Curtis, & Davis, 2009; Trinko, Sears, Guarnieri, & DiLeone, 2007;
   Volkow, Wang, Fowler, & Telang, 2008). In addition, signals that influence
   eating—orexin, insulin, leptin, and ghrelin—also increase or decrease activity in
   the reward system (Volkow, Wang, Tomasi, & Baler, 2013). Some drugs used in
   addiction treatment have shown promise for treating obesity as well. Obese
   patients taking Contrave, a combination of the anti-addiction drugs bupropion
   and naltrexone, lost 50% more weight than patients receiving a placebo; the
   manufacturer is in the final stages of obtaining FDA approval (“Orexigen Has
   Another Go,” 2013; “Orexigen Therapeutics,” 2009).

   Individuals.

   al., 2001, Lancet, 357, pp. 354–357, with permission from Elsevier.
   Unfortunately, lifestyle modification and approved drug therapies reduce body
   weight by only 5%–10% (Mitka, 2006), and most dieters regain their weight
   within a year (Bray, 1992). That much weight reduction can lead to significant
   health gains, but it is not enough for the morbidly obese, who are increasingly
   turning to bariatric surgery. The cost averages between $14,500 and $23,000
   depending on the type of surgery (“Weight Loss Surgery Insurance Coverage
   and Costs,” 2016), but the benefits can be remarkable. The most effective
   procedure, gastric bypass, reduces the stomach to a small pouch, which is then
   reconnected at a lower point on the intestine (Figure 6.22). This both limits meal
   size and reduces nutrient absorption in the digestive tract. The resulting weight
   loss averages 32% after 1or 2 years and is maintained at 25% 10 years later
   (Sjöström et al., 2007). The weight loss engenders a cascade of additional
   benefits: remission of type 2 diabetes in 77% of patients, hypertension in 66%,
   and sleep apnea in 88% (Buchwald et al., 2004), as well as a 27% reduction in
   mortality at 15 years (Sjöström et al.). Reducing digestive capacity is not the
   only way bypass surgery brings about weight reduction; blood glucose control
   improves (Rubino et al., 2016); postmeal ghrelin levels are decreased and PYY
   is increased (Pournaras & le Roux, 2009), so the individual doesn’t feel hungry;
   and even the balance of intestinal microbes improves (Kong et al., 2013).
   Surgery is a last resort, though, and its downsides highlight the need for obesity
   prevention and new strategies for weight management.
   In The News: Pets May Provide Protection Against Obesity
   Many parents think a dog or cat can help their child learn responsibility or engage in more
   physical activity, but new research suggests that just exposure to pets, even while still in the
   womb, can be beneficial. Researchers at the University of Alberta Department of Pediatrics
   have been studying how prenatal and postnatal exposure to furry animals, such as cats and dogs,
   affects the types of bacteria found in the guts of infants (Tun et al., 2017). This is messy work
   requiring analysis of fecal samples, but it is rewarding researchers with evidence that the types
   of bacteria found in the gut are associated with risk for a variety of psychological and physical
   conditions. Infants with pet exposure had higher amounts of two “good” bacteria, Oscillospira
   and Ruminococcus, compared with infants without pet exposure. Oscillospira previously has
   been found in the guts of people with healthy BMIs, and Ruminococcus seems to protect against
   illness. With increasing rates of childhood obesity, the discovery that a household pet can
   promote helpful bacterial development in the guts of children suggests new possibilities in
   obesity and illness prevention.
   Thought Questions
   1. How can pets influence risk for obesity in children?
   2. How are bacteria such as Oscillospira and Ruminococcus potentially helpful to people?

   The best course of action, however, is to head off obesity before it begins,
   through exercise and healthy eating. But there is also more one can do, as the
   accompanying In the News feature suggests.
   Not everyone with an eating disorder is overweight or obese. Some people try so
   hard to control their weight that they eat less than is needed to maintain health,
   or they eat normal or excess amounts and then vomit or use laxatives to avoid
   gaining weight. As you will see, anorexia and bulimia are as puzzling to
   researchers as obesity and often more deadly for the victims.

   Obesity is the most dangerous epidemic facing mankind, and we are relatively unprepared
   for it.
   —George Yancopoulos
   Anorexia, Bulimia, and Binge Eating Disorder
   Difficulties with eating and weight regulation affect women much more often
   than they do men. Though men are overrepresented among U.S. adults who are
   overweight or obese, women outnumber men two to one among the extremely
   obese (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2012). Similarly,
   women are three times as likely to be diagnosed with anorexia nervosa or
   bulimia nervosa, and twice as likely to suffer from binge eating disorder (Figure
   6.23; Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007). The reasons are not well
   understood, so they will not be addressed here, but you should understand why
   the following discussion often refers only to women or girls.
   Anorexia nervosa is known as the “starving disease” because the individual
   restricts food intake to maintain weight at a level so low that it is
   threatening to health (Figure 6.24; Walsh & Devlin, 1998). The person may
   also exercise for hours a day or resort to vomiting to control weight loss.
   Anorexics often see themselves as fat even when they are emaciated. They are
   likely to deny the need for treatment and fail to comprehend the medical
   consequences of their disorder. There are two subgroups of anorexics.
   Restrictors rely only on reducing food intake to control their weight. Binge-
   purgers restrict their calorie intake as well, but they also resort to vomiting or
   using laxatives. If anorexia continues long enough, it leads to cessation of
   ovulation, loss of muscle mass, heart damage, and reduction in bone density. The
   death rate among anorexics is more than double that for female psychiatric
   patients; half of the deaths are from complications of the disease and another
   quarter from suicide (Sullivan, 1995).
   What are anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder?
   Brain scans show deficits in brain volume, which appear to be only partially
   reversible following weight recovery (Castro-Fornieles et al., 2009; Lambe,
   Katzman, Mikulis, Kennedy, & Zipursky, 1997; Mainz, Schulte-Rüther, Fink,
   Herpertz-Dahlmann, & Konrad, 2012). Brain scans also reveal dysfunction in
   areas involved in reward, emotion, and processing of bodily information,
   including those responsible for body image (W. H. Kaye, Fudge, & Paulus,
   2009). After 16 hours of fasting, healthy women showed activation of reward
   evaluation circuits; women in remission from anorexia (chosen to avoid
   confounding from starvation) did not, but they did activate cognitive control
   circuits, both when fasting and after eating (Wierenga et al., 2014). When
   choosing foods, they also activated the dorsal striatum, an area involved in
   habitual behavior, more than did healthy controls (Foerde, Steinglass, Shohamy,
   & Walsh, 2015). These results are consistent with patients’ control over hunger
   and eating behavior, a control that relies on automatic learned behaviors rather
   than an assessment of bodily needs. The studies do not tell us whether these
   brain anomalies are due to starvation or represent conditions that precede and
   contribute to the anorexia. However, the poor performance of anorexics on a
   behavioral test of frontal cortex functioning continues after recovery and is
   found in healthy sisters (Attia, 2009). In addition, the presence of obsessive-
   compulsive traits, harm avoidance, and perfectionism during childhood as well
   as after recovery suggests the presence of predisposing factors before the onset
   of illness (Kaye et al.).

   Department of Health and Human Services (2012).

   Bulimia nervosa also involves weight control, but the behavior is limited to
   bingeing and purging. If the bulimic restricts food intake, it is only for a few
   days at a time, and restricting takes a backseat to bingeing and purging. In fact,
   only 19% of bulimic women consume fewer calories than normal controls,
   whereas 44% overeat (Weltzin, Hsu, Pollice, & Kaye, 1991). Unlike anorexics,
   most bulimic women are of normal weight (Walsh & Devlin, 1998). However,
   there are indications that, like anorexics, they might also be battling hunger.
   Their ghrelin levels between meals are a third higher than in control subjects and
   decrease less following a meal; in addition, PYY levels do not rise as much
   following a meal (Kojima et al., 2005). Like anorexia, bulimia is also a
   dangerous disorder. Both anorexia and bulimia are difficult to treat; although
   three quarters of bulimics and a third of anorexics appear to be fully recovered
   after eight years, a third of these relapse (D. B. Herzog et al., 1999).
   People with binge eating disorder (BED) frequently eat large amounts of food
   during a short period of time, and they feel they cannot control what or how
   much they eat. Because the individuals do not attempt to control weight by
   fasting, purging, or exercising, they typically are overweight, but this is not a
   requirement for diagnosis. They usually feel disgust and shame about their
   overeating, so they often choose to eat separately from others and do their
   bingeing in seclusion. BED has been recognized clinically only during the past
   two decades and was included as a disorder for the first time in the fifth edition
   of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5;
   American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Although there has been much less
   research on this disorder than on anorexia and bulimia, recent reports suggest
   BED is caused by impairments in decision making, increased pleasure derived
   from food, and alterations in dopamine pathways characteristic of other
   impulsive and compulsive disorders such as substance abuse (Kessler, Hutson,
   Herman, & Potenza, 2016).
   In addition to these three disorders, there are other eating disorders recognized
   by the DSM-5. These include night eating disorder (excessive eating between
   sleep bouts), pica (compulsive eating of dirt, rocks, and other non-food objects),
   rumination disorder (bringing back up and rechewing previously swallowed
   food), and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID; lack of interest in
   or concern about eating). Clearly, all are maladaptive and potentially harmful to
   the individual suffering from these disorders.
   Environmental and Genetic Contributions
   Both anorexics and bulimics are preoccupied with weight and body shape.
   Because increases in anorexia and bulimia seem to have paralleled an increasing
   cultural emphasis on thinness and beauty, some researchers have concluded that
   the cause is social. The male-female difference is consistent with this argument,
   because women are under more pressure to be slim while men are encouraged to
   “bulk up.” Cases are more common in Western, industrialized countries, where
   an impractical level of thinness is promoted by actors, models, and advertisers.
   Anne Becker of Harvard Medical School has been studying eating habits in the
   Pacific islands of Fiji since 1988 (Becker, Burwell, Gilman, Herzog, &
   Hamburg, 2002). Traditionally, a robust, muscled body has been valued for both
   sexes there. But when satellite television arrived in 1995, the tall, slim actors in
   shows like Beverly Hills 90210 became teenage Fiji’s new role models. By 1998,
   74% of young island girls considered themselves too big or fat, even though they
   were not more overweight than others. Young girls who lived in homes that
   owned a TV were three times more likely to have an eating problem. Among 17-
   year-old girls, 11% admitted they had vomited to control weight, compared with
   just 3% in 1995.
   What is the evidence for social and genetic influences in anorexia and bulimia?
   There is little doubt that social pressure contributes to anorexia and bulimia. But
   the disorders are not unknown in non-Westernized societies, and anorexia has
   been reported for 300 years, long before the cultural emphasis on thinness. One
   indication that a sociocultural explanation is an oversimplification is that several
   studies show a genetic influence. Relatives of patients have a higher than usual
   incidence of the disorders, and the concordances for anorexia and bulimia are
   about three times greater for identical twins than for fraternals (Kendler et al.,
   1991; Kipman, Gorwood, Mouren-Simeoni, & Ad’es, 1999). Heritability has
   been estimated at 56% for anorexia (Bulik, Sullivan, Tozzi, Furberg,
   Lichtenstein, & Pedersen, 2006), 54%–83% for bulimia (Bulik et al., 2003), and
   45% for binge eating disorder (K. S. Mitchell et al., 2010).
   There has been no shortage of candidate genes, but definitive results have been
   elusive; this is due to a variety of reasons, including the apparent involvement of
   many small-effect genes, difficulty acquiring adequate numbers of patient
   volunteers, and the failure of studies to distinguish between the two subtypes of
   anorexia. The most promising results so far implicate a serotonin receptor gene
   and a dopamine receptor gene in anorexia; estrogen and cannabinoid genes that
   influence food intake in bulimia; and a serotonin transporter gene in binge eating
   disorder (Trace, Baker, Peñas-Lledó, & Bulik, 2013).
   When researchers followed 772 female twins through adolescence, they made a
   surprising discovery (Klump, Burt, McGue, & Iacono, 2007). At age 11, genetic
   factors accounted for just 6% of disordered eating symptoms, such as weight
   preoccupation, body dissatisfaction, and binge eating, but by age 14 they
   accounted for 46% of the variance. Almost all of the nongenetic influence is
   unique to the individual (Bulik et al., 2006; Bulik, Sullivan, Wade, & Kendler,
   2000; K. S. Mitchell et al., 2010), which suggests the possibility that adolescent
   hormonal changes, stress, and dieting (and, possibly, prenatal conditions)
   produce epigenetic changes in the genes that play a role in anorexia and bulimia.
   There has been relatively little research in this area, but epigenetic dysregulation
   of dopamine genes has been reported in women with anorexia and bulimia
   (Frieling et al., 2010).
   Eating disorders typically are accompanied by comorbid psychological
   disorders; in a study of 2,436 female inpatients, almost all were diagnosed with
   depression, more than half had anxiety disorders, 22% had substance abuse
   disorders, and the rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder varied from 15% to
   29% across the groups (Blinder, Cumella, & Sanathara, 2006). Studies have also
   confirmed genetic associations of eating disorders with depression and
   obsessive-compulsive disorder (Scherag, Hebebrand, & Hinney, 2009). Because
   you know the limitations of correlational studies, you should be thinking that
   there are three possible reasons for this relationship: The psychological disorders
   could trigger disordered eating, starvation or overeating could precipitate an
   emotional disorder, or both of these could be the result of a third underlying
   cause. For us, the immediate value is that this correlation leads us to look at
   transmitters involved in the two emotional disorders and in reward and substance
   abuse.
   The Role of Serotonin, Dopamine, and Cannabinoids
   The involvement of serotonin and dopamine has been suggested by a large
   number of genetic studies. Researchers have focused most on serotonin, largely
   because it is involved so intimately in eating behavior and in the anxiety,
   depression, obsessiveness, and impulsive behavior that typically accompany
   anorexia and bulimia (W. Kaye, Gendall, & Strober, 1998). Antidepressants that
   block the reuptake of serotonin at synapses reduce bingeing and purging in
   patients with bulimia, and they lower the chance of relapse after recovery from
   anorexia. This finding led researchers to look for evidence of decreased
   serotonin activity. Instead, levels of serotonin metabolites in the cerebrospinal
   fluid were normal in the ill bulimia patients, and they rose to above normal after
   recovery (Figure 6.25). Levels did turn out to be low in patients with anorexia,
   but only during illness when their starvation diet provided too little tryptophan,
   the precursor to serotonin. After weight recovery (the only time antidepressants
   help them), metabolite levels were higher than normal. In addition, symptom
   improvement was unrelated to any reduction in depression, or even whether
   depression was present.
   What role does serotonin appear to have in anorexia and bulimia?

   The key might not be in the general level of serotonin activity but in which of
   two types of serotonin receptor is more abundant. The 5HT 1A receptor responds
   to serotonin by inhibiting neural activity, whereas the 5HT 2A receptor increases
   activation. A preponderance of 5HT 1A receptors in the subgenual prefrontal
   cortex appears to interfere with the area’s executive control over the amygdala;
   individuals with a higher ratio of 1A receptors respond more to photos depicting
   fearful or angry facial expressions than do subjects with a higher 2A ratio (Fisher
   et al., 2011). Imaging studies indicate that anorexia and bulimia patients have an
   imbalance in activity at serotonin receptors, with increased transmitter binding at
   the 5HT 1A receptors and diminished binding at 5HT 2A receptors in both groups
   (Bailer & Kaye, 2010). These receptors are of interest because of their role in
   anxiety, depression, compulsive behavior, and harm avoidance, and because
   1A/2A imbalance is found in brain areas known to be involved in these
   symptoms. Bailer and Kaye also think this imbalance explains why people with
   anorexia have such a compelling urge to starve themselves. They point to
   evidence that experimentally depleting tryptophan reduces anxiety in both ill and
   recovered subjects and suggest that food restriction serves to reduce anxiety by
   depriving 5HT 1A receptors of serotonin. Tandospirone, which targets these
   receptors, improved symptoms of anorexia in one study, but only two patients
   were treated (Okita, Shiina, Nakazato, & Iyo, 2013). Drug treatment studies have
   been hampered by high dropout rates, and they have generated little support,
   leaving behavioral therapy as the treatment of choice (Zadka, 2015).
   Anorexia patients’ distinctive lack of enjoyment and ability to deny themselves
   not only food but other pleasures of life suggest that disordered reward systems
   might also be at work (Cassin & von Ranson, 2005). Individuals ill with and
   recovered from anorexia have low levels of dopamine metabolites in the
   cerebrospinal fluid, and evidence indicates that dopamine activity may be
   diminished in the ventral striatum, one of the areas important in reward. Similar
   measures in another brain area are associated with higher levels of harm
   avoidance in weight-recovered patients (W. H. Kaye et al., 2009). In addition,
   increasing dopamine activity by administering amphetamine produced euphoria
   in control subjects but increased anxiety in subjects recovered from anorexia
   (Bailer et al., 2012). Because eating increases dopamine release, this finding
   lends additional support to the idea that food restriction serves to reduce anxiety.
   The cannabinoid system, which plays a role in food intake and reward, also
   appears to be involved (Gérard, Pieters, Goffin, Bormans, & Van Laere, 2011).
   Both anorexic and bulimic patients have larger numbers of cannabinoid
   receptors in the insula, whose functions include the rewarding effects of food
   and responses to hunger; viewing pictures of food invokes atypical activity there
   in both groups.

   How are anorexia and bulimia alike and different? (Don’t forget the two types of anorexia.)
   In Perspective
   Temperature regulation, thirst, and hunger provide good examples of drive,
   homeostasis, and physiological motivation in general. Although they are
   explained best by drive theory, they also illustrate the point that it is ultimately
   the balance or imbalance in certain brain centers that determines motivated
   behaviors.
   In addition, hunger in particular demonstrates that homeostasis alone does not
   explain all the facets of motivated behavior. For instance, we saw that the
   incentives of the sight and smell of food are enough to start the physiological
   processes involved in the absorptive phase. This suggests that incentives operate
   through physiological mechanisms and are themselves physiological in nature.
   We also know that there are important social influences on what and how much
   people eat, and sensation seeking may explain why some people are gourmets or
   enjoy the risks of eating puffer fish.
   Most of the factors that determine our eating behavior are in turn influenced by
   genes. If it is true that we are what we eat, it is equally true that what we eat (and
   how much) is the result of who we are. But we will be reminded time and again
   throughout this text that heredity is not destiny, that we are the products of
   countless interactions between our genetic propensities and the environment.
   Our interest in the motivation of hunger would be mostly theoretical if it were
   not for eating disorders, which can have life-threatening consequences. Despite
   their importance, we are unsure about the causes of obesity, anorexia, bulimia,
   and binge eating disorder, as well as what the best treatments are. We do know
   that, like the motivation of hunger itself, these disorders are complex and have a
   number of causes.
   This chapter has given you an overview of what we mean by motivation. We will
   broaden that view in the next two chapters by looking at sexuality, emotion, and
   aggression.
   Chapter Summary
   Motivation and Homeostasis
   Homeostasis and drive theory are key to understanding physiological motivation, but they
   are not adequate alone.
   Temperature regulation involves a simple mechanism for control around a set point.
   Thirst is a bit more complex, compensating for deficits both in the cells (osmotic thirst)
   and outside the cells (hypovolemic thirst).
   Hunger: A Complex Drive
   Hunger is a more complex motivation, involving a variety of nutrients and regulation of
   both short-term and long-term nutrient supplies.
   Taste helps an individual select nutritious foods, avoid dangerous ones, and vary the diet.
   The feeding cycle consists of an absorptive phase, a period of living off nutrients from the
   last meal, and the fasting phase, when reliance shifts to stored nutrients.
   Eating is initiated when low blood levels of glucose and fatty acids are detected in the
   liver. The information is sent to the medulla and to the paraventricular nucleus of the
   hypothalamus, where neuropeptide Y is released to initiate eating.
   Feeding stops when stretch signals from the stomach, increasing glucose levels in the
   liver, and cholecystokinin released in the duodenum indicate that satiety has occurred.
   How much we eat at a meal is also regulated by the amount of fat we have stored,
   indicated by leptin and insulin levels.
   Obesity
   Obesity is associated with malnutrition and with a variety of illnesses.
   A variety of factors, many of them outside the person’s control, contribute to obesity.
   Obesity is partly inheritable, and the environmental influences that exist are not primarily
   from the family.
   As calorie intake decreases, metabolism decreases to defend against weight loss.
   Obesity is difficult to treat, but drugs that increase serotonin activity appear most
   promising, and bariatric surgery is beneficial for more extreme obesity.
   Anorexia, Bulimia, and Binge Eating Disorder
   Anorexia involves restriction of food intake, and sometimes bingeing and purging, to
   reduce weight. Bulimia is a bingeing disease; weight increase is limited by purging or
   exercise.
   Both social pressure and heredity appear to be important in anorexia and bulimia.
   People with binge eating disorder eat excessively during a brief period of time; they are
   typically, but not always, overweight.
   Family and twin studies indicate a strong hereditary component, though few genes have
   been reliably identified. The large amount of individually unique environmental influence
   suggests epigenetic effects.
   Anomalies in serotonin, dopamine, and cannabinoid systems also are implicated.

   For Further Thought
   If a group of nuclei in the brain control a particular homeostatic need, what functions must
   those nuclei carry out?
   What do you think would happen if the brain had no way of monitoring stored fat levels?
   Several of the controls of eating seem to duplicate themselves. Is this wasteful or useful?
   Explain.
   What do you think a complete program of obesity treatment would look like?
   Can you propose another way to organize the three subgroups that make up anorexics and
   bulimics—perhaps even renaming the disorders?

   For Further Reading
   1. In “Overfat and Underfat: New Terms and Definitions Long Overdue,” Phillip Maffetone, Ivan
   Rivera-Dominguez, and Paul Laursen (Frontiers in Public Health, January 3, 2017) argue that
   76% of the world’s population is “overfat.” This includes not only the obese and overweight
   but also people who are normal in weight but carry extra fat, particularly around the belly,
   increasing their risk for chronic and metabolic disease.
   2. Researchers are continuing to discover maternal epigenetic influences on offspring risk of
   obesity, including stress (Obesity Research, 2015, 16, 351–361), high-fat diet (Diabetes, 2016,
   65, 574–584), and poor sleep (Diabetes, 2014, 63, 3230–3241).
   3. There is no shortage of hypotheses about what causes anorexia, but if one possible cause is
   confirmed, it could lead to an additional treatment option. Researchers at the French National
   Institute of Health and Medical Research have found that antibodies to a protein produced by
   normal intestinal bacteria are elevated in anorexia patients, and that the antibodies also attack
   the satiety hormone melanotropin (Translational Psychiatry, 2014, 4, e458.)
   4. “Full Without Food,” by Claire Ainsworth (New Scientist, September 5, 2009, 30–33),
   describes surgery for obesity and emphasizes its benefits for diabetics, as well as the possibility
   of creating drugs that mimic the effects of GLP-1, which is increased following the surgery.

   Bruce Jenner spent his early career as an athlete, playing football at Graceland
   College until a knee injury necessitated a change in sport to decathlon in 1968.
   After years of grueling training and competition, Jenner won a gold medal in
   decathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and became a hero back
   home in the United States. Jenner even graced the cover of Sports Illustrated
   magazine and became the most widely known athlete to be on the cover of a
   Wheaties breakfast cereal box. Leaving athletics behind, he became better
   known as a sports commentator and occasional actor in films and television.
   During this time he had been married three times and fathered six children.
   Throughout the successes in athletics and as an actor, Jenner was struggling with
   a psychological disorder called gender dysphoria, which is the distress that
   people feel when their gender identity does not match their sex at birth. At times
   he dressed as a woman, and he was taking female hormones to try to better
   match his feelings of being female.

   to replace the penis with a vaginal opening. Her memoir The Secrets of My Life

   demonstrated in discussing her gender identity struggles with the public, she
   received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award and Out magazine’s Newsmaker of the
   Year award. Quite possibly the most interesting thing about Caitlyn Jenner’s new
   gender and identity is that she still finds herself sexually attracted to women,
   underscoring the fact that gender identity does not always match a person’s
   sexual orientation.

   Humans have a great affinity for dichotomies, dividing their world into blacks
   and whites with few grays in between. No dichotomy is more significant for
   human existence than that of male and female: One’s sex is often the basis for
   deciding how the person should behave, what the person can do, and with whom
   the person should fall in love. Not only are many of the differences between
   males and females imposed on them by society, but Caitlyn’s experience
   suggests that typing people as male or female may not be as simple or as
   appropriate as we think. We will encounter even more puzzling cases later as we
   take a critical look at the designation of male versus female and the expectations
   that go with it. In the meantime, we need to continue our discussion of
   motivation by considering how sex is like and unlike other drives.
   Sex as a Form of Motivation
   To say that sex is a motivated behavior like hunger may be stating the obvious.
   But theorists have had difficulty categorizing sex with other physiological drives
   because it does not fit the pattern of a homeostatic tissue need. If you fail to eat
   or if you cannot maintain body temperature within reasonable limits, you will
   die. But no harm will come from forgoing sex; sex ensures the survival of the
   species but not of the individual.
   There are, however, several similarities with other drives like hunger and thirst.
   They include arousal and satiation, the involvement of hormones, and control by
   specific areas in the brain. We will explore these similarities as well as some
   differences in the following pages.
   Arousal and Satiation
   The cycle of arousal and satiation is the most obvious similarity between sexual
   motivation and other motivated behaviors such as hunger and thirst. In the
   1960s, William Masters and Virginia Johnson conducted groundbreaking
   research on the human sexual response. Until then, research had been limited to
   observing sexual behavior in animals or interviewing humans about their sexual
   activity. Masters and Johnson (1966) observed 312 men and 382 women and
   recorded their physiological responses during 10,000 episodes of sexual activity
   in the laboratory. This kind of research was unheard of at the time; in fact, the
   researchers had trouble finding journals that would publish their work. Their
   work on human sexual behavior was the subject of the recent Showtime cable
   series Masters of Sex.
   How is sex like and unlike other drives?
   Masters and Johnson identified four phases of sexual response (Figure 7.1). The
   excitement phase is a period of arousal and preparation for intercourse. Both
   sexes experience increased heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, and
   muscle tension. The male’s penis becomes engorged with blood and becomes
   erect. The female’s clitoris becomes erect as well, her vaginal lips swell and
   open, the vagina lubricates, her breasts enlarge, and the nipples become erect.
   While hunger is mostly a function of time since the last meal, sexual arousal is
   more influenced by opportunity and sexual stimuli such as explicit conversation
   or the presence of an attractive person. In contrast to humans, sexual arousal in
   most mammal species is triggered by a surge in hormones. Another difference
   between sex and other drives is that we usually are motivated to reduce hunger,
   thirst, and temperature deviations, but we seek sexual arousal. This difference is
   not unique, though; for example, we might skip lunch to increase the enjoyment
   of a gourmet dinner.
   During the plateau phase, the increase in sexual arousal levels off. Arousal is
   maintained at a high level for seconds or minutes, though it is possible to
   prolong this period. The testes rise in the scrotum in preparation for ejaculation;
   vaginal lubrication increases and the vaginal entrance tightens on the penis.
   During orgasm, rhythmic contractions in the penis are accompanied by
   ejaculation of seminal fluid containing sperm into the vagina. Similar
   contractions occur in the vagina. This period lasts just a few seconds but
   involves an intense experience of pleasure. Orgasm is similar to the pleasure one
   feels after eating or when warmed after a deep chill, but it is unique in its
   intensity; the resolution that follows is reminiscent of the period of quiet
   following return to homeostasis with other drives.
   After orgasm, males have a refractory phase, during which they are unable to
   become aroused or have another orgasm for minutes, hours, or even days,
   depending on the individual and the circumstances. Females do not experience a
   refractory period and can have additional orgasms anytime during the resolution
   phase. When comparing the sex drive with other kinds of motivation, the male
   refractory period has an interesting parallel with sensory-specific satiety (see
   Chapter 6); it is called the Coolidge effect. According to a popular but probably
   questionable story, President Coolidge and his wife were touring a farm when
   Mrs. Coolidge asked the farmer whether the flurry of sexual activity among the
   chickens was the work of one rooster. The farmer answered yes, that the rooster
   copulated dozens of times each day, and Mrs. Coolidge said, “You might point
   that out to Mr. Coolidge.” President Coolidge, so the story goes, then asked the
   farmer, “Is it a different hen each time?” The answer again was yes. “Tell that to
   Mrs. Coolidge,” the president replied. Whether the story is true or not, the
   Coolidge effect—a quicker return to sexual arousal when a new partner is
   introduced—has been observed in a wide variety of species. We will visit the
   subject again shortly.

   The Role of Testosterone
   As important as sex is to humans, it is ironic that so much of what we know
   about the topic comes from the study of other species. One reason is that
   research into human sexual behavior was for a long time considered off-limits,
   and funding was hard to come by. Another reason is that sexual behavior is more
   “accessible” in nonhuman animals; rats have sex as often as 20 times a day and
   are not at all embarrassed to perform in front of the experimenter. In addition, we
   can manipulate their sexual behavior in ways that would be considered unethical
   with humans. Hormonal control in particular is more often studied in animals
   because hormones have a clearer role in animal sexual behavior.
   Castration, or removal of the gonads (testes or ovaries), is one technique used
   to study hormonal effects because it removes the major source of sex hormones;
   castration results in a loss of sexual motivation in nonhuman mammals of both
   sexes. Sexual behavior may not disappear completely, because the adrenal
   glands continue to produce both male and female hormones, though at a lesser
   rate than the gonads. The time course of the decline is also variable, ranging
   from a few weeks to five months in male rats (J. M. Davidson, 1966); across
   several species, animals who are sexually experienced are impaired the least and
   decline the slowest (B. Hart, 1968; Sachs & Meisel, 1994). Humans are less at
   the mercy of fluctuating hormone levels than other animals, but when they are
   castrated (usually for medical reasons, such as cancer), sexual interest and
   functioning decrease in both males and females (Bremer, 1959; Heim, 1981;
   Sherwin & Gelfand, 1987; Shifren et al., 2000). The decline takes longer in
   humans than in rats, but the rate is similarly variable.
   Castration has been elected by some male criminals in the hope of controlling
   aggression or sexual predation, sometimes in exchange for shorter prison
   sentences. Castration is an extreme therapy; drugs that counter the effects of
   androgens (a class of hormones responsible for a number of male
   characteristics and functions) are a more attractive alternative. Those that
   block the production of the androgen testosterone, the major sex hormone in
   males, have been 80%–100% effective in eliminating deviant sexual behavior
   such as exhibitionism and pedophilia (sexual contact with children), along with
   sexual fantasies and urges (A. Rösler & Witztum, 1998; Thibaut, Cordier, &
   Kuhn, 1996). Chemical castration is either allowed on a voluntary basis or
   mandated for some offenses in nine states in the United States (M. Park, 2012)
   and in several other countries. The effects of castration indicate that testosterone
   is necessary for male sexual behavior, but the amount of testosterone required
   appears to be minimal; men with very low testosterone levels can be as sexually
   active as other men (Raboch & Stárka, 1973).
   Frequency of sexual activity does vary with testosterone levels within an
   individual, but the testosterone increases appear to be the result of sexual activity
   rather than the cause. For example, testosterone levels are high in males at the
   end of a period in which intercourse occurred, not necessarily before (J. M.
   Dabbs & Mohammed, 1992; Kraemer et al., 1976). A case report (which is
   anecdotal and does not permit us to draw conclusions) suggests that just the
   anticipation of sex can increase the testosterone level. Knowing that beard
   growth is related to testosterone level, a researcher working in near isolation on a
   remote island weighed the daily clippings from his electric razor. He found that
   the amount of beard growth increased just before planned visits to the mainland
   and the opportunity for sexual activity (Anonymous, 1970).

   Ovulation and Its Suppression by Oral Contraceptives,” by D. B. Adams, A.
   R. Gold, and A. D. Burt, 1978, New England Journal of Medicine, 299(21),
   pp. 1145–1150.
   In most mammals, females are unwilling to engage in sex except during estrus, a
   period when the female is ovulating, sex hormone levels are high, and the
   animal is said to be in heat. Human females and females of some other primate
   species engage in sex throughout the reproductive cycle. Studies of sexual
   frequency in women have not shown a clear peak at the time of ovulation.
   However, initiation of sex is a better gauge of the female’s sexual motivation
   than is her willingness to have sex; women do initiate sexual activity more often
   during the middle of the menstrual cycle, which is when ovulation occurs
   (Figure 7.2; D. B. Adams, Gold, & Burt, 1978; S. M. Harvey, 1987). The
   researchers attributed the effect to estrogen, a class of hormones responsible
   for a number of female characteristics and functions. Their reasons were that
   estrogen peaks at midcycle and the women did not increase in sexual activity if
   they were taking birth control pills, which level out estrogen release over the
   cycle.
   However, testosterone peaks at the same time, and the frequency of intercourse
   during midcycle corresponds to the woman’s testosterone level (N. M. Morris,
   Udry, Khan-Dawood, & Dawood, 1987). At menopause, when both estrogen and
   testosterone levels decline, testosterone levels show the most consistent
   relationship with intercourse frequency (McCoy & Davidson, 1985). How to
   interpret these observations is unclear, because testosterone increases in women
   as a result of sexual activity, just as it does in men (Figure 7.3; J. M. Dabbs &
   Mohammed, 1992). However, studies in which testosterone level was
   manipulated demonstrate that it also contributes to women’s sexual behavior.
   Giving a dose of testosterone to women increases their arousal during an erotic
   film (Tuiten et al., 2000). More important, in women who had their ovaries
   removed, testosterone treatment increased sexual arousal, sexual fantasies, and
   intercourse frequency, but estrogen treatment did not (Sherwin & Gelfand, 1987;
   Shifren et al., 2000).

   Brain Structures and Neurotransmitters
   As neuroscientists developed a clearer understanding of the roles of various
   brain structures, motivation researchers began to shift their focus from drive as a
   tissue need to drive as a condition in particular parts of the brain. Sexual activity,
   like other drives and behaviors, involves a network of brain structures. This
   almost seems inevitable, because sexual activity involves reaction to a variety of
   stimuli, activation of several physiological systems, postural and movement
   responses, a reward experience, and so on. We do not understand yet how the
   sexual network operates as a whole, but we do know something about the
   functioning of several of its components. In this section, you will see some
   familiar terms, the names of hypothalamic structures you learned about in
   Chapter 6. This illustrates an important principle of brain functioning, that a
   particular brain area, even a very small one, often has multiple functions.
   What is the role of testosterone in sexual behavior?
   Two areas are important in sexual behavior in both sexes, the medial preoptic
   area of the hypothalamus and the medial amygdala. The medial preoptic area
   (MPOA) is one of the more significant brain structures involved in male and
   female sexual behavior. (Be careful not to confuse the medial preoptic area
   with the median preoptic nucleus, discussed in Chapter 6. They are both in the
   preoptic area, which you can locate in Figure 6.2.) Stimulation of the MPOA
   increases copulation in rats of both sexes (Bloch, Butler, & Kohlert, 1996;
   Bloch, Butler, Kohlert, & Bloch, 1993), and the MPOA is active when they
   copulate spontaneously (Pfaus, Kleopoulos, Mobbs, Gibbs, & Pfaff, 1993;
   Shimura & Shimokochi, 1990). The MPOA appears to be more responsible for
   performance than for sexual motivation; when it was destroyed in male
   monkeys, they no longer tried to copulate, but instead they would often
   masturbate in the presence of a female (Slimp, Hart, & Goy, 1978).
   What brain structures are involved in sexual behavior?
   The medial amygdala also contributes to sexual behavior in rats of both
   sexes. Located near the lateral ventricle in each temporal lobe, the amygdala
   is involved not only in sexual behavior but also in aggression and emotions.
   The medial amygdala is active while rats copulate (Pfaus et al., 1993), and
   stimulation causes the release of dopamine in the MPOA (Dominguez & Hull,
   2001; Matuszewich, Lorrain, & Hull, 2000). The medial amygdala’s role
   apparently is to respond to sexually exciting stimuli, such as the presence of a
   potential sex partner (de Jonge, Oldenburger, Louwerse, & Van de Poll, 1992).

   Psychobiology (Vol. 2), 1974, New York: Wiley. Reprinted with permission
   of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
   There are other areas that are involved in sexual behavior but only in the
   behaviors of a single sex. Especially significant for males is the sexually
   dimorphic nucleus (SDN), located in the preoptic area (de Jonge et al., 1989).
   The SDN is three to four times larger in male rats than in females (Figure
   7.4; He, Ferguson, Cui, Greenfield, & Paule, 2013), and a male’s level of
   sexual activity is related to the size of the SDN, which in turn depends, at least
   in part, on protection by testosterone from the cell death that occurs during the
   pruning stage shortly after birth (He et al., 2013). Destruction of the SDN
   reduces male sexual activity (de Jonge et al., 1989). The SDN’s connections to
   other sex-related areas of the brain suggest that it integrates sensory and
   hormonal information and coordinates behavioral and physiological responses to
   sensory cues (Roselli, Larkin, Resko, Stellflug, & Stormshak, 2004). Two other
   hypothalamic structures are also important. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN;
   see Figure 6.2) is important for male sexual performance and, particularly, for
   penile erections (Argiolas, 1999). The ventromedial hypothalamus is active in
   females during copulation (Pfaus et al., 1993), and its destruction reduces
   the female’s responsiveness to a male’s advances (Pfaff & Sakuma, 1979).

   Effect.

   for Neuroscience. Reprinted with permission.
   For obvious reasons, we know much less about the brain structures involved in
   human sexual behavior. Functional MRI (fMRI) recording during masturbation
   has confirmed the involvement of the medial amygdala and PVN in human
   sexual activity (Komisaruk et al., 2004). PVN neurons are known to secrete the
   hormone/neuromodulator oxytocin, which contributes to male and female
   orgasm and the intensity of its pleasure (Carmichael, Warburton, Dixen, &
   Davidson, 1994). We will see additional results from human research in the
   discussion of neurotransmitters. We also know that a few brain structures in
   humans differ in size between males and females. Because their contribution to
   sexual behavior is not clear and the size differences may also distinguish
   homosexuals from heterosexuals, we will defer discussion of these structures
   until we take up the subject of sexual orientation.
   Sexual behavior involves several neurotransmitters, but dopamine has received
   the most attention. You saw in Chapter 5 that dopamine level increases in the
   nucleus accumbens during sexual activity, and in this chapter that stimulation of
   the medial amygdala releases dopamine in the MPOA. Dopamine activity in the
   MPOA contributes to sexual motivation in males and females of several species
   (E. M. Hull et al., 1999). In males, dopamine is critical for sexual performance:
   Initially, it stimulates D 1 receptors, activating the parasympathetic system and
   increasing motivation and erection of sexual tissues; as dopamine level
   increases, it activates D 2 receptors, which shifts autonomic balance to the
   sympathetic system, resulting in orgasm and ejaculation. D 2 activity also inhibits
   erection, which probably accounts in part for the sexual refractory period in
   males. Interestingly, dopamine release parallels sexual behavior during the
   Coolidge effect. As you can see in Figure 7.5, it increased in the male rat’s
   nucleus accumbens in the presence of a female, dropped back to baseline as
   interest waned, and then increased again with a new female (Fiorino, Coury, &
   Phillips, 1997). The changes occurred even when the male and female were
   separated by a clear panel, so the dopamine level reflects the male’s interest
   rather than the effects of sexual behaviors.
   Our knowledge about the role of dopamine in human sexual behavior is less
   precise but nevertheless intriguing. Drugs that increase dopamine levels, such as
   those used in treating Parkinson’s disease and stimulants, increase sexual activity
   in humans (Evans, Haney, & Foltin, 2002; Meston & Frolich, 2000). The
   dopamine system has been reported to be active in the ventral tegmental area in
   males during ejaculation (Holstege et al., 2003) and in the nucleus accumbens in
   females during orgasm (Komisaruk et al., 2004). This activity likely reflects a
   reward response, but, significantly, the activated areas also have strong motor
   output to the pelvic floor muscles, which are important in orgasmic activity.
   Variations in the gene for the D 4 receptor (DRD4) are associated with sexual
   arousal and functioning (Ben Zion et al., 2006), and one variant is correlated
   with promiscuity and sexual infidelity (Garcia et al., 2010).
   Ejaculation is also accompanied by serotonin increases in the lateral
   hypothalamus, which apparently contributes further to the refractory period (E.
   M. Hull et al., 1999). Injecting a drug that inhibits serotonin reuptake into the
   lateral hypothalamus increases the length of time before male rats will attempt to
   copulate again and their ability to ejaculate when they do return to sexual
   activity. Humans take serotonin reuptake blockers to treat anxiety and
   depression, and they often complain that the drugs interfere with their ability to
   have orgasms. The antianxiety drug buspirone, by contrast, decreases the release
   of serotonin and facilitates orgasms (Komisaruk, Beyer, & Whipple, 2008).
   An interesting model for the regulation of gender-related aggressive and bonding
   behaviors has been proposed in the steroid/peptide theory of social bonds (van
   Anders, Goldey, & Kuo, 2011). According to this theory, the balance among
   testosterone, oxytocin, and vasopressin determine behaviors such as aggression
   and intimacy (Figure 7.6). As you probably guessed, a high testosterone level in
   either sex increases aggression, but it also impairs the formation of close social
   bonds. Oxytocin (involved in muscle contractions of sexual tissue and in social
   bonding) and vasopressin (a potent neuromodulator of brain activity) modulate
   the form of intimacy and aggression. Antagonistic aggression (which includes
   social dominance, partner acquisition, and defense of partners and territory) is
   seen in those with low levels of vasopressin, whereas protective aggression (such
   as defending children or partners) is seen in those with high levels of
   vasopressin. Intimacy increases oxytocin, but its interaction with testosterone
   levels determines whether that intimacy is sexual (if testosterone is high) or
   nurturing (if testosterone is low). Therefore, testosterone levels determine the
   relative amount of competitive versus nurturing behaviors an individual
   expresses, whereas oxytocin determines the relative amount of social bonding
   versus social isolation.

   Odors, Pheromones, and Sexual Attraction
   Sexual behavior results from the interplay of internal conditions, particularly
   hormone levels, with external stimuli. Sexual stimuli can be anything from
   brightly colored plumage or an attractive body shape to particular odors. Here
   we will examine the role of odors and pheromones in sexual attraction, with
   emphasis on how important they might be for humans.
   Before we launch into this discussion, we need to have a basic understanding of
   the olfactory (smell) system. Olfaction is one of the two chemical senses, along
   with taste. Airborne odorous materials entering the nasal cavity must dissolve in
   the mucous layer overlying the receptor cells; the odorant then stimulates a
   receptor cell when it comes in contact with receptor sites on the cell’s dendrites
   (Figure 7.7). Axons from the olfactory receptors pass through openings in the
   base of the skull to enter the olfactory bulbs, which lie over the nasal cavity.
   From there, neurons follow the olfactory nerves to the nearby olfactory cortex
   tucked into the inner surfaces of the temporal lobes.
   Figure 7.7 The Olfactory and Vomeronasal Systems.
   By varying the number of components in odor mixtures, researchers have
   calculated that humans can distinguish a trillion odors (Bushdid, Magnasco,
   Vosshall, & Keller, 2014). But we do not have a different receptor for each odor,
   and an individual neuron cannot produce the variety of signals required to
   distinguish among so many different stimuli. Researchers have discovered that
   humans have around 400 different receptor genes that produce an equal number
   of receptor types, but additional alleles of some of these genes brings the total to
   about 600 (Olender et al., 2012). Variation in these alleles among individuals
   suggests considerable variation in what different people can smell. We’re pikers
   compared with dogs (800); mice (1,100); and the African elephant, which has
   2,000 different receptor genes (Niimura, Matsui, & Touhara, 2016). Research
   has shown that elephants can distinguish people from different tribes by odor
   and can recognize up to 30 different family members.
   There is a good argument to be made for the nose as a sexual organ. The most
   convincing evidence comes from the study of pheromones, airborne chemicals
   released by an animal that have physiological or behavioral effects on
   another animal of the same species. Most pheromones are detected by the
   vomeronasal organ (VNO), a cluster of receptors also located in the nasal
   cavity. The VNO is illustrated in Figure 7.7, although you will soon see that
   most researchers believe that it is no longer functional in humans, the victim of
   evolution as our ancestors developed color vision and came to rely on visual
   sexual signals (I. Rodriguez, 2004). However, a VNO may not be entirely
   necessary, because some pheromones and pheromone-like odors can be detected
   by the olfactory system when an animal’s VNO has been blocked or eliminated
   surgically (Wysocki & Preti, 2004). The VNO’s receptors are produced by a
   different family of genes, and the VNO and olfactory systems are separate
   neurally (P. J. Hines, 1997). Not surprisingly, in animals the VNO’s pathway
   leads to the MPOA and the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, as well as
   to the amygdala (Keverne, 1999).
   Pheromones can be very powerful, as you know if your yard has ever been
   besieged by all the male cats in the neighborhood when your female cat was “in
   heat.” The female gypsy moth can attract males from as far as two miles away
   (Hopson, 1979). Pheromones provide cues for kin recognition in animals,
   influence cycling of sexual receptivity in female mice, initiate aggression in both
   males and females, and trigger maternal behavior in adults and suckling in
   infants (Wysocki & Preti, 2004). In pigs, the boar exudes androstenone, which
   elicits sexual posturing and receptivity in sows. In fact, pig farmers use
   androstenone as an aid in artificial insemination.
   So, do pheromones play a role in human behavior? In spite of the eagerness with
   which the media and fragrance industry have embraced the topic, the best
   answer appears to be “maybe . . . maybe not.” We certainly don’t see
   pheromones controlling sexual behavior as powerfully as they do in animals; in
   fact, the best candidate for pheromone control of human behavior is the sucking
   and searching movements in infants in response to breast odors of a nursing
   woman (Wyatt, 2016; Wysocki & Preti, 2004). Early interest in the possibility of
   human pheromones was spurred by reports that women living together in dorms
   tended to have synchronized menstrual periods and that this was caused by
   sweat-borne compounds that altered the frequency of luteinizing hormone
   release (Preti, Cutler, Garcia, Huggins, & Lawley, 1986; Preti, Wysocki,
   Barnhart, Sondheimer, & Leyden, 2003; K. Stern & McClintock, 1998). Later
   studies have failed to demonstrate menstrual synchrony almost as often as they
   have succeeded, and the results have been questioned on methodological
   grounds (Z. Yang & Schank, 2006).
   Is there evidence for pheromones in human sexual behavior?
   Several other studies have claimed evidence for an influence of pheromones, or
   at least body odors, on human behavior. This includes amygdala activation from
   smelling the sweat of first-time skydivers (Mujica-Parodi et al., 2009); increased
   intercourse opportunities when using aftershave or perfume containing underarm
   extracts that enhanced the person’s sex-characteristic body odor (Cutler,
   Friedman, & McCoy, 1998; McCoy & Pitino, 2002); higher alcohol
   consumption and sociability in males after exposure to fertile female odors (Tan
   & Goldman, 2015); and men’s higher attractiveness ratings of the scent of
   women’s T-shirts when women were ovulating (Kuukasjärvi et al., 2004).

   Prairie voles are a rare exception among mammals; they mate for life, and if they lose a mate
   they rarely take another partner. The bonding process (as reviewed in L. J. Young & Wang,
   2004) begins with the release of dopamine in reward areas during mating. If dopamine activity
   is blocked by a receptor antagonist, partner preference fails to develop. Sexual activity also
   releases the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin, which are likewise required for bonding to
   take place. Either can facilitate bonding in males or females, but oxytocin is more effective with
   females and vasopressin with males.
   So does any of this apply to humans, who are also monogamous (more or less)? The most
   apparent parallel involves oxytocin. Oxytocin not only facilitates bonding but also causes
   smooth muscle contractions, such as those involved in orgasm and in milk ejection during
   breastfeeding. Blood levels of oxytocin increase dramatically as males and females masturbate
   to orgasm (M. R. Murphy, Checkley, Seckl, & Lightman, 1990). Oxytocin also contributes to
   social recognition, which is necessary for developing mate preferences. Male mice without the
   oxytocin gene fail to recognize females from one encounter to the next (J. N. Ferguson et al.,
   2000), and human males are better at recognizing previously seen photos of women after
   receiving oxytocin (Rimmele, Hediger, Heinrichs, & Klaver, 2009). Men given oxytocin also
   had more activity in the nucleus accumbens while viewing photos of their partners, and they
   increased their ratings of their partners’ attractiveness, but not of other women they knew
   (Scheele et al., 2013).
   Oxytocin’s bonding effects are not limited to mates and sex partners. Mother-infant bonding is
   correlated with oxytocin levels during pregnancy and following birth (Feldman, Weller,
   Zagoory-Sharon, & Levine, 2007), and a gene for the oxytocin receptor is related to parenting
   sensitivity (Bakermans-Kranenburg & van IJzendoorn, 2008). Oxytocin also apparently explains
   empathetic behavior in prairie voles. Though we can’t speculate about what the rodents are
   “feeling,” they respond to a cagemate’s earlier, unobserved stress with increased grooming, and
   they match the cagemate’s fear response, anxiety-related behaviors, and corticosterone increase
   (Burkett et al., 2016). Consoling behavior did not occur if the animals received an infusion of an
   oxytocin receptor antagonist into the lateral ventricles.
   But there is no shortage of critics. They point out that no human secretion has
   been identified as a pheromone, including the “putative human pheromones”
   regularly used in research studies (Wyatt, 2016; Wysocki & Preti, 2004).
   Although these compounds may have physiological effects, so do plant odors.
   Pepper oil, fennel oil, and rose oil can change blood pressure and catecholamine
   levels (including adrenaline), and the scent of lemon oil increases positive mood.
   In addition, pheromone studies are criticized for their small sample size, lack of
   statistical power, lack of replication, and publication bias—the tendency to
   publish positive results and shelve negative ones. In spite of these concerns, at
   least one of the critics agrees that we’re able to identify family members by odor
   and that smell may influence our choice of sexual partner, but he attributes these
   abilities to a finely tuned sense of smell rather than pheromones (Wyatt).
   In most animals, attraction is fleeting, lasting only through copulation or, at best,
   till the end of the mating season. For a few species, though, pair bonding occurs
   for years or for a lifetime, as we see in the accompanying Application.

   The Biological Determination of Sex
   Now we need to talk about differences between the sexes and the anomalies
   (exceptions) that occur. Sex is the term for the biological characteristics that
   divide humans and other animals into the categories of male and female.
   Gender refers to the behavioral characteristics associated with being male or
   female. For our purposes, it will be useful to make two further distinctions:
   Gender role is the set of behaviors society considers appropriate for people
   of a given biological sex, whereas gender identity is the person’s subjective
   feeling of being male or female. The term sex cannot be used to refer to all
   these concepts, because the characteristics are not always consistent with each
   other. Thus, classifying a person as male or female can sometimes be difficult.
   You might think that the absolute criterion for identifying a person’s sex would
   be a matter of chromosomes, but you will soon see that it is not that simple.
   Chromosomes and Hormones
   You may remember from Chapter 1 that when cells divide to produce sex cells,
   the pairs of chromosomes separate, and each gamete—the sperm or egg—
   receives only 23 chromosomes. This means that a sex cell has only one of the
   two sex chromosomes. In mammals, an egg will always have an X chromosome,
   but a sperm may have either an X chromosome or a Y chromosome. The
   procreative function of sexual intercourse is to bring the male’s sperm into
   contact with the female’s egg, or ovum. When the male ejaculates into the
   female’s vagina, the sperm use their tail-like flagella to swim through the uterus
   and up the fallopian tubes, where the ovum is descending. As soon as one sperm
   penetrates and enters the ovum, the ovum’s membrane immediately becomes
   impenetrable so that only that sperm is allowed to fertilize the egg. The sperm
   makes its way to the nucleus of the ovum, where the two sets of chromosomes
   are combined into a full complement of 23 pairs. After fertilization, the ovum
   begins dividing, producing the billions of cells that make up the human fetus. If
   the sperm that fertilizes the ovum carries an X sex chromosome, the fetus will
   develop into a female; if the sperm’s sex chromosome is Y, the child will be a
   male (Figure 7.8).
   For the first month, XX and XY fetuses are identical. Later, the primitive gonads
   (testes and ovaries, the primary reproductive organs) in the XX individual
   develop into ovaries, where the ova (eggs) develop. The Müllerian ducts
   develop into the uterus, the fallopian tubes, and the inner vagina, while the
   Wolffian ducts, which would become the male organs, wither and are absorbed
   (Figure 7.9). The undifferentiated external genitals become the clitoris, the outer
   segment of the vagina, and the labia, which partially enclose the entrance to the
   vagina (Figure 7.10).
   What makes a person male or female?
   Figure 7.8 Female and Male X and Y Chromosomes.
   If the fetus receives a Y chromosome from the father, the SRY (sex-determining
   region Y) gene on that chromosome produces a protein that causes the primitive
   gonads to develop into testes, the organs that will produce sperm. The testes
   begin secreting two types of hormones (Haqq et al., 1994). Müllerian inhibiting
   hormone defeminizes the fetus by causing the Müllerian ducts to
   degenerate. Testosterone, the most prominent of the androgens, masculinizes
   the internal organs: The Wolffian ducts develop into the seminal vesicles,
   which store semen, and the vas deferens, which carry semen from the testes
   to the penis. A derivative of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, masculinizes
   the external genitals. The same structures that produce the clitoris and the labia
   in the female become the penis and the scrotum, into which the testes descend
   during childhood.

   1999, Fig. 3.2 p. 46. Stamford, CT: Cengage Learning.
   In the absence of a Y chromosome (and SRY gene), the primitive gonads of the
   XX fetus develop into ovaries. The ovaries won’t begin producing estrogens
   until later, but in humans default sex is female, and the uterus, vagina, clitoris,
   and labia will all develop without benefit of hormones. You should understand
   that it is not entirely accurate to speak of hormones as being “male” or “female.”
   The testes and ovaries each secrete both androgens and estrogens, although in
   differing amounts; the adrenal glands of the kidney also secrete small amounts of
   both kinds of hormones.
   Figure 7.10 Differentiation of Male and Female Genitals.
   Source: Based on Netter (1983).
   The hormonal effects we have been discussing are called organizing effects.
   Organizing effects mostly occur prenatally and shortly after birth; they
   affect structure and are lifelong in nature. Organizing effects are not limited
   to the reproductive organs; they include sex-specific changes in the brains of
   males and females as well, at least in nonhuman mammals. Activating effects
   can occur at any time in the individual’s life; they are reversible changes
   that can come and go as hormone levels change. Some of the changes that
   occur during puberty are examples of activating effects.
   During childhood, differences between boys and girls other than in the genitals
   are relatively minimal. Boys tend to be heavier and stronger, but there is
   considerable overlap. Boys also are usually more active and more aggressive,
   and interests diverge at an early age. Marked differences appear about the time
   the child enters puberty, usually during the preteen years. At puberty, a surge of
   estrogens from the ovaries and testosterone from the testes completes the process
   of sexual differentiation that began during prenatal development. Organizing
   effects include maturation of the genitals and changes in body size. Activating
   effects include breast development in the girl and muscle increases and hair
   growth in the boy. In addition, the girl’s ovaries begin releasing the ova that have
   been there since birth (i.e., she begins to ovulate), and she starts to menstruate.
   Boys’ testes start producing sperm, and ejaculation becomes possible. More
   important from a behavioral perspective, sexual interest increases dramatically,
   and in the majority of cases, preference for same-sex company shifts to an
   attraction to the other sex, along with an interest in sexual intimacy.
   Prenatal Hormones and the Brain
   Several characteristics and behaviors can be identified as male typical and others
   as female typical. This does not mean that the behaviors are somehow more
   appropriate for that sex but simply that they occur more frequently in one sex
   than in the other. These differences are not absolute. For example, consider the
   stereotypical sexual behavior of rats: The male mounts the female from behind,
   while the female curves her back and presents her hindquarters in a posture
   called lordosis. However, females occasionally mount other females, and males
   will sometimes show lordosis when approached by another male.
   The same hormonal influence responsible for the development of male gonads
   and genitals affects behavior as well. A male rat will display lordosis (arching of
   the back) and accept the sexual advances of other males if he was castrated
   shortly after birth or if he was given a chemical that blocks androgens just before
   birth and for a short time postnatally (after birth). Similarly, a female rat given
   testosterone during this critical period will mount other females at a higher rate
   than usual as an adult (Figure 7.11; Gorski, 1974). These behaviors apparently
   result from the influence of testosterone on the size and function of several brain
   structures; in other words, the presence of testosterone masculinizes certain brain
   structures. That statement is somewhat misleading, though, because it is
   estradiol, the principal estrogen hormone, that carries out the final step of
   masculinization. When testosterone enters a neuron, it is converted to estradiol
   by a chemical process called aromatization. At the critical time when brain
   masculinization occurs, aromatase increases in the areas that are to be
   masculinized (Horvath & Wikler, 1999).
   What is the effect of “sexualizing” the brain?

   Functions,” in G. Dörner (Ed.), Endocrinology of Sex (pp. 30–37). Leipzig:

   Until recently, it was believed that feminization of the brain, like the sex organs,
   required only the absence of testosterone; now we know that just as
   masculinization of the male brain requires estradiol, so does feminization of the
   female brain. Female knockout mice born unable to produce estradiol display
   less sexual interest and receptivity toward males or females as adults than do
   other mice, even when they are given replacement estrogens (Bakker, Honda,
   Harada, & Balthazart, 2002, 2003). Just as the male brain must be masculinized
   and the female brain feminized, the male brain must also be defeminized. Again,
   estrogens are necessary; male knockout mice lacking the estrogen receptor
   showed normal male sexual behavior but also were receptive to advances of
   other males (Kudwa, Bodo, Gustafsson, & Rissman, 2005).
   This sexualization of the brain is reflected in behavioral differences, affecting
   not only sexual activity but also play behavior, spatial activity, and learning
   performance (see Collaer & Hines, 1995). Do hormones have a similar influence
   in humans? In the following pages we will try to answer that question.

   Gender-Related Behavioral and Cognitive Differences
   In his popular book Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus, John Gray
   (1992) said that men and women communicate, think, feel, perceive, respond,
   love, and need differently, as if they are from different planets and speaking
   different languages. How different are men and women? This question is not
   easily answered, but it is not for lack of research on the topic. The results of
   studies are often ambiguous and contradictory. One reason is that different
   researchers measure the same characteristic in different ways. Also, the research
   samples are often too small to yield reliable results, and the subjects are usually
   not selected in a manner that ensures accurate representation of the population.
   Whether the differences that do exist are influenced by biology or are solely the
   product of experience is controversial. Contemporary parents often make efforts
   to rear their children equally, but it can be difficult to separate oneself from
   ingrained societal expectations; parents who claimed equality as a childrearing
   value were found to verbalize differently and play differently with a child
   dressed as a girl than when the same child was dressed as a boy (Culp, Cook, &
   Housley, 1983). Differential rearing, of course, could account for marked
   differences in behavior, temperament, and self-expectations.
   Some Demonstrated Male-Female Differences
   Back in 1974, Eleanor Maccoby and Carol Jacklin reviewed more than 2,000
   studies and concluded that the evidence firmly supported three differences in
   cognitive performance and one difference in social behavior: (1) Girls have
   greater verbal ability than boys, (2) boys excel in visual-spatial ability, (3) boys
   excel in mathematical ability, and (4) boys are more aggressive than girls. Later
   research has supported these differences to some extent, but with qualifications.
   First, there is considerable overlap between males and females in these
   characteristics. Second, the differences are rather specific. For example, females
   excel in verbal fluency and writing but not in reading comprehension or
   vocabulary (Eagly, 1995; Hedges & Nowell, 1995), and male spatial
   performance exceeds females’ most on tasks requiring mental rotation of a three-
   dimensional object (like the one in Figure 7.12) and less on other spatial tasks
   (Hyde, 1996). More significantly, the differences have narrowed during the
   ensuing four-plus decades, particularly for the cognitive abilities.
   Figure 7.12 A Spatial Rotation Task.
   Stories of Brain & Behavior
   Origins of Male-Female Differences
   The best evidence that the three cognitive differences mentioned earlier are
   partially the result of experience is that they have decreased over the years,
   presumably as gender roles and expectations have changed (Hedges & Nowell,
   1995; Hyde, 1996; Voyer, Voyer, & Bryden, 1995). In fact, testing of 7 million
   students indicates that the gender difference in average mathematical
   performance has disappeared in the United States, although boys are slightly
   overrepresented at both the lower and higher extremes (Hyde, Lindberg, Linn,
   Ellis, & Williams, 2008). Similar trends were found in a study of 89 countries,
   and data suggested that progress is due to increasing gender equality (Kane &
   Mertz, 2012). In addition, the dramatic variation in murder rate in different
   countries suggests there is also a strong cultural influence on aggression; for
   example, the murder rate in 2014/2015 was 57.15 per 100,000 of population in
   Venezuela, 4.88 in the United States, 0.92 in the United Kingdom, and 0.31 in
   Japan (“List of Countries,” n.d.).
   Although environmental influences play a significant role, gender differences in
   cognition and behavior also owe a great deal to biology. Most often, researchers
   attribute the differences to the effects of estrogen and testosterone, particularly
   on the organizational development of the brain during gestation. Supporting this
   view is the fact that gender differences in the volume of different brain areas
   correspond to the density of sex hormone receptors in those areas (J. M.
   Goldstein et al., 2001). Because the effects of sex hormones on brain
   development are most evident in people with atypical sexual development, we
   will hold that discussion for the next section and focus here on activating effects
   occurring after birth.
   How do we explain the differences in verbal and spatial abilities and in
   aggression?
   Males who produce low amounts of testosterone during the developmental years
   are impaired later in spatial ability (Hier & Crowley, 1982), and testosterone
   replacement in older men improves their spatial functioning (Janowsky, Oviatt,
   & Orwoll, 1994). Individuals born men who take estrogens because they identify
   as females (transgender women) increase their scores on verbal fluency tasks,
   but they lose spatial performance; transgender men taking testosterone lose
   verbal ability but improve in spatial performance (for references, see Hulshoff
   Pol et al., 2006). Men kill 30 times as often as women do (Daly & Wilson,
   1988), and testosterone is usually blamed for this difference. However, whether
   testosterone is the cause or the result of aggression is questioned because a
   variety of studies show, for example, that winning a sports competition increases
   testosterone and losing decreases it (Archer, 1991). Aggression in males is partly
   inheritable; genetic effects account for about half the variance in aggression, and
   aggression is moderately correlated in identical twins even when they are reared
   apart (Rushton, Fulker, Neale, Nias, & Eysenck, 1986; Tellegen et al., 1988).
   The source of aggression is a complex subject, and we will deal with it more
   thoroughly in Chapter 8.
   In The News: GTEx Project Provides New Insight Into the Differences Between the Sexes
   In the years since completion of the Human Genome Project, researchers have focused on
   understanding how differences in genes’ ability to create proteins, or gene expression, can
   provide insight into typical versus atypical human functioning. The Genotype-Tissue Expression
   (GTEx) Project, which began in 2010, aims to identify differences in gene expression in tissues
   and organs that have been donated from hundreds of different people, with the hope of better
   understanding diseases (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2016). Researchers at the
   Weizmann Institute of Science have recently used some of the GTEx data to determine why
   human males and females differ in disease risk, behavior, and body type in spite of sharing most
   genes (Gershoni & Pietrokovski, 2017). Of the approximately 20,000 genes that they examined,
   the researchers identified more than 6,500 that were expressed differently in at least one tissue
   of males compared with females. Sex-based gene expression differences were found not just in
   the reproductive organs and mammary glands but also in the heart, the skin, the liver, and parts
   of the brain. These differences in gene expression likely relate to sex differences not only in fat
   storage, body hair, and milk production and release but also in medical issues such as drug
   responsiveness, heart muscle disease, and risk for Parkinson’s disease. Of particular interest,
   there were more mutations in male-specific genes than female-specific genes, suggesting that
   natural selection acts less strongly on males than females, possibly since males can create many
   more offspring in a lifetime (due to both gestation time and the Coolidge effect).
   Thought Questions
   1. Why might so many genes be expressed differently in males and females?
   2. What sorts of sex differences in behavior might be explained by gene expression
   differences?

   Differences in brain functioning are also cited as bases for gender differences.
   Jerre Levy (1969) hypothesized that women outperform men on verbal tests
   because they are able to use both hemispheres of the brain to solve verbal
   problems rather than mostly the left hemisphere. This idea has obviously been
   controversial; there has been some support from fMRI studies, but there have
   also been negative findings, and a meta-analysis of fMRI studies during
   language tasks found no lateralization differences between males and females
   (Sommer, Aleman, Bouma, & Kahn, 2004). This doesn’t settle the issue,
   according to Harrington and Farias (2008), who claim that many fMRI studies
   are not as methodologically rigorous as they could be, and point out that gender
   differences should be expected only on some types of tasks. A more recent
   strategy has been to measure functional connectivity. Some support for Levy’s
   hypothesis comes from studies that found greater connectivity within
   hemispheres in males and greater connectivity between the hemispheres in
   females (Ingalhalikar et al., 2014; Tomasi & Volkow, 2012).
   A meta-analysis of spatial performance did confirm gender differences, with
   males relying primarily on the right hemisphere and females showing no
   hemisphere preference (J. M. Vogel, Bowers, & Vogel, 2003). Imaging studies
   indicate that men use parietal areas to perform spatial rotations, whereas women
   rely more on frontal areas (reviewed in Andreano & Cahill, 2009), and that
   men’s scores on the task are correlated with the amount of cortical surface in the
   parietal lobes (Koscik, O’Leary, Moser, Andreasen, & Nopoulos, 2009). In an
   fMRI study, men performed a spatial memory task by activating the right
   hippocampus, whereas women relied on the left hippocampus and reported using
   a verbal strategy (Frings et al., 2006).
   There are also several other indications that male and female brains work
   differently. Males and females have different patterns of brain activation during
   learning (Andreano & Cahill, 2009), pain (Naliboff et al., 2003), and stress (J.
   Wang et al., 2007). Males are genetically more resistant to pain, and males and
   females respond differently to different pain medications (J. Bradbury, 2003).
   Men are less affected by stress (Matud, 2004), and, as you will see in subsequent
   chapters, males are more susceptible to autism, Tourette syndrome, and
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, whereas women are more likely to suffer
   from depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Research described in the
   accompanying In the News feature suggests that some of these differences may
   be due to male-female differences in expression of their genes.
   The value of studying these differences is not to determine whether one sex is
   smarter or more aggressive or healthier than the other but to understand what
   contributes to the characteristics in either sex. Keep in mind that aside from
   physical strength and possibly aggressiveness, the differences are small and do
   not justify discrimination in society or in the workplace. We are far more alike
   than we are different; this is a reason to use the term other sex instead of
   opposite sex. There are real differences, though, and an understanding of their
   origins could help us enhance intellectual development, reduce violence, and
   cure or manage diseases. From a scientific perspective, that knowledge also
   helps us understand how the brain develops, an issue that we will continue to
   pursue in the next two sections.

   What are the origins of male-female differences in verbal and spatial abilities?
   What are the arguments for environmental origins and for biological origins of male-female
   differences in cognitive abilities and behaviors?
   Biological Origins of Gender Identity
   For decades, sex researchers have argued about what shapes an individual’s
   gender identity, with some believing it is formed in the first few years of life by a
   combination of rearing practices and genital appearance (Money & Ehrhardt,
   1972) and others claiming that chromosomes and hormones are more important
   (M. Diamond, 1965). Our earlier discussion of the effects of XY and XX
   chromosomes was the simple version of the sex-determination story; in reality,
   development sometimes takes an unexpected turn. As you will soon see, the
   results not only challenge our definition of what is male and what is female but
   also tell us a great deal about the influence of biology on gender.
   There is no one biological parameter that clearly defines sex.
   —Eric Vilain
   Gender Dysphoria
   Individuals who believe they have been born into the wrong sex are referred
   to as transgender. They may dress and live as the other sex, take hormones to
   feminize or masculinize their bodies, or undergo surgery for sex reassignment. It
   is estimated that 0.1%–0.5% of people in the United States and the United
   Kingdom have taken some steps to transition to the other sex (Gates, 2011).
   Distress that people may feel due to the perception that their sex does not
   match their gender is called gender dysphoria. The best therapeutic outcomes
   have resulted from the requested hormonal and surgical treatment rather than
   psychotherapy alone (Saraswat, Weinand, & Safer, 2015). Gender dysphoria is
   estimated to occur in 0.005%–0.014% of adult males and in 0.002%–0.003% of
   adult females (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Gender dissatisfaction
   that appears as early as three or four years of age appears to be due mostly to
   family environmental influences (Knafo, Iervolino, & Plomin, 2005); among
   adolescents the heritability is estimated at 62%, with the remainder due to
   nonfamily environmental influence (Coolidge, Thede, & Young, 2002). Specific
   genes that have been identified are alleles of the CYP17 gene and the AR gene.
   The first increases testosterone levels in female-to-male transgender individuals
   (Bentz et al., 2008) and the second reduces sensitivity to androgen in male-to-
   female transgender individuals (Hare et al., 2009); the researchers believe these
   genes lead to masculinization of the female brain and a failure to masculinize the
   male brain.

   How could an individual’s genitals and brain develop at variance with each
   other? They differentiate sexually at different times during gestation, the genitals
   during the first two months and the brain during the last half, presumably
   allowing them to fall under the influence of independent processes (Bao &
   Swaab, 2011). Several studies suggest that the brains of transgender individuals
   have followed a different developmental path, finding that various brain
   structures are more like those of their identified sex than of their birth sex in
   size, shape, or patterning (reviewed in Saraswat et al., 2015). The third
   interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3) is larger in men
   than in women and is thought to be the human counterpart of the sexually
   dimorphic nucleus. It and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc, which
   controls autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behavioral responses) are larger in
   males than in females, but they have been reported to be female sized in male-to-
   female transgender individuals (Figure 7.13; Garcia-Falgueras & Swaab, 2008;
   Kruijver et al., 2000; J. N. Zhou, Hofman, Gooren, & Swaab, 1995). INAH3 is
   believed to correspond to the sexually dimorphic nucleus in animals. Female-
   typical brain responses have also been reported in male-to-female transgender
   individuals. In a study with presumed pheromones, an androgen derivative found
   in male sweat (4, 16-androstadien-3-one, or AND) activated the anterior
   hypothalamus, whereas an estrogen-like compound found in female urine
   (estratetraenol, or EST) did not (Berglund, Lindström, Dhejne-Helmy, & Savic,
   2008). In a second study, when male-to-female transgender individuals viewed
   an erotic video, their pattern of brain responses resembled those of women rather
   than men (Gizewski et al., 2009). The studies are vulnerable to a variety of
   criticisms, however: Some, though not all, of the studies are potentially
   contaminated because the subjects were undergoing hormone treatment; studies
   have rarely been replicated, and results from attempts have been inconsistent;
   and “data-snooping” brain scans—measuring a large number of structures
   because the researcher doesn’t know what to look for—increases the probability
   of incorrectly identifying one of them as different, especially in the small
   samples that are typical of research on transgender individuals.
   For a variety of reasons, obtaining reliable data on gender identity has not been
   easy; the sexual variations described in the sections that follow serve as “natural
   experiments” that provide valuable, and sometimes dramatic, additional
   information.
   46 XY Difference in Sexual Development
   At puberty Jan had failed to develop breasts or to menstruate; instead, her voice
   deepened, and her body became muscular, while her clitoris grew to a length of 4
   centimeters (1½ inches) and her vaginal lips partially closed, giving the
   appearance of a male scrotum. Once comfortable with her tomboyishness, she
   was now embarrassed by her appearance and increasingly masculine
   mannerisms; she withdrew from peers, and her school performance began to
   suffer. To everyone’s surprise, her doctor discovered two undescended testes in
   her abdomen and no ovaries. After a psychiatric evaluation, Jan’s parents and
   doctors offered Jan the opportunity to change to a male sexual identity. She
   immediately went home and changed into boy’s clothing and got a boy’s haircut.
   The family moved to another neighborhood where they were unknown. At the
   new high school, Jack became an athlete, excelled as a student, was well
   accepted socially, and began dating girls. Surgeons finished closing the labia and
   moved the testes into the newly formed scrotum. He developed into a muscular,
   6-foot-tall male with a deep voice and a heavy beard. At the age of 25 he
   married, and he and his wife reported a mutually satisfactory sexual relationship
   (Imperato-McGinley, Peterson, Stoller, & Goodwin, 1979).
   Today Jack would be diagnosed with 46 XY difference in sexual development
   (46 XY DSD), meaning that he had a typical number of chromosomes,
   including an X and a Y chromosome, but his sexual development was
   atypical for those chromosomes. The term adopted by practitioners in 2006
   used the word disorder in place of difference. Some observers contend that
   sexual development is a continuum, and prefer the term difference in place of
   disorder; in respect for that view, we will use DSD here to mean “difference in
   sexual development.” These variations in development have a variety of causes.
   The reason for Jack’s unusual development was a deficiency in an enzyme (17α-
   hydroxysteroid) that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone;
   dihydrotestosterone masculinizes the external genitalia before birth. The large
   surge of testosterone at puberty enabled his body partially to carry out that
   process.
   A deficiency in another enzyme, 5α-reductase, also reduces dihydrotestosterone
   levels and delays genital development; this deficiency is genetic and is most
   likely to occur when there is frequent intermarriage among relatives. Of 18 such
   individuals in the Dominican Republic who were reared unambiguously as girls,
   all but one made the transition to a male gender identity after puberty, and 15
   were living or had lived with women (Imperato-McGinley, Peterson, Gautier, &
   Sturla, 1979). The men said they realized they were different from girls and
   began questioning their sex between the ages of 7 and 12. Although their
   transition argues for the influence of genes and hormones on gender identity,
   such a conclusion must be tentative because the individuals had a great deal to
   gain from the switch in a society that puts a high premium on maleness (Cohen-
   Kettenis, 2005).
   Eden Atwood (Figure 7.14) is a widely acclaimed jazz singer. She has recorded
   and performed all over the world and with the biggest names in jazz. Ms.
   Atwood is also remarkable for having been born with XY chromosomes and two
   testes. Her androgen insensitivity syndrome, a form of 46 XY DSD, is caused
   by a genetic absence of androgen receptors, which results in insensitivity to
   androgen. Müllerian inhibiting hormone suppresses development of most of the
   female internal organs, but because the individual is unaffected by androgens,
   the testes do not descend and the external genitals develop as more or less
   feminine (depending on the degree of insensitivity), with a shallow vagina. If the
   genitals are mostly feminine, the child is reared as a girl, and at puberty her body
   is further feminized by estrogen from the testes and adrenal glands. The
   condition may not be recognized until menstruation fails to occur at puberty or
   when unsuccessful attempts to become pregnant lead to a more complete
   medical examination. In the absence of testosterone’s influence, androgen-
   insensitive individuals tend to have well-developed breasts and a flawless
   complexion. Because these characteristics are often combined with long, slender
   legs, androgen-insensitive males repeatedly turn up among female fashion
   models (J. Diamond, 1992).

   46 XX Difference in Sexual Development
   A female fetus may be partially masculinized by excess androgen and by
   some hormone treatments during fetal development, resulting in 46 XX
   difference in sexual development. The internal organs are female, because no
   Müllerian inhibiting hormone is released, but the external genitals are virilized to
   some extent; that is, they have some degree of masculine appearance. In extreme
   cases, the clitoris is as large as a newborn male’s penis, and the external labia are
   partially or completely fused to give the appearance of an empty scrotum.
   Figure 7.15 illustrates one cause of 46 XX DSD; congenital adrenal hyperplasia
   (CAH), which results from an enzyme defect that causes the individual’s
   adrenal glands to produce large amounts of androgen during fetal
   development and after birth until the problem is treated. Postnatal hormone
   levels can be normalized by administering corticosteroids, and the parents often
   choose reconstructive surgery to reduce the size of the clitoris and eliminate
   labial fusion, giving the genitals a more feminine appearance. If masculinization
   is more pronounced, the parents may decide to rear the child as a boy; in that
   case, the surgeons usually finish closing the labia and insert artificial testes in the
   scrotum to enhance the masculine appearance. Recent work indicates that the
   most common cause of CAH, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, can be detected in the
   womb and treated with a synthetic corticosteroid to reduce genital ambiguity
   (Nimkarn & New, 2010).

   Obviously, sex cannot always be neatly divided between male and female. Some
   experts believe that two categories are not sufficient to describe the variations in
   masculinity and femininity. Anne Fausto-Sterling (1993) advocates at least five
   sexual categories. The ones between male and female are often referred to as
   intersex conditions, a term that is not used in the medical profession but is
   preferred by many individuals. It would be easy to get caught up in the unusual
   physical characteristics of these individuals and to be distracted from our
   question: What makes a person male or female? This question is the topic of the
   accompanying Application as well as the next few pages.
   Cognitive and Behavioral Effects
   As mentioned earlier, reversing the sex hormone balance during prenatal
   development changes the brain and later behavior in nonhuman animals. Is it
   possible that masculinization and feminization of the developing brain account
   for sex differences in behavior and cognitive abilities in humans as well? If so,
   then we would expect the behavior and abilities of individuals who have
   experienced an excess or a deficit of androgen during prenatal development to be
   at odds with their chromosomal sex.
   That is indeed the case. Androgen-insensitive males are like females in that their
   verbal ability is higher than their spatial performance, and their spatial
   performance is lower than that of other males (Imperato-McGinley, Pichardo,
   Gautier, Voyer, & Bryden, 1991; Masica, Money, Ehrhardt, & Lewis, 1969). And
   though there have been contradictory results, evidence favors increased spatial
   ability in CAH women (Puts, McDaniel, Jordan, & Breedlove, 2008). Androgen-
   insensitive 46 XY individuals also are typically feminine in behavior, have a
   strong childbearing urge, and are decidedly female in their sexual orientation (M.
   Hines, 1982; Money, Schwartz, & Lewis, 1984; J. M. Morris, 1953). Although
   95% of CAH women reared as girls accept a female identity, they also show
   behavioral shifts in the masculine direction (Dessens, Slijper, & Drop, 2005).
   They have been reported to be tomboyish in childhood (M. Hines); to prefer
   boys’ toys, such as trucks and building blocks (Berenbaum, Duck, & Bryk,
   2000); and to draw pictures more typical of boys, using darker colors and
   including mechanical objects and excluding people (Iijima, Arisaka, Minamoto,
   & Arai, 2001). They also more often report male-dominated occupational
   choices (30% vs. 13%), interest in rough sports (74% vs. 50%), and interest in
   motor vehicles (14% vs. 0%; Frisén et al., 2009). There is evidence that these
   effects are due to androgen levels before birth rather than during postnatal
   development (Berenbaum et al., 2000). Homosexual or bisexual orientation has
   been reported to be as high as 37% (Money et al., 1984) and at 19% in a recent
   larger study (Frisén et al.).
   What are the behavioral implications of 46 XX and 46 XY DSD?
   Some critics claim that humans are sexually neutral at birth, and they attribute
   the cognitive and behavioral effects we have just seen to feminine or ambiguous
   rearing in response to the child’s genital appearance. (You may be beginning to
   appreciate the deficiencies of natural experiments.) However, some of the
   findings are difficult to explain from a socialization perspective. For example,
   the anti-miscarriage drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) given to women in the 1950s
   and 1960s has an androgen-like effect in the brain but does not virilize the
   genitals, yet DES-exposed daughters reported increased homosexual fantasy and
   behavior (Ehrhardt et al., 1985; Meyer-Bahlburg et al., 1995). In another study,
   girls exposed to a similar drug and who had nonvirilized genitals scored higher
   in aggression than their unexposed sisters (Reinisch, 1981). In addition, the fact
   that androgen-insensitive 46 XY individuals perform even lower on spatial tests
   than their unaffected sisters and female controls (Imperato-McGinley et al.,
   1991) can be explained by insensitivity to androgens but not by “feminine
   rearing.”
   The evidence accumulated so far strongly suggests that man is no exception with regard to
   the influence of sex steroids on the developing brain and subsequent behavior.

   When Caster Semenya of South Africa won the gold medal in the 800-meter race at the 2009
   World Championships in Athletics, her strong performance and masculine physique aroused
   suspicions about her gender. Fueled by years of media reports that some female competitors
   might actually be men, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and the
   International Olympic Committee (IOC) had introduced routine gender testing in the 1960s (J.
   L. Simpson et al., 1993). However, physical examination was soon rejected as unacceptable to
   many women, and chromosome testing turned out to be inadequate as a measure of performance
   advantage. For example, Barr body analysis, which identifies cells with XX chromosomes,
   rejects androgen-insensitive XY individuals though they receive no benefit from testosterone,
   but it would pass XXY males, who do benefit. The IOC and the IAAF ended routine testing in
   the 1990s, though both reserved the authority to request gender identification on an individual
   basis.
   Semenya agreed to an IAAF request to undergo extensive gender testing. In the meantime,
   reports were leaked that Semenya had two testes and triple the normal level of testosterone for a
   female. The IAAF said that if the reports turned out to be accurate, it would pay for corrective
   surgery; the surgery would remove the internal testes, which have a high risk for cancer, and
   eliminate the source of the extra testosterone. When the IAAF received the report, it did not
   reveal the results to the public, but nearly a year after the championships, Semenya was cleared
   to compete again—as a woman. Some sexual activists argue that if society would place less
   emphasis on gender, whether a person is male or female wouldn’t matter, but this case suggests
   there is a need for better understanding of what it means to be male or female.
   The IOC tried to skirt the gender issue in 2012 by announcing it would bar athletes from
   competing as females if they had normal male levels of androgens and were responsive to
   androgens. However, this policy on hyperandrogenism was suspended in 2015 when female
   Indian sprinter Dutee Chand, who had a high testosterone level, brought suit in the Court of
   Arbitration for Sport (Branch, 2015). The court decided that evidence demonstrating
   testosterone-related increased athletic performance in women was lacking and gave the IAAF
   until 2017 to provide data supporting its claim for hormone-induced enhanced female
   performance.

   Ablatio Penis and Other Natural Experiments
   The “neutral-at-birth” theorists claim that individuals reared in opposition to
   their chromosomal sex generally accept their sex of rearing and that this
   demonstrates that rearing has more effect on gender role behavior than
   chromosomes or hormones (studies reviewed in M. Diamond, 1965). Diamond,
   who advocates a “sexuality-at-birth” hypothesis, argues that the reason
   individuals with ambiguous genitals accept their assigned gender is that sex of
   rearing is usually decided by whether the genital appearance is predominantly
   masculine or feminine, which in turn reflects the influence of prenatal hormones.
   According to Diamond, there was no case in the literature where an
   unambiguously male or female individual was successfully reared in opposition
   to the biological sex. He and others (such as Money, Devore, & Norman, 1986)
   have described several instances in which individuals assigned as one sex
   successfully shifted to their chromosomal and gonadal sex in later years, long
   after the assumed window for forming gender identity (the first few years of life)
   had closed. Failures in predicting the later gender identity of a child with
   ambiguous genitals has led several experts (along with the advocacy group
   Accord Alliance) to advocate waiting until the child can give informed consent,
   or at least indicates a clear gender preference; others are reluctant to see the child
   subjected to the social difficulties that result from an ambiguous appearance.
   In 1966, an eight-month-old boy became the most famous example of resistance
   to sexual reassignment when the surgeon using electrocautery to perform a
   circumcision turned the voltage too high and destroyed the boy’s penis (called
   ablatio penis). After months of consultation and agonizing, Bruce’s parents
   decided to let surgeons transform his genitals to feminine-appearing ones. While
   sounding radical even today, this has remained the recommended practice for
   ablatio penis cases. The neutral-at-birth view was widely accepted then, and the
   psychologist John Money counseled the parents that they could expect their son
   to adopt a female gender identity (M. Diamond & Sigmundson, 1997). Bruce
   would be renamed Brenda, and “she” would be reared as a girl. This case study
   had two characteristics lacking in other “natural experiments”: The child was
   normal before the accident, and he happened to have an identical twin brother
   who served as a control.
   Over the next several years, Money (1968; Money & Ehrhardt, 1972) reported
   that Brenda was growing up feminine, enjoying her dresses and hairdos, and
   choosing to help her mother in the house, while her “typical boy” brother played
   outside. But developmental progress was not nearly as smooth as Money
   claimed (M. Diamond & Sigmundson, 1997). Brenda was in fact a tomboy who
   played rough-and-tumble sports and fought, preferred her brother’s toys and
   trucks over her dolls, and even preferred to urinate in a standing position. She
   had private doubts about her sex beginning in the second grade, decided she was
   a boy at age 11, and decided to switch to living as a male at 14. Only then did
   Brenda’s father tell her the story of her sexual transition in infancy. Then, said
   Brenda, “everything clicked. For the first time things made sense and I
   understood who and what I was” (p. 300).
   Gender identity is sufficiently incompletely differentiated at birth as to permit successful
   assignment of a genetic male as a girl.
   —John Money
   An extensive search of the literature reveals no case where a male or female without some
   sort of biological abnormality . . . accepted an imposed gender role opposite to that of his
   or her phenotype.
   —Milton Diamond
   Brenda changed her name to David and requested treatment with testosterone,
   removal of the breasts that had developed under estrogen treatment, and
   construction of a penis. The person who was isolated and teased as a girl was
   accepted and popular as a boy, and he attracted girlfriends. At age 25, he married
   Jane and adopted her three children. Although he was limited in his sexual
   performance, he and Jane engaged in sexual play and occasional intercourse.
   But life was still not ideal. He brooded about his childhood and was often angry
   or depressed; after 14 years, Jane told him they should separate for a while.
   Troubled by his past and his present, and perhaps a victim of heredity—his
   mother had attempted suicide, his father became an alcoholic, and his twin
   brother died of an overdose of antidepressants—one spring day in 2004 David
   Reimer took his own life (Figure 7.16; Colapinto, 2004).

   Although only seven cases of ablatio penis have been examined in the literature,
   there are numerous instances of male infants born with a missing or
   underdeveloped penis, not involving hormonal causes. These include
   malformation of the pelvic area (cloacal exstrophy) and absence of a penis
   (penile agenesis). All of these conditions require decisions about surgical
   intervention and gender rearing (Meyer-Bahlburg, 2005). In 311 such individuals
   reared as male, all accepted that role, with only one indicating possible gender
   dysphoria. Of the 77 reared as females, 22% transitioned later to male and 13%
   more exhibited possible gender dysphoria. In another study of individuals with
   cloacal exstrophy who were assigned a female gender shortly after birth, most
   exhibited male-like behaviors and had switched to a male persona later in life
   (Reiner & Gearhart, 2004). The accompanying Application describes a recent
   case that highlights the need for better understanding when a child’s gender must
   be chosen.

   How do the sexual anomalies require you to rethink the meaning of male and female?
   What reasons can you give for thinking that the brains of people with sexual anomalies have
   been masculinized or feminized contrary to their chromosomal sex?
   Sexual Orientation
   Sex researchers, along with the rest of us, spend a great deal of time arguing
   about why some people are attracted to members of the same sex. Whether we
   know it or not, we are also asking why most people are heterosexual. The answer
   to that question may seem obvious, but the fact that a behavior is nearly
   universal and widely accepted does not mean that it requires no explanation.
   People who are attracted to members of their own sex may be able to tell us not
   only about homosexuality but also about the basis for sexual orientation in
   general.
   Why is it difficult to measure sexual orientation rates?
   It is difficult to estimate how many people are homosexual; the numbers vary
   from study to study and from one country to another, due to differences in
   definition and sampling methods, as well as reluctance to admit membership in a
   stigmatized group. In a review of nine studies, the average rate in the United
   States was 3.5%, with Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Norway
   ranging from 1.2% to 2.1% (Gates, 2011). In the United States, prevalence was
   equally divided between men and women. Although almost two thirds of the
   nonheterosexual men identified themselves as exclusively homosexual, only one
   third of nonheterosexual women did so. Interestingly, when Gallup asked
   Americans what percentage of the U.S. population they thought was gay or
   lesbian, the average answer was 23% (Newport, 2015). That response hasn’t
   changed significantly since 2002, in spite of increasing acceptance of
   homosexuality and access to greater information. Homosexual experiences are
   fairly common, especially during adolescence and in the absence of heterosexual
   opportunities. Almost 8% of the population have had at least one same-sex
   sexual encounter, and as many as 11% report same-sex attraction (Gates, 2011).
   As Ellis and Ames (1987) point out, these experiences do not make a person
   homosexual any more than occasional heterosexual activity makes a person
   heterosexual. About 1% of people express no interest in sex at all (Bogaert,
   2004). Asexuality is gaining acceptance as an additional category of preference.
   Research does not support the belief that gay men are necessarily feminine and
   lesbians are masculine; only about 44% of gays and 54% of lesbians fit those
   descriptions (Bell, Weinberg, & Hammersmith, 1981). Even then, they usually
   identify with their biological sex, so gender role, gender identity, and sexual
   orientation are somewhat independent of each other and probably have different
   origins.

   M.C. was born diagnosed with ovotesticular DSD; he had a normal penis and a scrotum and
   testosterone levels were high, but there was a small vaginal opening below his penis. His
   physicians recommended corrective surgery, but even though he was identified as male at birth,
   four months later they decided he would be reassigned as a girl. Because M.C. was a ward of the
   state, the South Carolina Department of Social Services approved the surgery, which was
   performed at the age of 16 months, just 3 months before he was adopted by Pam and Mark
   Crawford. M.C. behaved more like a boy than a girl; he wanted a haircut like his dad, and he
   wanted to use the men’s restroom and to be referred to as a boy. At the age of 7 he chose to
   begin living as a boy, an identity supported by his family, friends, school, pediatrician, and
   religious leaders. M.C.’s adoptive parents filed a legal suit against the Medical University of
   South Carolina, the Greenville Health System, and the Department of Social Services, on the
   grounds that the decision should have been left to the boy. Defense attorneys got the case
   dismissed from federal court by arguing that the doctors had no way of knowing at the time that
   they were violating M.C.’s constitutional rights, but the state case is proceeding. (For sources,
   see On the Web at the end of the chapter.)
   It is not clear what causes homosexuality, which means that we do not know
   how to explain heterosexuality either. There is considerable evidence for
   biological influences on sexual orientation, or else the topic would not appear in
   this chapter. But because social influences are commonly believed to be more
   important, we will consider this position first.
   The Social Influence Hypothesis
   It has been argued that homosexuality arises from parental influences or is
   caused by early sexual experiences. Bell and his colleagues (1981) expected to
   confirm these influences when they studied 979 gay and 477 heterosexual men.
   But they found no support for frequently hypothesized environmental influences,
   such as seduction by an older male or a dominant mother and a weak father.
   Several developmental experiences do seem to differentiate homosexuals from
   heterosexuals, and these have been considered evidence for a social learning
   hypothesis (Van Wyk & Geist, 1984). But these experiences—such as spending
   more time with other-sex playmates in childhood, learning to masturbate by
   being masturbated by a member of the same sex, and homosexual contact by age
   18—can just as easily be interpreted as reflecting an early predisposition to
   homosexuality. In fact, Bell and his associates (1981) concluded that adult
   homosexuality “is just a continuation of the earlier homosexual feelings and
   behaviors from which it can be so successfully predicted” (p. 186; italics in the
   original). However, they did find more evidence for an influence of learning on
   bisexuality than on exclusive homosexuality. This suggests that there might be a
   biological influence that varies in degree, with experience making the final
   decision in the individuals with weaker predispositions for homosexuality.
   Among homosexuals, 70% remember feeling “different” as early as four or five
   years of age (Bell et al., 1981; Savin-Williams, 1996). Memories of feelings are
   suspect, because they are easily distorted in light of today’s circumstances.
   Memories of behavior are somewhat more reliable, and home videos from
   childhood are better yet. These behavioral measures show a high rate of gender
   nonconformity, including mannerisms and dress typical of the other sex, a
   tendency to engage in activities usually preferred by the other sex, and an
   atypical preference for other-sex playmates and companions while growing
   up (Bell et al., 1981; Rieger, Linsenmeier, Gygax, & Bailey, 2008). If we are to
   entertain a biological hypothesis of sexual orientation, though, we must come up
   with some reasonable explanation for how it is formed and how it is altered.
   There are three biological approaches to the question: genetic, hormonal, and
   neural.
   Genetic and Epigenetic Influences
   Twin and family studies provide the most documented evidence for a biological
   basis for sexual orientation. Homosexuality is seen two to seven times more
   often among the siblings of homosexuals than it is in the general population (J.
   M. Bailey & Bell, 1993; J. M. Bailey & Benishay, 1993; Hamer, Hu, Magnuson,
   Hu, & Pattatucci, 1993). Studies in the early 1990s reported concordances of
   about 50% in identical twins for both men and women (J. M. Bailey & Pillard,
   1991; J. M. Bailey et al., 1993). However, when subjects were recruited without
   regard to their sexual preference, concordances for men fell to 37% in one study
   and 18% in another, and women’s concordances dropped to 30% and 22% (J. M.
   Bailey, Dunne, & Martin, 2000; Långström, Rahman, Carlström, & Lichtenstein,
   2010). Presumably the earlier data suffered from volunteer bias, due to
   homosexual individuals’ greater willingness to volunteer if they had a
   homosexual sibling.

   Sex Sexual Behavior: A Population Study of Twins in Sweden,” by N.
   Långström, Q. Rahman, E. Carlström, and P. Lichtenstein, 2010, Archives
   of Sexual Behavior, 39, pp. 75–80.
   The search for specific genes has been frustrating, which is not uncommon when
   multiple genes are involved; because any number of combinations of the genes
   can produce the behavior, a particular gene can have a significant effect in one
   study and go undetected in the next. The most successful research on male
   homosexuality has involved a stretch of DNA on the X chromosome. Dean
   Hamer and his associates (1993) focused their attention there because gay men
   have more gay relatives on the mother’s side of the family than on the father’s
   side, and the mother contributes only X chromosomes to her sons. They found
   that 64% of the pairs of gay brothers they studied shared identical genetic
   material at one end of the X chromosome, in the region designated as Xq28
   (Figure 7.17a). The location received additional confirmation in a meta-analysis
   of the five studies available in 1999 (Hamer, 1999), a whole-genome study in
   2005 (Mustanski et al., 2005), and a recent unusually large study of 409 pairs of
   homosexual brothers (Sanders et al., 2015). The gene itself has not been
   identified yet, however. The Sanders study also supported linkage at 8q12, which
   had been tentatively identified a decade earlier. A whole-genome study
   implicated a stretch of DNA on chromosome 7 in the 7q36 region (Mustanski et
   al.), and a later study of Chinese homosexual men implicated an allele of the
   SHH gene there (Figure 7.17b; B. Wang et al., 2012). SHH contributes to the
   patterning of organ development, from growth of fingers to organization of the
   brain, but it is also involved in male-male sexual activity, at least in fruit flies.
   Female sexual orientation, by contrast, does not appear to be linked to 7q36 (S.
   Hu et al., 1995; Ngun & Vilain, 2014).
   What is the evidence for a biological basis for homosexuality?
   Evidence that homosexuality is influenced by genes presents a Darwinian
   contradiction; how could homosexuality survive when its genes are unlikely to
   be passed on by the homosexual individual? Italian researchers have offered an
   intriguing proposal; the birth rate is higher in women on the mother’s side of the
   family of male homosexuals, so they conclude that genes responsible for
   homosexuality also increase the women’s birth rate—compensating for the
   homosexual’s lack of productivity (Camperio Ciani, Corna, & Capiluppi, 2004;
   Iemmola & Camperio Ciani, 2009). A later analysis indicated that this effect is
   best explained by two genes, at least one of which is on the X chromosome; the
   researchers also suggested that the genes increase attraction to men, in both men
   and women (Camperio Ciani, Cermelli, & Zanzotto, 2008).
   In the face of recent data indicating that environmental influences are stronger
   than previously thought, we need to look further for the sources. As you can see
   in Figure 7.18, unique environmental factors are much greater than shared
   (family) influences (Långström et al., 2010). At the age of three or four, when
   prehomosexual feelings and behaviors typically appear, there has been little
   opportunity for social influences outside the family to come into play; this means
   that the prenatal environment is the more likely source of these unique
   influences. A variety of epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed as a prenatal
   factor. In females, one of each pair of X chromosomes in every cell is turned off
   by methylation; which of the two X chromosomes gets turned off usually varies
   randomly from cell to cell. However, inactivation of the same chromosome
   occurred in 90% of the cells in 13% of women with a homosexual son and 23%
   of the mothers of two or more gay sons, compared with only 4% of women with
   no gay sons (Bocklandt, Horvath, Vilain, & Hamer, 2006). Another suggestion is
   that an epigenetic modification of testosterone sensitivity that occurs in a parent
   as compensation for an atypical testosterone level could be passed on to the
   offspring (W. R. Rice, Friberg, & Gravilets, 2012). If a man with low
   testosterone transfers his increased sensitivity to a daughter, or a woman with
   high testosterone transfers her decreased sensitivity to a son, it could have
   significant effects on the offspring’s sexual and gender development. In the most
   promising effort so far, researchers at UCLA studying identical twins discordant
   for homosexuality identified a pattern of methylation in five DNA regions; the
   pattern predicted which individuals were homosexual with 70% accuracy (Ngun
   et al., 2015). The researchers cautioned that it is too early to know how well this
   predictive ability will generalize outside the sample.

   Prenatal Influences on Brain Structure and Function
   For early researchers, the most obvious biological explanation was that
   homosexuality is due to atypical sex hormone levels. Their attempts to reverse
   male homosexuality by administering testosterone not only were not successful
   but often increased homosexual activity (for references, see A. C. Kinsey,
   Pomeroy, Martin, & Gebbard, 1953). Later studies measured hormonal levels
   and found no evidence of either a deficit or an excess of sex hormones (Gartrell,
   1982; Meyer-Bahlburg, 1984). However, by manipulating hormonal levels
   during gestation and shortly after birth, researchers were able to produce same-
   sex preference in rats, hamsters, ferrets, pigs, and zebra finches (for references,
   see LeVay, 1996).
   Which brain structures are different in homosexual males?
   Critics say this effect has no bearing on human behavior, claiming that
   spontaneous homosexual behavior occurs in animals only when members of the
   other sex are unavailable and that it does not represent a shift in sexual
   orientation. However, about 10% of male sheep prefer other males as sex
   partners, and some form pair bonds in which they take turns mounting and
   copulating anally with each other (Perkins & Fitzgerald, 1992). A few female
   gulls observed on Santa Barbara Island off the coast of California form “lesbian”
   pairs—courting, attempting copulation, taking turns sitting on their nest, and
   sharing parenting if some of the eggs were fertilized during an “unfaithful”
   interlude with a male (Hunt & Hunt, 1977; Hunt, Newman, Warner, Wingfield,
   & Kaiwi, 1984). A shortage of males could be a contributing factor, but the
   gulls’ behavior is atypical of opportunistic homosexuality in that the majority of
   birds stay paired for more than one season.
   If sex hormones play a role in human sexual orientation, they probably do so by
   altering brain development during gestation. It is difficult to measure prenatal
   hormone levels in humans, so researchers have looked for evidence for hypo- or
   hyper-masculinization of homosexuals’ brains by examining differences known
   or thought to be influenced by sex hormones during development. A few
   differences in brain structures have been reported, including equal-sized cerebral
   hemispheres in gay males and straight women, with a larger right hemisphere in
   lesbian females and heterosexual men (Savic & Lindström, 2008); and a female-
   sized INAH3 (Figure 7.19; LeVay, 1991) and suprachiasmatic nucleus (Swaab &
   Hofman, 1990) in gay men. In rats, blocking the effects of testosterone in male
   rats during the prenatal period and shortly after birth increased the number of
   vasopressin-secreting cells; as adults, the rats preferred the company of a
   sexually active male rather than an estrous female, and they showed lordosis and
   accepted mounting from the male (Swaab, Slob, Houtsmuller, Brand, & Zhou,
   1995). From a functional perspective, a few studies have reported that
   homosexual males perform better on verbal tests and poorer on spatial tests than
   do heterosexual men (Figure 7.20; Collaer, Reimer, & Manning, 2007; C. M.
   McCormick & Witelson, 1991; Rahman, Abrahams, & Wilson, 2003). Evidence
   that homosexual women perform like men has been inconsistent (Collaer et al.,
   2007; Gladue, Beatty, Larson, & Staton, 1990; Rahman et al., 2003). Also, some
   studies have reported that homosexual men and women respond to presumed
   pheromones similarly to members of the other sex (Figure 7.21; Savic, Berglund,
   & Lindström, 2005; W. Zhou et al., 2014). Finally, relative finger length is
   considered a marker of fetal androgen exposure, and the ratio of index finger to
   ring finger length has been reported to be male typical in lesbian women (T. J.
   Williams et al., 2000).

   (AAAS). Reprinted with permission from AAAS.
   You will notice that most of the differences relate to males; this is partly due to
   an unfortunate research focus on male homosexuality and partly because the
   results have more often been negative when studying females. The latter may be
   because homosexual women are more often bisexual, which could lead to
   disparate results; for that reason, studies should divide nonheterosexual women
   into two groups. Something else you might have picked up on is that these
   studies are several years old. That is not damning in itself, but it should be
   disturbing that most of these lines of research—on such a socially controversial
   topic—have not seen replication. We are faced with the dilemma whether to
   draw conclusions based on either a single study or a few studies with
   inconsistent results, or to suspect that subsequent studies have yielded negative
   results, which often don’t find their way into print. At this point we lack a clear
   idea of what forces determine human sexual preference. What does seem likely
   is that the answer will turn out to be a multiplicity of factors, rather than any
   single influence.
   The most powerful sex organ is between the ears, not between the legs.

   Social Implications of the Biological Model
   As is often the case, the research we have been discussing has important social
   implications. If homosexuality is a choice, as argued by some, then U.S. civil
   rights legislation does not apply to homosexuals, because protection for
   minorities depends on the criterion of unalterable or inborn characteristics
   (Ernulf, Innala, & Whitam, 1989). About 75% of homosexuals believe that
   homosexuality is inborn, and that they have no choice (Leland & Miller, 1998).
   When Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts (Figure 7.22) was asked if
   he ever considered whether switching to the straight life was a possibility, he
   replied, “I wished it was. But it wasn’t. I can’t imagine that anybody believes
   that a 13-year-old in 1953 thinks, ‘Boy, it would be really great to be a part of
   this minority that everybody hates and to have a really restricted life’” (Dreifus,
   1996, p. 25).
   But some people in the gay community think that promoting this view is not in
   their best interest. For them, the biological model is associated too closely with
   the old medical “disease” explanation of homosexuality. They fear that
   homosexuals will be branded as defective, or even that science may find ways to
   identify homosexual predisposition in fetuses and that parents will have the
   “problem” corrected through genetic manipulation or abortion. Emotions are so
   strong among some homosexuals that the researcher Dick Swaab was physically
   attacked in Amsterdam by members of the Dutch gay movement, who felt
   threatened by his biological findings (Swaab, 1996).
   Figure 7.22 Former U.S. Congressman Barney Frank.
   Other gay and lesbian rights activists welcome the biological findings because
   they think that belief in biological causation will increase public acceptance of
   homosexuality. Polls indicate they are right; in a survey of four different
   cultures, 56%–85% of people who believed homosexuals are “born that way”
   held significantly more positive views (Ernulf et al., 1989). In the United States,
   moral acceptance of homosexuality has risen from 40% in 2001 to 60% in 2016,
   and in the past 20 years belief that same-sex marriage should be legal has
   increased from 27% to 61% (“Gay and Lesbian Rights,” 2016). The nature-
   nurture debate will not be settled to everyone’s satisfaction anytime soon, but
   most researchers believe that when we understand the origins of homosexuality
   and heterosexuality, they will include a combination of heredity, hormones,
   neural structures, and experience (LeVay, 1996).

   In Perspective
   The fact that sex is not motivated by any tissue deficit caused researchers to look
   to the brain for its basis. What they found was a model for all drives that focused
   on the brain rather than on tissue that lacked nutrients or water or was too cold.
   This view changed the approach to biological motivation, and it meant that
   gender identity and gender-specific behavior and abilities might all be
   understood from the perspective of the brain.
   The fact that a person’s sexual appearance, gender identity, and behavior are
   sometimes in contradiction with each other or with the individual’s
   chromosomes makes sex an elusive concept. Research is helping us understand
   that many differences between the sexes are cultural inventions and that many
   differences thought to be a matter of choice have biological origins. As a result,
   society is slowly coming around to the idea that distinctions should not be made
   on the basis of a person’s sex, sexual appearance, or sexual orientation. These
   issues are emotional, as are the important questions behind them: Why are we
   attracted to a particular person? Why are we attracted to one sex and not the
   other? Why do we feel male or female? The emotion involved often obscures an
   important point: that the answers keep leading us back to the brain, which is why
   some have called the brain the primary sex organ.
   Why is the search for a biological basis of homosexuality a social issue?
   As for being gay, I never felt I had much choice. . . . I am who I am. I have no idea why.
   —Congressman Barney Frank
   Chapter Summary
   Sex as a Form of Motivation
   Although there is no tissue deficit, sex involves arousal and satiation like other drives, as
   well as hormonal and neural control. Also like the other drives, sex can be thought of as a
   need of the brain.
   The key elements in human sexual behavior are testosterone, structures in the
   hypothalamus, and sensory stimuli such as certain physical characteristics and
   pheromones.
   The Biological Determination of Sex
   Differentiation as a male or a female depends on the combination of X and Y
   chromosomes and the presence or absence of testosterone.
   Testosterone controls the differentiation not only of the genitals and internal sex organs
   but also of the brain.
   Gender-Related Behavioral and Cognitive Differences
   Evidence indicates that females exceed males in verbal abilities and that males are more
   aggressive and score higher in visual-spatial abilities. Males also score more often at the
   extremes of mathematical ability.
   With the possible exception of mathematical ability, it appears that these differences are
   at least partly due to differences in the brain and in hormones.
   Biological Origins of Gender Identity
   Transgender individuals and people with sexual variations challenge our idea of male and
   female.
   The cognitive abilities and altered sexual preferences of people with sexual anomalies
   suggest that the human brain is masculinized or feminized before birth.
   Sexual Orientation
   The idea that sexual orientation is entirely learned has not fared well.
   Evidence indicates that homosexuality, and thus heterosexuality, is influenced by genes,
   prenatal hormones (and possibly other factors), and brain structures.
   The biological view is controversial among homosexuals, but most believe that it
   promotes greater acceptance, and research suggests that this is the case.

   Do you think the cognitive differences between males and females will completely disappear
   in time? If not, would they in an ideal society? Explain your reasons.
   Some people believe that parents should have their child’s ambiguous genitals corrected early,
   and others think it is better to see what gender identity the child develops. What do you think,
   and why?
   Do you think neuroscientists have made the case yet for a biological basis for homosexuality?
   Why or why not?

   When Jane was 15 months old, she was run over by a vehicle. The injuries
   seemed minor, and she appeared to recover fully within days of the accident. By
   the age of 3, however, her parents noticed that she was largely unresponsive to
   verbal or physical punishment. Her behavior became progressively disruptive,
   and by the age of 14 she had to be placed in the first of several treatment
   facilities. Although her intelligence was normal, she often failed to complete
   school assignments. She was verbally and physically abusive to others, she stole
   from her family and shoplifted frequently, and she engaged in early and risky
   sexual behavior that resulted in pregnancy at the age of 18. She showed little if
   any guilt or remorse; empathy was also absent, which made her dangerously
   insensitive to her infant’s needs. Because her behavior put her at physical and
   financial risk, she became entirely dependent on her family and social agencies
   for financial support and management of her personal affairs.

   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that there was damage to Jane’s
   prefrontal cortex, which is necessary for making judgments about behavior and
   its consequences. People who sustain damage to this area later in life show an
   understanding of moral and social rules in hypothetical situations, but they are
   unable to apply these rules in real-world situations, so they regularly make
   choices that lead to financial losses and the loss of friends and family
   relationships (Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Lee, 1999). People like Jane,
   whose injury occurred in infancy, cannot even verbalize these rules when
   confronted with a hypothetical situation, and their moral development never
   progresses beyond the motivation to avoid punishment; they not only make a
   mess of their own lives but also engage in behavior that harms others as well,
   like stealing (S. W. Anderson, Bechara, Damasio, Tranel, & Damasio, 1999).
   My own brain is to me the most unaccountable of machinery—always buzzing, humming,
   soaring, roaring, diving, and then buried in mud. And why? What’s this passion for?
   —Virginia Woolf
   Emotion enriches our lives with, as the writer Virginia Woolf put it, its “buzzing,
   humming, soaring, and roaring.” It also motivates our behavior: Anger
   intensifies our defensive behavior, fear accelerates flight, and happiness
   encourages the behaviors that produce it. Emotion adds emphasis to experiences
   as they are processed in the brain, making them more memorable (A. K.
   Anderson & Phelps, 2001); as a result, we are likely to repeat the behaviors that
   bring joy and avoid the ones that produce danger or pain. Although Jane was
   intelligent, her injury left her unable to learn from her emotional experiences.
   According to Antonio Damasio (1994), reason without emotion is inadequate for
   making the decisions that guide our lives and, in fact, make up our lives.
   Emotion and the Nervous System
   If asked what emotion means, you would probably think first of what we call
   “feelings”—the sense of happiness or excitement or fear or sadness. Then you
   might think of the facial expressions that go along with these feelings: the
   curled-up corners of the mouth during a smile, the knit brow and red face of
   anger. Next you would probably visualize the person acting out the emotion by
   fleeing, striking, embracing, and so on. Emotion is all these and more; a working
   definition might be that emotion is an increase or a decrease in physiological
   activity that is accompanied by feelings that are characteristic of the
   emotion and often accompanied by a characteristic behavior or facial
   expression. Having said that mouthful, we suspect you will understand why
   Joseph LeDoux (1996) wrote that we all know what emotion is until we attempt
   to define it. We will talk about these different facets of emotion in the following
   pages, along with some practical implications in the form of aggression and
   health.
   Autonomic and Muscular Involvement in Emotion
   To the neuroscientist, the most obvious component of emotional response is
   sympathetic nervous system activation. You may remember from Chapter 3 that
   the sympathetic system activates the body during arousal; it increases heart rate
   and respiration rate, increases sweat gland activity, shuts down digestion, and
   constricts the peripheral blood vessels, which raises the blood pressure and
   diverts blood to the muscles. As you will see in the section on stress, the
   sympathetic system also stimulates the adrenal glands to release various
   hormones, particularly cortisol. At the end of arousal, the parasympathetic
   system puts the brakes on most bodily activity, with the exception that it
   activates digestion. In other words, the sympathetic nervous system prepares the
   body for “fight or flight”; in contrast, the parasympathetic system generally
   reduces activity and conserves and restores energy (Figure 8.1).
   What effect does the autonomic nervous system have during emotions?
   Of course, muscular activation is involved in the external expression of emotion,
   such as smiling or fleeing or attacking. It is also a part of the less obvious
   responses of emotion, such as the bodily tension that not only prepares us to act
   but also produces a headache and aching muscles when we try to write a paper
   the night before it is due. Autonomic and muscular arousal are adaptive, because
   they prepare the body for an emergency and help it carry out an appropriate
   response. They are also an important part of the emotion itself, though the exact
   nature of their contribution has been the subject of controversy. Fortunately, as
   you will see from the following discussion, competing theories are one of the
   engines driving research and scientific advancement.
   How do the James-Lange and cognitive theories disagree? What evidence is
   there for each?
   The Role of Feedback From the Body
   A bit over a century ago, the American psychologist William James (1893) and
   Danish physiologist Carl Lange (1885/2010) independently proposed what has
   come to be known as the James-Lange theory: Emotional experience results
   from the physiological arousal that precedes it, and different emotions are
   the result of different patterns of arousal. In our discussion of research ethics
   in Chapter 4, we talked about an experiment by Albert Ax (1953) in which
   subjects either were made angry by an insulting experimenter or were frightened
   by the possibility of a dangerous electric shock. Consistent with the James-
   Lange theory, the two emotions were accompanied by different patterns of
   physiological activity. Seventy years after James and Lange, Stanley Schacter
   and Jerome Singer (1962) took a contrary position in their cognitive theory; they
   stated that the identity of the emotion is based on the cognitive assessment
   of the situation, and physiological arousal contributes only to the emotion’s
   intensity. Their research demonstrated how easily people could misidentify
   emotions depending on the environmental context. For example, young men who
   were interviewed by an attractive woman while crossing a swaying footbridge
   230 feet above a rocky river included more sexual content in brief stories they
   wrote later and were more likely to call the phone number the young woman
   gave them than were men who were interviewed 10 minutes after crossing the
   bridge (D. G. Dutton & Aron, 1974).
   We feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble.
   —William James, 1893
   Studies like these have not determined that one theory is right and the other is
   wrong. Barlassina and Newen (2013) argue that neither is adequate; in their
   integrative embodiment theory of emotions they maintain that bodily sensations
   are a critical component of emotions, but these perceptions must be integrated
   with cognitive information. Nevertheless, incorrect theories can be useful if they
   generate research, and the competition between these two has produced valuable
   insights into emotion. A good example is the contribution of facial expressions
   to emotional experience. Experimenters have had to be very inventive in doing
   facial expression studies; obviously, they can’t just tell people to smile or frown
   and then ask them what emotion they’re feeling. Paul Ekman and his colleagues
   (Levenson, Ekman, & Friesen, 1990) instructed subjects to contract specific
   facial muscles to produce different expressions (Figure 8.2); for example, to
   produce an angry expression, subjects were told to pull their eyebrows down and
   together, raise the upper eyelid, and push the lower lip up with the lips pressed
   together (p. 365). The posed facial expressions for happiness, fear, anger,
   disgust, sadness, and surprise each resulted in the experience of the intended
   emotion, along with a distinct pattern of physiological arousal.
   Figure 8.1 Comparison of Sympathetic Activity During Emotional Arousal With
   Parasympathetic Activity During Relaxation.

   Induced facial poses also influence how the person interprets the environment.
   Volunteers rate a stimulus as more painful when they are making a sad face than
   a happy or neutral one (Salomons, Coan, Hunt, Backonja, & Davidson, 2008),
   and college students rate Far Side cartoons as more amusing when they are
   holding a pen between the teeth, which induces a sort of smile, than when they
   hold the pen between the lips, producing a frown (Strack, Martin, & Stepper,
   1988). More strikingly, women who have had their corrugator muscles paralyzed
   by injecting botulinum toxin (Botox) to remove frown lines are unable to frown,
   and they report less negative mood—even if they don’t perceive themselves as
   more attractive (M. B. Lewis & Bowler, 2009). In addition, when these women
   attempt to imitate angry expressions, they produce less activation of the
   amygdala than women who have not had Botox treatment (Figure 8.3;
   Hennenlotter et al., 2009).
   Some researchers suggest that feedback from emotional expressions has another
   role besides contributing to our emotional experience in that it also helps us
   understand other people’s emotions; this ability is critical to social
   communication and to societal success. This view is supported by studies of
   mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are neurons that respond both when we
   engage in a specific act and while observing the same act in others. They
   were first discovered when researchers noticed that neurons that were active
   while monkeys reached for food also responded when the monkeys saw the
   researcher picking up a piece of food (di Pellegrino, Fadiga, Fogassi, Gallese, &
   Rizzolatti, 1992); similar correlations have been observed in other brain areas,
   including those involved in emotions (see review in Bastiaansen, Thioux, &
   Keysers, 2009). Observing another person’s emotional expressions activates
   emotional areas in our own brains, and the amount of activity is related to scores
   on a measure of empathy (Chakrabarti, Bullmore, & Baron-Cohen, 2006). The
   accompanying In the News feature describes research showing that our
   socioeconomic class affects our empathic ability.
   Figure 8.2 Emotional Expressions Posed Using Ekman’s Instructions.

   Our observation of other people’s emotions is not entirely passive; we also
   mimic their gestures, body posture, tone of voice, and (often imperceptibly)
   facial expressions (Bastiaansen et al., 2009). Just as feedback during our own
   emotional activity adds to our own emotional experience, feedback from
   imitated expressions may help us empathize with the emotions of others. Indeed,
   interfering with facial mimicry by engaging the required muscles in other
   activities (such as chewing gum) impairs subjects’ ability to recognize happiness
   and disgust in photos (Oberman, Winkielman, & Ramachandran, 2007). Women
   who have Botox treatments also rate facial photos and sentences as less
   emotional than before treatment (Baumeister, Papa, & Foroni, 2016). People
   with autism typically have trouble understanding other people’s emotions,
   perhaps in part because their imitation of emotional expressions is delayed by
   about 160 milliseconds (Oberman, Winkielman, & Ramachandran, 2009).

   A system this complex requires an equally complex control system. We will turn
   our attention now to the brain structures responsible for emotion.
   The Emotional Brain
   In the late 1930s and 1940s, researchers proposed that emotions originated in the
   limbic system, a network of structures arranged around the upper brain
   stem (Figure 8.4). As complex as this system is with its looping
   interconnections, we now know that this hypothesis is an oversimplification;
   emotion involves structures at all levels of the brain, from the prefrontal area to
   the brain stem (A. R. Damasio et al., 2000). Also, we know that some of the
   limbic structures are more involved in non-emotional functions. For example,
   the hippocampus and mammillary bodies have major roles in learning. The
   concept of a limbic system is less important as a description of how emotion
   works than for spawning a tremendous volume of research that has taken us in
   diverse directions, which we will explore over the next several pages.
   What are some of the brain structures involved in emotions, and what are their
   functions?
   Much of what we know about the brain’s role in emotion comes from lesioning
   and stimulation studies with animals; this research is limited because we do not
   know what the animal is experiencing. Robert Heath did some of the earliest
   probing of the limbic system in humans in 1964 when he implanted electrodes in
   the brains of patients in an attempt to treat epilepsy, sleep disorders, or pain that
   had failed to respond to conventional treatments. Researchers knew from animal
   studies that the hypothalamus has primary control over the autonomic system
   and that it produces a variety of emotional expressions, such as the threatened
   cat’s hissing and bared teeth and claws. Stimulation of the hypothalamus in
   Heath’s patients produced general autonomic discharge and sensations such as a
   pounding heart and feelings of warmth, but it also evoked feelings of fear, rage,
   or pleasure, depending on the location of the electrode in the hypothalamus.
   Septal area stimulation also produced a sense of pleasure, but in this case the
   feeling was accompanied by sexual fantasies and arousal. During septal
   stimulation one patient went from near tears while talking about his father’s
   illness to a broad smile as he described how he planned to take his girlfriend out
   and seduce her. When asked why he changed the subject, he replied that the
   thought just came into his head.
   In The News: Emotional Processing Differs by Class
   Recent work has confirmed our intuition that others perceive the world in different ways from
   us. For example, people of higher socioeconomic status (SES) pay less attention to other people
   and people’s faces and show less interest in them than do members of lower classes (Baer, 2017;
   Dietze & Knowles, 2016). The neural counterpart of these behavioral differences is a difference
   in mirror neuron activity in response to others’ behavior. Researchers at Arizona State
   University used mu wave suppression—a decrease in 8–13 Hz EEG activity—over the motor
   cortex as a measure of mirror neuron activation. In their study, lower SES participants
   responded with more mirror neuron activity to videos of hand movements of others than did the
   higher SES participants (Varnum, Blais, & Brewer, 2016). According to the authors, their results
   are consistent with previous studies indicating that lower SES individuals are more empathetic
   toward others.
   Thought Questions
   1. What are some real-world implications of these findings?
   2. How did the researchers assess mirror neuron activity? Why didn’t they measure the
   activity directly?

   Now researchers are more likely to use one of the scanning techniques to study
   the brain centers of emotion. Typically, they do MRI scans to determine the
   location of damage in patients with emotional deficits, or they use positron
   emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   while healthy subjects relive an emotional experience, examine facial
   expressions of emotion, or view an emotional video. Two of the most reliable
   brain-emotion associations have been the amygdala’s role in fear and the
   location of disgust in the insular cortex and the basal ganglia (Figure 8.5; F. C.
   Murphy, Nimmo-Smith, & Lawrence, 2003; Phan, Wager, Taylor, & Liberzon,
   2002). We will consider the amygdala in some detail later. The insula is the area
   we identified in Chapter 6 as the cortical projection site for taste; a number of
   writers have remarked on the fact that taste and disgust share the same brain area
   and that dis-gust means, roughly, “bad taste.” In Chapter 3, we identified the
   basal ganglia as being involved in motor functions. Interestingly, people with
   Huntington’s disease or obsessive-compulsive disorder, both of which involve
   abnormalities in the basal ganglia, have trouble recognizing facial expressions of
   disgust (Phan et al., 2002).
   Figure 8.5 Location of the Amygdala, Insula, and Basal Ganglia.

   Another significant structure in emotion is the anterior cingulate cortex, a part
   of the cingulate gyrus that is important in attention, cognitive processing,
   emotion, and possibly consciousness. You can see the cingulate gyrus in Figure
   8.4 and the anterior cingulate gyrus in Figure 8.6. The anterior cingulate cortex
   is believed to combine emotional, attentional, and bodily information to bring
   about conscious emotional experience (Dalgleish, 2004). Consequently, it is
   involved in emotional activity regardless of which emotion is being experienced,
   although some studies have also linked parts of the structure to specific
   emotions, such as sadness and happiness (F. C. Murphy et al., 2003; Phan et al.,
   2002). Interestingly, an MRI investigation found that the right anterior cingulate
   was larger in people with high scores on harm avoidance, which involves worry
   about possible problems, fearfulness in the face of uncertainty, and shyness with
   strangers (Pujol et al., 2002).

   Before we go too far in assigning emotions to specific brain structures, we need
   to understand that any specific emotion involves activity in a network that
   includes many brain areas. This is well illustrated in a study that combined the
   results of 55 PET and fMRI investigations (Phan et al., 2002). As you can see in
   Figure 8.7, places activated during a specific emotion cluster somewhat in
   particular areas, but they are also scattered across wide areas of the brain. This is
   partly due to different methods of inducing the emotions in the studies, but it
   also reflects the complexity of emotion. With the understanding that no emotion
   can be relegated to a single part of the brain, we will look more closely at three
   areas that have particularly important roles in emotional experience and
   behavior: the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the right hemisphere.
   The Prefrontal Cortex
   The prefrontal cortex (see Figure 3.8 for location) is the final destination for
   much of the brain’s information about emotion before action is taken. You saw in
   Chapter 3 that damage to the prefrontal area or severing its connections with the
   rest of the brain impairs people’s ability to make rational judgments. Later in this
   chapter you will learn that people with deficiencies in the area are unable to
   restrain violent urges, and in Chapter 14 you will see that abnormalities in the
   prefrontal area also figure prominently in depression and schizophrenia. These
   deficits have a variety of causes, including injury, infection, tumors, strokes, and
   developmental errors. What the victims have in common is damage to the
   prefrontal area that includes the ventromedial cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex
   (see Figure 8.8).

   and Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex to Decision-Making,” by A. Bechara,

   19, pp. 5473–5481.
   The prefrontal cortex makes the final decision whether to produce a given
   behavior, using information supplied by other brain areas about the relative value
   of the choices, the likelihood of success, and the cost of failure. From this
   description it is easy to see why most research on decision making is done in the
   form of studies of risk taking. A good example is a gambling task study in which
   patients with ventromedial damage and healthy volunteers chose cards from four
   decks to win play money (Bechara et al., 1999). Initially both groups chose more
   often from the two “risky” decks, which usually resulted in large rewards but
   occasionally led to large penalties, for an overall loss. Over time, the control
   subjects shifted to the two “safe” decks, whose cards produced lower rewards
   and smaller penalties for an overall gain; the patients typically did not make the
   shift, however, even after they figured out how the game worked (Figure 8.9a).
   How does loss of emotion impair “rational” decision making?
   To assess the subjects’ emotional responses during the task, the researchers used
   the skin conductance response (SCR), a measure of sympathetic nervous
   system activity obtained by recording changes in the skin’s electrical
   conductance that occurs during sweat gland activation. Both groups showed
   emotional reactions—increases in skin conductance—when their choices
   resulted in wins or losses. And over time, the control subjects began to show
   anticipatory SCRs just before drawing a card from a risky deck, even before they
   were able to verbalize that those stacks were risky. (This is the example of
   unaware emotional influence we promised earlier.) The patients, however, did
   not produce anticipatory SCRs to the four decks; although their bad choices were
   eliciting emotional responses, their prefrontal damage made them unable to
   process the consequences of risky behavior and use that information to guide
   their choices (Figure 8.9b).
   Figure 8.9 Comparison of Gambling Task Behavior in Controls and Patients
   With Damage to the Prefrontal Cortex.
   More recently, studies of risk taking have mapped out some of the circuitry
   involved in decision making. Functional MRIs showed that teenagers identified
   as risk takers had stronger functional connectivity of the right prefrontal cortex
   with the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala than did their non-risk-taking
   age-mates (DeWitt, Aslan, & Filbey, 2014). The nucleus accumbens and
   amygdala, of course, are involved in the evaluation of rewarding and emotional
   stimuli, respectively. While the prefrontal cortex dampens impulsive and risky
   behavior, the nucleus accumbens and amygdala appear to play the role of
   instigators. For example, in a simulated driving task fMRI showed significantly
   increased activity in the nucleus accumbens when the teenage subjects chose to
   run through a yellow light (Telzer, Ichien, & Qu, 2015). Activity in the nucleus
   accumbens is exceptionally high during adolescence. Meyer and Bucci (2016)
   pursued the hypothesis that this increased activity, along with the delayed
   development of the orbitofrontal cortex, plays a causal role in teen impulsiveness
   and risk taking. They manipulated receptors to increase activation of the nucleus
   accumbens while simultaneously decreasing activity in the orbitofrontal cortex
   of adult rats; the rats then performed comparably to adolescent rats, taking twice
   as long to learn to withhold a conditioned response when a stimulus indicated
   that it would not be followed by a reward.
   Studies have also identified another part of the brain that participates in risk
   evaluation, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Patients with damage to this area
   had difficulty adjusting their betting according to the chances of winning; they
   often made large bets when the odds were low and small bets when the chances
   of winning were strongly favorable (Studer, Manes, Humphreys, Robbins, &
   Clark, 2015). In two additional studies, willingness to make risky choices was
   correlated with the amount of gray matter volume in the PPC (Gilaie-Dolan et
   al., 2014), and across subjects aged 18 to 88, risk taking and PPC gray matter
   volume declined together (Grubb, Tymula, Gilaie-Dolan, Glimcher, & Levy,
   2016).
   In the rest of us, who like to think of ourselves as normal, the prefrontal cortex’s
   connections to other parts of the brain determine whether we are novelty-seeking
   adventurers or are more restrained, as the accompanying Application explains.
   Application: Why Bob Doesn’t Jump Out of Airplanes
   Source: iStock/vuk8691.
   In our discussion of sensation seeking in Chapter 6, we mentioned the first author’s wife’s
   skydiving adventure. Why did she enjoy leaping out of a perfectly good airplane at 14,000 feet,
   while he preferred to stay on the ground and take photos of her descent? Why did she like to
   travel to exotic places, like Thailand and Patagonia, while he would rather stay at home and
   write about behavioral neuroscience? Once again, research comes to the rescue. Psychologists at
   the University of Arizona (M. X. Cohen, Schoene-Bake, Elger, & Weber, 2009) used a
   questionnaire to categorize 20 volunteers as novelty seekers (agreeing to statements like “I like
   to try new things just for fun”) or reward dependent (agreeing to statements like “I’d rather stay
   home than go out”). Novelty seekers are higher in exploratory drive and impulsivity, whereas
   those who are reward dependent are particularly sensitive to rewards and spend a lot of time
   pursuing activities that have been rewarding in the past.
   Next, the researchers used diffusion tensor imaging to measure the density of the subjects’
   white-matter tracts. Their analysis focused on the hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum,
   because animal research has indicated that these structures form a looping circuit that is
   important in novelty seeking. There were strong white-matter connections within this loop in the
   human novelty seekers, but the reward-dependent volunteers’ strongest connections were
   between the striatum and prefrontal areas, which tend to put the brakes on risky behavior. Just
   before the skydiving experience, the jump videographer interviewed Bob’s wife about why she
   was making the jump, then turned the camera on Bob and asked why he chose not to. He
   answered lamely, “I just don’t need to.” Today, armed with the results of this study, his answer
   would be, “My prefrontal cortex won’t let me!”
   The Amygdala
   The prefrontal areas receive much of their emotional input from the amygdala
   (see Figure 8.4 again), a small limbic system structure in each temporal lobe that
   is involved in emotions, especially negative ones. The amygdala has other
   functions as well. In Chapter 7 you learned that the amygdala responds to
   sexually exciting stimuli, and in Chapter 12 you will see that it participates in
   memory formation, especially when emotion is involved. Some amygdala
   neurons fire when the individual judges the facial expression in a photo to be
   fearful, and others respond to happy faces (S. Wang et al., 2014). So the
   amygdala’s role may involve responding to emotionally significant stimuli in
   general (Phan et al., 2002).
   Although the amygdala participates in other emotions, its role in fear and anxiety
   has been researched the most thoroughly. Fear is an emotional reaction to a
   specific immediate threat; anxiety is an apprehension about a future, and often
   uncertain, event. Stimulating the amygdala produces fear in human subjects
   (Gloor, Olivier, Quesney, Andermann, & Horowitz, 1982). The amygdala
   contains receptors for benzodiazepines, which are used to treat anxiety, and
   injection of this type of drug directly into the amygdala reduces signs of both
   fear and anxiety in animals (M. Davis, 1992). A person with one version of the
   SLC6A4 gene has decreased serotonin activity; as a result, the person is prone to
   fear and anxiety and, as Figure 8.10 shows, the amygdala is hyperreactive to fear
   stimuli (Hariri et al., 2002).

   Rats with amygdala damage are so fearless they will not only approach a sedated
   cat but also climb all over its back and head (D. C. Blanchard & Blanchard,
   1972). One rat even nibbled on the stuporous cat’s ear, provoking an attack—and
   after the attack ended, the rat climbed right back onto the cat. A few humans
   have sustained damage to both amygdala structures, usually as a result of
   infection or disease, and they also show a variety of deficits; like the rats, for
   example, they are unusually trusting of strangers (Adolphs, Tranel, & Damasio,
   1998). Bechara’s study of prefrontal patients included a group of patients with
   bilateral amygdala damage (Bechara et al., 1999). The two groups performed
   similarly in most ways, with one notable exception: While neither group
   produced anticipatory SCRs when choosing from the risky decks, the amygdala
   patients also didn’t respond to monetary gains and losses. Apparently the
   ventromedial patients were unable to make use of emotional information from
   the amygdala, but the amygdala patients couldn’t even generate an emotional
   response to rewards and punishments. As a result, patients with bilateral
   amygdala damage often live in supervised care, because their actions can easily
   bring harm to themselves and others. Ventromedial patients are less impaired,
   which suggests that the amygdala sends its information to additional decision-
   making areas, suggesting a broad scope to this network.
   SM is one of the best characterized patients with bilateral amygdala damage
   (Figure 8.11); she reports very little feeling of fear and—in spite of having been
   held up at knifepoint, nearly killed in an act of domestic violence, and threatened
   with death on other occasions—her behavior never reflected any sense of
   desperation or urgency (Feinstein, Adolphs, Damasio, & Tranel, 2011).
   Researchers were unable to find any stimulus that could evoke fear in her; she
   was undisturbed by horror movies or a haunted house that produced screams in
   her companions, and she showed an unusual compulsion to touch snakes she had
   been told were deadly. Interestingly, during a test that involved inhaling carbon
   dioxide, which produces a feeling of suffocation, she and a similar patient
   experienced full-blown panic attacks (Feinstein et al., 2013). The researchers’
   interpretation was that the amygdala monitors external threats from the
   environment, and that fear triggered internally—in this case by the sense of
   suffocation—has another neural basis.
   Hemispheric Specialization in Emotion
   The specialization of the cerebral hemispheres we have seen in other functions is
   also evident in emotion. Although both hemispheres are involved in the
   experience of emotions, the left frontal area is more active when the person is
   experiencing positive emotions, and the right frontal area is more active during
   negative emotion (R. J. Davidson, 1992). This is consistent with a study done
   with epilepsy patients who had numerous electrodes placed in their brains as part
   of a presurgical evaluation. Stimulation in the right amygdala evoked negative
   emotions (identified by the conscious patients as fear, anxiety, or sadness) at
   100% of the locations; in the left amygdala the locations were split almost
   evenly between negative emotions and positive ones (joy and happiness;
   Lanteaume et al., 2007). People with damage to the left hemisphere often
   express more anxiety and sadness about their situation, whereas those with right-
   hemisphere damage are more likely to be unperturbed or even euphoric, even
   when dealing with an associated paralysis of an arm or a leg (Gainotti, 1972;
   Gainotti, Caltagirone, & Zoccolotti, 1993; W. Heller, Miller, & Nitschke, 1998).
   The same difference in emotions occurs when each of the cerebral hemispheres
   is anesthetized briefly in turn by injecting a short-acting barbiturate into the right
   or left carotid artery (Rossi & Rosadini, 1967). (This technique is sometimes
   used in evaluating patients prior to brain surgery.) In fact, when the right
   hemisphere is anesthetized, individuals can describe negative events in their
   lives but can barely recall having felt sad or angry or fearful, even with incidents
   as intense as their mother’s death, the discovery of a spouse’s affair, or the wife’s
   threatening to kill the individual (E. D. Ross, Homan, & Buck, 1994).
   Although both hemispheres are involved in experiencing emotion, the right is
   more specialized for its expression (Heller et al., 1998). Autonomic responses to
   emotional stimuli such as facial expressions and emotional scenes are greater
   when the stimuli are presented to the right hemisphere (using the strategy
   described by Spence, Shapiro, & Zaidel, 1996, p. 298). Much of the emotional
   suppression in patients with right-hemisphere damage is due to decreased
   autonomic response (Gainotti et al., 1993).

   Threats,” by John Riehl, April 2, 2013, Iowa Now, retrieved from

   Perception of nonverbal aspects of emotion is impaired in patients with right-
   hemisphere damage; for example, they often have difficulty recognizing emotion
   in others’ facial expressions (Adolphs, Damasio, Tranel, & Damasio, 1996).
   Verbal aspects are unimpaired, however; the same patients can understand the
   emotion in a verbal description like “Your team’s ball went through the hoop
   with one second left to go in the game,” but they have trouble identifying the
   emotion in descriptions of facial or gestural expressions such as “Tears fell from
   her eyes” or “He shook his fist” (Blonder, Bowers, & Heilman, 1991). Patients
   with right-hemisphere damage also have trouble recognizing emotion from the
   tone of the speaker’s voice (Gorelick & Ross, 1987), and their own speech is
   usually emotionless as well (Heilman, Watson, & Bowers, 1983). When asked to
   say a neutral sentence like “The boy went to the store” in a happy, sad, or angry
   tone, they speak instead in a monotone and often add the designated emotion to
   the sentence verbally, for example, “. . . and he was sad.”

   Stress, Immunity, and Health
   Stress is a term that has two meanings in psychology. Stress is a condition in
   the environment that makes unusual demands on the organism, such as
   threat, failure, or bereavement. Stress is also an internal condition, your
   response to a stressful situation; you feel stressed, and your body reacts in
   several ways. Whether a situation is stressful to the person is often a matter of
   individual differences, either in perception of the situation or in physiological
   reactivity. For some people, even the normal events of daily life are stressful,
   whereas others thrive on excitement and would feel stressed if they were
   deprived of regular challenges. In other words, stress in this sense of the term is
   in the eye of the beholder.
   What are the positive effects of stress?
   Stress as an Adaptive Response
   Ordinarily, the body’s response to a stressful situation is positive and adaptive. In
   Chapter 3, you saw that the stress response includes activation of the
   sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, which is largely under the
   control of the hypothalamus. The resulting increases in heart rate, blood flow,
   and respiration rate help the person deal with the stressful situation. Stress also
   activates the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, a group of structures that
   help the body cope with stress (Figure 8.12). The hypothalamus activates the
   pituitary gland, which in turn releases hormones that stimulate the adrenal glands
   to release the stress hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol. The
   first two hormones increase output from the heart and liberate glucose from the
   muscles for additional energy. The hormone cortisol also increases energy
   levels by converting proteins to glucose, increasing fat availability, and
   increasing metabolism. Cortisol provides a more sustained release of energy
   than the sympathetic nervous system does, for coping with prolonged stress.
   Figure 8.12 The Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis.
   Brief stress increases activity in the immune system (Herbert et al., 1994), the
   cells and cell products that kill infected and malignant cells and protect the
   body against foreign substances such as bacteria and viruses. Of course, this
   is highly adaptive because it helps protect the person from any infections that
   might result from the threatening situation. The immune response involves two
   major types of cells. Leukocytes, or white blood cells, recognize invaders by
   the unique proteins that every cell has on its surface and kills them. These
   proteins in foreign cells are called antigens. A type of leukocyte called a
   macrophage ingests intruders (Figure 8.13). Then it displays the intruder’s
   antigens on its own cell surface; this attracts T cells, another type of
   leukocyte that is specific for particular antigens, which kill the invaders. B
   cells, a third type of leukocyte, fight intruders by producing antibodies that
   attack a particular cell type. Natural killer cells, the second type of immune
   cells, attack and destroy certain kinds of cancer cells and cells infected with
   viruses; they are less specific in their targets than T or B cells. The brain and
   spinal cord are considered “immune privileged,” in that the central nervous
   system is protected from most infectious agents by the blood-brain barrier. When
   these agents do make their way in, they are dealt with by microglia, which act
   in most ways like macrophages. Table 8.1 summarizes the characteristics of
   these immune cells.
   Figure 8.13 Macrophages Preparing to Engulf Bacteria.
   Source: Science Picture Co/Science Source.
   Some antibodies are transferred from mother to child during the prenatal period
   or postnatally through the mother’s milk. Most antibodies, though, result from a
   direct encounter with invading cells, for example, during exposure to measles.
   Vaccinations work because injection of a weakened form of the disease-causing
   bacteria or virus triggers the B cells to make antibodies for that disease.
   The preceding is a description of what happens when all goes well. In the
   immune deficiency disease AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), by
   contrast, T cells fail to detect invaders, and the person dies of an infectious
   disease. In autoimmune disorders, the immune system runs amok and attacks
   the body’s own cells. In the autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis, for
   instance, the immune system destroys myelin in the central nervous system.
   Negative Effects of Stress
   We are better equipped to deal with brief stress than with prolonged stress.
   Chronic stress can interfere with memory, increase or decrease appetite, diminish
   sexual desire and performance, deplete energy, and cause mood disruptions.
   Although brief stress enhances immune activity, prolonged stress compromises
   the immune system. After the nuclear accident at the Three Mile Island electric
   generating plant, nearby residents had elevated stress symptoms and performed
   less well on tasks requiring concentration, compared with people who lived
   outside the area (Baum, Gatchel, & Schaeffer, 1983). Amid concerns about
   continued radioactivity and the long-term effects of the initial exposure,
   residents had reduced numbers of B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells as long
   as six years after the accident (McKinnon, Weisse, Reynolds, Bowles, & Baum,
   1989).
   Figure 8.14 Relationship Between Stress and Vulnerability to Colds.

   Common Cold,” by S. Cohen, A. D. Tyrrell, and A. P. Smith, New England

   Society. All rights reserved.
   Disease symptoms were not measured at Three Mile Island, but other studies
   have shown that health is compromised when stress impairs immune
   functioning. Recently widowed women experienced decreased immunity and
   marked health deterioration in the year following the spouse’s death (Maddison
   & Viola, 1968). Also, students had reduced immune responses, more infectious
   illnesses, and slower wound healing at exam times than at other times of the year
   (Glaser et al., 1987; Marucha, Kiecolt-Glaser, & Favagehi, 1998). In a rare
   experimental study, healthy individuals were given nasal drops containing
   common cold viruses and then were quarantined and observed for infections. In
   Figure 8.14, you can see that their chance of catching a cold depended on the
   level of stress they reported on a questionnaire at the beginning of the study (S.
   Cohen, Tyrrell, & Smith, 1991). In a follow-up study, it turned out that only
   stresses that had lasted longer than a month increased the risk of infection (S.
   Cohen et al., 1998).
   The cardiovascular system is particularly vulnerable to stress. Stress increases
   blood pressure, and prolonged high blood pressure can damage the heart or
   cause a stroke. Some people are more vulnerable to health effects from stress
   than others. Researchers classified young children as normal reactors or
   excessive reactors based on their blood pressure increases while one hand was
   immersed in ice water. Forty-five years later, 71% of the excessive reactors had
   high blood pressure, compared with 19% of the normal reactors (Wood, Sheps,
   Elveback, & Schirger, 1984).
   Stress can even produce death. This fact has not always been accepted in the
   scientific and medical communities, but in 1942 the physiologist Walter Cannon
   determined that reports of apparent stress-related deaths were legitimate. He
   even suggested that voodoo death, which has been reported to occur within
   hours of a person being “hexed” by a practitioner of this folk cult, is also due to
   stress. We now know that fear, loss of a loved one, humiliation, or even extreme
   joy can result in sudden cardiac death. In sudden cardiac death, stress causes
   excessive sympathetic activity that sends the heart into fibrillation,
   contracting so rapidly that it pumps little or no blood. When one of the
   largest earthquakes ever recorded in a major North American city struck the Los
   Angeles area in 1994, the number of deaths from heart attacks increased fivefold
   (Figure 8.15; Leor, Poole, & Kloner, 1996). The stress doesn’t have to be as
   extreme as an earthquake: During the 2006 soccer World Cup games in
   Germany, cardiac emergencies in that country tripled in men and almost doubled
   in women (Wilbert-Lampen et al., 2008); and when the Los Angeles Rams were
   defeated in the 1980 Super Bowl, cardiac deaths in the team’s hometown
   increased 15% in men and 27% in women (Kloner, McDonald, Leeka, & Poole,
   2011). In 2016, when the Chicago Cubs (Gerald Hough’s favorite team) won the
   World Series after 108 years, a 108-year-old fan died of a heart attack just days
   after the team’s final win (Leavitt, 2016). Heart attack rates even increase during
   the first three days following the spring change to daylight savings time, as
   people cope with earlier wake times and minor sleep deprivation, and then drop
   slightly when the autumn transition gives them an extra hour of sleep (T. S.
   Janszky & Ljung, 2008).

   In [emotional] pain there is as much wisdom as in pleasure.
   —Friedrich Nietzsche
   Extreme stress can also lead to brain damage (Figure 8.16). Hippocampal
   volume was reduced in Vietnam combat veterans suffering from posttraumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD; Bremner et al., 1995) and in victims of childhood abuse
   (Bremner et al., 1997), and cortical tissue was reduced in torture victims (T. S.
   Jensen et al., 1982). The abused individuals had short-term memory deficits, and
   some of the torture victims showed slight intellectual impairment. There is some
   evidence that the damage is caused by cortisol; implanting cortisol pellets in
   monkeys’ brains damaged their hippocampi (Sapolsky, Uno, Rebert, & Finch,
   1990), and elderly humans who had elevated cortisol levels over a five-year
   period had an average 14% decrease in hippocampal volume (Lupien et al.,
   1998). However, individuals with PTSD have lowered cortisol levels. Rachel
   Yehuda (2001) points out that they also have an increased number and sensitivity
   of the glucocorticoid receptors that respond to cortisol. She suggests that PTSD
   involves increased sensitivity to cortisol rather than an increase in cortisol level.
   Although there is a compensatory decrease in cortisol release, it is not adequate
   to protect the hippocampus. The accompanying Research Spotlight describes
   remarkable evidence of brain damage following recent globally significant
   disasters.

   Stress in Primates,” by H. Uno, R. Tarara, J. G. Else, M. A. Suleman, and
   R. M. Sapolsky, 1999, Journal of Neuroscience, 9, pp. 1705–1711.
   Several studies suggest that reducing stress can improve health. T cell counts
   increased in AIDS patients after 20 hours of relaxation training (D. N. Taylor,
   1995); similar training was associated with reduced death rates in elderly
   individuals (C. N. Alexander, Langer, Newman, Chandler, & Davies, 1989) and
   in cancer patients (Fawzy et al., 1993; Spiegel, 1996). However, evidence that
   survival rate in these studies is related to immune function improvement is
   sketchy (Fawzy et al., 1993); it is possible that study participation led the elderly
   subjects and cancer patients to make lifestyle changes. At any rate, it may be
   more practical to block stress hormones and bolster immunity chemically.
   Researchers at Tel Aviv University have found that the psychological and
   physiological stress of cancer surgery suppresses immunity, allowing the spread
   of cancer during the postoperative period; combining an anti-anxiety drug with
   an anti-inflammatory drug greatly increased the survival rate of mice following
   tumor removal, and clinical trials are under way with humans (Glasner et al.,
   2010; “New Method to Manage . . . ,” 2012).
   In what ways do personality characteristics influence immune functioning?
   Social, Personality, and Genetic Factors
   Social support was associated with dramatically lower death rates in several
   different populations (reviewed in House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988) and with
   lower stress and reduced stress hormone levels among Three Mile Island
   residents (Fleming, Baum, Gisriel, & Gatchel, 1982). People who are hostile are
   at greater risk for heart disease (T. Q. Miller, Smith, Turner, Guijarro, & Hallet,
   1996), while cancer patients who have a “fighting spirit” may live longer than
   patients who accept their illness or have an attitude of hopelessness (Derogatis,
   Abeloff, & Melisaratos, 1979; Greer, 1991; Temoshok, 1987). Because of the
   high association between mood disorder and cancer, some observers have
   suggested that depression is a predisposing factor; however, the opposite is more
   likely, because animal research indicates that immune system cytokines released
   by tumors can produce depressive-like behaviors (Pyter, Pineros, Galang,
   McClintock, & Prendergast, 2009).
   Social and personality influences must work through physiological mechanisms,
   which, unfortunately, are seldom assessed in these studies. An exception is an
   investigation of individual differences in immune response. Recall that there is a
   greater association of positive emotion with the left prefrontal area and negative
   emotion with the right. Six months after volunteers were given influenza
   vaccinations, the ones with higher EEG activity in the left prefrontal area had a
   five times greater increase in antibodies than those with higher activation on the
   right (Figure 8.17; Rosenkranz et al., 2003). In other research, men who had
   tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection had HIV
   levels that were eight times higher if they were introverted (socially inhibited)
   rather than extroverted (S. W. Cole, Kemeny, Fahey, Zack, & Naliboff, 2003).
   The introverted patients’ HIV levels also decreased less during treatment and
   their T cells did not increase at all.
   The researchers point out that introverted individuals have elevated levels of
   epinephrine and norepinephrine, which activate the sympathetic nervous system
   during stress, and that norepinephrine increases the rate at which the HIV virus
   multiplies in the laboratory. Unfortunately, they didn’t measure sympathetic
   activity specifically, but total autonomic activity (assessed from variability of
   heart rate, skin conductance, and other measures) was higher among the
   introverted HIV patients. This correlational study doesn’t tell us which among
   introversion, norepinephrine, and HIV infection is the initial cause, but it does
   suggest that norepinephrine is an important mediator of the effects.

   Prefrontal Hemispheric Activity.

   Personality characteristics such as introversion are moderately heritable, and so
   is vulnerability to stress; for example, a study of 300 Swedish twins concluded
   that 32% of workplace stress is genetic (Judge, Ilies, & Zhang, 2012). One gene
   implicated in stress is NPY, which encodes the production of neuropeptide Y
   (which you know from its involvement in appetite); people with a low-
   functioning version of the gene show greater brain activity in response to
   negatively charged words, report more negative feelings in anticipation of a
   painful stimulus, and are more prone to depression (Mickey et al., 2011). But
   what may be as important as the genes we have is the ability of stress to modify
   the expression of those genes. German researchers took repeated blood samples
   from subjects undergoing a stressful interview and found that methylation of the
   oxytocin receptor gene OXTR increased during the first 10 minutes and then
   decreased below initial levels 90 minutes afterward, presumably increasing and
   then decreasing the number of oxytocin receptors (Unternaehrer et al., 2012).
   Besides playing a role in sexual experience and bonding, oxytocin increases
   during stress and reduces some of the physiological effects, including blood
   pressure and heart rate. The researchers suggest that the receptor changes
   observed would mobilize the body’s resources initially and then support longer-
   term coping with the effects of stress. Stress effects are known to sometimes
   carry over to the offspring, apparently due to epigenetic changes of this sort.
   Male mice repeatedly separated from their mothers during the first 14 days after
   birth showed depressive symptoms as adults (passivity in response to stressful
   situations); the same behaviors were seen in the offspring, along with
   methylation changes in genes known to be involved in responses to stress
   (Franklin et al., 2010).
   Research Spotlight: One Aftermath of Disaster Is Stress-Related Brain Damage
   Three years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center killed more than 2,600
   people, researchers compared fMRI scans of people living within 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) of
   the towers with those of volunteers living 200 miles (322 kilometers) away (Ganzel, Kim,
   Glover, & Temple, 2008). Although the near residents’ symptoms of PTSD were not serious
   enough to merit diagnosis, they had reduced gray-matter volume in the hippocampus, amygdala,
   prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula; in addition, amygdala activation was
   greater when they viewed facial expressions of fear (see figure).
   Two studies of people affected by the devastating Japanese earthquake of 2011 have the rare
   advantage of being able to examine before-and-after brain scans. After the earthquake,
   researchers recruited 42 subjects who had received MRI scans as part of previous research and
   scanned them again (Sekiguchi et al., 2013). The subjects most likely to have PTSD symptoms
   had lower gray-matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) prior to the quake and
   lower gray-matter volume in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) after. The researchers believed that,
   due to the ACC’s involvement in processing fear and anxiety, its small volume was a
   predisposing factor to developing OFC damage and PTSD symptoms. A year later, the 37
   original subjects who could be located showed decreased right hippocampal volumes, but they
   had not developed clinical PTSD and their OFC volumes had increased (Sekiguchi et al., 2014).

   Pain as an Adaptive Emotion
   Eighty percent of all visits to physicians are at least partly to seek relief from
   pain (Gatchel, 1996), and we spend billions each year on nonprescription pain
   medications. These observations alone qualify pain as a major health problem.
   A world without pain might sound wonderful, but in spite of the suffering it
   causes, pain is valuable for its adaptive benefits. It warns us that the coffee is too
   hot, that our shoe is rubbing a blister, that we should take our skis back to the
   bunny slope for more practice. People with congenital insensitivity to pain are
   born unable to sense pain; they injure themselves repeatedly because they are
   not motivated to avoid dangerous situations, and they die from untreated
   conditions like a ruptured appendix. Mild pain tells us to change our posture
   regularly; a woman with congenital insensitivity to pain suffered damage to her
   spine because she could not respond to these signals, and resulting complications
   led to her death (Sternbach, 1968).

   Pain is one of the senses, a point we consider in more detail in Chapter 11. Here
   we focus on the feature that makes pain unique among the senses: It is so
   intimately involved with emotion that we are justified in discussing it as an
   emotional response. In fact, when we tell someone about a pain experience, we
   are usually describing an emotional reaction; it is the emotional response that
   makes pain adaptive.
   You know it, and Harvard psychologists have confirmed it: Pain someone inflicts
   on you intentionally hurts more than pain you experience accidentally (K. Gray
   & Wegner, 2008). As Beecher (1956) observed, “The intensity of suffering is
   largely determined by what the pain means to the patient” (p. 1609). In our
   society, childbirth is considered a painful and debilitating ordeal; in other
   cultures, childbirth is a routine matter, and the woman returns to work in the
   fields almost immediately. After the landing at the Anzio beachhead in World
   War II, 68% of the wounded soldiers denied pain and refused morphine; only
   17% of civilians with similar “wounds” from surgery accepted their pain so
   bravely (Beecher, 1956). The soldiers were not simply insensitive to pain,
   because they complained bitterly about rough treatment or inept blood draws.
   According to Beecher, who was the surgeon in command at Anzio, the surgery
   was a major annoyance for the civilians, but the soldiers’ wounds meant they had
   escaped the battlefield alive. Spiritual context can also have a powerful influence
   on the meaning of pain. Each spring in some remote villages of India, a man is
   suspended by a rope attached to steel hooks in his back; swinging above the
   cheering crowd, he blesses the children and the crops. Selection for this role is
   an honor, and the participant seems not only to be free of pain but also in a “state
   of exaltation” (Ghosh & Sinha, 2007; Kosambi, 1967). Figure 8.18 shows an
   example of culturally sanctioned self-torture.

   The pain pathway has rich interconnections with the limbic system, where pain
   becomes an emotional phenomenon. Besides the somatosensory area, pain
   particularly activates the anterior cingulate cortex, which in turn is intimately
   connected with other limbic structures (D. D. Price, 2000; Talbot et al., 1991).
   The brain scan in Figure 8.19 shows increased activity in the anterior cingulate
   cortex as well as the somatosensory area during painful heat stimulation. But
   what evidence is there that activity in the anterior cingulate cortex represents the
   emotional aspect of pain? First of all, in humans and monkeys some of the
   neurons respond to the anticipation of pain as well as to painful stimulation
   (Hutchison, Davis, Lozano, Tasker, & Dostrovsky, 1999; Koyama, Tanaka, &
   Mikami, 1998). More convincingly, as pain unpleasantness increases with
   repetitions of the same painful stimulus or due to hypnotic suggestion, activity
   increases in the ACC but not in the somatosensory area (D. D. Price, 2000;
   Rainville, Duncan, Price, Carrier, & Bushnell, 1997). Estimating the pain of
   others also activates the ACC but not the somatosensory cortex (Jackson,
   Meltzoff, & Decety, 2005; T. Singer et al., 2004). Interestingly, acetaminophen
   may owe some of its pain-alleviating ability to a dampening of emotion.
   Compared with control subjects receiving a placebo, volunteers who took a
   typical dose of acetaminophen showed blunted emotional reactions to photos
   (Durso, Luttrell, & Way, 2015) and rated the physical and emotional pain of
   others lower (Mischkowski, Crocker, & Way, 2016).
   What makes pain an emotional response?
   If pain continues, it also recruits activity in prefrontal areas where, presumably,
   the pain is evaluated and responses to the painful situation are planned (D. D.
   Price, 2000). The location of pain emotion in separate structures may explain the
   experience of two groups of patients. In pain insensitivity disorders, it is the
   emotional response that is diminished rather than the sensation of pain; the
   person can recognize painful stimulation, but simply is not bothered by it
   (Melzack, 1973; D. D. Price, 2000). The same is true for people who underwent
   prefrontal lobotomy back when that surgery was used to manage untreatable
   pain; when questioned, the patients often said they still felt the “little” pain but
   the “big” pain was gone.
   Pain is a more terrible lord of mankind than even death itself.

   Biological Origins of Aggression
   Both motivation and emotion reach a peak during aggression. Aggression can be
   adaptive, but it also takes many thousands of lives annually and maims countless
   others physically and emotionally. The systematic slaughter of millions in World
   War II concentration camps and the terrorist attack that destroyed the World
   Trade Center are dramatic examples, but we should not allow such catastrophic
   events as these to blind us to the more common thread of daily aggression
   running throughout society.
   Aggression is behavior that is intended to harm. Researchers agree that there
   is more than one kind of aggression, but they do not agree on what the different
   kinds are, partly because the forms of aggression differ among species. Most
   often, researchers make a distinction between predatory aggression and affective
   aggression. Predatory aggression occurs when an animal attacks and kills its
   prey or when a human makes a premeditated, unprovoked attack on
   another. Predatory aggression is cold and emotionless, whereas affective
   aggression is characterized by its impulsiveness and emotional arousal.
   Although these terms have been useful in animal research, the terms
   instrumental and impulsive seem more descriptive of aggression seen in humans.
   Instrumental aggression is unprovoked and emotionless, and is intended to
   bring about some gain for the aggressor, for example, to intimidate or rob
   the victim. Impulsive aggression occurs in response to a threat, real or
   imagined, and is characterized by heightened emotionality. These two types
   of aggression are sometimes referred to as proactive and reactive, for obvious
   reasons.
   The Brain’s Role in Aggression
   The primary neural instigator of aggressive behavior is the hypothalamus;
   electrical stimulation there reliably induces attack in rats, cats, and monkeys
   (reviewed in Falkner & Lin, 2014). Specific areas of the hypothalamus have
   been identified by using more precisely controllable techniques such as
   optogenetic stimulation; the most important are the anterior hypothalamic area,
   the medial hypothalamic area, and the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial
   hypothalamus. We know that the hypothalamus is important in human
   aggression as well, in part because back in the days of psychosurgery electrical
   lesions were made in the hypothalamus to treat extreme aggressiveness.
   Although there has not been the systematic identification of specific areas that
   we’ve seen with animals, there is some indication that the structures are
   organized very similarly from mice through humans (Haller, 2013).
   Research Spotlight: A Bug That Causes Road Rage?
   When the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii infects animals, it forms cysts in the brain that
   change the host’s behavior. Rats, for example, become risk takers and lose their fear of cats; this
   makes it likely they will get eaten, which means T. gondii cysts will end up in the cat’s feces and
   be spread to new hosts. About one third of the world’s population is infected with T. gondii,
   including about 14% of the U.S. population, due to contaminated food and water; infected
   individuals have slower reaction times and are more likely to have car accidents, and infection
   has been linked to some cases of psychiatric disorder, such as schizophrenia (Torrey, Bartko, &
   Yolken, 2012).
   Following studies that found an association with aggression (Cook et al., 2015) and suicidal
   behaviors in women (Ling, Lester, Mortensen, Langenberg, & Postolache, 2011), Emil Coccaro
   and his colleagues (2016) at the University of Chicago asked whether the parasite might
   contribute to intermittent explosive disorder (IED). IED is a form of problematic, impulsive
   aggressive behavior, such as we see in road rage, and it affects about 16 million Americans. The
   researchers found that individuals who tested positive for T. gondii were also more likely to
   score higher on measures of aggression. The rate of infection was 21.8% in the subjects with
   IED, compared with 16.7% among control subjects with psychiatric diagnoses and 9.1% of
   healthy control subjects. Coccaro said that these results “confirm that IED is a brain disorder
   and not a disorder of ‘personality.’” Previous studies found that the cysts show up mostly in the
   amygdala, where they cause retraction of dendrites, and in the prefrontal cortex.
   Whether the individual becomes aggressive is not up to the hypothalamus alone;
   the amygdala is a central part of a circuit that detects and responds to threats (E.
   F. Coccaro, Sripada, Yanowitch, & Phan, 2011). Stimulation of the amygdala has
   been reported to produce anger in humans, but only in aggressive patients, and
   lesioning of the amygdala improved “intractable aggression” in 33%–100% of
   cases (Mpakopoulou, Gatos, Brotis, Paterakis, & Fountas, 2008). PET scan
   studies have consistently found reduced activity in the temporal lobes (where the
   amygdala is located) of aggressive individuals, but in fMRI studies amygdala
   activity has sometimes been reduced and sometimes enhanced; one hypothesis
   for this discrepancy is that amygdala responsiveness is characteristic of
   impulsive aggression, and reduced activation is seen in instrumental aggression
   (E. F. Coccaro et al.). Evidence of this is that individuals with borderline
   personality disorder or intermittent explosive disorder, both marked by impulsive
   aggression, typically have enhanced amygdala activity, whereas individuals with
   disorders that are typified by emotionless, instrumental aggression—for
   example, psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder—are more likely to
   have diminished responses in the amygdala. In addition, children who play
   violent video games and watch violent television shows (and are therefore
   presumed to have become somewhat immune to the emotional effects of
   violence) are likely to have reduced activity in the amygdala (R. J. Nelson &
   Trainor, 2007).
   You’re already familiar with the role of the prefrontal cortex in controlling risky
   behavior, and there is considerable evidence that diminished prefrontal
   functioning is important in aggression. Men have less gray matter in the
   prefrontal cortex than women, which in one study accounted for 77% of their
   greater antisocial behavior (Raine, Yang, Narr, & Toga, 2009). Impulsive
   aggression apparently occurs because diminished frontal activity is inadequate to
   inhibit circuits in the hypothalamus and amygdala (Bufkin & Luttrell, 2005; R. J.
   Nelson & Trainor, 2007). In a study of convicted murderers, prefrontal activity
   was reduced in those whose crimes were impulsive, but it was essentially normal
   among instrumental murderers (Raine et al., 1998). And though prefrontal gray
   matter was reduced by 22% in psychopaths who had been convicted of crimes,
   those who admitted to crimes but had escaped detection had no deficits (Y. Yang
   et al., 2005). Thus, although the prefrontal cortex deters most of us from
   engaging in hostile and aggressive behavior, it fails to do so in others. In still
   others it may provide the impulse control and planning ability needed to carry
   out instrumental aggression.
   Hormones and Neurotransmitters in Aggression
   No discussion of the neural bases of aggression is complete without considering
   the role of hormones and neurotransmitters. When the topic of hormones comes
   up, we immediately think of testosterone, largely because men are typically more
   violent than women. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (2010),
   90.3% of murders are committed by males. So we will look at testosterone first,
   while acknowledging that it also plays a role in female aggression, and then
   consider emerging evidence that serotonin and cortisol are equally important as
   counters to testosterone.
   Testosterone
   The importance of testosterone in animal aggression is well established. For
   example, castration of an alpha male rat causes a significant decrease in
   aggressiveness along with loss of his dominant position; testosterone
   replacement prevents these losses (D. J. Albert, Walsh, Gorzalka, Siemens, &
   Louie, 1986). Male monkeys with high testosterone more often engage in
   aggression that asserts dominance, such as threatening other monkeys or
   displacing them from their position (Virkkunen, Goldman, & Linnoila, 1996;
   Virkkunen & Linnoila, 1993). A testosterone-aggression link has been reported
   in females as well, but few animal studies have even raised this question.
   How is testosterone related to aggression?
   Obviously, it is more difficult to observe aggression in humans, so researchers
   often resort to simulations in the laboratory. For example, testosterone levels
   were highly correlated with the intensity of shocks college males delivered to a
   provocative fictitious confederate (Berman, Gladue, & Taylor, 1993). In a series
   of studies, high testosterone—whether endogenous or administered—was
   associated with increased responses to anger stimuli and decreased reactivity to
   fear stimuli (Montoya, Terburg, Bos, & van Honk, 2012), both of which would
   support aggressive behavior. Studies of real-life aggression have relied on self-
   report or criminal records. Testosterone levels were higher in male prisoners
   convicted of violent crimes, such as rape and murder, and in prisoners rated as
   tougher by their peers (Figure 8.20; J. M. Dabbs, Carr, Frady, & Riad, 1995; J. J.
   Dabbs, Frady, Carr, & Besch, 1987). In female inmates, testosterone levels were
   correlated with the violence of their crimes and with aggressive dominance
   while in prison (J. J. Dabbs & Hargrove, 1997).
   Application: Neurocriminology, Responsibility, and the Law
   Source: Lawrence K. Ho/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images.
   In 1999, Donta Page robbed a young Denver woman and then raped and killed her. During the
   trial, British psychologist Adrian Raine testified that Page had a “perfect storm” of predisposing
   factors: a family history of mental illness; a distinct lack of activation in the prefrontal cortex
   (Glenn & Raine, 2014); and a childhood of poor nutrition, lead exposure, parental neglect,
   repeated physical and sexual abuse, and head injuries (Raine, 2013). As a result of Raine’s
   testimony, Page received a life sentence rather than the death penalty.
   Raine (who is cited frequently in this chapter) is a pioneer in the emerging field of
   neurocriminology, which uses neuroscience to understand and prevent criminal behavior. He
   raises the question of whether we should hold criminals like Page to the same level of
   accountability we expect of other people. For emphasis, he points out that violence in the United
   States has closely tracked the rise and fall of lead in gasoline, which can statistically account for
   91% of the changes in violence from the 1970s to the present (“Criminologist Believes Violent
   Behavior . . . ,” 2013).
   In spite of Page’s impairments, his crime didn’t have to happen. Earlier in 1999, he had come
   before the parole board while serving time for robbery. Had Raine been called on to testify then,
   he would have told the board that Page was at high risk for violence and should not be returned
   to society (Raine, 2013). Instead, Page was set free after serving 4 years of a 20-year term, and
   he murdered the young woman just 4 months later. Applying the expertise of neurocriminology
   earlier in a criminal’s career could reduce later violence through treatment and more enlightened
   decisions about sentencing and parole. Obstacles standing in the way of this approach are the
   lack of research funding and outmoded attitudes of officials and the public when it comes to
   brain disorders, mental illness, and responsibility. A positive outcome of the December 2012
   Sandy Hook school shooting is that the parents of one victim, six-year-old Avielle Richman,
   established the Avielle Foundation to foster more constructive attitudes and to encourage
   neuroscience research on the causes of violence (T. Smith, 2013).
   Figure 8.20 Testosterone Levels of Men Convicted of Various Crimes.

   The role of testosterone in human aggression has been controversial, and some
   observers have argued that elevated testosterone is the result of aggressive
   arousal rather than the cause. It is true that testosterone increases after winning a
   sports event (Archer, 1991; Mazur & Lamb, 1980), while watching one’s team
   win a sports event (Bernhardt, Dabbs, Fielden, & Lutter, 1998), and even after
   receiving an MD degree (Mazur & Lamb, 1980). But that doesn’t eliminate the
   possibility that testosterone contributes to aggression, and there are other
   potential reasons that studies sometimes come up with negative results. For one
   thing, correlations are typically low and highly variable across groups (J. Archer,
   Graham-Kevan, & Davies, 2005), which means that small studies could come up
   with differing results. More important, though, we are learning that it makes
   little sense to study testosterone alone because its effect depends on serotonin
   and cortisol, which we will discuss next.
   Serotonin and Cortisol
   We have already seen some indication of the importance of serotonin in
   motivation. Usually its role is inhibitory, suppressing motivated behaviors; when
   serotonin activity is low, appetite increases for food, water, sex, and drugs of
   abuse (Pihl & Peterson, 1993). Now we will add aggression to the list. Serotonin
   is important because it plays a crucial role in the inhibition that the prefrontal
   cortex exerts on aggression. Studies have found low serotonin levels in a variety
   of groups showing impulsive aggression, and low binding of serotonin at
   receptors in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala is associated with higher
   aggressiveness; treatment with antidepressants that increase serotonin levels
   increases prefrontal activation and reduces aggression (R. J. Nelson & Trainor,
   2007). Remember in the study of monkeys that those with high testosterone were
   aggressive; in the same study, the monkeys with low serotonin were impulsive,
   taking dangerously long leaps among the treetops and allowing occasional
   aggression to escalate into greater violence (Higley et al., 1996). The most
   aggressive monkeys had both low serotonin and high testosterone levels. A
   similar relationship with aggression was seen in violent alcoholic offenders
   (Virkkunen, Goldman, & Linnoila, 1996; Virkkunen & Linnoila, 1993) and in
   normal males (Kuepper et al., 2010).
   Cortisol, a steroid hormone, is released in response to stress and helps the body
   cope by regulating many of the changes that occur, such as blood pressure, blood
   sugar, and immune responses. In a study of male prisoners, those who were
   nonpsychopathic had high cortisol levels, whereas those diagnosed as
   psychopathic had low cortisol, just as we would expect in individuals who tend
   to be calculating and unemotional (Cima, Smeets, & Jelicic, 2008). But if we left
   the discussion here, we would miss the point of cortisol’s broader role; along
   with dampening the physical responses to stress, it also inhibits aggression. In a
   group of late-adolescent males who had committed violent crimes, testosterone
   levels were correlated with aggression severity only if cortisol was low (J. M.
   Dabbs, Jurkovic, & Frady, 1991). Since that study, numerous others have
   verified the relationship between a high testosterone-to-cortisol ratio and
   aggression in a variety of populations (see Montoya et al., 2012, for references)
   and, in at least one study, in girls as well as in boys (Platje et al., 2015). And as
   discussed in the accompanying Application, biological explanations for criminal
   behavior (called neurocriminology) are increasingly being used to explain
   violent acts and identify individuals for proper treatment instead of
   incarceration.
   We are now beginning to see a counterbalanced system of opposed hormones
   and transmitters, just as we did with the neural structures involved in aggression.
   As you know, serotonin controls aggression through its inhibitory influence on
   the hypothalamus and amygdala; and cortisol exerts its inhibition by increasing
   expression of genes in the amygdala to facilitate fear and avoidance, whereas
   testosterone upregulates other genes there to facilitate aggression (Montoya et
   al., 2012). According to one hypothesis, these three factors work in concert to
   determine both whether and how aggression will occur (Montoya et al.). A high
   testosterone-to-cortisol ratio predisposes to aggression; low serotonin then
   predisposes to impulsive aggression, whereas high serotonin, if it does not
   suppress the behavior, channels it into planned, instrumental aggression.
   Two other transmitters are worthy of note because they will show up in the next
   section. Dopamine levels increase during aggression in animals, and
   antidopaminergic drugs alleviate aggression in some psychiatric patients, but the
   precise role of dopamine is not understood (Narvaes & de Almeida, 2014). The
   contribution of dopamine could be due to its involvement in competitive
   motivation and risk taking. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is, of course, the
   main inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brains, and most studies report
   an inhibitory effect on aggression, but there have been contradictory results,
   possibly because its influence also depends on the other players.
   Heredity and Environment
   About 50% of the variability in aggressive behavior can be accounted for by
   genes, with the remaining half mostly due to nonshared (nonfamily)
   environmental influences (Tuvblad & Baker, 2011). Numerous genes have been
   implicated, including 18 involved in the development of neurons and another 7
   related to formation of the forebrain. But those studied most often have functions
   in serotonin and dopamine transmission (Fernàndez-Castillo & Cormand, 2016).
   Examples are the serotonin transporter gene, 5HTT (also known as SLC6A4),
   and the dopamine transporter gene, DAT1 (or SLC6A4); transporter genes encode
   proteins that return the neurotransmitter to the presynaptic neuron. The MAOA
   gene encodes monoamine oxidase A, an enzyme that degrades serotonin and
   dopamine, as well as noradrenalin. The short alleles of this gene, known
   collectively as MAOA-L, result in low levels of monoamine oxidase; their
   association with impulsive aggression has earned them the nickname “warrior
   genes.” Considering the role of testosterone in aggression, it is not surprising
   that some studies have identified the androgen receptor gene, AR, as important;
   two alleles may distinguish between impulsive and instrumental aggression
   (Waltes, Chiocchetti, & Freitag, 2016).
   Figure 8.21 Genetic Influence on Violent Behavior in Victims of Childhood
   Maltreatment.
   Source: Based on data from “Role of Genotype in the Cycle of Violence in
   Maltreated Children,” by A. Caspi et al., 2002, Science, 292, p. 852.
   Research has also identified environmental conditions that predispose
   individuals to aggressive behavior, including maltreatment, family adversity, and
   low socioeconomic status (Tuvblad & Baker, 2011). Environmental influences
   and heredity interact in interesting and complicated ways. The best known
   example is MAOA-L, whose link to aggression has been replicated more than
   any other. Two studies of incarcerated criminals have confirmed that this allele
   leads to violent behavior only in individuals who were subjected to childhood
   physical abuse (Figure 8.21; Caspi et al., 2002; Gorodetsky et al., 2014).

   In Perspective
   Emotion has been difficult for neuroscientists to get a handle on because it is so
   complex physiologically and because so much of emotion is a subjective, private
   experience. With improved research strategies and new technologies like PET
   scans, old questions about the role of brain structures are finally yielding to
   research. A good example is the ability to separate the emotion of pain from its
   sensory aspects at the neural level. On another front, research has confirmed the
   influence of emotion on health, a topic that was practically relegated to fringe
   psychology not too long ago.
   We have focused mostly on the negative aspects of emotion because they have
   received the most attention from researchers and we know more about them.
   Stress, pain, anger, and aggression are viewed as some of our greatest burdens,
   but they are permanently etched into our behavior because they helped ensure
   our ancestors’ survival. Because they are part of our biology, we can sometimes
   treat these problems with medication and might one day be able to use genetic
   interventions. But society also needs to ask itself whether fewer students would
   show up at school with a weapon if we started thinking of it as an environmental
   problem, or if terrorism could be reduced through better international
   understanding, and whether we need to appreciate the role of hormones, genes,
   and the brain when judging the accountability of a murderer. In the meantime, if
   you find thoughts about the negative aspects of emotion a bit depressing, you
   might want to take a short break while you hold your pen between your teeth;
   brightening your corner of the world is a good place to start.
   Chapter Summary
   Emotion and the Nervous System
   The autonomic nervous system increases bodily arousal during an emotional event and
   decreases it afterward.
   The James-Lange and cognitive theories differ as to the role of bodily feedback in
   emotional experience. There is evidence that bodily feedback, especially from facial
   expressions, contributes to emotions; also, mimicking other people’s expressions may
   help us understand others’ emotions.
   The limbic system is a network of several structures that have functions in emotion. We
   now know that emotion involves additional structures at all levels of the brain.
   The amygdala has a variety of functions, but its role in fear has received the most
   attention. Rats and humans with damage to both amygdalae lack fear and often fail to act
   in their own best interest.
   The prefrontal cortex combines emotional input with other information to make
   decisions. People with prefrontal cortex damage have trouble following moral and social
   rules, and they have impaired ability to learn from the consequences of their behavior.
   Damage to the right hemisphere particularly blunts emotions and impairs the person’s
   ability to recognize emotion in faces and in voices.
   Stress, Immunity, and Health
   Although the body’s response to stress can result in damage, it is generally adaptive,
   mobilizing the body for action and increasing immune system activity.
   Prolonged stress interferes with mental, physical, and emotional functioning;
   compromises the immune system; and even damages the brain.
   Social support, personality, and attitudes are related to immune functioning and health,
   including cancer survival. However, these social and personality factors may not
   influence immune functioning; instead, they may be indicators of the individual’s
   physiological functioning.
   Pain is also an adaptive response; it informs us of danger to the body, and the emotion
   that accompanies it motivates us to take action.
   Biological Origins of Aggression
   Researchers usually distinguish two types of aggression in animals, predatory and
   affective; in humans, the two types are known as instrumental and impulsive.
   Aggression arises from the hypothalamus and, at least in the case of impulsive
   aggression, from the amygdala. The prefrontal cortex typically inhibits aggression, but in
   aggressive individuals its role in planning and impulse control may distinguish
   instrumental from impulsive aggression.
   Testosterone is involved in both male and female aggression, although in humans the
   causal link for testosterone has been questioned.
   Serotonin and cortisol inhibit aggression. According to one hypothesis, high testosterone
   and low cortisol predispose a person to aggression, and low serotonin further disposes
   one to impulsive aggression, whereas high serotonin channels it into planned,
   instrumental aggression.
   The role of dopamine in aggression is not well understood, but antidopaminergic drugs
   alleviate aggression in some psychiatric patients. GABA has been reported to inhibit
   aggression, but there have been contradictory results.
   Heritability of aggressive behavior is about 50%, with most of the remainder due to
   nonshared environmental influences.
   Genes that contribute to aggression include several involved in neuronal and forebrain
   development. Others include serotonin and dopamine transporter genes, the MAOA-L
   allele, and the androgen receptor gene. Gene-environment interaction is illustrated by the
   finding that MAOA-L contributed to aggression only in individuals who had been abused
   as children.

   The only way Heather Whitestone knew the music had started for her ballet
   number in the 1995 Miss America talent competition was because she could feel
   the vibrations through the floor. Heather was profoundly deaf, and she became
   the first person with deafness or any other handicap to win the title of Miss
   America (Figure 9.1).
   Her hearing was normal until she contracted meningitis at the age of 18 months;
   the problem was not the meningitis but the strong antibiotics that destroyed the
   sound receptor cells in her ears. A hearing aid helped some, and she read lips and
   received twice-weekly speech therapy. By the time she reached high school, she
   could participate in mainstream classes without a sign language interpreter, and
   she graduated with a 3.6 grade point average. A cochlear implant was an option,
   but since she had been deaf so long, it was possible she would not tolerate the
   strange new sounds. Besides, she was satisfied with her level of adjustment—
   that is, until she married and had a son. Heather realized she could not share
   many of her son’s experiences because she could not hear what he was hearing.
   Then one day she saw her husband running to their son when the boy hurt
   himself and she had not even heard him crying. It was then she decided to have
   the surgery.
   Master the content.
   edge.sagepub.com/garrett5e
   The implant bypassed the dead receptor cells to stimulate the neurons in her
   inner ear directly. After the surgery, she could understand her son’s speech much
   better, so he didn’t have to repeat himself so many times. Best of all, she could
   hear him cry, even when he was playing outside in the backyard.
   Nothing attests to the value of hearing more than the effects of losing it. Like
   Heather, the person is cut off from much of the discourse that our social lives
   depend on. There is no music, no song of birds, and no warning from thunder or
   car horns. When hearing is lost abruptly in later life, the effect can be so
   depressing that it eventually leads to suicide.
   To be deaf is a greater affliction than to be blind.
   —Helen Keller
   With the topics of hearing and language, we begin the discussion of how we
   carry on transactions with the world. This communication involves acquiring
   information through the senses, processing the sensory information,
   communicating through language, moving about in the world, and acting on the
   world. We have already touched on the senses of taste, smell, and pain in the
   context of hunger, sexual behavior, and emotion. Before we explore additional
   sensory capabilities, we need to establish some basic concepts.
   First, every sensory system must have a specialized receptor. A receptor is a cell,
   often a specialized neuron that is suited by its structure to respond to a form
   of energy, such as sound. A receptor’s function is to convert that energy into a
   specific pattern of neural responses. You will see examples of two kinds of
   receptors in this and the next chapter, but receptors come in a wide array of
   forms to carry out their functions.
   How is a stimulus translated into information the brain can use?
   For a sensory receptor to do its job, there must also be an adequate stimulus. An
   adequate stimulus is the energy form for which the receptor is specialized.
   Due to the imperfect specialization of receptors, other stimuli will often produce
   responses as well. For example, if you apply gentle pressure to the side of your
   eyeball (through the lid), you will see a circular dark spot caused by
   mechanically stimulating normally light-sensitive receptors inside your eye.
   What is the difference between sensation and perception?
   You will remember from Chapter 3 that, according to Müller’s doctrine of
   specific nerve energies, the neural mechanism determines the kind of sensory
   experience you will have. A sensory system will register its peculiar type of
   experience even if the stimulus is inappropriate. So, when the neurosurgeon
   stimulates the auditory cortex, the patient hears a buzzing sound or even voices
   or music, and when your skateboard shoots out from under you and your head
   hits the pavement, you really do see “stars.” You will learn in this and the next
   two chapters that it is the pattern of the stimulation—that is, the amplitude and
   timing of neural impulses—that makes sensory information meaningful.
   Most people consider audition and vision the most important senses. As a result,
   there has been more research on these two senses than on others and we know
   more about them, so we will give them the most attention. Because audition is a
   more mechanical sensory mechanism than vision, it is a good place to begin our
   formal discussion of sensation, the acquisition of sensory information, and
   perception, the interpretation of sensory information.

   Hearing
   The fact that the auditory mechanism is less complex does not mean that hearing
   is a simple matter. The cochlea, where the auditory stimulus is converted into
   neural impulses, contains thousands of moving parts. Our range of sensitivity
   to intensity, from the softest sound we can hear to the point where sound
   becomes painful, is ten trillion to one. Our ability to hear low-intensity sounds is
   limited more by interference from the sound of blood coursing through our veins
   and arteries than by the auditory mechanism itself. In addition, we can hear
   frequencies ranging from about 20 hertz (Hz, cycles per second) up to about
   20,000 Hz, and we can detect a difference in frequencies of only 2 or 3 Hz. To
   give you some idea of what these frequencies relate to in real life, the piano—the
   most versatile of musical instruments—has a range of about 27 to 4000 Hz.
   Upper ranges are more impressive for some animals: 60,000 Hz (60 kHz) for
   dogs, 79 kHz for cats, and an astonishing 300 kHz in a species of moth (Moir,
   Jackson, & Windmill, 2013)—15 times higher than for humans.
   The Adequate Stimulus for Hearing
   The adequate stimulus for audition is vibration in a conducting medium.
   Normally for humans the conducting medium is air, but we can also hear
   vibrations in water, as well as those conducted through our skulls. The air is set
   to vibrating by the vibration of the sound source—a person’s vocal cords, a bell
   that has been struck, or a stereo speaker. As the sound source vibrates, it
   alternately compresses and decompresses the air (Figure 9.2).
   Figure 9.2 Alternating Compression and Decompression of Air by a Sound
   Source.

   If we used a microphone to convert a sound to an electrical signal, we could
   display the signal on a computer, like the one we used to measure the action
   potential in Chapter 2; the oscillations of the sound wave would form a graph of
   the compressions and decompressions, and we could see what the sound “looks
   like.” In Figure 9.3 the up-and-down squiggles represent the increasing and
   decreasing pressure of different sounds (over a brief fraction of a second). One
   way sounds differ is in frequency. Frequency refers to the number of cycles or
   waves of alternating compression and decompression of the vibrating
   medium that occur in a second (expressed in hertz). Figure 9.3a and b have the
   same frequency—indicated by the number of waves in the same time—so we
   would hear these two sounds as the same, or nearly the same, pitch. Figure 9.3c
   and d would also sound about the same as each other, but higher in pitch than
   Figure 9.3a and b. Pitch is our psychological perception of the frequency of a
   sound—more waves per second correspond to higher perceived pitch.
   Sounds also differ in amplitude (the physical energy). The sounds represented by
   Figure 9.3a and c have the same amplitude (the height of the wave), so they
   would sound about equally loud; Figure 9.3b and d would sound less loud but
   like each other. Amplitude, or intensity, is the term for the physical energy in
   a sound; loudness is the term for our perception of sound energy. Sound
   intensity is usually measured in decibels (dB); this is a logarithmic scale, so a
   doubling of amplitude corresponds to a 6 dB increase in loudness. This means
   the 10 trillion-fold difference between barely detectable to damaging is about
   140 dB in intensity difference.
   Pitch does not correspond exactly to frequency, nor is the amplitude of a sound
   exactly the same as its loudness; this is due to the way our sensitivity varies
   across the range of sounds. For example, we are most sensitive to sounds
   between 1000 and 4000 Hz—the range within which most conversation occurs
   —and equally intense sounds outside this range would seem less loud to us
   (Figure 9.4). Similarly, the amplitude of a sound influences our experience of
   pitch. Because the physical stimulus and the psychological experience are not
   always perfectly related, we need to use the terms intensity versus loudness and
   frequency versus pitch carefully.
   Figure 9.3 Examples of Pure and Complex Sounds.
   The sounds we hear can also be classified as either pure tones or complex
   sounds. A pure tone, generated for example by striking a tuning fork, would
   produce a tracing on an oscilloscope that looks like one of the graphs in Figure
   9.3a–d. Notice that these four waveforms are a very regular shape, called a sine
   wave. They are pure tones: Each has only one frequency. Figure 9.3e and f
   represent complex sounds that mix several frequencies. The random
   combination of frequencies in Figure 9.3e would be perceived as “noise.”
   Depending on the combination and amplitude of frequencies, a complex sound
   might seem musical like the last waveform in Figure 9.3f, which was produced
   by a clarinet. The two waveforms may not look very different to you, but they
   would certainly sound different. Although what is considered pleasantly musical
   depends on experience and culture (and one’s age!), we would recognize even
   the most foreign music as music.
   The Auditory Mechanism
   To hear, we must get information about the sound to the auditory cortex. This
   requires a series of events, including sound reception, amplification, and
   conversion into neural impulses that the brain can use. Before we get to the
   functional aspects of encoding sound and how we extract meaningful
   information from a complex auditory environment, we will first begin with a
   survey of the structures of brain areas involved in processing sound.

   321.
   The Outer and Middle Ear
   The term ear refers generally to all the structures shown in Figure 9.5. The flap
   that graces the side of your head is called the outer ear or pinna. The outer
   ear filters the sound and then amplifies it slightly by funneling it from the larger
   area of the pinna into the smaller area of the auditory canal. It also selects for
   sounds in front; this makes it easier to focus on a sound, such as the conversation
   you’re having, while excluding irrelevant sounds around you. Dogs and cats
   have muscles that enable them to turn their ears toward a sound that is not
   directly in front of them; you may be able to wiggle your ears a bit by twitching
   your scalp muscles, but you must turn your head to orient toward a sound. A
   unique aspect of your pinna is that its unique shape and filtering properties allow
   you to map sound objects in the world around you—if you wear earbuds that
   bypass your pinna, sound objects appear to be located within your own head
   rather than out in the world.
   The separation between the outer and middle ear is the eardrum or
   tympanic membrane, a very thin membrane stretched across the end of the
   auditory canal; its vibrations transmit sound energy to the three middle ear
   bones (or ossicles). A muscle called the tensor tympani can stretch the eardrum
   tighter or loosen it to adjust the sensitivity to changing sound levels. The second
   part of the middle ear is the ossicles, tiny bones that operate in lever fashion
   to transfer vibration from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. The
   malleus, incus, and stapes are named for their shapes, as you can see from their
   English equivalents hammer, anvil, and stirrup. By concentrating the energy
   collected from the larger tympanic membrane onto the much smaller base of the
   stirrup, which rests on the end of the cochlea, the ossicles amplify the sound
   approximately 30-fold. The amplification is more than enough to compensate for
   the loss of energy as the vibration passes from air to the denser liquid inside the
   cochlea. The ossicles are not passive players in the auditory process: The
   muscles attached to them tighten the joints to increase sensitivity to soft sounds
   and loosen the connections to dampen loud sounds. In addition to these sound-
   related structures, the middle ear also contains the Eustachian tube, connecting
   the middle ear to the back of your mouth, which equalizes the air pressure
   of the middle ear with the outside world. Pressure differences between the
   middle ear and the outside world put pressure on the tympanic membrane, which
   hurts. Therefore, your ears hurt when you dive deep in a pool, or climb up a
   mountain; yawning or chewing gum can open a blocked Eustachian tube,
   causing a “pop” as the pressure suddenly equalizes and the tympanic membrane
   returns to its normal shape.
   The Inner Ear
   Just like a membrane separates the outer and middle ears, membranes separate
   the air-filled middle and the fluid-filled inner ear (called the oval and round
   windows). You can also see the parts of the inner ear in Figure 9.5. The snail-
   shaped structure is the cochlea, where the ear’s sound-analyzing structures are
   located. You can see from the cochlea’s shape where it got its name, which
   means “land snail” in Latin. Figure 9.5a shows a more highly magnified view. It
   is a tube that is about 35 millimeters (mm) long in humans and coiled 2½ times.
   This tube is subdivided by membranes into three fluid-filled chambers or canals
   (Figure 9.5b). In this illustration, the end of the cochlea has been removed, and
   you are looking down the three canals from the base end. The stirrup (see Figure
   9.5a) rests on the oval window, a thin, flexible membrane on the face of the
   vestibular canal. The vestibular canal (scala vestibuli) is the point of entry of
   sound energy into the cochlea. The vestibular canal connects with the tympanic
   canal at the far end of the cochlea through an opening called the helicotrema.
   (You might not need to remember this term, but it just sounds too wonderful to
   leave out!) The helicotrema allows the pressure waves to travel through the
   cochlear fluid (called endolymph) into the tympanic canal more easily. Liquids
   are essentially incompressible; at the end of the tympanic canal another thin
   membrane, the round window, flexes outward with each sound wave and allows
   the fluid to move. The vestibular organs on top of the cochlea do not participate
   in hearing; we will talk about them in Chapter 11.

   Stories of Brain & Behavior
   All this activity in the vestibular and tympanic canals bathes the cochlear canal,
   where the auditory receptors are located, in vibration. The vibration passes
   to the organ of Corti, the sound-analyzing structure that rests on the basilar
   membrane. The organ of Corti consists of four rows of specialized cells
   called hair cells, their supporting cells, and the tectorial membrane above the
   hair cells (Figure 9.5c). To visualize these structures, remember that you are
   looking down a long tube; imagine the four rows of hair cells as picket fences or
   rows of telephone poles and the tectorial membrane as a shelf overlying the hair
   cells.
   How is the auditory stimulus converted to a neural impulse?
   The hair cells are the receptors for auditory stimulation (Figure 9.5d). Vibration
   of the basilar membrane and the cochlear fluid bends the hair cells back and
   forth, forward movement opens potassium and calcium channels (not sodium
   channels, as in neurons), and the inflow of ions depolarizes the hair cell
   membrane (whereas backward movement closes the channels and hyperpolarizes
   the membrane). Depolarization results in neurotransmitter release and
   stimulation of the auditory neuron connected to the hair cells. The hair cells are
   very sensitive; the amount of movement required to produce a sensation is
   equivalent to the Eiffel Tower leaning just the width of your thumb (Hudspeth,
   1989), about the distance the tower sways in a strong wind.
   The human cochlea has two sets of hair cells: a single row of about 3,500 inner
   hair cells and three rows of about 12,000 outer hair cells (“inner” and “outer”
   refer to their location relative to the center of the coiled cochlea; see Figure
   9.5c). The less numerous inner hair cells receive 90%–95% of the auditory
   neurons, and they provide most of the information about auditory
   stimulation (Dallos & Cheatham, 1976). A strain of mouse lacking inner hair
   cells due to a mutant gene is unable to hear (Deol & Gluecksohn-Waelsch,
   1979). The outer hair cells increase the cochlea’s sensitivity both by
   amplifying its output and by sharpening the frequency tuning at the
   location of peak vibration (Hudspeth, 2008; Z. Xiao & Suga, 2002). Damage to
   the outer hair cells by noise or chemical ablation causes a dramatic loss of
   hearing but also a loss of frequency selectivity along the basilar membrane. Why
   are these apparently non-sensory cells so important? Apparently, the outer hair
   cells’ tugging on the tectorial membrane increases stimulation of the inner hair
   cells.
   Pathway to the Auditory Cortex and Beyond
   The work of the auditory system is hardly finished when we have converted
   sound into electrical impulses. Neurons from the two cochleas make up part of
   the auditory nerves (eighth cranial nerves), one of which enters the brain on each
   side of the brain stem. The information from the cochleas passes through the
   lateral lemniscus to various brain stem nuclei (see Figure 9.6a) to the inferior
   colliculi (which are involved in sound localization, as we will discuss later), then
   to the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (where attentional processes
   interact with ascending auditory information), and finally to the auditory cortex
   in each temporal lobe. As you’ll see in Chapters 10 and 11, the crossover of
   sensory information for opposite-side brain processing is a common occurrence.
   Therefore, a sound on your right side is registered primarily, but not exclusively,
   in the left hemisphere of the brain. Researchers interested in differences in
   function between the two hemispheres have used an interesting strategy, called
   the dichotic listening task, to stimulate one side of the brain. They present an
   auditory stimulus through headphones to one ear and present white noise (which
   contains all frequencies and sounds like radio static) to the other ear to occupy
   the nontargeted hemisphere. This technique has helped researchers determine
   that the left hemisphere is dominant for language in most people and that the
   right hemisphere is better at other tasks, such as identifying melodies. The
   auditory cortex is on the superior (upper) gyrus of the temporal lobe of each
   hemisphere; part of it is hidden inside the lateral fissure, as you can see in Figure
   9.6a.
   The area is tonotopically organized, which means that neurons from adjacent
   receptor locations project to adjacent cells in the cortex, and they convey
   similar frequencies. In this case, the projections form a sort of map of the
   unrolled basilar membrane (Merzenich, Knight, & Roth, 1975), just as the
   somatosensory cortex contains a map of the body. When we study vision in
   Chapter 10, we will see that this organization is typical in the senses.
   Beyond the primary auditory cortex are additional processing areas, as many as
   nine in some mammals; these secondary auditory areas are involved in
   processing complex sounds and understanding their meaning. For example,
   some of the cells adjacent to the monkey’s primary auditory area respond
   selectively to calls of their own species, and some of those react only to one type
   of call (Wollberg & Newman, 1972). The human primary auditory cortex has a
   secondary area surrounding it (Figure 9.6b), but auditory information also travels
   well beyond the auditory areas, following the dorsal stream or the ventral stream
   (Alain, Arnott, Hevenor, Graham, & Grady, 2001; Rauschecker & Tian, 2000).
   Figure 9.6 The Auditory Pathway and the Auditory Cortex.
   The dorsal stream flows from the auditory cortex through the parietal area,
   where the brain combines information from other senses to locate the sound in
   relation to the body and the visual scene. The information then proceeds to the
   frontal lobes, where it can be used for directing eye movements toward sound
   sources and for planning movements. The ventral stream is active when the
   individual is identifying sounds; the call-specific cells of the monkey’s auditory
   system are part of this system. Because of their specialties, the ventral and dorsal
   streams have been dubbed the “what” and “where” systems of audition. These
   two pathways are illustrated in Figure 9.7. We will consider the communication
   roles of the dorsal and ventral streams later, in the section on language, and you
   will see in Chapter 10 that vision has similar systems.
   Frequency Analysis
   Now that we have gone over the anatomy of the auditory system and processing
   areas in the brain, we can examine some of the functional aspects of the auditory
   system. Before we get to the more complex concepts on how our brains extract
   information from the cochlea to determine the location and meaning of sound,
   we first must discuss how the vibrations of the conducting medium are converted
   into neural impulses by the cochlea. To do this, the cochlea is built to extract
   both frequency and intensity information from the sound through the movement
   of hair cells spread out across the length of the cochlea. More than 50 years ago,
   Ernest Wever (1949) described 17 versions of the two major theories of
   frequency analysis, which indicates the difficulty we have had in figuring out
   how people experience pitch. We will discuss a few versions that have been
   important historically. Besides introducing you to these two important theories,
   we will describe what we know about how the auditory mechanism works and
   give you some idea of how theories develop in response to emerging evidence.

   Telephone and Frequency Theories
   The most obvious explanation of how the auditory system analyzes frequency is
   the frequency theory, which assumes that the auditory mechanism transmits
   the actual frequency of a sound to the auditory cortex for analysis there.
   William Rutherford proposed an early version in 1886; it was called the
   telephone theory because he believed that individual neurons in the auditory
   nerve fired at the same frequency as the rate of vibration of the sound
   source. Half a century later, it was possible to test the theory with electrical
   recording equipment. Ernest Wever and Charles Bray (1930) performed one of
   the most intriguing investigations of auditory frequency analysis found in the
   scientific literature. They attached an electrode to the auditory nerve of an
   anesthetized cat and recorded from the nerve while they stimulated the cat’s ear
   with various sounds. Because the simple equipment used to record neural
   activity at that time was limited to very low frequencies, Wever and Bray ran the
   amplified neural responses into a telephone receiver in a soundproof room and
   listened to the output. Sounds produced by a whistle were transmitted with great
   fidelity. When someone spoke into the cat’s ear, the speech was intelligible, and
   the researchers could even identify who the speaker was. They concluded the
   auditory nerve was “following,” or firing at the same rate as, the auditory
   stimulus frequencies. It appeared that the telephone theory was correct, but with
   the benefit of our more modern understanding of neural functioning, you and I
   know that single neurons cannot possibly fire at such high rates. (See the
   discussion of refractory periods in Chapter 2 if you don’t remember.)
   How do the frequency and place theories explain frequency analysis?
   Obviously, Wever and Bray were not recording from a single neuron, but from
   all the neurons in contact with the hook-shaped copper electrode they placed in
   contact with the auditory nerve. Thus, they were monitoring the combined
   activity of hundreds, perhaps thousands of neurons. Wever explained their
   finding later in his volley theory, which states that groups of neurons follow
   the frequency of a sound at higher frequencies when a single neuron cannot
   (Wever, 1949). A group of neurons can follow high frequencies because different
   neurons “take turns” firing. The term volleying is analogous to playing
   volleyball, where players take turns when striking the ball to keep it aloft.
   Volleying is illustrated in Figure 9.8, where each of the neurons synchronizes its
   firing to the wave peaks of the tone; no single neuron can fire on every peak, but
   at least one neuron will be firing on each wave peak. In this theory, the brain
   then combines information from many neurons to determine the tone’s
   frequency. In Wever and Bray’s study, volleying in the auditory nerve was
   unable to keep up with the sound frequency beyond 5200 Hz, a figure that
   subsequent research has shown to be accurate (J. E. Rose, Brugge, Anderson, &
   Hind, 1967). So even with volleying, frequency following can account for only
   one-fourth of the range of frequencies we hear.
   Figure 9.8 Illustration of Volleying in Neurons.
   Place Theory
   In the 19th century, Hermann von Helmholtz (1863/1948) proposed that the
   basilar membrane was like a series of piano strings, stretched progressively more
   loosely with distance down the membrane. Then he invoked a principle from
   physics called resonance to explain how we discriminate different frequencies.
   Resonance is the vibration of an object in sympathy with another vibrating
   object. If you pluck the strings of a violin, you will notice that the strings begin
   to vibrate. The thinner, more tautly stretched E string vibrates faster and has a
   higher pitch and frequency than the thicker, less tautly stretched G string.
   According to Helmholtz, resonance would cause the narrow base end of the
   membrane to resonate more to high-frequency sounds, the middle portion to
   moderate frequencies, and the wider apex (tip) to low frequencies. Helmholtz’s
   proposal was a type of place theory, which states that encoding sound
   frequency depends on the location of maximal vibration on the basilar
   membrane; the more a particular section of membrane vibrates, the higher the
   levels of firing in the hair cells found there. Place theory in its evolving versions
   has been the most influential explanation of frequency analysis for a century and
   a half. It is an example of a scientific idea that has become almost universally
   accepted but continues to be referred to as a theory.
   A century later, Georg von Békésy (a communications engineer from Budapest)
   began a series of innovative experiments that won him the Nobel Prize for
   physiology in 1961. Békésy constructed mechanical models of the cochlea and
   observed the responses of the basilar membrane in cochleas he removed from
   deceased subjects as diverse as elephants and humans. When he stimulated these
   cochleas with a vibrating piston, he could see under the microscope that
   vibrations peaked at different locations along the basilar membrane; a wavelike
   peak hovered near the base when the frequency was high and moved toward the
   apex when Békésy (1951) decreased the frequency. But Helmholtz was wrong
   about the basilar membrane being like a series of piano strings; Békésy (1956)
   determined that its frequency selectivity is due to differences in elasticity, with
   the membrane near the stirrup 100 times stiffer than at the apical end.
   Figure 9.9a shows how frequency sensitivity is distributed along the membrane’s
   length (see Figure 9.5 again for the location of the basilar membrane).
   Recordings from single auditory neurons have confirmed that place information
   about frequency is preserved in all lower levels of auditory processing, from the
   cochlea to the auditory cortex. In other words, these structures contain a
   tonotopic map, which means that each successive area responds to successively
   higher frequencies (Figure 9.9a and b).
   You can see from the tuning curves in Figure 9.9c that each neuron responds
   most to a narrow range of frequencies (Palmer, 1987), due to the neuron’s place
   of origin in the cochlea. However, each neuron also responds to a lesser extent to
   a range of frequencies around its “primary” frequency, mirroring the pattern of
   vibration in the basilar membrane. So how can neurons that make such imperfect
   discriminations inform the brain about the frequency of a sound with the 2- to 3-
   Hz sensitivity that has been observed? The answer is lateral inhibition; the more
   highly stimulated neurons inhibit activity in adjacent neurons with slightly
   different primary frequencies (G. Wu, Arbuckle, Liu, Tao, & Zhang, 2008). As a
   result, some neurons in the auditory cortex are many times more discriminating
   than neurons in the auditory nerve (E. L. Bartlett, Sadagopan, & Wang, 2011;
   Bitterman, Mukamel, Malach, Fried, & Nelken, 2008). This neural sharpening of
   information is a characteristic of most sensory systems, as we will see when we
   discuss sound localization and in Chapter 10 when we talk about vision.
   Figure 9.9 Frequency Sensitivity of the Basilar Membrane and Auditory Cortex.
   Figures Brought to Life
   Place analysis is the reason we can hear with some clarity through bone
   conduction. The vibrations enter the cochlea from all sides during bone
   conduction, rather than through the oval window, but Békésy (1951)
   demonstrated with his cochleas that the tonotopic response of the basilar
   membrane is independent of sound source. As he moved his vibrating piston
   from the base around to the side of the cochlea, or to the apex or anywhere else,
   the peak of vibration remained in the same location. Thomas Edison was nearly
   deaf, yet his second most famous invention was the phonograph. He
   compensated for his impaired hearing by grasping the edge of the phonograph’s
   wooden case between his teeth and listening to the recording through bone
   conduction. You can still see the bite marks on one of his phonographs in the
   museum at his winter home and laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida. Figure 9.10
   shows a device that takes advantage of bone conduction.
   Combining Theories
   At low frequencies, the whole basilar membrane vibrates about equally, and
   researchers have been unable to find neurons that are specific for frequencies
   below 200 Hz (Kiang, 1965). Wever (1949) suggested a frequency-volley-place
   theory: Individual neurons follow the frequency of sounds up to about 500 Hz
   by firing at the same rate as the sound’s frequency; then between 500 and 5000
   Hz, the frequency is tracked by volleying, and place analysis takes over beyond
   that point. While volleying does occur in the auditory nerve, studies do not show
   that the brain uses that information in frequency analysis. Therefore, most
   researchers subscribe to a simpler frequency-place theory: Frequency
   following by individual neurons accounts for frequencies up to about 200
   Hz, and all remaining frequencies are represented by the place of greatest
   activity.

   Fortunately, we can sum up the auditory system’s handling of intensity coding
   much more simply. As we learned in Chapter 2, a more intense stimulus causes a
   neuron to fire at a higher rate. The auditory system relies on this strategy for
   distinguishing among different intensities of sound. However, this is not possible
   at lower frequencies, where firing rate is the means of coding frequency.
   Researchers believe that at the lower frequencies, the brain relies on the number
   of neurons firing as increases in stimulus intensity recruit progressively higher-
   threshold neurons into activity.
   Restoring Hearing
   For individuals who have damage to the middle ear bones, or a mild loss of hair
   cells due to aging, a simple hearing aid does an excellent job in compensating
   for the loss of amplification. However, 90% of hearing impairment cases involve
   loss of hair cells, and, because hair cells don’t regenerate, these individuals may
   be candidates for a cochlear implant, like Heather Whitestone’s and the ones
   worn by the two children in the opening photograph. An implant uses a
   microphone to pick up sounds and send them to a speech processor located
   behind the ear; then a transmitter on the surface of the skin sends the signal to a
   receiver that is surgically embedded under the skin. From there, the signal
   travels through a wire to an electrode array threaded through the cochlea; these
   electrodes deliver signals representing the different frequencies of a sound to
   different membrane locations. Activating different neurons with different
   frequencies mimics the functioning of the basilar membrane and hair cells in an
   unimpaired individual; in other words, it relies on the principle of place analysis.
   Most cochlear implant recipients hear effectively enough to use a telephone,
   which is more difficult than face-to-face conversation; most children can be
   mainstreamed in school, and they rate their quality of life comparably with their
   peers (Loy, Warner-Czyz, Tong, Tobey, & Roland, 2010). Early implantation
   works best, because adjustment to an enriched auditory world can be
   surprisingly difficult and because neurons from other sensory areas can take over
   the unused auditory cortex over time (D. S. Lee et al., 2001). In adults, success
   also depends on having learned language before deafness occurred. Children, by
   contrast, can use the implants regardless of whether they learned language
   previously (Francis, Koch, Wyatt, & Niparko, 1999).
   Conventional implants have a number of disadvantages: They cannot be worn in
   the shower or while swimming, they are bulky and cumbersome, and the wearer
   is likely to experience some amount of social stigma. Researchers at Harvard
   University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are developing a fully
   implantable device (Yip et al., 2015). A tiny sensor mounted on the malleus
   detects the movement of the ossicles and a processor-on-a-chip turns the
   vibrations into signals that are delivered to the cochlear nerve. The device
   consumes very little power, and it is anticipated that it would be charged
   overnight by sleeping on a special pillow. But there are additional problems with
   the quality of reproduction; the accompanying Research Spotlight describes
   some of the ongoing efforts to improve cochlear implants and eventually make
   them obsolete.
   Research Spotlight: Beyond Cochlear Implants
   A major problem people have with cochlear implants is difficulty following conversations in a
   crowded or noisy environment. A recent study with marmosets suggests that although implants
   restore basic functionality to the cochlea, they don’t provide the signal complexity the auditory
   cortex requires (Johnson et al., 2016). Imagine, for example, what your photos would look like
   if your smartphone was limited to displaying them in a few hundred pixels instead of the usual
   few million. You would see the outlines of objects and some of the features, but most of the
   detail would be gone.
   Because hearing is less than optimal with current cochlear implants, researchers continue to
   improve them. One potential improvement involves adding neurotrophins (see Chapter 3) to the
   cochlear implant itself to help regenerate and repair weak neurons (Pinyon et al., 2014). In the
   future, gene replacement may be an additional option. In genetically deaf mice, replacement of
   the VGLUT3 gene improved glutamate transmission between the intact hair cells and auditory
   neurons (Akil et al., 2012) and inserting genes to replace damaged hair cells improved hearing
   to the point of ability to hear a loud conversation (György et al., 2017). Gene therapy carries
   some risks that could prevent its use in humans, but a drug has produced similar results, both
   increasing the number of supporting cells and coaxing them to develop into hair cells (McLean
   et al., 2017). Another possibility is the use of stem cells, which can be induced to develop into
   hair cells or auditory neurons; inserting the latter into chemically nerve-deafened guinea pigs
   partially restored their hearing (Chen et al., 2012). The first FDA-approved stem cell study to
   treat hearing loss is under way in a Phase 1 safety trial with infants, using stem cells from their
   own previously banked umbilical cord blood (Arcila, 2016).
   Analyzing Complex Sounds
   You may have realized that we rarely hear a pure tone. The speech, music, and
   noises that are so meaningful in our everyday lives are complex, made up of
   many frequencies. Yet we have an auditory mechanism that appears to be
   specialized for responding to individual frequencies. But a solution to this
   enigma was suggested even before Helmholtz proposed his place theory. The
   French mathematician Joseph Fourier had demonstrated 40 years earlier that any
   complex waveform—sound, electrical, or whatever—is in effect composed of
   two or more component sine waves. Fourier analysis is the analysis of a
   complex waveform into its sine wave components (Figure 9.11). A few years
   later, Georg Ohm, better known for Ohm’s law of electricity, proposed that the
   ear performs a Fourier analysis of a complex sound and sends information about
   each of the component frequencies to the cortex. Current researchers agree that
   the basilar membrane acts as the auditory Fourier analyzer, responding
   simultaneously along its length to the sound’s component frequencies.
   How does the auditory system handle complex sounds?
   Not only do we rarely hear a pure sound, but we also seldom hear a single
   complex sound by itself. At a party, we hear the music playing loudly, mixed in
   with several conversations going on all around us, as well as general sounds of
   people moving about, dancing, eating, and drinking. Despite the number of
   complex sounds assaulting our cochleas, we can separate our conversations with
   other partygoers from the other noises in the room. And we do more than that;
   we periodically sample the other sounds regularly enough to enjoy the music and
   to hear snippets of conversation across the room. The ability to sort out and
   focus on meaningful auditory messages from a complex background of
   sounds is referred to as the cocktail party effect.

   The cocktail party effect is an example of selective attention; the brain must
   select the important part of the auditory environment for emphasis and suppress
   irrelevant background information. In the auditory system, this first happens in
   the superior olivary nucleus. When we look at attention more closely in Chapter
   15, we will see that selective attention enhances activity in one part of the
   sensory cortex and reduces it in others.
   To find out what happens in the brain during the cocktail party effect, researchers
   turned to patients who had EEG electrodes placed directly on the cortex to
   determine where their seizure-causing lesions were located. When these subjects
   attended to one of two speech sources, that speech was tracked closely in the
   auditory cortex, while the competing speech was somewhat suppressed; in
   higher-order areas, including those concerned with language, the unattended
   speech dropped out completely (Horton, D’Zmura, & Srinivasan, 2013; Zion
   Golumbic et al., 2013). Although outer hair cells have very few ascending
   connections to the brain, they receive many descending fibers; stimulating those
   fibers in bats increases hair cell activity in specific areas of the basilar
   membrane, which enhances frequency sensitivity in those areas (Z. Xiao &
   Suga, 2002). By measuring evoked otoacoustic emissions in humans, French
   researchers confirmed that attention to a tone causes frequency-specific changes
   in outer hair cell activity (Maison, Micheyl, & Collet, 2001).
   Beyond distinguishing one sound from another, it is important to be able to
   identify a sound. Here it is useful to think in terms of an auditory object—a
   sound we identify as distinct from other sounds. Identifying an auditory
   object involves distinguishing characteristics such as pitch, rhythm, and tempo
   and depends on our ability to separate sounds by their directional location.
   Understand that identifying an auditory object does not imply that we recognize
   what the sound is; memory helps provide that function, enabling us to recognize
   an oncoming train or the voice of a friend. Dolphins can even recognize the
   signature whistle of former tank mates from as far back as 20 years, the typical
   dolphin lifespan in the wild (Bruck, 2013). Recognizing environmental sounds
   primarily requires posterior temporal areas and, to a lesser extent, the frontal
   cortex (J. W. Lewis et al., 2004), while recognizing individuals’ voices involves
   the secondary auditory cortex in the superior temporal area (Kriegstein &
   Giraud, 2004; Petkov et al., 2008). More generally, these sound objects activate
   the “what” pathway (see Figures 9.12 and 9.7). In a few pages, you will see that
   these areas are also important in producing and understanding language.

   How does the brain determine the locations of sounds?
   Locating Sounds
   The most obvious way to locate a sound is to turn your head until the sound is
   loudest. This is not very effective, because the sound may be gone before the
   direction is located. Three additional cues permit us to locate sounds quickly and
   accurately, including those that are too brief to allow turning the head. All three
   of these cues are binaural, meaning that they involve the use of two ears; the
   brain determines the location based on acoustic differences between the two
   ears. These cues are useless when a sound source is in the median plane
   (equidistant from the person’s ears), but if the sound is shifted to one side, the
   stimulus will differ between the ears. Animals with ears that are very close
   together (such as mice) are at a disadvantage in locating sounds because the
   differences are so small. Grasshoppers and crickets have evolved a compensation
   for their small head size: Their auditory organs are on their legs, as far apart as
   possible. Nineteenth-century sailors used a novel application of this strategy
   when they needed to locate a distant sound source: They listened through tubes
   attached to funnels at the ends of a long rod called a topophone (Figure 9.13).
   The following paragraphs describe the three binaural differences: intensity,
   timing, and phase.
   Figure 9.14 Differential Intensity and Timing as Cues for Sound Localization.
   Source: From “Navigation in Fog,” Scientific American, July 3, 1880, p. 3.
   Binaural Cues
   When a sound source is on one side, the head blocks some of the sound energy.
   The sound shadow this creates produces an interaural intensity (or level)
   difference (IID or ILD), so that the near ear receives a more intense sound
   the more it is to that side (Figure 9.14). Some of the neurons of the lateral
   superior olivary nucleus (LSO, located in the brain stem) respond to differences
   in IID at the two ears using a simple subtraction mechanism (far ear being
   excitatory, near ear being inhibitory). Because low-frequency sounds tend to
   pass through solid objects (like the head), this cue works best when the sound is
   above 2000 Hz.
   The second binaural cue for locating sounds is interaural timing difference
   (ITD) at the two ears. A sound that is directly to a person’s left or right
   takes about 0.5 milliseconds to travel the additional distance to the second
   ear (see Figure 9.14 again); humans can detect an ITD difference as small as 10
   microseconds (millionths of a second; Hudspeth, 2000), which means we can
   locate sound sources that move by as little as a degree horizontally. This
   computation is done in the medial superior olivary nucleus (MSO, Masterton,
   Jane, & Diamond, 1966). Although components of our auditory system can
   respond to smaller angles of separation, we cannot distinguish such small
   intervals consciously; this kind of precision involves automatic processing by
   specialized circuits, as we will see shortly.
   At low frequencies, a sound arriving from one side of the body will be at a
   different phase of the wave at each ear, referred to as an interaural phase
   difference (IPD) (Figure 9.15). As a result, at a given moment one eardrum will
   be pushed in more or less than the other or, at very low frequencies, one will be
   pushed in while the other is being pulled out. Some of the neurons in the
   superior olivary nucleus respond only when the inputs from the two ears have
   different IPD values. Above about 1500 Hz, a sound will have begun a new
   wave by the time it reaches the second ear, introducing something called phase
   ambiguity, which makes localizing sounds more difficult. This, like timing
   differences, is also computed in the MSO.
   Figure 9.15 Phase Difference as a Cue for Sound Localization.
   A Brain Circuit for Detecting Time Differences
   Of the neural circuits for binaural sound localization, the one for ITD has been
   studied the most thoroughly. The circuit has been mapped in the barn owl, which
   is extremely good at sound localization; in fact, it can locate a mouse in darkness
   just from the sounds it makes rustling through the grass. The circuit is in the
   nucleus laminaris, the avian (bird) counterpart of the mammalian LSO.
   Electrical recording has revealed the function of its coincidence detectors,
   neurons that fire most when they receive input from both ears at the same
   time (C. E. Carr & Konishi, 1990). Figure 9.16 is a simplified diagram of the
   Jeffress model of sound localization (Jeffress, 1948), with delay lines and
   coincidence detectors, confirmed through neuronal mapping in the barn owl.
   When the sound comes directly from the left side of the figure (Speaker A),
   Detector A will receive stimulation simultaneously from the two ears and the
   simultaneous inputs will cause the neuron to fire at a high rate. The stimulation
   is simultaneous because the connection between the near ear and the coincidence
   detector acts as a delay line, compensating for the delay in the sound reaching
   the distant ear. Likewise, Detector B will fire at its highest rate when the sound
   comes from Speaker B. When the sound source is equidistant from the two ears,
   Detector C is most active, and so on. Note that these relationships hold whether
   the sound comes from in front of the observer, behind, above, or below. This
   circuit is another example of the neural enhancement of small sensory
   differences that we referred to earlier.

   Figures Brought to Life
   These circuits can determine the direction of a sound, but that is not very useful
   by itself; it must be integrated with information from the visual environment and
   information about the position of the body in space. In Chapter 3, you learned
   that combining all this information is the function of association areas in the
   parietal lobes. So, unlike identifying sounds, locating sounds in space occurs in
   the dorsal “where” stream.
   The ultimate in sound localization is echolocation, a sort of sonar that bats,
   dolphins, whales, and even some cave-dwelling birds use to avoid obstacles and
   to detect prey and predators. Bats are so proficient that they can use the echoes
   of their ultrasonic chirps to catch insects while avoiding obstacles in total
   darkness (see Ulanovsky & Moss, 2008, for more information about these
   amazing mammals). We are currently using knowledge gained from
   echolocating mammals not only to demonstrate people who can echolocate but
   also to design new devices that use sound to help people see, which is the subject
   of the accompanying Application.
   If this were the end of our discussion of audition, it would also be the end of the
   chapter and, obviously, it is not. In humans, the most elaborate processing of
   auditory information occurs in language, which is our next topic.

   Some blind individuals have a remarkable ability to avoid obstacles in their paths, often without
   any awareness of how they do so. In 1749, the French philosopher Denis Diderot (1916) studied
   one of these adept individuals and concluded that he relied on air currents deflected by the
   obstacles. By the time Karl Dallenbach and his colleagues tackled the question at Cornell
   University, 14 theories had been proposed (Supa, Cotzin, & Dallenbach, 1944) to explain how
   blind subjects could detect a wall from 4–17 feet away. They concluded that the subjects
   accomplished this by listening to the sounds of their footsteps reflected by the obstacle as they
   approached. Their performance was still surprisingly good when they listened from another
   room through headphones as an experimenter carrying a microphone walked toward the wall.
   Blind individuals may use echolocation passively—simply listening for reflected sounds in their
   environment—or actively, by scuffing their feet or tapping a cane on the pavement, but these
   efforts can be thwarted by thick carpeting or a blanket of snow. Researchers have demonstrated
   that humans echolocate better when they actively vocalize instead of passively listen (Flanagin
   et al., 2017), and Daniel Kish is a living example of this principle. Daniel lost his eyes to cancer
   at the age of one, but he grew up surprisingly normally, even riding a bicycle to school (Kish,
   2013). It wasn’t until he was 11 that a friend pointed out to him that he was using echolocation,
   clicking his tongue two to three times a second and listening for the echoes. As an adult, he
   bikes in busy traffic, travels by plane without assistance, and hikes in the woods, where he can
   recognize trees by the difference in the way the leaves and the trunks reflect the sounds. An
   fMRI study showed that blind individuals engage part of the visual cortex during echolocation,
   an area that is well suited for processing spatial information (see figure; Thaler, Arnott, &
   Goodale, 2011).
   A team at University of California, Berkeley, took inspiration from bat echolocation to create a
   device that emits ultrasonic sweeps, whose echoes provide higher spatial resolution than sounds
   in our normal range of hearing; the device then converts the echoes to sound frequencies we can
   hear. Even untrained individuals could use the echoes to locate objects and determine their
   distance (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015).
   Language
   Now that we have gone over the basics of the auditory system, let’s apply this
   knowledge to a behavior we all need to learn: language. Few would question the
   importance of language in human behavior. Keep in mind the meaning of the
   term language: It is not limited to speech but includes the generation and
   understanding of written, spoken, and gestural communication. Communication
   through language has important survival value and is inestimably important to
   human social relationships. A person who cannot communicate his or her
   thoughts to others suffers a high degree of isolation; one who cannot
   comprehend the communications of others is worse off still. These capabilities
   not only require learning; they also depend on specific structures of the brain,
   and damage to these structures can deprive a person of some or all of these
   functions.
   For humans, the most important aspect of hearing is its role in processing language.
   —A. J. Hudspeth
   Figure 9.17 Language-Related Areas of the Cortex.
   Every language is characterized by a consistent set of rules, called grammar.
   This grammar can be quite flexible yet still convey the ideas and meaning of the
   speaker, which is called semantics. For instance, the Star Wars character Yoda
   frequently speaks with altered grammar in sentences like “See you I do,” but the
   semantic meaning is clear. The individual sounds that comprise a language are
   called phonemes. Phonemes are small units of speech sound that distinguish one
   word from another—for example, the beginning sounds that distinguish book,
   took, and cook. Phonemes can be combinations of consonants and vowels (and
   even clicks!) and vary in languages from less than 20 in Polynesian languages
   (like Hawaiian) to over 80 in Taa (spoken in Botswana and Namibia).
   In 1861, the French physician Paul Broca reported his observations of a patient
   who for 21 years had been almost unable to speak. Tan, as the hospital staff
   knew him because that was one of the few sounds he could make, died shortly
   after he came under Broca’s care. The autopsy revealed that Tan’s brain damage
   was in the posterior portion of the left frontal lobe. After studying eight other
   patients, Broca concluded that aphasia—language impairment caused by
   damage to the brain—results from damage to the frontal area anterior to the
   motor cortex, now known as Broca’s area. Nine years later, a German doctor
   named Carl Wernicke identified a second site where damage produced a
   different form of aphasia. Located in the posterior portion of the left temporal
   lobe, this site is known as Wernicke’s area. See Figure 9.17 to locate Broca’s and
   Wernicke’s areas and the other structures to be discussed here. Most of our
   understanding of the brain structures involved in language comes from studies of
   brain-damaged individuals, so this is where we will start.
   Broca’s Area
   Broca’s aphasia is language impairment caused by damage to Broca’s area
   and surrounding cortical and subcortical areas. The symptoms can best be
   understood by examining the speech of a stroke patient; as you read this
   interview, you will see why the disorder is also referred to as expressive aphasia.
   What are the differences between Broca’s aphasia and Wernicke’s aphasia?
   Doctor: What happened to make you lose your speech?
   Mr. Ford: Head, fall, Jesus Christ, me no good, str, str . . . oh Jesus . . . stroke.
   Doctor: I see. Could you tell me, Mr. Ford, what you’ve been doing in the
   hospital?
   Mr. Ford: Yes, sure. Me go, er, uh, P.T. nine o’cot, speech . . . two times . . . read
   . . . wr . . . ripe, er rike, er, write . . . practice . . . getting better. (H. Gardner,
   1975, p. 61)
   Mr. Ford’s speech was not nearly as impaired as Tan’s; he can talk, and you can
   get a pretty good idea of his meaning, but he showed the classic symptoms
   associated with damage to Broca’s area. First, his speech was non-fluent.
   Although well-practiced phrases such as “yes, sure” and “oh, Jesus” come out
   easily, his speech was halting, with many pauses between words. Second, he had
   trouble finding the right words, a symptom known as anomia (“without name”).
   He had difficulty with articulation; he mispronounced words, like “rike” for
   write. Finally, notice that his speech was agrammatic; it had content words
   (nouns and verbs) but lacked grammatical, or function, words (articles,
   adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions). The hardest phrase for a
   Broca’s aphasic to repeat is “No ifs, ands, or buts” (Geschwind, 1972).
   Broca believed that Broca’s aphasia impaired motor instructions for vocalizing
   words. But Mr. Ford could recite the days of the week and the letters of the
   alphabet, or sing “Home on the Range.” So, vocalization is not lost, but the
   ability to translate information into speech patterns is compromised. The
   problem is “upstream” from speech in the brain, so reading and writing are
   impaired as much as speech is. Comprehension is also as impaired as speech
   when the meaning depends on grammatical words. For example, the patient can
   answer questions like “Does a stone float on water?” but not the question “If I
   say, ‘The lion was killed by the tiger,’ which animal is dead?” (H. Gardner,
   1975).
   Wernicke’s Area
   In Wernicke’s aphasia, the person has difficulty understanding and
   producing spoken and written language. This is often called receptive
   aphasia, but that term is misleading because the same problems with
   understanding language also show up in producing it. For example, the person’s
   speech is fluent but meaningless. A patient asked to describe a picture of two
   boys stealing cookies behind a woman’s back said, “Mother is away here
   working her work to get her better, but when she’s looking the two boys looking
   in the other part. She’s working another time” (Geschwind, 1979). This
   meaningless speech is called word salad, for obvious reasons.
   Because the speech of the Wernicke’s patient is articulate and has the proper
   rhythm, it sounds normal to the casual listener. The first time one of us met a
   person with Wernicke’s aphasia, he was knocking on the social worker’s door at
   the nursing home, and he thought it was because his thoughts were elsewhere
   that he failed to understand one of the residents when she spoke. But then his
   “Pardon me” elicited “She’s in the frimfram,” and he realized the problem was
   hers rather than his. He responded with a pleasantry, and she gave a classic
   word-salad reply. That began a long relationship of conversations, but the
   difference was that neither of us ever understood the other; another difference
   was that it did not matter, because she seemed strangely unaware that anything
   was amiss.
   The Wernicke-Geschwind Model
   Of course, language requires more than just these two areas. Wernicke
   suggested, and Norman Geschwind later elaborated on, a model for how Broca’s
   area and Wernicke’s area interact to produce language (Geschwind, 1970, 1972,
   1979). The model is illustrated in Figure 9.18 and in the following examples.
   Answering a verbal question involves a progression of activity from the auditory
   cortex to Wernicke’s area, and then to Broca’s area. Broca’s area then formulates
   articulation of the verbal response and sends the result to the facial area of the
   motor cortex, which produces the speech. If the response is to be written,
   Wernicke’s area sends output to the angular gyrus instead, where it elicits a
   visual pattern. When a person reads aloud, the visual information is translated
   into an auditory form by the angular gyrus and then passed to Wernicke’s area,
   where a response is generated and sent to Broca’s area for directing the muscles
   of the throat, mouth, and lungs. The idea that visual information must be
   converted to an auditory form for processing arose in part from the fact that
   language evolved long before writing was invented, and Wernicke’s area was
   believed to operate in an auditory fashion.
   What is the Wernicke-Geschwind model?
   This system has long been the primary model for how language operates. It is
   relatively simple and seems to explain the various aphasias. Modern imaging
   techniques have confirmed the participation of Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas in
   language. One study has traced the progression of activity while subjects
   produced a verbal response to written material, from the visual cortex to
   Wernicke’s area and then to Broca’s area (Dhond, Buckner, Dale, Marinkovic, &
   Halgren, 2001). However, there are problems. One is that language functions are
   not limited to Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas; damage to the basal ganglia,
   thalamus, and subcortical white matter also produce aphasias (Hécaen &
   Angelergues, 1964; Mazzocchi & Vignolo, 1979; Naeser et al., 1982). Broad
   cortical areas also play an important role, though possibly only because they are
   storage sites for information. For example, noun use (naming objects) produces
   activity just below the auditory cortex and Wernicke’s area in the
   inferior/anterior temporal lobe (H. Damasio, Grabowski, Tranel, Hichwa, &
   Damasio, 1996). Verb use (describing what is happening in a picture) is impaired
   by damage to the left premotor cortex, which sends output to the motor cortex.
   This area is also activated while naming tools and by imagining body
   movements (Hauk, Johnsrude, & Pulvermüller, 2004). Apparently when tool
   names are learned, they are stored near the brain structure that would produce
   the action. And there is evidence that object categories are stored in different
   areas as well (Caramazza & Mahon, 2006).

   Geschwind, Scientific American, 241(9), pp. 180–199.
   Figures Brought to Life
   Electrical stimulation studies (Mateer & Cameron, 1989; Ojemann, 1983) and
   studies of brain damage (Hécaen & Angelergues, 1964) have also shown that the
   various components of language functioning are scattered throughout all four
   lobes (Figure 9.19). This does not mean that there is no specialization of the
   cortical areas; for example, articulation errors are still more likely to result from
   frontal damage and comprehension problems from damage in the temporal lobes
   (Hécaen & Angelergues; Mazzocchi & Vignolo, 1979). However, it does mean
   that each function depends on a network of interconnected structures rather than
   a single structure. We do know that, like vision, there are processing streams in
   the cortex devoted to language. The dorsal stream passes through frontal
   sensorimotor areas that deal with planning speech, rhyming, and working
   memory, whereas the ventral stream that passes through the left temporal gyrus
   helps us comprehend language (Hickok & Poeppel, 2007).
   Other challenges to classic theory include studies that question, for example,
   how the language structures are interconnected (Dick & Tremblay, 2012),
   indicating that spoken words are processed anterior to the auditory cortex rather
   than in Wernicke’s area (DeWitt & Rauschecker, 2012). The Wernicke-
   Geschwind view therefore has turned out to be too simple, but it has also helped
   researchers organize their thinking about language and has generated volumes of
   research—which, after all, is how we make scientific sense of our world.
   Reading, Writing, and Their Impairments
   Although aphasia affects reading and writing, these functions can be impaired
   independently of other language abilities when the visual inputs to the language
   network are interrupted. In language disorders, a complete absence of behavior
   has the prefix “a-,” while impairment of behavior has the prefix “dys-.” Alexia is
   the inability to read, and agraphia is the inability to write. Presumably, they
   are due to disruption of pathways in the angular gyrus that connect the visual
   projection area with the auditory and visual association areas in the
   temporal and parietal lobes (see Figure 9.17 again). The PET scans in Figure
   9.20 show that activity increases in this area during reading.
   Reading and writing are also impaired in learning disorders. The most common
   learning disorders are dyslexia, an impairment of reading; dysgraphia,
   difficulty in writing; and dyscalculia, a disability with arithmetic. Because of its
   importance and the amount of research that has been done, we will focus on
   dyslexia. Dyslexia can be acquired, through damage, but its origin is more often
   developmental. Developmental dyslexia is partially genetic, with an estimated
   heritability between 40% and 60% (Gayán & Olson, 2001). Of the seven most
   reliably identified genes involved in dyslexia (Scerri & Schulte-Körne, 2010),
   four are involved in neuron guidance and migration, and two contribute to cell
   functioning.

   Area.

   The implications of impaired brain development are far-reaching. The public is
   most familiar with the visual-perceptual symptoms of dyslexia: The individual
   reads words backwards (“now” becomes “won”), confuses mirror-image letters
   (p and q, b and d), and has trouble fixating on printed words, which seem to
   move around on the page. Some researchers have attributed this to slowness in
   responding to low-contrast, rapidly changing visual stimuli (Livingstone, Rosen,
   Drislane, & Galaburda, 1991); presumably, words jump around and reverse
   themselves because the reader has difficulty detecting and correcting for rapid,
   unintentional eye movements (called saccades), which affects both reading
   performance and learning to read in the first place (Bucci, Bremond-Gignac, &
   Kapoula, 2008).

   Nonimpaired and Dyslexic Readers.

   from Society of Biological Psychiatry.
   However, individuals with dyslexia also have trouble tracking the frequency and
   amplitude changes that distinguish speech sounds from each other (J. Stein,
   2001); supposedly this impairs the dyslexic’s ability to associate speech sounds
   with letters when learning to read and explains his or her slowness in reading
   nonwords. According to the phonological hypothesis, individuals with dyslexia
   have impairment in processing, storing, and/or retrieving phonemes. When a
   group of dyslexic college students was administered a battery of tests, 10 had
   auditory deficits and 2 had a visual function deficit, but all 16 suffered from a
   phonological deficit (Ramus et al., 2003). Almost all researchers in the field now
   agree that phonological impairment is the crucial problem, and even suggest that
   at least some of the visual processing problems are a consequence, rather than a
   cause, of reading impairment (Habib, 2003; Olulade, Napollello, & Eden, 2013).
   What problems have been found in the brains of people with dyslexia?
   These difficulties are accompanied by several functional and structural
   irregularities in the brain. Kindergartners who had a delayed EEG response when
   a string of repeated auditory or speech sounds was interrupted by a novel sound
   were more likely to have reading difficulties in the fifth grade (Maurer et al.,
   2009). In addition, kindergartners who scored poorly on a phonological
   awareness test used to measure risk for dyslexia had a smaller left arcuate
   fasciculus, which connects Wernicke’s area with Broca’s area (Saygin et al.,
   2013). The planum temporale, where Wernicke’s area is located, averages
   about 13% larger in the left hemisphere than the right in nondyslexics but is
   equally sized in people with dyslexia (J.S. Bloom, Garcia-Barrera, Miller, Miller,
   & Hynd, 2013). In at least some dyslexic brains, many of the neurons in the left
   planum temporale lack the usual orderly arrangement, and some of them have
   migrated past their normal destination and into the outermost layer of the cortex
   (Galaburda, 1993). One study found that young individuals with dyslexia must
   “sound out” the words in their minds, rather than visually recognizing the words
   in a much faster fashion, due to reduced connections in the left word form areas
   (Figure 9.21; Finn et al., 2014). These brain anomalies suggest that at least some
   of the origins of developmental dyslexia are prenatal.
   The incidence of dyslexia is twice as great in some cultures as in others; this
   seems to suggest a cultural explanation for the disorder, but in fact the
   discrepancies support a brain-based phonological hypothesis. Italian and Spanish
   are phonologically simpler languages, with an almost one-to-one correspondence
   between phonemes and spelling. Predictably, dyslexia is much rarer in Italy and
   Spain than in French- and English-speaking countries, where the same spelling
   may have several pronunciations (cough, tough, dough, slough). PET imaging
   shows that Italians suffering from dyslexia have the same brain impairments
   seen in French and English speakers (Figure 9.22; Paulesu et al., 2001).

   Recovery From Aphasia and Lateralization of
   Language
   There is usually some recovery from acquired aphasia during the first one or two
   years, more so for Broca’s aphasia than for Wernicke’s aphasia (I. P. Martins &
   Ferro, 1992). Initial improvement is due to reduction of the swelling that often
   accompanies brain damage rather than to any neural reorganization. Just how the
   remaining recovery occurs is not well understood, but it is a testament to the
   brain’s plasticity.
   The right hemisphere can take over language functions following left-
   hemisphere damage, if the injury occurs early in life. A two-year-old girl had a
   left-hemisphere stroke; her language was impaired, but she developed normal
   language capability by the age of seven. Then at the age of 56, she had a right-
   hemisphere stroke, which resulted in a second aphasia from which she had only
   minimal recovery (Guerreiro et al., 1995). Right-hemisphere language was
   confirmed by fMRI in all five individuals of a group who had been born with
   inadequate blood supply to the language areas of the left hemisphere (Vikingstad
   et al., 2000). Rasmussen and Milner (1977) used the Wada technique and
   electrical stimulation to determine the location of language control in patients
   before removing lesioned tissue that was causing epileptic seizures. (The Wada
   technique involves anesthetizing one hemisphere at a time by injecting a drug
   into each carotid artery; when the injection is into the language-dominant
   hemisphere, language is impaired.) Individuals whose left-hemisphere injury
   occurred before the age of five were more likely to have language control in the
   right hemisphere, supporting the hypothesis of right-hemisphere compensation.
   Patients whose left-hemisphere damage occurred later in life more often
   continued to have language control in the left hemisphere; there was, however,
   evidence in some cases that control had shifted into the border of the parietal
   lobe. Since language functions are scattered widely in the left hemisphere,
   perhaps the compensation involves enhancing already-existing activity rather
   than establishing new functional areas.
   The ability of the right hemisphere to assume language functions may result in
   part because it normally makes several contributions to language processing.
   The most obvious right-hemisphere role in language is prosody, the use of
   intonation, emphasis, and rhythm to convey meaning in speech. An example
   of one aspect of prosody is the difference between “You put the cat out when it’s
   freezing” spoken as a statement and spoken as an emotion-filled question. We
   saw in Chapter 8 that people with right-hemisphere damage have trouble
   understanding emotion when it is indicated by speaking tone and in producing
   emotional speech the same way. An fMRI study found that right-hemisphere
   activity increased while individuals detected angry, happy, sad, or neutral
   emotions from the intonation of words (Buchanan et al., 2000).
   The right hemisphere also is important in understanding information from
   language that is not specifically communicated by the meaning of the words,
   such as when the meaning must be inferred from an entire discourse or when the
   meaning is figurative rather than literal. For example, interpreting the moral of a
   story activates the right hemisphere (Nichelli et al., 1995), as does understanding
   a metaphor or determining the plausibility of statements such as “Tim used
   feathers as paperweights” (Bottini et al., 1994). Interestingly, the right-
   hemisphere regions involved in all these activities correspond generally to the
   structures we have identified in left-hemisphere language processing.
   A Language-Generating Mechanism?
   When Darwin suggested that we have an instinctive tendency to speak, what he
   meant was that infants seem very ready to engage in language and can learn it
   with minimal instruction. Children learn language with such alacrity that by the
   age of six they understand about 13,000 words, and by the time they graduate
   from high school, their working vocabulary is at least 60,000 words (Dronkers,
   Pinker, & Damasio, 2000). This means that children learn a new word about
   every 90 waking minutes. The hearing children of deaf parents pick up language
   just about as fast as children with hearing parents (Lenneberg, 1969), despite
   minimal learning opportunities. Not only are preadolescent children particularly
   sensitive language learners, but they are also believed to be the driving force in
   the development of creole language (which combines elements of two
   languages, allowing communication between the cultures). In Nicaragua,
   children in the school for the deaf, where sign language is not taught, have
   devised their own sign language with unique gestures and grammar (Senghas,
   Kita, & Özyürek, 2004).
   Man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children.
   —Charles Darwin
   Noam Chomsky (1980) and later Steven Pinker (1994) interpreted children’s
   readiness to learn language as evidence of a language acquisition device, a
   hypothesized part of the brain dedicated to learning and controlling
   language. Not all researchers agree with this idea (see below), but most accept
   that there are biological reasons why language acquisition is so easy. This ease
   cuts across forms of language. For example, both hearing and deaf infants of
   signing parents babble in hand movements (Figure 9.23); the deaf infants’
   babbling proceeds into signing through the same stages and at about the same
   pace that children of speaking parents learn vocal language (Petitto, Holowka,
   Sergio, & Ostry, 2001; Petitto & Marentette, 1991). The researchers suggest that
   the ease of children’s language acquisition is due to a brain-based sensitivity to
   rhythmic language patterns, a sensitivity that does not depend on the form of the
   language. Rhythm problems in childhood appear to correlate to reading disorders
   as adults (K. W. Carr, White-Schwoch, Tierney, Strait, & Kraus, 2014). And new
   evidence suggests that when musicians improvise passages within a larger
   ensemble, they use language centers as if they are participating in a musical
   conversation with the group (Donnay, Rankin, Lopez-Gonzalez, Jiradejvong, &
   Limb, 2014). As the accompanying In the News feature explains, we are
   predisposed to learn language as adults, even when we are not focused on it.

   In The News: Learn a New Language While You Study Psychology
   How would you like to learn a new language while doing your psychology homework? We have
   been told since we were young that we had to focus and practice to learn how to speak another
   language, but recent evidence suggests that our brains are just as good at acquiring language
   information passively when we divert our attention elsewhere (reported in Greenwood, 2017).
   In one study, two groups of participants were trained to distinguish between several similar-
   sounding phonemes of native Hindi speakers. The focus group practiced for one continuous
   hour across two days, while the other group alternated between 10 minutes of active practice
   and 10 minutes of another task for an hour while the sounds continued in the background.
   Surprisingly, the researchers discovered the “distracted” group learned the discrimination task as
   well as the “focused” group. In another study, students who were learning Spanish learned to
   distinguish among sounds better if they simply listened to the new language rather than trying to
   speak along with the new material. So there might be something to taking frequent breaks from
   intensive language study and turn on a movie in that language while you do something else.
   Thought Questions
   1. How could you apply the results of these studies to learning a new language in college?
   2. Why do you think that listening by itself leads to better language learning than listening
   while repeating?

   Innate Brain Specializations
   More than 90% of right-handed people are left-hemisphere dominant for
   language. This is also true for two-thirds to three-quarters of left-handers; the
   remainder is about equally divided between right-hemisphere dominant and
   mixed (Knecht et al., 2000; B. Milner, 1974). In the large majority of autopsied
   brains, the left-hemisphere Broca’s area is larger (Falzi, Perrone, & Vignolo,
   1982), and the lateral fissure (Yeni-Komshian & Benson, 1976) and planum
   temporale (Geschwind & Levitsky, 1968; Rubens, 1977; Wada, Clarke, &
   Hamm, 1975) are longer. These differences are not the result of usage. By the
   20th week of gestation, the left temporal lobe is already beginning to enlarge
   relative to the right (Kasprian et al., 2010), and the left planum temporale is
   larger by the 29th week (Wada et al., 1975). At birth or shortly after, speech
   causes a greater increase in cerebral blood flow than nonspeech sounds, speech
   sounds activate the same left-hemisphere language areas as in adults, and
   sentence melody activates the right hemisphere (reviewed by Friederici, 2006).
   Congenitally deaf individuals also have larger left temporal lobes, though the
   lack of auditory experience does result in fewer connections between language
   areas and auditory centers (Shibata, 2007).
   Storing Multiple Languages
   Additional evidence for a language acquisition device comes from studies of
   individuals who communicate with sign language. Left-hemisphere damage
   impairs sign-language ability more than right-hemisphere damage does (Hickok,
   Bellugi, & Klima, 1996), and communicating in sign language activates the
   classical left-hemisphere language areas (Figure 9.24; Neville et al., 1998;
   Petitto et al., 2000). This was true of both congenitally deaf and normally
   hearing signers (all of whom had used sign language from infancy), but the
   finding is especially interesting in the deaf individuals, because it cannot be the
   result of the brain simply using pathways already established by an auditory
   language. It is also interesting because Wernicke’s area has traditionally been
   considered auditory in nature, which required the conversion of written words
   into an auditory form. Either the posterior language area is inherently more
   versatile than some theorists have thought, or the area underwent reorganization
   during infancy that enabled it to handle visual language.
   Either way, language seems to be a specialized capability of a limited subset of
   brain structures.
   But what happens if a person learns a second language after childhood, when the
   brain is less plastic (Figure 9.25); will the brain then recruit other areas to handle
   the task? Two imaging studies indicate that this does happen, to some extent. In
   the first study, bilingual individuals silently “described” events from the previous
   day in each of their two languages; the languages activated separate areas in the
   frontal lobes, with centers that were 4.5–9 mm apart in different individuals.
   This was not true of subjects who learned their second language simultaneously
   with the first (K. H. S. Kim, Relkin, Lee, & Hirsch, 1997). The second study
   produced similar results in the temporal lobe when subjects heard and read
   words in their two languages (Figure 9.26; Simos et al., 2001). This separation is
   so distinct that capability can be impaired in one of the languages while the other
   is unaffected (called bilingual aphasia; Gomez-Tortosa, Martin, Gaviria, Charbel,
   & Auman, 1995; M. S. Schwartz, 1994). A colleague who is originally from
   Lebanon told one of us an interesting story about his mother. She lives in the
   United States, and she was fluent in English until a stroke impaired her ability to
   speak English, but not Arabic. Her nearby family members spoke only English,
   so when they needed to talk with her they had to telephone a relative in another
   city to translate! These observations are not as inconsistent with the hypothesis
   of a single language acquisition device as they might seem. In both the K. H. S.
   Kim et al. (1997) and the Simos et al. (2001) studies, the second-language
   locations were in the same area as Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas, respectively.

   We still cannot say that they evolved specifically to serve language functions.
   You will see in the next section that some primates show similar enlargements in
   the left hemisphere, and their possession of language is questionable at best. A
   reasonable interpretation of these data is that certain brain areas evolved simply
   to handle rapidly changing information and complex discriminations, which
   language in its various forms requires. The strongest proponent of this “language
   as use” theory is Vyvyan Evans, who cites agrammatic languages in native
   Australia, and the lack of new spontaneous languages forming in isolated groups
   of humans, as evidence that language may simply be the result of our vast
   capacity to learn. Another view is that the language areas are primarily
   specialized for different aspects of general learning: the frontal area for
   “procedural” or how-to learning that coincides with the rules of grammar and
   verb tenses, and the temporal area for “declarative” or informational learning
   and, thus, the storage of word meanings and information about irregular word
   forms (Ullman, 2001). Even if these learning structures have been “borrowed” to
   serve language functions and the concept of a dedicated language acquisition
   device isn’t meaningful, it is still clear that the human brain is uniquely well
   fitted for creating, refining, and learning language. We will explore the possible
   evolutionary roots of this ability in the context of animal language.

   Language in Nonhuman Animals
   Research has refuted most of humans’ claims to uniqueness, including tool use,
   tool making, and self-recognition. Determining whether we have exclusive
   ownership of language has been more difficult. Animal language intrigues us
   both because we’re curious whether we have any company “at the top” and
   because we want to trace the evolutionary roots of language. Because language
   (like all behaviors) leaves no fossils behind, the origin of language is “a mystery
   with all the fingerprints wiped off” (Terrence Deacon, quoted by Holden,
   2004a). Without this evidence, we are left with comparing the behavior and
   brains of our nonhuman relatives. The rationale behind animal language research
   is that any behavior or brain mechanism we share with other animals must have
   originated in common ancestors, or through similar mechanisms. Although
   dolphins, whales, and gorillas have been the subjects of mammalian research, the
   major contenders for a coprocessor of language have been the chimpanzee and
   bonobo. The reason is that humans and these ape species diverged from common
   ancestors a relatively recent 5 million years ago and we still share 99% of our
   genetic material (Prufer et al., 2012).
   A major obstacle has been deciding what we mean by language. Linguists agree
   that the vocalizations animals use to announce intentions or states (like finding
   food, detecting danger, and being hungry) are only signals and have little to do
   with language. Even the human toddler’s request of “milk” may initially be just
   a learned signal to indicate hunger and, like the monkey’s alarm call, indicate no
   language understanding. As you will see in the following discussion, some of the
   results obtained in language research with animals are equally difficult to
   interpret.
   What skills have chimps achieved in language studies?
   The first hurdle was deciding how to communicate with chimpanzees. An early
   study that attempted to teach a home-reared chimpanzee (Viki) to talk failed
   because chimpanzees lack a larynx for forming words (Hayes & Hayes, 1953;
   Kellogg, 1968). Since chimpanzees normally communicate using gestures, later
   researchers turned to American Sign Language (ASL) with better success. Over
   a four-year period, the chimpanzee Washoe learned to use 132 signs; she could
   request food or to be tickled or to play a game, and she would sign “sorry” when
   she bit someone (Fouts, Fouts, & Schoenfeld, 1984). And these gestures were
   transferrable to others: Washoe’s adopted son, Loulis, learned 47 signs from her
   and three other chimps. The chimps regularly carried on sign-language
   conversations among themselves, most requesting hugs or tickling, asking to be
   chased, and signing “smile” (Fouts et al., 1984). But critics argued that no
   chimpanzee had learned to form a sentence; they concluded that expressions
   such as “banana me eat banana” are just a “running-on” of words, and Washoe’s
   signing “water bird” in the presence of a swan was not the inventive
   characterization of “a bird that inhabits water” but the separate identification of
   the bird and the water it was on (Terrace, Petitto, Sanders, & Bever, 1979).
   Results were more remarkable with bonobos, a near relative of chimpanzees and
   equally close to humans. When Duane and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh trained the
   bonobo Mutata to communicate by pressing symbols on a panel, her son Kanzi
   spontaneously began to communicate with the symbols and eventually learned
   150 of them without any formal instruction (Figure 9.27; S. Savage-Rumbaugh,
   1987; S. Savage-Rumbaugh, McDonald, Sevcik, Hopkins, & Rubert, 1986).
   Kanzi uses the board to request specific food items or to be taken to specific
   locations on the 55-acre research preserve, asks one person to chase a specific
   other person, and responds to similar requests from trainers. His communication
   skills have been estimated at the level of a two-year-old child (E. S. Savage-
   Rumbaugh et al., 1993).
   Clearly, chimps and bonobos use predominantly gestural communication
   mechanisms, while we use a vocal mechanism. How did our spoken language
   evolve from a gestural one? There are two theories that have the most support.
   One theory, described by Corballis (2002), suggests that vocal language was a
   replacement for gestural language, to communicate over longer distances.
   Another theory, put forth by Dunbar (1996), suggests a more social role in
   communication; as groups of apes grew large, the grooming signals used to bond
   with others were replaced by vocal ones so that the hands could be used for other
   things like foraging. Dunbar’s theory explains why most of us are right-handed
   and why speech is processed in the left hemisphere—gestural language
   controlled by the left hemisphere became vocal language in the same areas.
   Taken together, both theories explain why our greatest successes in
   communicating with chimps and bonobos have come through ASL—while we
   communicate primarily using vocalizations, primates communicate primarily
   using gestures.

   What about other, nonrelated animals? There is evidence that birds evolved a
   very human-like language system, even though birds and humans are
   evolutionarily separated by over 350 million years. Even Charles Darwin, in his
   book The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871), comments on
   the similarities between birdsong and human speech. Irene Pepperberg (1993)
   emphasized concept learning with her African gray parrot, Alex, but his
   communication skills turned out to be equally interesting. Using speech, Alex
   could tell his trainer how many items she was holding, the color of an item, or
   whether two items differed in shape or color. He also could respond to complex
   questions, such as “What shape is the green wood?” In addition, birds learn
   language in similar ways to us (see Marler, 1997, for a review); birds can have
   geographically distinct song dialects, which are regionally stable variations in
   language (Marler & Tamura, 1964); and can even learn grammatical patterns
   like us (Gentner, Fenn, Margoliash, & Nusbaum, 2006). Some birds, like the
   mockingbird, can even learn new “words” throughout adulthood and can control
   their vocal apparatus in ways that mimic other species’ patterns (Zollinger &
   Suthers, 2004).
   So do we share language ability with animals? The behavior of animals like
   Loulis, Kanzi, and Alex requires us to rethink our assumptions about human
   uniqueness, but no animal has yet turned in the critical language performance,
   and as far as we know, no animals in the wild have developed anything
   resembling a true language. But what some researchers do see in the animals’
   performance is evidence of evolutionary foundations of our language abilities
   (Gannon, Holloway, Broadfield, & Braun, 1998).
   Neural and Genetic Antecedents
   An approach of some researchers has been to determine whether other animals
   share with us any of the brain organization associated with human language. The
   results have been intriguing. In the chimpanzee, as with humans, there is a
   greater ratio of white to gray matter in the left hemisphere than in the right
   (Cantalupo et al., 2009), and the left lateral fissure is longer and the planum
   temporale is larger (Gannon et al., 1998; Yeni-Komshian & Benson, 1976).
   Japanese macaque monkeys respond better to calls of their own species when the
   recorded calls are presented through headphones to the right ear (and, therefore,
   primarily to the left hemisphere) than when they are presented to the left ear.
   There is no left-hemisphere advantage for the (nonmeaningful) calls of another
   monkey species (M. R. Petersen, Beecher, Zoloth, Moody, & Stebbins, 1978).
   Dolphins and the Rumbaughs’ chimps Austin and Sherman responded more
   quickly when symbols or command gestures were presented to their left
   hemisphere (Hopkins & Morris, 1993; Morrel-Samuels & Herman, 1993).
   Songbirds and parrots have language centers functionally analogous to Broca’s
   and Wernicke’s areas (called RA and HVC, respectively; Vu, Mazurek, & Kuo,
   1994). Finally, birds also have a dominant side of the brain for controlling song:
   dominant-side lesions to HVC in both canary and zebra finch brains severely
   disrupted their songs (Nottebohm, 1977; H. Williams, Crane, Hale, Esposito, &
   Nottebohm, 1992).
   Do other animals share our brain structures for language?
   Many researchers consider hand and face gestures to be more analogous to
   human speech than animal vocalizations are. They think that our ancestors
   communicated this way, aided in forming this simple but effective prelanguage
   by emerging language structures (Holden, 2004a; MacNeilage, 1998).
   Chimpanzees, our best living window into that ancestral past, communicate
   primarily through hand and face gestures (Figure 9.28), and one-third of the
   hand gestures used by chimpanzees in the wild are like those used by humans,
   such as beckoning to an individual or waving an individual away (A. I. Roberts,
   Vick, Roberts, Buchanan-Smith, & Zuberbühler, 2012). These researchers also
   believe that the ability to imitate gestures was critical to the development of
   language in humans; in fact, research indicates that children initially learn
   speech not by imitating sounds but by imitating the actions of the mouth
   (Goodell & Studdert-Kennedy, 1993), and the amount of gesturing at 14 months
   predicts vocabulary size at 54 months (Rowe & Goldin-Meadow, 2009). Now
   language theorists think they have identified the mechanism for the imitative
   development of language in mirror neurons, which you learned about in Chapter
   8.
   Mirror neurons were first discovered in the area of the monkey brain that
   corresponds to Broca’s area; they respond not only to monkeys’ hand movements
   but also to communicative mouth gestures such as lip smacking (Ferrari,
   Gallese, Rizzolatti, & Fogassi, 2003). In humans, they are in Broca’s area and
   Wernicke’s area and in the parietal lobe (Grèzes, Armony, Rowe, & Passingham,
   2003; Holden, 2004a). Human mirror neurons are most active during imitation
   of another’s movement (Iacoboni et al., 1999), which has encouraged the belief
   that they figure prominently in imitative ability and, thus, in the evolution of
   language (Figure 9.29). However, the fact that we share mirror neurons with
   monkeys and chimpanzees does not imply that monkeys and chimpanzees also
   share our language abilities. In fact, the evolutionary clues we do have suggest
   that language developed well after the split that led to humans and chimpanzees
   (Holden, 2004a). In addition, the involvement of songbird HVC neurons in both
   the perception and the production of song is highly analogous to mirror neurons
   in human language centers (Prather et al., 2008), suggesting that any species
   with mirror neurons may be capable of eventually evolving language. Whatever
   brain foundations of language we share with other animals required extensive
   refinement, such as expansion of the brain, including the language areas;
   migration of the larynx lower in the throat, which increased vocalization range;
   and the development of imitative ability, which is poor in nonhuman primates
   (Holden, 2004a).

   Suggesting that language is a product of evolution means, of course, that genes
   are involved. KIAA0319, one of the genes contributing to dyslexia, also plays a
   role in the development of speech and language (M. L. Rice, Smith, & Gayán,
   2009), and CNTNAP2 and ATP2C2 have been implicated in language
   impairment (Newbury, Fisher, & Monaco, 2010; Vernes et al., 2008). ROBO1, a
   gene that controls axon guidance in fetal speech and hearing areas (C. Johnson,
   Drgon, McMahon, & Uhl, 2009), has been implicated in a particularly severe
   type of dyslexia (Hannula-Jouppi et al., 2005) and is also found in avian brain
   areas involved in song learning (R. Wang et al., 2015). But the most researched
   and best understood language gene is FOXP2. A mutation of this gene results in
   reduced gray matter in Broca’s area, along with articulation difficulties,
   problems identifying basic speech sounds, grammatical difficulty, and trouble
   understanding sentences (C. S. L. Lai, Fisher, Hurst, Vargha-Khadem, &
   Monaco, 2001; Pinker, 2001; Vargha-Khadem, Gadian, Copp, & Mishkin, 2005).
   We also share this gene with chimpanzees, but the human version differs in two
   apparently very important amino acids. The human version has been found in
   Neanderthal remains (J. Krause et al., 2007), and other fossil and archaeological
   evidence suggests to some researchers that the Neanderthals had the capacity for
   language. According to the researchers, the Neanderthals’ increased nerve supply
   (assessed from the size of the bony pathways) enabled the voluntary control of
   the tongue and respiratory muscles necessary for speech; their auditory system
   specialized them for sensitivity in the speech range; and the spread of complex
   tool designs implied the imitative ability involved in learning speech (Dediu &
   Levinson, 2013). In a recent study, mice genetically altered to carry a human
   form of FOXP2 enhanced their ability to turn thoughts into actions through
   increased dopamine activity in the striatum (an area involved in fine movements
   and memory; Schreiweis et al., 2014). Although the evidence is circumstantial
   and the interpretation subjective, it does appear that modern language has roots
   in the far distant past. However, not all the innovation has been in the human
   ancestral line, as the accompanying In the News feature reveals.

   In The News: Language Dialects: You Are From What You Say
   Did you know your state (or country) of origin could be deduced by the words you say? While
   someone from the United Kingdom might say “knackered” when tired, and folks from Australia
   call a charcoal grill a “barbie,” there is evidence of strong regional dialects in the United States
   itself. A book by a statistician, Joshua Katz, of North Carolina State University, demonstrates
   that there are some remarkably precise and predictable dialect boundaries in American English
   (Katz, 2016).
   Do you call a carbonated beverage “pop,” “soda,” or “coke”? The “pop” crowd tends to be in
   the northern United States. The “soda” group includes the desert Southwest, the Northeast, and
   for some reason the area around St. Louis. The “coke” bunch is in the South, east of New
   Mexico. Do you call the thing you drink water out of in school a “bubbler”? You’re from
   Wisconsin. Do you call something diagonally across an intersection “catty-corner,” or do you
   say “kitty-corner”? That separates those who grew up in the South (catty) from those who grew
   up in the North and West (kitty). Sometimes a particular word can originate from a very small
   area. In Putnam and Westchester counties in New York, where Gerald grew up, there was a
   rather unique name for a sandwich with meats, vegetables, and cheese: They call it a “wedge”
   because of the slice taken out of the bread roll. The best meatball wedge in the area came from
   Rodak’s restaurant in Mahopac, New York. Good stuff. Gerald is from New York, so he enjoys
   bottles of “soda,” refers to a group of people as “you guys,” and wears “sneakers.” Bob, on the
   other hand, grew up in Texas, so he calls these things “coke,” “y’all,” and “tennis shoes.” If you
   want to learn about geographical language oddities (like the Deep South term “the devil beating
   his wife” for when it rains when the sun is shining) and other dialectical differences, be sure to
   read Katz’s book, Speaking American (2016).
   So where do we get these localized differences in language, seeing that we all learn the same
   basic language rules and vocabulary in school? We learn these differences during the sensitive
   period of our language development, when a group of people decide to call something a unique
   term, and it passes from person to person through cultural learning until most of the people in
   that area use the same term. Once learned, we carry these regional differences with us for the
   rest of our lives, which serves as a reminder of where we began our journeys. They indicate the
   background we’ve each had and the experiences we went through, and they provide clues to
   how little we seem to travel from our birth areas.

   In Perspective
   Our guess is that at the beginning of this chapter you would have said that vision
   is the most important sense. Perhaps now you can appreciate why Helen Keller
   thought her deafness was a greater handicap than her blindness. Hearing alerts us
   to danger, brings us music, and provides for the social interactions that bind
   humans together. Small wonder that during evolution, the body invested such
   resources in the intricate mechanisms of hearing.
   Hearing has important adaptive functions with or without the benefit of
   language, but from our vantage point as language-endowed humans, it is easy to
   understand Hudspeth’s (2000) claim that audition’s most important role is in
   processing language. The person who is unable to talk is handicapped; the
   person who is unable to understand and to express language is nearly helpless.
   No wonder we put so much research effort into understanding how language
   works.
   Some of the most exciting directions that language research has taken have
   involved attempts to communicate with our closest nonhuman relatives, and to
   make sense of the chirps and warbles of birds. Whether they possess language
   capabilities depends on how we define language. It is interesting how the
   capabilities we consider most characteristic of being human—such as language
   and consciousness—are the hardest to define. As so often happens, studying our
   animal relatives, however distant they may be, helps us understand ourselves.
   Chapter Summary
   Sensation requires a receptor that is specialized for the kind of stimulus. Beyond
   sensation, the brain carries out further analysis, called perception.
   Hearing
   The auditory mechanism responds mostly to airborne vibrations, which vary in frequency
   and intensity.
   Sounds are captured and amplified by the outer ear and transformed into neural impulses
   in the inner ear by the hair cells on the basilar membrane. The signal is then transmitted
   through the brain stem and the thalamus to the auditory cortex in each temporal lobe.
   Frequency discrimination depends mostly on the basilar membrane’s differential vibration
   along its length to different frequencies, resulting in neurons from each location carrying
   frequency-specific information to the brain. At lower frequencies, neurons fire at the
   same rate as the sound’s frequency; it is possible that intermediate frequencies are
   represented by neurons firing in volleys, though research has not indicated that the brain
   utilizes this information.
   Although the cochlea is specialized for responding to pure tones, the basilar membrane
   apparently performs a Fourier analysis on complex sounds, breaking down a sound into
   its component frequencies.
   When different sounds must be distinguished from each other, stimulation from the brain
   probably adjusts the sensitivity of the hair cells to emphasize one sound at the expense of
   others. Selective attention also results in differential activity in areas of the cortex.
   Locating sounds helps us approach or avoid sound sources and to attend to them despite
   competition from other sounds.
   The brain has specialized circuitry for detecting the binaural cues of differences in
   intensity, timing, and phase at the two ears.
   Language
   Researchers have identified two major language areas in the brain, with Broca’s area
   involved with speech production and grammatical functions and Wernicke’s area with
   comprehension.
   Damage to either area produces different symptoms of aphasia, and damage to
   connections with the visual cortex impairs reading and writing. Developmental dyslexia
   may involve planum temporale abnormalities, reduced activity in the posterior language
   area, or deficiencies in the auditory and visual pathways.
   Although damage to the left frontal or temporal lobes is more likely to produce the
   expected disruptions in language, studies have shown that control of the various
   components of language is distributed across the four lobes.
   Although some animals have language-like brain structures and have been taught to
   communicate in simple ways, it is controversial whether they possess true language.
   Their study suggests some possible evolutionary antecedents of language. Several genes
   with language functions have been identified, the best known being a variant of FOXP2,
   which was shared by Neanderthals.
   Since language is learned, there are regional differences, called dialects, that give clues as
   to the origin of individuals.

   For Further Thought
   Write a modified Wernicke-Geschwind theory of language control, based on later evidence.
   Would you rather give up your hearing or your vision? Why?
   Make the argument that chimps possess language, though at a low level. Then argue the
   opposite, that their behavior does not rise to the level of language.

   2. neurons specific for frequencies above 5000 Hz have not been found.
   3. the entire basilar membrane vibrates about equally at low frequencies.
   4. volleying does not follow sound frequencies above about 5000 Hz.
   7. An auditory neuron’s tuning curve tells you

   1. a vibrating object in the environment.
   2. a sound recognized as distinct from others.
   3. the sound source the individual is paying attention to.
   4. none of the above
   10. As a binaural sound location cue, difference in intensity works
   1. poorly at low frequencies.
   2. poorly at medium frequencies.
   3. poorly at high frequencies.
   4. about equally at all frequencies.

   showing that American Sign Language activates
   1. the left hemisphere.
   2. the left and right hemispheres.
   3. both frontal lobes.
   4. the occipital lobe.
   15. The most reasonable conclusion regarding language in animals is that
   1. they can use words or signs but do not possess language.
   2. they can learn language to the level of a six-year-old human.
   3. language is “built in” for humans but can be learned by animals.
   4. some animals have brain structures similar to human language structures.
   16. The role of mirror neurons in language development is supposedly in the
   1. imitation of word sounds.

   Jonathan I. was in his car when a small truck hit it. In the emergency room, he
   was told that he had a concussion. For a few days, he was unable to read, saying
   that the letters looked like Greek, but fortunately this alexia soon disappeared.
   Jonathan was a successful artist who had worked with the renowned Georgia
   O’Keeffe, and he was eager to return to his work. Driving to his studio, he
   noticed that everything appeared gray and misty, as if he were driving in a fog.
   When he arrived at his studio, he found that even his brilliantly colored paintings
   had become gray and lifeless.

   His whole world changed. People’s appearance was repulsive to him, because
   their skin appeared “rat colored”; he lost interest in sex with his wife for that
   reason. Food was unattractive, and he came to prefer black and white foods
   (coffee, rice, yogurt, black olives). His enjoyment of music was diminished, too;
   before the accident, he used to experience synesthesia, in which musical tones
   evoked a sensation of changing colors, and this pleasure disappeared as well.
   Even his migraine headaches, which had been accompanied by brilliantly
   colored geometric hallucinations, became “dull.” He retained his vivid imagery,
   but it too was without color.
   From the patterns of stimulation on the retina we perceive the world of objects and this is
   nothing short of a miracle.
   —Richard Gregory
   Over the next two years, Jonathan seemed to forget that color once existed, and
   his sorrow lifted. His wife no longer appeared rat colored, and they resumed
   sexual activity. He turned to drawing and sculpting and to painting dancers and
   race horses, rendered in black and white but characterized by movement, vitality,
   and sensuousness. However, he preferred the colorless world of darkness and
   would spend half the night wandering the streets (O. Sacks & Wasserman, 1987).
   Vision enables us to read and to absorb large amounts of complex information. It
   helps us navigate in the world, build structures, and avoid danger. Color helps
   distinguish objects from their background, and it enriches our lives with natural
   beauty and works of art. We suspect that in contrast to Helen Keller’s belief that
   deafness was a greater affliction than blindness, most of you would consider
   vision the most important of our senses. Apparently, researchers share that
   opinion, because vision has received more research attention than the other
   senses combined. Thus, we understand a great deal about how the brain
   processes visual information. In addition, studies of vision are providing a
   valuable model for understanding complex neural processing in general.
   Light and the Visual Apparatus
   Vision is an impressive capability. There are approximately 97 million light
   receptors in the human eye (Curcio, Sloan, Kalina, & Hendrickson, 1990), and a
   complex network of cells connecting them to each other and to the optic nerve.
   The optic nerve itself boasts a million axons (Mikelberg, Drance, Schulzer,
   Yidegiligne, & Wels, 1989), compared with 30,000 in the auditory nerve. The
   optic nerve transmits information to the brain at an estimated 100 million bits
   per second, comparable to Ethernet data transmission rates (Koch et al., 2006).
   What our brain does with the information it receives from the eye is equally
   remarkable. The topics of vision and visual perception form an exciting story,
   one of high-tech research and conflicting theories, and dedicated scientists’
   lifelong struggles to understand our most amazing sense.
   The Visible Spectrum
   To understand vision, we need to start at the beginning by describing the
   adequate stimulus, as we did with audition. To say that the stimulus for vision is
   light seems obvious, but the point needs some elaboration. Visible light is a part
   of the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum includes a
   variety of energy forms, ranging from gamma rays at one extreme of
   frequency to the radiations of alternating current circuits at the other
   (Figure 10.1); the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can see is
   represented by the colored area in the figure.
   The visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum accounts for only 1/70 of the
   frequency range. Most of the frequencies are not useful for producing images;
   for instance, AM, FM, and analog television waves pass right through objects.
   Some of the other energy forms, such as X-rays and radar, can be used for
   producing images, but they require powerful energy sources and special
   equipment for detecting the images. Heat-producing objects give off infrared
   energy, which some nocturnal animals (such as the sidewinder rattlesnake) use to
   detect their prey in darkness. Humans can convert infrared images to visible
   ones with the aid of specialized equipment, and this capability is very useful to
   the military and law enforcement for detecting heat-producing individuals, heat-
   producing vehicles, and armament at night. Sometimes this ability can be used to
   deceive heat-detecting equipment; during the first Gulf War, the Iraqi army set
   up plywood silhouettes of tanks with heaters behind them to distract Allied
   airplanes. But infrared is best for detecting nearby objects—distant ones have
   blurred edges and fuzzy detail. The electromagnetic energy within our detectable
   (visible) range produces well-defined images because it is reflected from objects
   with minimal distortion. We are adapted to life in the daytime, and we sacrifice
   the ability to see in darkness in exchange for crisp, colorful images of faces and
   three-dimensional objects in daylight. In other words, our sensory equipment is
   adapted for detecting the energy that is most useful to us, just as the night-
   hunting sidewinder rattlesnake is equipped to detect the infrared radiation
   emitted by its prey and a bat’s ears are specialized for the high-frequency sound
   waves it bounces off small insects.
   Figure 10.1 The Electromagnetic Spectrum.
   Light is a form of oscillating energy and travels in waves just as sounds do. We
   could specify visible light (and the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum) in terms
   of frequency, just as we did with sound energy, but the numbers would be
   extremely large. So, we describe light in terms of its wavelength—the distance
   the oscillating energy travels in one complete cycle. (We could do the same with
   sound, but those numbers would be just as inconveniently small.) The unit of
   wavelength is the nanometer (nm), which is a billionth of a meter; visible light
   ranges from about 380 to 800 nm. Notice in Figure 10.1 that different
   wavelengths correspond to different colors of light; for example, when light in
   the range of 500 to 570 nm strikes the receptors in our eye, we normally report
   seeing green. Later in the chapter, we will qualify this relationship when we
   examine why wavelength does not always correspond to the color we see (just
   like our pitch perception isn’t perfectly aligned with sound frequency).
   The Eye and Its Receptors
   The eye is a spherically shaped structure filled with a clear, thick liquid (Figure
   10.2a). The white outer covering, or sclera, is opaque except for the cornea,
   which is transparent. Behind the cornea is the iris, which gives your eye its color.
   The iris is a circular muscle that controls the amount of light entering your eye
   by contracting reflexively in bright light and relaxing in dim light. You can
   observe this response in yourself by watching in a mirror while you change the
   level of light in the room. The pupil is not a real structure, but simply a hole in
   the iris muscle; it looks black because light that enters your eye doesn’t come
   out. Behind the iris is the lens. Notice in the figure that the lens reflects the
   image upside down and backwards onto the retina. You can demonstrate this by
   touching the side of your eye through your closed lid—you’ll be manually
   stimulating the retina on one side, but you’ll see a flashing spot on the other side
   of your eye—if you move your finger down, the spot moves up. Because the
   normally flat lens is a transparent yet remarkably flexible tissue, the muscles
   attached to it can contract to make the lens rounder to focus on a near
   object through a process called accommodation (Figure 10.3).

   Principles of Neural Science (5th Edition), 2012.
   The retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the rear of the eye, is made up of two
   main types of light-sensitive receptor cells, called rods and cones, and the
   neurons that are connected to them. As you can see in Figure 10.4, the
   receptors—collectively referred to as photoreceptors—are at the very back of the
   eye. Light must pass through the neural cells to reach the photoreceptors over
   much of the retinal surface, but this presents little problem because the neural
   cells are very small and transparent (see Figure 10.2b). The photoreceptors
   connect to bipolar cells, which in turn connect to ganglion cells, whose axons
   form the optic nerve. The photoreceptors are filled with light-sensitive
   chemicals called photopigments. The photopigment absorbs energy from the
   light that causes some of the molecules to break down into two components, and
   the ensuing chemical reaction ultimately results in a neural response. The two
   components then recombine to maintain the supply of photopigment.
   Figure 10.3 Accommodation of the Lens.
   Source: Schwartz, B. L. & Krantz, J. H. (2015).
   The rods and cones are named for their shapes, as you can see by looking at
   Figure 10.4 again. The human eye contains about 92 million rods and about 4.6
   million cones (Curcio et al., 1990). The two types of receptors contain different
   kinds of photopigments; rods and cones function similarly, but their chemical
   contents and their neural connections give them different specializations.
   How does the eye detect light?
   The rod photopigment is called rhodopsin; the name refers to its color (from
   the Latin rhodon, “rose”), not to its location in rods. Rhodopsin absorbs light
   much faster than cone photopigment, so it is used exclusively for low-light
   situations. In very bright light, the rhodopsin in your eyes remains broken down
   most of the time, so the rods are not useful. The brief delay in adjusting to a
   darkened movie theater is due to the time it takes the rhodopsin to resynthesize.
   Iodopsin, the cone photopigment, requires a high light intensity level, so your
   cones function well in daylight but are nonfunctional in dark situations. Three
   varieties of iodopsin, located in different cone types, respond best to different
   wavelengths of light; this means that cones detect only certain different
   wavelengths, whereas rods differentiate only among different levels of light and
   dark (which is why you cannot recognize colors in dim light).
   Rods and cones also differ in their retinal distribution and in their amount of
   neural interconnection. Cones are most concentrated in the fovea, a 1.5-
   millimeter-diameter circle in the middle of the retina, and drop off rapidly
   with distance from that point. Rods are most concentrated at 20 degrees from the
   fovea; from that point, they decrease in number in all directions and fall to zero
   in the fovea. In the center of the fovea, there is one ganglion cell for each cone;
   the number of cones per ganglion cell increases with distance from the center but
   remains small compared with rods. Because few cones share ganglion cells, the
   fovea has higher visual acuity, or ability to distinguish details. In contrast,
   many rods share a single ganglion cell; this reduces their resolution but enhances
   their already greater sensitivity to dim light. The area of the retina from which
   a ganglion cell (or any other cell in the visual system) receives its input is the
   cell’s receptive field. So, we can say that receptive fields are smaller in the fovea
   and larger in the periphery. Table 10.1 summarizes the characteristics of these
   two visual systems.
   The receptors’ response to light is different from what you might expect, because
   they are most active when they are not being stimulated by light. In darkness, the
   photoreceptor’s sodium and calcium channels are open, allowing these ions to
   flow in freely. Thus, the membrane is partially depolarized; the receptor releases
   a continuous flow of glutamate, and this inhibits activity in the bipolar cells. The
   chemical response that occurs when light strikes the photopigments closes the
   sodium and calcium channels, reducing the release of glutamate in proportion to
   the amount of light. The bipolar cells release more neurotransmitters, which
   increases the firing rate in the ganglion cells. (The photoreceptors and bipolar
   cells do not produce action potentials.) In neural terms, ganglion cells undergo
   what is called “release from inhibition.”

   If you look again at Figure 10.4, you can see that the rods and cones are highly
   interconnected by horizontal cells. In addition, amacrine cells connect across
   many ganglion cells. This might suggest to you that the retina does more than
   transmit information about points of light to the brain. You might also suspect
   that a great deal of processing goes on in the retina itself. You will soon see that
   both are true. With such complexity, it’s no wonder most vision scientists
   consider the retina to be part of the brain and refer to the optic nerve as a tract!
   Pathways to the Brain
   The axons of the ganglion cells join and pass out of each eye to form the two
   optic nerves (Figure 10.5). Where the nerve exits the eye, there are no receptors,
   so it is referred to as the blind spot (see Figure 10.2a). This point is located about
   20 degrees toward the outside and down slightly from the usual focal point of
   each retina. The blind spots of the two eyes fall at different points in a visual
   scene, so you do not notice that any of your visual world is missing; besides,
   your brain is good at “filling in” missing information, even when a small part of
   the visual system is damaged. The two optic nerves run to a point just in front of
   the pituitary, where they join for a short distance at the optic chiasm before
   separating again and traveling to their first synapse in the lateral geniculate
   nuclei of the thalamus. At the optic chiasm, axons from the nasal sides of the
   eyes cross to the other side and go to the occipital lobe in the opposite
   hemisphere. Neurons from the outside half of the eyes (the temporal side) do not
   cross over but go to the same side of the brain.
   Figure 10.5 Projections From the Retinas to the Cerebral Hemispheres.
   Figures Brought to Life
   It seems like splitting the output of each eye between the two hemispheres would
   cause a major distortion of the image. However, if you look closely at Figure
   10.5, you can see that the arrangement keeps related information together. Notice
   that the letter A, which appears in the person’s left visual field (the part of the
   environment being registered on the retina), casts an image on the right half
   of each retina. The information from the right half of each eye will be
   transmitted to the right hemisphere. An image in the right visual field will
   similarly be projected to the left hemisphere. This is how researchers who study
   differences in the functions of the two cerebral hemispheres can project a visual
   stimulus to one hemisphere. They present the stimulus slightly to the left or to
   the right of the midline; the exposure time is too brief to allow the subject to
   shift the eyes toward the stimulus, and with brief exposures the information does
   not transfer to the other hemisphere.
   How does information about an object on your right end up in your left
   hemisphere?
   Although it appears that information from both eyes is integrated at the lateral
   geniculate nuclei (LGN) in Figure 10.5, information from each eye is processed
   in separate areas of the primary visual cortex (V1). If you close one eye in a
   research animal, and then stain V1 for cytochrome oxidase (which indicates
   metabolic activity), only the areas of V1 that were actively processing visual
   information would be darkly stained. When you look at the tissue under a
   microscope, you can see clear light and dark bands that appear like a fingerprint.
   These stripes are called ocular (left and right) dominance columns.
   How does retinal disparity help us see 3-D?
   There is a good reason you have two forward-facing eyes, instead of one like the
   mythical Cyclops or one on each side of your head like many animals. The
   approximately 6-centimeter (cm) separation of your eyes produces retinal
   disparity, a discrepancy in the location of an object’s image on the two
   retinas. Figure 10.6 shows how the image of distant objects in a scene falls
   toward the nasal side of each retina and closer objects cast their image in the
   temporal half. Retinal disparity is detected in the visual cortex, where different
   neurons fire depending on the amount of lateral displacement. Then in the
   anterior parietal cortex this information is combined with information about an
   object’s shape and location to provide information about the distance of objects
   (J.-B. Durand et al., 2007). There are several good demonstrations of retinal
   disparity; the simplest is to hold your finger a foot (30 cm) in front of you and
   alternately close one eye and then the other while you notice how your finger
   moves relative to the background. The ViewMaster 3-D viewer you may have
   had as a child took advantage of your brain’s retinal disparity detectors by
   presenting each eye with an image photographed at a slightly different angle. 3-
   D movies use the same principle, but differently polarized lenses in the special
   glasses separate the two images. A striking 3-D effect can also be obtained
   without a viewer from stereograms such as those created by Magic Eye.

   As the rest of the story of vision unfolds, you will notice three themes that will
   help you understand how the visual system works: inhibition, modularity, and
   hierarchical processing. You will learn that neural inhibition is just as important
   as excitation, because it sharpens information beyond the processing capabilities
   of a system that depends on excitation alone. You will also learn that, like
   hearing and language, the visual system carries out its functions in discrete
   specialized structures, or modules, which pass information to each other in a
   serial, hierarchical fashion.

   Color Vision
   In Figure 10.1, you saw that there is a correspondence between color and
   wavelength; this would suggest that color is a property of the light reflected from
   an object and, therefore, of the object itself. However, wavelength does not
   always predict color, as Figure 10.7 illustrates. The circle on the left and the
   circle on the right appear to be different colors, although they reflect exactly the
   same wavelengths. Just as with the auditory terms pitch and loudness, the term
   color refers to the observer’s experience rather than a characteristic of the object.
   Thus, it is technically incorrect to say that the light is red or that a book is blue,
   because red and blue are experiences that are imposed by the brain. However, in
   the interest of simplicity, we will be rather casual about this point in future
   discussions, as long as we understand that “red” and “blue” are experiences
   rather than object characteristics. To understand the experience of color, we must
   now examine the neural equipment that we use to produce that experience. Our
   understanding of color vision has been guided over the past two centuries by two
   competing theories: the trichromatic theory and the opponent process theory.
   Figure 10.7 Independence of Wavelength and Color.
   Application: Restoring Lost Vision
   The World Health Organization (2013) estimates that 285 million people worldwide suffer from
   blindness or impaired vision, but researchers now have several promising strategies for restoring
   lost vision such as camera-based electrode grids, photosensitive polymer implants, and stem cell
   therapy. The camera-based electrode grids use a strategy that is like the cochlear implants
   discussed in Chapter 9, where a glasses-mounted camera converts images into a grid of
   electrode impulses delivered to the retina. Several other systems are in clinical trials, including
   one that uses a light-sensitive chip mounted behind the retina. One of its advantages is that it
   allows the recipient to look around by moving the eyes rather than turning the head (Stingl et al.,
   2013).
   Of course, the ideal treatment would be to make the damaged retina respond to light on its own,
   and research teams are making impressive progress to accomplish this. Fortunately, ganglion
   cells usually survive when diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa damage the rods and cones. A
   recently designed retinal prosthetic uses photosensitive polymers embedded just behind the
   retina; the light-sensitive polymers convert light to electrical signals that are picked up by the
   ganglion cells (see figure). After six months, rats with degenerative blindness had increased
   levels of activity in the visual cortex and could detect (Maya-Vetencourt et al., 2017). An
   optogenetic method seeks to restore vision in people who have lost their retinal receptors by
   inserting a synthetic light-sensitive glutamate channel (called LiGluR6) into ganglion cells to
   make them work like photoreceptors (Caporale et al., 2011). In a human clinical trial, retinal
   stem cell injections produced improved vision or stabilization after six months (W. T. Schmidt,
   2015). Finally, there are promising results using gene therapy (see Chapter 2). In one study,
   vision was restored in mice with damaged retinas when a virus encoding a synthetic form of
   rhodopsin (channelrhodopsin) was injected (Bi et al., 2006). In another, injection of a pigment
   gene (RPE65) into retinas with a damaged gene has been found safe and effective in restoring
   vision in animals (Amado et al., 2010). While these methods are not ready for routine
   implementation in humans, they are demonstrating promise for individuals with vision loss.

   Trichromatic Theory
   After observing the effect of passing light through a prism, Sir Isaac Newton
   proposed in 1672 that white light is composed of seven fundamental colors that
   cannot themselves be resolved into other colors. If there are seven “pure” colors,
   this would suggest that there must be seven receptors and brain pathways for
   distinguishing color, just as there are five primary tastes (or six, if the fat
   receptor is confirmed). In 1852, Hermann von Helmholtz (whose place theory
   was discussed in Chapter 9) revived an idea of Thomas Young from a half-
   century earlier. Because combining different amounts of just three colors of light
   can produce any color, Young and Helmholtz recognized that this must be due to
   the nature of the visual mechanism rather than the nature of light. They proposed
   a trichromatic theory—now known as the Young-Helmholtz theory—that
   just three color processes account for all the colors we are able to
   distinguish. They chose red, green, and blue as the primary colors because
   observers cannot resolve these colors into separate components as, for example,
   you can see red and blue in the color purple. When you watch television or look
   at an electronic device screen, you see an application of trichromatic color
   mixing: All the colors you see on the screen are made up different intensities of
   tiny red, green, and blue dots (pixels) of light. This is illustrated in the color cube
   in Figure 10.8.
   Figure 10.8 Color Cube Demonstrating Trichromatic Theory.
   Opponent Process Theory
   The trichromatic theory accounted for some of the observations about color
   perception very well, but it ran into trouble explaining why yellow also appears
   to observers to be a pure color. Ewald Hering (1878) “solved” this problem by
   adding yellow to the list of physiologically unique colors. But rather than
   assuming four color receptors, he asserted that there are only two—one for red
   and green and one for blue and yellow. Opponent process theory attempts to
   explain color vision in terms of opposing neural processes. In Hering’s
   version, the photochemical in the red-green receptor is broken down by red light
   and regenerates in the presence of green light. The chemical in the second type
   of receptor is broken down in the presence of yellow light and regenerates in the
   presence of blue light.
   How do we distinguish colors?
   Hering proposed this arrangement to explain the phenomenon of complementary
   colors, colors that cancel each other out to produce a neutral gray or white.
   (Note the spelling of this term; complementary means “completing.”) In Figure
   10.9, the visible spectrum is represented as a circle. This rearrangement of the
   spectrum makes sense, because violet at one end of the spectrum blends
   naturally into red at the other end just as easily as the colors adjacent to each
   other on the spectrum blend into each other. Another reason the color circle
   makes sense is that any two colors opposite each other on the circle are
   complementary; mixing equal amounts of light from across the circle results in
   the sensation of a neutral gray tending toward white, depending on the
   brightness. An exception to this rule is the combination of red and green; they
   produce yellow, for reasons you will understand shortly.
   Another indication of complementarity is that overstimulation of the eye with
   one light makes the eye more sensitive to its complement. Stare at a red
   stimulus for a minute, and you will begin to see a green edge around it; then
   look at a white wall or a sheet of paper, and you will see a green version of
   the original object. This experience is called a negative color aftereffect; the
   butcher decorates the inside of the meat case with parsley or other greenery to
   make the beef look redder. Negative color aftereffect is what one would expect if
   the wavelengths were affecting the same receptor in opposed directions, as
   Hering theorized. The flag in Figure 10.10 is a very good interactive
   demonstration of complementary colors and negative aftereffects.
   Figure 10.9 The Color Circle.
   If this discussion of color mixing seems inconsistent with what you understood
   in the past, it is probably because you learned the principles of color mixing in
   an art class. The topic of discussion there was pigment mixing, whereas we are
   talking about mixing light. An object appears red to us because it reflects mostly
   long-wavelength (red) light, while it absorbs other wavelengths of light. The
   effect of light mixing is additive, whereas pigment mixing is subtractive. If we
   mix lights, we add wavelengths to the stimulus, but as we mix paints more
   wavelengths are absorbed. For example, if you mix equal amounts of all
   wavelengths of light, the result will be white light; mixing paints in the same
   way produces black because each added pigment absorbs additional wavelengths
   of light until the result is total absorption and blackness (Figure 10.11).
   Now, back to color vision theory. Although Hering’s theory did a nice job of
   explaining complementary colors and the uniqueness of yellow, it received little
   acceptance. One reason was that researchers had trouble with Hering’s
   assumption of a chemical that would break down in response to one light and
   regenerate in the presence of another. His theory was, in fact, in error on that
   point, but developments 100 years later would bring Hering’s thinking back to
   the forefront.
   Figure 10.10 Complementary Colors and Negative Color Aftereffect.
   A Combined Theory
   The trichromatic and opponent process theories appear to be contradictory.
   Sometimes this means that one position is wrong and the other is right, but often
   it means that each of the competing theories is partly correct but just too simple
   to accommodate all the known facts. Hurvich and Jameson (1957) resolved the
   conflict with a compromise: They proposed that three types of color receptors—
   red sensitive, green sensitive, and blue sensitive—are interconnected in an
   opponent process fashion at the ganglion cells.
   Figure 10.12 is a simplified version of how Hurvich and Jameson thought this
   combined color-processing strategy might work. Long-wavelength light excites
   “red” cones and the red-green ganglion cell to give the perception of red.
   Medium-wavelength light excites the “green” cones and inhibits the red-green
   cell, reducing its firing rate below its spontaneous level and signaling green to
   the brain. Likewise, short-wavelength light excites “blue” cones, which inhibits
   the yellow-blue ganglion cell, leading to a perception of blue. Light midway
   between the sensitivities of the “red” and “green” cones would stimulate both
   cone types. The firing rate in the red-green ganglion cell would not change,
   because equal stimulation and excitation from the two cones would cancel out;
   however, the cones’ connections to the yellow-blue ganglion cell are both
   excitatory, so their combined excitation would excite the ganglion cell to
   produce a perception of yellow. If all three cones are stimulated at equal
   intensities, both ganglion cell types receive equal amounts of excitatory and
   inhibitory stimulation and, therefore, produce a perception of a shade of gray
   equal to the intensity of the light. According to this combined theory, there are
   three color processes at the receptors and four beyond the ganglion cells.
   Figure 10.11 Mixing Lights Is Additive; Mixing Paints Is Subtractive.
   This scheme does explain very nicely why yellow would appear pure just like
   red, green, and blue do. Also, it is easy to understand why certain pairs of colors
   are complementary instead of producing a blended color. For example, you
   could have a color that is reddish blue (purple) or greenish yellow (chartreuse)
   but not a reddish green or a bluish yellow. You can try this out in any drawing
   program: make a gradient that is red on one side and green on the other, and
   you’ll see that where they meet is gray. Negative aftereffects can be explained as
   overstimulation “fatiguing” a ganglion cell’s response in one direction, causing a
   rebound in the opposite direction and a subtle experience of the opposing color.
   By the way, this is our first example of the significance of all that
   interconnectedness we saw back in Figure 10.4.
   Figure 10.12 Hurvich and Jameson’s Proposed Interconnections of Cones
   Provide Four Color Responses and Complementary Colors.
   Source: Based on the findings of De Valois et al. (1966).
   Evidence for this combined trichromatic/opponent process theory would be
   almost a decade away, however, because it depended on the development of
   more precise measurement capabilities. Support came in two forms. First,
   researchers produced direct evidence for three color receptors in the retina (K.
   Brown & Wald, 1964; Dartnall, Bowmaker, & Mollon, 1983; Marks, Dobelle, &
   MacNichol, 1964). The researchers shone light of selected wavelengths through
   individual receptors in eyes that had been removed from humans for medical
   reasons or shortly after their death; they measured the light that passed through
   to determine which wavelengths had been lost through absorption. The absorbed
   wavelengths indicated the ones the receptor’s photochemical was sensitive to.
   Figure 10.13 shows the results from a study of this type. Note that there are three
   distinct color response curves (plus a response curve for rods), just as Hurvich
   and Jameson predicted. We should point out that the “red” cone’s sensitivity is
   actually closer to orange, but tradition is tradition, so we continue to refer to its
   preferred color as red.
   Let’s look at three additional features of these results. Like the tuning curves for
   frequency we saw in Chapter 9, these curves are not very sharp; each receptor
   has a sensitivity peak, but its response range is broad and overlaps with that of
   its neighbors. This means that the medium-wavelength cones could be active
   because the stimulus is “green” light or because they are being stimulated with
   intense “blue” light. The system must compare activity in all three types of cones
   to determine which wavelengths you are seeing. This “comparison” does not
   occur at the level of awareness; it is an automatic neural process, like the one
   that sharpens frequency discrimination and the activity of coincidence detectors
   in sound localization.
   The second feature is related to the evolution of color vision. Notice that in
   Figure 10.13 the medium- and long-wavelength curves (green and red,
   respectively) are distant from the short-wavelength curve (blue) but are very
   close to each other. Genetic research indicates that the genes for the
   photopigments in the medium- and long-wavelength cones evolved from a
   common precursor gene relatively recently (only about 35 million years ago), but
   the genes for the short-wavelength cones and for the rod receptors split off from
   their precursor much earlier. Indeed, the “red” and “green” genes are adjacent to
   each other on the X chromosome, and they are 98% identical in DNA
   (Gegenfurtner & Kiper, 2003). Because the genes are on the X chromosome,
   red-green color blindness is a sex-linked trait and tends to affect males many
   times more than females. (See the discussion of X-linked traits in Chapter 1.)
   Figure 10.13 Relative Absorption of Light of Various Wavelengths by Visual
   Receptors.

   Retina,” by Bowmaker and Dartnall, 1980, Journal of Physiology, 298, pp.

   Third, a recent finding suggests that the bulk of red- and green-sensitive cones
   respond equally to all wavelengths of light, and only a subset respond to these
   particular colors (Figure 10.14; Sabesan, Schmidt, Tuten, & Roorda, 2016).
   Presumably, this ensures that we see the fine details of objects clearly regardless
   of color, and the need for sharpness overrules the need for precise color
   perception. This tendency to detect all wavelengths in the majority of cones may
   be useful for some proposed retinal damage therapies (see the earlier Application
   on restoring vision), in that improving any cone function (regardless of color
   sensitivity) will increase light perception in those with vision loss.
   Trichromatic vision is certainly beneficial in appreciating art, but we might well
   ask what evolutionary benefits compelled its development. An obvious
   advantage was an enhanced ability to distinguish ripe red fruit among green
   foliage, and to distinguish young, tender leaves from darker ones. In addition,
   comparisons of primate genomes indicate intriguing parallels between the
   appearance of genes for trichromacy, the decreases in olfactory and pheromone
   receptor genes, and the development of visual sexual signals such as the
   reddened and swollen sexual skin in female baboons and Old World monkeys
   (Gilad, Wiebe, Przeworski, Lancet, & Pääbo, 2004; J. Zhang & Webb, 2003).
   The importance of the red-green end of the spectrum is suggested by the fact that
   only 10% of human cones have their sensitivity in the blue end of the spectrum
   (see Figure 10.14). Analyzing 5,000 photographs from the savannas of
   Botswana, researchers concluded that this balance matches the distribution of
   colors in the environment in which humans are believed to have evolved
   (Garrigan et al., 2010).
   Additional confirmation of the trichromatic/opponent process theory came when
   researchers found color-opponent cells in monkeys, both in the retina and in the
   lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (De Valois, 1960; De Valois, Abramov,
   & Jacobs, 1966; Gouras, 1968). Figure 10.15 shows two types of opponent cells,
   one that is excited by red and inhibited by green (R+G−) and one that is excited
   by yellow and inhibited by blue (Y+B−); Russell De Valois and his colleagues
   (1966) identified two additional types that were the inverse of the previous two:
   green excitatory/red inhibitory (G+R−) and blue excitatory/yellow inhibitory
   (B+Y−).
   A surprise was that some of the color-opponent ganglion cells receive their input
   from cones that are arranged in two concentric circles (Gouras, 1968; Wiesel &
   Hubel, 1966). The cones in the center and those in the periphery have color-
   complementary sensitivities (see Figure 10.15). Of course, the yellow response
   is provided by the combined output of “red” and “green” cones. Why all this
   complexity? First, the opposition of cones at the ganglion cells provides
   wavelength discrimination that individual cones are incapable of producing (E.
   B. Goldstein, 1999)—an example of the “neural comparison” we referred to
   earlier. The concentric-circle receptor fields also enhance information about
   color contrast in objects. This mode of information sharpening will become
   clearer when we look at how the retina distinguishes the edge of an object.
   A theory is considered successful if it is consistent with the known facts, can
   explain those facts, and can predict new findings. The combined trichromatic
   and opponent process color theory meets all three criteria: (1) It is consistent
   with the observation that all colors can be produced by using red, green, and blue
   light. (2) It can explain why observers regard red, green, blue, and yellow as
   pure colors. It also explains complementary colors, negative aftereffects, and the
   impossibility of color experiences such as greenish red. (3) It predicted the
   discovery of three photopigments and of the excitatory/inhibitory neural
   connections at the ganglion cells.

   Color Blindness
   Color blindness (or the more accurate term, color vision deficiency) occurs
   when an individual has a poor or absent response from one or more cone
   types. It is an intriguing curiosity; but more than that, it has played an important
   role in our understanding of color perception by scuttling inadequate theories
   and providing the inspiration for new ones. There are very few completely color-
   blind people—about 1 in every 100,000. They usually have an inherited lack of
   cones; limited to rod vision, they see in shades of gray, they are very light
   sensitive, and they have poor visual acuity. More typically a person is partly
   color-blind, due to a defect in one of the cone systems rather than a lack of
   cones.
   Figure 10.15 Receptive Fields of Color-Opponent Ganglion Cells.
   Source: Based on the findings of De Valois et al. (1966).
   There are two major types of retinal color blindness. A person who is red-green
   color-blind sees these two colors but is unable to distinguish between them (this
   is either protanopia with absence of red receptors, or deuteranopia with absence
   of green receptors). We know something about what color-blind people
   experience by noting which colors color-blind people confuse and from studying
   a few rare individuals who are color-blind in only one eye. When a red-green
   color-blind colleague of one of the authors was describing his experience of
   color, he explained that green grass appeared to be the same color as peanut
   butter! We’re not sure what peanut butter actually looked like to him, but he said
   that he found grass and trees “very beautiful.” People in the much rarer second
   color-blind group do not perceive blue (tritanopia, due to a defect on
   Chromosome 7), so their world appears in variations of red and green. Many
   partly color-blind individuals are unaware that they see the world differently
   from the rest of us. Color vision deficiencies can be detected by having the
   subject match or sort colored objects or with a test like the one illustrated in
   Figure 10.16.
   Figure 10.16 A Test for Color Blindness.
   What is it like to be color-blind?
   Red-green color-blind individuals show a deficiency in either the red end of the
   spectrum or in the green portion; this suggests that the person lacks either the
   appropriate cone or the photochemical. Acuity is normal in both groups, so there
   cannot be a lack of cones. Some are unusually sensitive to green light, and the
   rest are sensitive to red light; this suggests that in one case the normally red-
   sensitive cones are filled with green-sensitive photochemical and in the other the
   normally green-sensitive cones are filled with red-sensitive chemical. The In the
   News feature offers one example of the kind of difficulties this deficiency can
   pose for an individual.
   In The News: Being a Color-Blind Sports Fan
   Having color vision deficiency is not easy, and nowhere is it more problematic than in fast-
   paced team sports like football. It can be hard enough to keep track of the action as 22 men run
   around the field executing complicated plays, but it is much more difficult if you can’t tell the
   two teams apart.
   NFL teams typically use different uniform colors and styles to distinguish between the home and
   visiting teams, but in 2015 a new fad in uniform design called Color Rush made this task much
   more difficult. In Color Rush the jerseys, pants, and socks are all the same vibrant color (or
   color accent). For most of us it was easy to distinguish between the fluorescent orange uniforms
   worn by the Buffalo Bills and the fluorescent green uniforms of the New York Jets in their
   November 2015 game. But for someone with red-green color blindness, the orange Bills
   uniforms looked exactly like the green Jets uniforms. See http://goo.gl/CsFzqk for what this
   looked like to a colorblind individual. Because of this confusion, the NFL instituted a new
   policy requiring that one team wear white uniforms instead of the Color Rush jerseys. This is
   not just a problem with sports but is true in advertisements, TV shows, and other forms of media
   like safety signs. For this reason, most commercial image editing software products have tools
   to simulate color blindness, so that color issues can be detected during the production process.
   Thought Questions
   1. How do cone deficiencies impact the perceptions of humans?
   2. What steps can be taken to ensure that all people, including people who experience color
   blindness, can clearly perceive information in sporting events and advertisements?

   Summarize the three color vision theories described here.
   What is the benefit of the color-opposed concentric circle receptor fields?
   What causes color blindness?
   Form Vision
   Just as the auditory cortex is organized as a map of the cochlea, the visual cortex
   contains a map of the retina. Russell De Valois and his colleagues demonstrated
   this point when they presented the image in Figure 10.17a to monkeys that had
   been injected with radioactive 2-deoxyglucose. The animals were sacrificed and
   their brains placed on photographic film. Because the more active neurons
   absorbed more radioactive glucose, they exposed the film more darkly in the
   autoradiograph in Figure 10.17b; this produced an image of the stimulus that
   appears to be wrapped around the monkey’s occipital lobe (Tootell et al., 1982).
   Figure 10.17 Deoxyglucose Autoradiograph Showing Retinotopic Mapping in
   Visual Cortex.
   Source: From “Deoxyglucose Analysis of Retinotopic Organization in
   Primate Striate Cortex,” by R. B. H. Tootell et al.,” Science, 218, pp. 902–
   904. Reprinted with permission from AAAS.
   This result tells us that, just as there is a tonotopic map of the basilar membrane
   in the auditory cortex, we have a retinotopic map in the visual cortex, meaning
   that adjacent retinal receptors activate adjacent cells in the visual cortex.
   However, this does not tell us how we see images; transmitting an object’s image
   to the cortex like a television picture does not amount to perception of the object.
   Object perception is a two-stage affair. In this section we will discuss form
   vision, the detection of an object’s boundaries and features (such as texture).
   We will discuss the second component, object recognition, a bit later. The story
   that unfolds here is about more than perception; it provides a model for
   understanding how the brain processes information in general. It is also a story
   that begins not in the cortex but in the retina itself.
   Contrast Enhancement and Edge Detection
   Detecting an object’s boundaries is the first step in form vision. The nervous
   system often exaggerates especially important sensory information. In the case
   of boundaries, the retina uses lateral inhibition, where each neuron’s activity
   inhibits the activity of its neighbors and in turn they inhibit its activity, to
   enhance the contrast in brightness that defines an object’s edge. To demonstrate
   this enhancement for yourself, look at the Hermann grid illusion in Figure
   10.18a and the Mach band illusion in Figure 10.18b. The Hermann grid is the
   more dramatic of the two illusions, but the simplicity of the Mach band graphic
   makes it easier to explain, so we will focus on it. Each bar in the Mach band
   image is consistent in brightness across its width, but it looks a bit darker on the
   left and a bit lighter on the right than it does in the middle. (If you don’t see a
   difference at the edges, you may notice that the bars seem slightly curved. This
   is because the illusion suggests subtle shadowing on the left side of each bar.)
   An illusion is not simply an error of perception, but an exaggeration of a normal
   perceptual process, which makes illusions very useful in studying perception.
   See the Application for more on visual illusions.
   Deceptions of the senses are the truths of perception.
   —Johannes Purkinje
   Application: Neural Bases of Visual Illusions
   As you have been learning in this chapter, visual signals are processed at multiple levels; the
   Mach band illusion, for example, occurs at the retinal level, whereas other features of the visual
   world are not processed until the cortex. Illusions are more than entertaining novelties; they also
   can tell us how the visual mechanism converts retinal stimulation into a meaningful visual
   experience. This includes how we distinguish the edges or boundaries of objects, separate
   objects from each other, and make sense of the contents of an image. Look at the Kanizsa
   triangle (a) for instance. The white triangle you see is an illusion, created when the cortical area
   V2 “fills in” the triangle’s boundaries that are suggested by the missing portions of the circles
   and the actual triangle (von der Heyde, Peterhans, & Baumgartner, 1984). Further up the visual
   processing pathway, the medial temporal lobe (MT) is responsible for extracting motion
   information. The middle image (b), called the Fraser-Wilcox or peripheral drift illusion, fools
   your brain into thinking the circles are rotating even though you obviously are looking at a
   printed page. This is because the MT interprets the rapid high-contrast alternations between the
   yellow and blue, which are processed by the same ganglion cells, as being in motion. Finally,
   the cortex is responsible for combining features from the two processing streams into a singular
   experience. In the last image in the figure (c), how many legs does the elephant have? Is there
   anything odd about them? It may take a bit of study to see why the elephant is clearly an
   impossible animal—understanding what you’re seeing here requires the contribution of your
   frontal lobes (Shepard, 1990). If you want to see more visual illusions, especially moving ones,
   check out the Illusion of the Year website listed at the end of the chapter.
   Figure 10.19 will help you understand how your retinas produce the illusion
   using lateral inhibition. In this case, the inhibition is delivered by horizontal cells
   to nearby synapses of receptors with bipolar cells. The critical point in the
   illustration is at ganglion cells 7 and 8. Ganglion cell 7 is inhibited less than
   ganglion cells 1 to 6; this is because the receptors to its right are receiving very
   little stimulation and producing low levels of inhibition. This lesser inhibition of
   ganglion cell 7 creates a sensation of a lighter band to the left of the border, as
   indicated at the bottom of the illustration. Similarly, ganglion cell 8 is inhibited
   more than its neighbors to the right, because the receptors to its left are receiving
   greater stimulation and producing more inhibition. As a result, the bar appears
   darker to the right of the border.
   Actually, this description is more appropriate for the eye of the horseshoe crab,
   where lateral inhibition was originally confirmed by electrical recording; in fact,
   the graph in Figure 10.18d was based on data from the horseshoe crab’s eye
   (Ratliff & Hartline, 1959). The principle is the same in the mammalian eye, but
   each ganglion cell’s receptive field is made up of several receptors arranged in
   circles, like the color-coded circular fields we saw earlier (Kuffler, 1953). Light
   in the center of the field has the opposite effect on the ganglion cell from light in
   the surround. In on-center cells, light in the center increases firing, and light in
   the off surround reduces firing below the resting levels. Other ganglion cells
   have an off center and an on surround. Figure 10.20 illustrates these two types of
   ganglion cells.
   These ganglion cells are good at detecting spots of light or darkness, but their
   contribution to vision is as light–dark contrast detectors (Hubel, 1982). Look at
   the illustrations in Figure 10.21. Light falling across the entire field will have
   little or no effect on the ganglion cell’s firing rate, because the excitation and
   inhibition cancel each other out (Figure 10.21a). Light that falls only on the off
   surround will suppress firing in the ganglion cell (Figure 10.21b). But the
   ganglion cell’s firing will be at its maximum when the stimulus falls on all of the
   on center and only a part of the off surround, as in Figure 10.21c. Figure 10.21d
   represents what happens in an off-center ganglion cell when its receptors are
   stimulated by an object that is darker than the background (or by a shadow).
   Because the dark image falls across the entire off center but only part of the on
   surround, the cell’s activity is high. We are so accustomed to thinking of vision
   in terms of light stimulation that we neglect the importance of dark stimulation.
   The fact is that off ganglion cells outnumber on cells two to one in the human
   retina, and for good reason. When researchers analyzed photos taken in several
   settings ranging from the streets of Philadelphia to the plains of Africa, they
   found that dark-on-light contrasts were 10%–20% more numerous than light
   contrasts (Ratliff, Borghuis, Kao, Sterling, & Balasubramanian, 2010). When
   they created a mathematical model of the ideal system for processing these
   scenes, it predicted the smaller and more numerous off cells found in the retina.
   We will see the significance of this light–dark contrast mechanism in the next
   section.

   Hubel and Wiesel’s Theory
   Cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus have circular receptive fields just like the
   ganglion cells from which they receive their input. The receptive fields of visual
   neurons in the cortex, however, turn out to be surprisingly different. David
   Hubel and Torsten Wiesel (1959) were probing the visual cortex of anesthetized
   cats as they projected visual stimuli on a screen in front of a cat. Their electrode
   was connected to an auditory amplifier so they could listen for indications of
   active cells. One day, they were manipulating a glass slide with a black dot on it
   in the projector and getting only vague and inconsistent responses
   How do we detect objects’ boundaries?
   when suddenly over the audio monitor the cell went off like a machine gun.
   After some fussing and fiddling we found out what was happening. The
   response had nothing to do with the black dot. As the glass slide was
   inserted its edge was casting onto the retina a faint but sharp shadow, a
   straight dark line on a light background. (Hubel, 1982, p. 517)
   Hubel and Wiesel then began exploring the receptive fields of these cortical cells
   by projecting bars of light on the screen. They found that an actively responding
   cell would decrease its responding when the stimulus was moved to another
   location or rotated to a slightly different angle. Figure 10.22 shows the changes
   in response in one cell as the orientation of the stimulus was varied. Hubel and
   Wiesel called these cortical cells simple cells. Simple cells respond to a line or
   an edge that is at a specific orientation and at a specific place on the retina.
   Figure 10.19 The Neural Basis of the Mach Band Illusion.
   Figure 10.20 Effect of Light on Center and Surround of Receptive Field.
   Figure 10.21 Effects of a Border on an On-Center and an Off-Center Ganglion
   Cell.
   How can we explain the surprising shift in specialization in these cortical cells?
   Imagine several contrast-detecting circular fields arranged in a straight line, like
   those in Figure 10.23. (Notice that the fields overlap each other; by now you
   shouldn’t be surprised that receptors would share their output with multiple
   ganglion cells.) Then, connect the outputs of their ganglion cells to a single cell
   in the cortex—one of Hubel and Wiesel’s simple cells. You now have a
   mechanism for detecting not just spots of light–dark contrast but a contrasting
   edge, such as in the border of an object that is lighter or darker than its
   background. Fields with on centers would detect a light edge, like the one in the
   figure, and a series of circular fields with off centers would detect a dark edge.
   In other layers of the cortex, Hubel and Wiesel found complex cells, which
   continue to respond when a line or an edge moves to a different location, as
   long as it is not too far from the original site. They explained the complex
   cell’s ability to continue responding in essentially the same way they explained
   the sensitivity of simple cells. They assumed that complex cells receive input
   from several simple cells that have the same orientation sensitivity but whose
   fields are adjacent to each other on the retina. This arrangement is illustrated in
   Figure 10.24. Notice that as the edge moves horizontally, different simple cells
   will take over, but the same complex cell will continue responding. However, if
   the edge rotates to a different orientation, this complex cell will stop responding,
   and another complex cell specific for that orientation will take over. Connecting
   several simple cells to a single complex cell enables the complex cell not only to
   keep track of an edge as it moves but also to detect movement.

   Figure 10.23 Hubel and Wiesel’s Explanation for Responses of Simple Cells.
   The feasibility of this kind of arrangement has received support from an
   interesting source—artificial neural networks. Lau, Stanley, and Dan (2002)
   trained a network so that its output “neurons” gave the same responses to bar-
   shaped stimuli as those recorded from complex cells in cats. Then they examined
   the hidden processing layer and found that those “neurons” had rearranged their
   connections to approximate simple cells, complete with “on” and “off” regions
   in their receptive fields as well as directional sensitivity. In an earlier study, a
   neural network was trained to recognize curved visual objects (Lehky &
   Sejnowski, 1990). Its “neurons” spontaneously developed sensitivity to bars or
   edges of light even though they had never been exposed to such stimuli,
   suggesting that the Hubel-Wiesel model is a very versatile one.
   But so far, Hubel and Wiesel had seen only the beginnings of the intricate neural
   organization that makes visual perception possible. They lowered electrodes
   perpendicularly through a monkey’s striate cortex; as the electrode passed
   through simple and complex cells, the cells’ preferred width and length changed,
   but they had the same orientation (Hubel & Wiesel, 1974). As the researchers
   moved the electrode slightly to the side, the preferred orientation of those cells
   shifted slightly but systematically in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction;
   over a distance of 0.5–1.0 mm, the orientation would progress through the
   complete circle. A complete 360-degree “set” of preferred orientations tends to
   be organized around a common point, forming what are called orientation
   pinwheels or whorls (Figure 10.25a and b; Yacoub, Harel, & Ugurbil, 2008).
   This arrangement is repeated in the adjacent cortex, with the input coming from
   an adjacent part of the retina. This sort of organization is typical of the cortex’s
   efficiency in processing and transmitting information. Connections mostly run
   up and down in columns, with much shorter lateral connections. In addition,
   similar functions are clustered together, increasing communication speed and
   reducing energy requirements.
   Figure 10.24 Hubel and Wiesel’s Explanation for Responses of Complex Cells.
   Figures Brought to Life
   Hubel and Wiesel shared the Nobel Prize for their work in 1981. However, their
   model has limitations—some would say problems. For one thing, it accounts for
   the detection of boundaries, but it is questionable whether edge detection cells
   can also handle the surface details that give depth and character to an image.
   Spatial Frequency Theory
   Although some cortical cells respond best to edges (Albrecht, De Valois, &
   Thorell, 1980; De Valois, Thorell, & Albrecht, 1985; von der Heydt, Peterhans,
   & Dürsteler, 1992), other cells apparently are not so limited. Think of an edge as
   an abrupt or high-frequency change in brightness. The more gradual changes in
   brightness across the surface of an object are low-frequency changes. According
   to De Valois, some complex cells are “tuned” to respond to the high frequencies
   found in an object’s border, while others are tuned to low frequencies, for
   example, in the slow transition from light to shadow that gives depth to the
   features of a face (De Valois et al., 1985). Some cells respond better to
   “gratings” of alternating light and dark bars—which contain a particular
   combination of spatial frequencies—than they do to lines and edges. According
   to spatial frequency theory, visual cortical cells do a Fourier frequency
   analysis of the luminosity variations in a scene (see Chapter 9 to review
   Fourier analysis). According to this view, different visual cortical cells have a
   variety of sensitivities, not just those required to detect edges (Albrecht et al.,
   1980; De Valois et al., 1985).
   A few photographs should help you understand what we mean by spatial
   frequencies, as well as the importance of low frequencies. The picture in Figure
   10.26a was prepared by having a computer average the amount of light over
   large areas in a photograph; the result was a number of high-frequency
   transitions, and the image is not very meaningful. In Figure 10.26b, the computer
   filtered out the high frequencies, producing more gradual changes between light
   and dark (low frequencies). It seems paradoxical that blurring an image would
   make it more recognizable, but blurring eliminates the sharp boundaries. You
   can get the same effect from Figure 10.26a by looking at it from a distance or by
   squinting. In Figure 10.26c, the Spanish artist Salvadore Dali incorporated the
   illusion in one of his more famous paintings. A real-life example in Figure 10.27
   suggests what our visual world might be like if we were limited to high
   frequencies or low frequencies.
   Figure 10.25 Orientations in Primary Visual Cortex.
   Is spatial frequency theory a better explanation?
   So far, we have dealt only with the simplest aspects of visual perception. But we
   also are able to recognize an object as an object, assign it color under varied
   lighting conditions, and detect its movement. Attempting to explain these
   capabilities will provide challenge enough for the rest of this chapter.

   The Perception of Objects, Color, and Movement
   One of the more interesting characteristics of the visual system is how it dissects
   an image into its various components and analyzes them in different parts of the
   brain. The separation begins in the retina and increases as visual information
   flows through all four lobes of the brain, with locations along the way carrying
   out analyses of color, movement, and other features of the visual scene. Thus, we
   will see how visual processing is, as mentioned earlier, both modular and
   hierarchical. Modular processing refers to the segregation of the various
   components of processing into separate locations. Hierarchical processing
   means that lower levels of the nervous system analyze their information and
   pass the results on to the next higher level for further analysis.
   Some neuroscientists reject the modular notion, arguing that any visual function
   is instead distributed, meaning that it occurs across a relatively wide area of
   the brain. One study found evidence that sensitivity to faces, for example, is
   scattered over a large area in the temporal lobe (Haxby et al., 2001). Research
   has not resolved the modular-distributed controversy, leaving researchers to
   quarrel over the interpretation of studies that seem to support one view or the
   other (J. D. Cohen & Tong, 2001). Vision may well involve a mix of modular
   and distributed functioning, rather like the arrangement we saw for language.
   With this thought in mind, we will consider what is known about the pathways
   and functional locations in the visual system.
   The Two Pathways of Visual Analysis
   Most visual information follows two routes from the retina through the brain,
   which make up the parvocellular system and the magnocellular system
   (Livingstone & Hubel, 1988; P. H. Schiller & Logothetis, 1990). Parvocellular
   ganglion cells are smaller than magnocellular cells, account for the large
   majority of ganglion cells, and are most numerous in the fovea. They have
   circular receptive fields that are small and color opponent, which suits them for
   the specialties of the parvocellular system, the discrimination of fine detail
   and color. Magnocellular ganglion cells have large circular receptive fields that
   are brightness opponent and respond rapidly but only briefly to stimulation. As a
   result, the magnocellular system is specialized for brightness contrast and for
   movement.
   What do the parvocellular and magnocellular systems do?
   We see evidence of differences in the two systems in our everyday lives. The
   simplest example is that at dusk our sensitivity to light increases, but we lose our
   ability to see color and detail. You cannot read a newspaper under such
   conditions or color coordinate tomorrow’s outfit, because the high-resolution,
   color-sensitive parvocellular system is nearly nonfunctional. The magnocellular
   system’s sensitivity to movement is most obvious in your peripheral vision. Hold
   your arms outstretched to the side while you look straight ahead, and move your
   hands slowly forward while wriggling your fingers. When you just notice your
   fingers moving, stop. Notice that you can barely see your fingers but you are
   very sensitive to their movement. Figure 10.28 is a striking demonstration of
   another capability of the magnocellular system, depth perception. Notice that
   you see considerable depth in (a); this is because the bicycle differs from the
   background in brightness, so the image stimulates primarily the magnocellular
   system. The bicycle in (b) looks “flat”; the image has color contrast but little
   brightness contrast, so it stimulates the magnocellular system minimally.
   What are the functions of the ventral and dorsal streams?
   Both pathways travel to the lateral geniculate nucleus and then to the primary
   visual cortex, which is also known as V1. Although the two systems are highly
   interconnected, the parvocellular system dominates the ventral stream, which
   flows from the visual cortex into the temporal lobes, and the magnocellular
   system dominates the dorsal stream from the visual cortex to the parietal
   lobes (Figure 10.29). Like the two auditory pathways, the ventral stream is often
   referred to as involved with the “what” of visual processing, and the dorsal
   stream with the “where.” Most of the research on this topic has been done with
   monkeys, but the two pathways have been confirmed with PET scans in humans
   (Ungerleider & Haxby, 1994).
   Beyond V1, the ventral stream passes through V2 and into V4, which is mostly
   concerned with color perception. It then projects to the inferior temporal cortex,
   which is the lower boundary of the temporal lobe; this area shows a remarkable
   specialization for object recognition, which we will examine shortly.
   Magnocellular neurons arrive in V1 in areas that are responsive to orientation,
   movement, and retinal disparity (Poggio & Poggio, 1984). The dorsal stream
   then proceeds through V2 to V5, also known as MT because it is on the middle
   temporal gyrus in the monkey; neurons there have strong directional sensitivity,
   which contributes to the perception of movement. The dorsal stream travels then
   to the posterior parietal cortex, the area just behind the somatosensory cortex; its
   role is primarily to locate objects in space, but the behavioral implications of its
   functions are far more important than that simple statement suggests.

   Systems.

   Figure 10.29 The Ventral “What” and Dorsal “Where” Streams of Visual
   Processing.
   Movement perception is a good example of how modular and distributed
   processing work together. V5/MT and a nearby area that receives input from MT,
   known as MST (for medial superior temporal area), appear to be the most
   important areas for perceiving movement. They receive most of their input from
   the magnocellular pathway, including complex cells that are sensitive to
   movement; they also respond when the motion is only implied in a photograph
   of an athlete in action or a picture of a cup falling off a table (reviewed in
   Culham, He, Dukelow, & Verstraten, 2001). At the same time, there are many
   other areas that are specialized for particular kinds of movement. Viewing
   movement of the human body or its parts activates dorsal stream areas adjacent
   to V5/MT and MST, in the parietal and frontal lobes, and in the ventral stream in
   the temporal lobes (Vaina, Solomon, Chowdhury, Sinha, & Belliveau, 2001;
   Wheaton, Thompson, Syngeniotis, Abbott, & Puce, 2004).
   Images move across your retinas every time you move your eyes, but you don’t
   see the world moving around you. (Imagine trying to read, otherwise.) This is
   because the activity of movement-sensitive cells in MT and MST is suppressed
   during eye movements (Thiele, Henning, Kubischik, & Hoffmann, 2002). These
   cells are sensitive to movement in a particular direction, and some of them
   reverse their preferred direction of movement as the head moves, which allows
   them to continue responding to real movement of objects. The brain’s visual
   movement areas are close to an area that analyzes input from the vestibular
   organs, which monitor body motion (Thier, Haarmeier, Chakraborty, Lindner, &
   Tikhonov, 2001); you are already indirectly familiar with this fact if you get
   motion sickness in a moving car when you read or when you watch roadside
   objects too closely.
   The functions of the ventral and dorsal streams are best illustrated by a
   comparison of patients with damage in the two areas. People with damage in the
   temporal cortex (ventral stream) have trouble visually identifying objects, but
   they can walk toward or around the objects and reach for them accurately
   (Kosslyn, Ganis, & Thompson, 2001). People with damage to the dorsal stream
   have the opposite problem. They can identify objects, but they have trouble
   orienting their gaze to objects, reaching accurately, and shaping their hands to
   grasp an object using visual cues (Ungerleider & Mishkin, 1982). So the dorsal
   stream is also a “how” area that is important for action.
   From the parietal and temporal lobes, the dorsal and ventral streams both
   proceed into the prefrontal cortex. One function of the prefrontal cortex is to
   manage this information in memory while it is being used to carry out the
   functions that depend on the two pathways (Courtney, Ungerleider, Keil, &
   Haxby, 1997; F. A. Wilson, Ó Scalaidhe, & Goldman-Rakic, 1993). As one
   example, we will see in Chapter 11 that the prefrontal cortex integrates
   information about the body and about objects around it during the planning of
   movements.
   Disorders of Visual Perception
   Because the visual system is somewhat modular, damage to a processing area
   can impair one aspect of visual perception while all others remain normal. This
   kind of deficit is often called an agnosia, which means “lack of knowledge.”
   Because the disorders provide a special opportunity for understanding the neural
   basis of higher-order visual perception, we will orient our discussion of the
   perception of objects, color, movement, and spatial location around disorders of
   those abilities.
   Object and Face Agnosia
   Object agnosia is the impaired ability to recognize objects. In Chapter 3, we
   described Oliver Sacks’s (1990) agnosic patient who patted parking meters on
   the head, thinking they were children; he was also surprised when carved knobs
   on furniture failed to return his friendly greeting. Dr. P. was intellectually intact;
   he continued to perform successfully as a professor of music, and he could carry
   on lively conversations on many topics. Patients with object agnosia are able to
   see an object, describe it in detail, and identify it by touch. But they are unable to
   identify an object by sight or even to recognize an object from a picture that they
   have just drawn from memory (Gurd & Marshall, 1992; Zeki, 1992).
   Object agnosia is caused by damage to the inferior temporal cortex (see Figure
   10.29); this part of the ventral stream is where information about edges, spatial
   frequencies, texture, and so on is reassembled to form perceptions of objects.
   Cells have been located there in monkeys and humans that respond selectively to
   geometric figures, houses, animals, hands, faces, or body parts (Figure 10.30a;
   Desimone, Albright, Gross, & Bruce, 1984; Downing, Jiang, Shuman, &
   Kanwisher, 2001; Gross, Rocha-Miranda, & Bender, 1972; Kreiman, Koch, &
   Fried, 2000; Sáry, Vogels, & Orban, 1993). Some of these cells require very
   specific characteristics of a stimulus, such as a face viewed in profile; others
   continue to respond in spite of changes in rotation, size, and color (Figure
   10.30b; Miyashita, 1993; Tanaka, 1996; Vogels, 1999). The latter group of cells
   likely receive their input from cells with narrower sensitivities (Tanaka, 1996),
   like those in V1 that detect edges. The inferior temporal cortex also has a
   columnar organization reminiscent of what we saw in V1; a column of object-
   responsive cells might respond to variations on a star-like shape, for example,
   and a column adjacent to one that responds to a frontal view of a face is
   activated by a face in profile (Tanaka, 2003).

   Cells in Monkeys.

   Inferior Temporal Neurons in the Macaque,” by R. Desimone et al., p.
   2057. in Journal of Neuroscience, 4, 1984.
   Like Dr. P., many object agnosic patients also suffer from prosopagnosia, an
   impaired ability to visually recognize familiar faces. The problem is not
   memory, because they can identify individuals by other characteristics like their
   speech or mannerisms. Nor is their visual acuity impaired; they often have no
   difficulty recognizing facial expressions, gender, and age (Tranel, Damasio, &
   Damasio, 1988). However, they are unable to recognize the faces of friends and
   family members or even their own image in a mirror (Benton, 1980; A. R.
   Damasio, 1985). Prosopagnosia has a variety of causes, including stroke, carbon
   monoxide poisoning, and Alzheimer’s disease. Damage usually impairs the
   ability to recognize both objects and faces, but the occasional case is reported of
   a patient with prosopagnosia alone (Benton, 1980) or of object agnosia with
   spared face identification (Behrmann, Moscovitch, & Winocur, 1994).

   Achromatopsia,” by S. E. Bouvier and S. A. Engel, 2006, Cerebral Cortex,
   16, pp. 183–191, by permission of Oxford University Press.
   While some processing of face information occurs in the inferior temporal
   cortex, recognizing individual faces requires additional structures. In humans, a
   part of the fusiform gyrus on the underside of the temporal lobe is so
   important to face recognition that it is referred to as the fusiform face area
   (FFA). This area starts assisting us in recognizing caregiver faces at about two
   years of age (Bushnell, 2001) but can be developmentally delayed in individuals
   with autism (Scherf, Behrmann, Minshew, & Luna, 2008). Damage that results
   in prosopagnosia is usually in the right hemisphere (Figure 10.31; Bouvier &
   Engel, 2006; Gauthier, Skudlarski, Gore, & Anderson, 2000; Gauthier, Tarr,
   Anderson, Skudlarski, & Gore, 1999), but face processing is a cooperative effort
   involving both sides of the brain. Facelike images produce activity in the left
   fusiform gyrus that strengthens as the resemblance to a face increases; about two
   seconds later, the right fusiform gyrus increases its activity only when the image
   is of a human face (Meng, Cherian, Singal, & Sinha, 2012). Another area that
   has been implicated in face recognition is the medial temporal lobe, which is
   important in memory and seems to be involved in decision making between
   familiar and unfamiliar faces, even when features are shared between those two
   groups of faces (Quian Quiroga, Kraskov, Mormann, Fried, & Koch, 2014).
   Until recently, researchers thought the only way prosopagnosia occurred was
   through brain damage. Then medical student Martina Grueter began to recognize
   the symptoms in her husband’s behavior and made congenital prosopagnosia the
   subject of her MD thesis (Grueter, 2007). An estimated 2.5% of the population
   has symptoms of the disorder without any history of brain damage
   (Kennerknecht et al., 2006); thus, they make errors in recognizing familiar faces,
   and they learn new faces slowly (Grüter, Grüter, & Carbon, 2008). Afflicted
   individuals include noted primatologist Jane Goodall, actor Brad Pitt, and Oliver
   Sacks, the neurologist who studied Dr. P. Face recognition ability has a
   heritability of about 39% (Zhu et al., 2010), so its deficiency in the absence of
   brain damage has a genetic origin. The defect, though, does not appear to be in
   the fusiform face area; fMRI shows that the FFA responds just as much to faces
   in prosopagnosics as it does in normal individuals. Instead, connections of the
   FFA to more anterior temporal and frontal cortex areas are diminished (Avidan &
   Behrmann, 2009), suggesting that face recognition is a distributed function,
   despite modularity of its components.
   These capabilities might be “hardwired” at birth to some extent, but they also are
   amenable to learning. When researchers showed monkeys pictures of the faces
   of lab workers, neurons in the inferior temporal cortex increased their firing rates
   according to the monkeys’ familiarity with the workers (M. P. Young & Yamane,
   1992). Isabel Gauthier and her colleagues (1999) trained humans to identify
   faces, using pictures of fictitious creatures they called “greebles” to ensure initial
   unfamiliarity. The fMRI scans in Figure 10.32 show that pictures of human faces
   activated the FFA but greebles did so only after the person had learned to
   recognize individual creatures.

   Prosopagnosics do respond emotionally to photographs of familiar faces they do
   not recognize, as indicated by EEG evoked potentials and skin conductance
   response (Bauer, 1984; Renault, Signoret, Debruille, Breton, & Bolger, 1989;
   Tranel & Damasio, 1985). This “hidden perception” is not without precedent.
   Patients blinded by damage to V1 show a surprising ability to track the
   movement of objects and discriminate colors, all the while claiming to be
   guessing (Zeki, 1992). Cortically blind individuals also can identify emotions
   expressed in faces they do not otherwise see (Tamietto et al., 2009), and they can
   avoid obstacles while walking. This ability to respond to visual stimuli that
   are not consciously seen is called blindsight. Imaging studies have found that
   blindsight depends on pathways passing through the superior colliculus directly
   to extrastriate areas, bypassing V1 (reviewed in de Gelder & Tamietto, 2007;
   Tamietto et al., 2010).
   A nearby area in the inferior temporal cortex has an intriguingly similar “object”
   recognition function; the visual word form area (VWFA) responds to written
   words as a whole. Its importance in reading was demonstrated in a patient
   whose VWFA was disconnected from adjacent language areas by surgery
   intended to remove tissue that was causing epileptic seizures (Gaillard et al.,
   2006). Before surgery, the patient could recognize familiar words of any length
   in less than a second; following surgery, the time had almost doubled for three-
   letter words and increased by an additional 100 milliseconds for each additional
   letter, indicating that he was deciphering words letter by letter. Performance in
   identifying faces, tools, and houses was unaffected. The VWFA is typically
   underactivated in adult dyslexics during reading (McCandliss & Noble, 2003),
   but, consistent with what we saw in Chapter 9, the authors suggest that this is not
   the cause of the dyslexia but the result of phonological deficits that interfere with
   learning rapid word recognition. It is clear that the VWFA could not have
   evolved as a dedicated whole-word detector, because written language is a
   relatively recent invention; still, it serves that function so precisely that two
   words evoke activity in different subareas, even when the words differ by just
   one letter (Glezer, Jiang, & Riesenhuber, 2009). What is intriguing about the
   VWFA is that, for whatever reason, the area has evolved special capabilities that
   suit it for learning to identify words as if they are unique visual “objects.”

   Color Agnosia
   Let’s return to Jonathan I., whose plight was described at the beginning of the
   chapter. Jonathan’s problem was color agnosia, which is the loss of the ability
   to perceive colors due to brain damage. But before we can discuss this
   disorder, we need to revisit the distinction between wavelength and color. As one
   of the authors walked past a colleague’s slightly open office door, he was
   astonished to see that his colleague’s face was a distinct green! Opening the door
   to investigate, he understood why: The light from the colleague’s desk lamp was
   reflecting off a bright green brochure he was reading. Immediately his face
   appeared normal again. This ability to recognize the so-called natural color of
   an object despite the illuminating wavelength is called color constancy. An
   example of this can be seen in Figure 10.33. Although both eyes are the same
   color gray, the colored shading pushes the brain’s interpretation of color in the
   opponent direction. If not for color constancy, objects would seem to change
   colors as the sun shifted its position through the day or as we went indoors into
   artificial (or colored) light. Imagine having to survive by identifying ripe fruit if
   the colors kept changing.
   How is color coding different from wavelength coding?
   Figure 10.33 Color Constancy.
   When the author reinterpreted his colleague’s skin color, it was not because he
   understood that his friend’s face was bathed in green light; it occurred
   automatically as soon as his eyes took in the whole scene. Monkeys, who do not
   understand the principles of color vision, apparently have the same experience.
   When Zeki (1983) illuminated red, white, green, and blue patches with red light,
   each patch set off firing in V1 cells that preferred long-wavelength (red) light,
   regardless of its actual color; however, cells in V4 responded only when the
   patch’s actual color matched the cell’s color “preference.” Zeki concluded that
   cells in V1 are wavelength coded, whereas cells in V4 are color coded. Schein
   and Desimone (1990) suggested how V4 cells provide color constancy. They
   have large circular receptive fields that are color opposed; so if, for example, a
   green light falling on the center increases the cell’s firing rate, green light falling
   simultaneously in the surround reduces or eliminates the increase. In other
   words, the cells “subtract out” the color of any general illumination. It is our V4
   cells that allow us to see our friend’s face as normal pink rather than as the color
   that it might reflect.
   We have no brain scan to tell us where Jonathan I.’s damage was located, but we
   know that cortical color blindness, or cerebral achromatopsia, occurs when
   people have lesions between V1 and the fusiform face area (Heywood &
   Kentridge, 2003; Witthoft et al., 2013); this is where V4 is located, but it is
   unclear whether the deficiency can be attributed to V4 malfunction. Unlike
   Jonathan I., many patients are unaware their color vision is impaired, just as we
   saw in Chapter 9 with Wernicke’s aphasia.
   Movement Agnosia
   Although movement is detected by neurons in V1 and beyond, area V5/MT is
   the place where that information is integrated; MT (for middle temporal area)
   also helps direct reaching movements and eye movements when tracking objects
   (Born & Badley, 2005; Whitney et al., 2007). A 43-year-old woman known in
   the literature as LM suffered a stroke that caused bilateral damage in the general
   area of MT; the result was movement agnosia, an impaired ability to detect
   movement (Vaina, 1998; Zihl, von Cramon, & Mai, 1983). Although her vision
   was otherwise normal, she could distinguish between moving and stationary
   objects only in her peripheral view, she had difficulty making visually guided
   eye and finger movements, and she had trouble detecting the movement of
   people if there were more than two people in the room. She was often surprised
   to notice that an object had changed position (Zihl et al., 1983). You might think
   that perceiving a change in position would be the same thing as perceiving
   movement, but she had no sense of the object traveling through the intermediate
   positions. When she poured coffee, she could not tell that the liquid was rising in
   the cup, so she would keep pouring until the cup overflowed! When she tried to
   cross a street, a car would seem far away, but then suddenly very near.
   Later analyses indicated that LM’s most severe impairment was in her ability to
   detect radial movement (Vaina, 1998). We experience radial movement when the
   image of an approaching car expands outwardly, or radially. Radial movement
   also tells us that we are approaching an object when we walk or drive, because
   all the environmental objects around the central point appear to move outward;
   this effect provides information about our heading and is important for personal
   navigation. A patient with impaired perception of radial movement could not
   catch a ball that was thrown to him, and he frequently bumped into people in his
   wheelchair. Scans done while subjects perform a task involving radial movement
   or heading detection implicate the MST area (for medial superior temporal area,
   where it is located), which receives its input from MT (Peuskens, Sunaert,
   Dupont, Van Hecke, & Orban, 2001; Vaina).
   Neglect and the Role of Attention in Vision
   The posterior parietal cortex combines input from the visual, auditory, and
   somatosensory areas to help the individual locate objects in space and to orient
   the body in the environment. Damage impairs abilities such as reaching for
   objects, but it also often produces neglect, in which the patient ignores visual,
   touch, and auditory stimulation on the side opposite the injury. The term neglect
   seems particularly appropriate in patients who ignore food on the left side of the
   plate, shave only the right side of the face, or fail to dress the left side of the
   body. The manifestations are largely, but not entirely, visual, and they are more
   likely to occur on the left side of the body, following right-hemisphere damage.
   (Because the symptoms affect one side of space, the term hemispatial neglect is
   often used.)
   Figure 10.34 Drawings Copied by a Left-Field Neglect Patient.
   Source: Schwartz, B. L. & Krantz, J. H. (2015).
   Neglect is not due to any defect in visual processing, but rather it is due to a
   deficit in attention; it illustrates the fact that to the extent attention is impaired,
   so is visual functioning. Two patients with this condition, caused by right
   parietal tumors, were asked to report whether words and pictures presented
   simultaneously in the left and right visual fields were the same or different. They
   said that the task was “silly” because there was no stimulus in the left field to
   compare, yet they were able to answer with a high level of accuracy (Volpe,
   LeDoux, & Gazzaniga, 1979). Their performance is superior to that of
   blindsighted individuals, which supports the contention that neglect is a deficit in
   attention rather than in vision.
   I knew the word “neglect” was a sort of medical term for whatever was wrong but the word
   bothered me because you only neglect something that is actually there, don’t you? If it’s not
   there, how can you neglect it?
   —P. P., a neglect patient
   Patients’ drawings and paintings help us understand what they are experiencing.
   When asked to copy drawings, they will neglect one side while completing the
   other side in detail, like the example in Figure 10.34. The two portraits in Figure
   10.35 were painted by Anton Raderscheidt two and nine months after a stroke
   that damaged his right parietal area. Notice that the first painting has very little
   detail and the left half of the image is missing. In the later painting, he was using
   the whole canvas, and the portrait looks more normal; but notice that the left side
   is still much less developed than the right, with the eyeglasses and face melting
   into ambiguity (Jung, 1974).

   Research Spotlight: When Binding Goes Too Far
   Before his accident, Jonathan I. saw a “tumult” of changing colors whenever he listened to
   music. For other people with synesthesia, letters may have colors, days of the week may have
   personalities, visual motion might produce sounds, or words might have tastes. Synesthesia is a
   condition in which stimulation in one sense triggers an experience in another sense or a concept
   evokes an unrelated sensory experience. Over 60 varieties of synesthesia have been
   documented, and most synesthetes report more than one form (Brang & Ramachandran, 2011).
   Synesthesia was thought to be rare, based on the number of people who came forward to report
   these experiences, but when Julia Simner and her colleagues (2006) tested 1,700 non-self-
   referred individuals, almost 5% showed characteristics of synesthesia. A third of those were
   projectors, who experience the unrelated color or sound or taste, and the rest were associators,
   who have a persistent mental association between, for example, a word and a color but don’t
   report that they see the color. Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon; fMRI studies show
   that area V4 is active when grapheme/color synesthetes view letters and numbers and when
   auditory word/color synesthetes listen to spoken words (see figure; Hubbard, Arman,
   Ramachandran, & Boynton, 2005; Nunn et al., 2002).
   There are two competing hypotheses as to why synesthetes “overbind” sensory information:
   Either there is excess connectivity among the involved brain areas, or there is inadequate
   inhibition in otherwise normal pathways. Studies favor the connectivity hypothesis; a diffusion
   tensor imaging MRI study (suited for imaging white matter) indicated more pronounced
   connections in grapheme/color synesthetes in the inferior temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex
   —all areas involved in processing and integrating visual information (Rouw & Scholte, 2007).
   Also, genetic studies suggest synesthesia runs in families, and at least four of the five
   chromosomal areas implicated contain genes for axon guidance and cortical development
   (Asher et al., 2009; Thomson et al., 2011).
   Source: From “Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Synesthesia: Activation of V4/V8
   by Spoken Words,” by J. A. Nunn et al., 2002, Nature Neuroscience, 5, pp. 371–375.
   By all rights, synesthesia could be considered a developmental brain disorder, but other than
   being a bit of a distraction it is relatively benign and, like Jonathan I., many synesthetes enjoy
   their enriched sensory experience. Besides, they often have no idea they are different from
   others. Julian Asher, who led the genetic study described above, discovered his synesthesia
   when, as a child attending the symphony with his parents, he remarked, “Oh, they turned the
   lights off so you could see the colors” (“Seeing Color,” 2000).
   The Problem of Final Integration
   We have seen how the brain combines information about some aspects of an
   object, but many researchers wonder where all the information about the object
   is brought together; how the brain combines information from different areas
   into a unitary whole is known as the binding problem. Imagine watching a
   person walking across your field of view; the person is moving, shifting
   orientation, and changing appearance as the lighting increases and decreases
   under a canopy of trees. At the same time, you are walking toward the person,
   but your brain copes easily with the changing size of the person’s image and the
   apparent movement of environmental objects toward you. It seems logical that a
   single center at the end of the visual pathway would combine all the information
   about shape, color, texture, and movement, constantly updating your perception
   of this image as the same person. In other words, the result would be a complete
   and dynamic awareness. Presumably, damage to that area would produce
   symptoms that are similar to blindsight but that affect all stimuli.
   It has been suggested that our ultimate understanding of an object occurs in a
   part of the superior temporal gyrus that receives input from both neural streams
   (Baizer, Ungerleider, & Desimone, 1991) or in the part of the parietal cortex
   where damage causes neglect (Driver & Mattingley, 1998). Other investigators
   suspect frontal areas where both streams converge. But these ideas are highly
   speculative, and there is no convincing evidence for a master area where all
   perceptual information comes together to produce awareness (Crick, 1994; Zeki,
   1992). The variety of hypothesized awareness centers suggests another
   possibility, that visual awareness is distributed throughout the network of 32
   areas of cortex concerned with vision and their 305 interconnecting pathways
   (Van Essen, Anderson, & Felleman, 1992). This thinking is exemplified on a
   small scale in the interaction between V5/MT and V1. After a stimulus occurs,
   activity continues back and forth between these areas for a few hundred
   milliseconds, and disrupting this interchange eliminates awareness of movement
   (reviewed in McKeefry, Gouws, Burton, & Morland, 2009).
   Actually, the brain’s task is a balancing act between combining relevant
   information and segregating inconsequential information, as the accompanying
   Research Spotlight on synesthesia shows. We will spend more time examining
   how the brain sorts out and uses information when we talk about consciousness
   in Chapter 15.

   Take a Minute to Check Your Knowledge and Understanding
   Explain why higher-order processing is required to recognize the natural color of objects; how
   does it work?
   Draw a diagram of the brain, add lines showing the two major visual pathways, and label the
   various areas; for the higher-order processing areas, include their functions.
   In Perspective
   Very few subjects in the field of behavioral neuroscience can match the interest
   that researchers have bestowed on vision. As a result, we know more about the
   neuroanatomy and functioning of vision than any other neural system. Still,
   many challenges remain in the field of vision research.
   Researchers’ fascination with vision goes beyond the problems of vision itself.
   Our understanding of the networks of neurons and structures in the visual system
   provides a basis for developing theories to explain other functions as well,
   including the integration of complex information into a singular awareness.
   Whatever directions future research might take, you can be sure that vision will
   continue to be one of the most important topics.
   Chapter Summary
   Light and the Visual Apparatus
   The human eye is adapted to the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is reflected
   from objects with minimal distortion. Wavelength is related to the color of light but is not
   synonymous with it.
   The retina contains rods, which are specialized for brightness discrimination, and cones,
   which are specialized for detail vision and discrimination of colors. The cells of the retina
   are highly interconnected to carry out some processing at that level.
   The optic nerves project to the two hemispheres so that information from the right visual
   field goes to the left visual cortex, and vice versa.
   Color Vision
   There are three types of cones, each containing a chemical with peak sensitivity to a
   different segment of the electromagnetic spectrum.
   Connections of the cones to ganglion cells provide for complementary colors and for
   perception of yellow as a unique color.
   The most common cause of partial color blindness is the lack of one of the
   photochemicals.
   Form Vision
   Form vision begins with contrast enhancement at edges by ganglion cells with light-
   opponent circular fields.
   These ganglion cells contribute to cortical mechanisms that detect edges (Hubel and
   Wiesel’s theory) or that perform a Fourier analysis of a scene (spatial frequency theory).
   The Perception of Objects, Color, and Movement
   Most visual information follows two somewhat separate paths through the brain, which
   are part of the magnocellular and parvocellular systems.
   Structures along the way are specialized for different functions, including color,
   movement, object perception, and face perception.
   We do not know how or where the components of vision are combined to form the
   perception of a unified object. One suggestion is that this is a distributed function.
   Study Resources
   For Further Thought
   Red and green are complementary colors and blue and yellow are complementary because their
   receptors have opponent connections to their ganglion cells. How would you explain the fact
   that bluish green and reddish yellow (orange) are also complementary?
   Considering what you know about the retina, how would you need to direct your gaze to read a
   book or to find a very faint star?
   Explain why the visual system analyzes an object’s edges, texture, and color and then detects
   the object, instead of the other way around.
   Are Hubel and Wiesel’s theory and the spatial frequency theory opposed or complementary
   theories?
   Cones in the bird retina detect blue, green, red, and ultraviolet. Can you imagine what they
   might gain from detecting ultraviolet reflections from objects in their environment? Then
   check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_vision (see the section “Ultraviolet Sensitivity”); you
   might be surprised by some of the benefits!
   How could you design traffic signs, uniforms, and safety equipment to make them
   recognizable to individuals with color vision deficiencies?

   One morning, Michael woke up with a strange sensation: His pinkie would not
   stop twitching. Stretching, even holding it straight, would stop the wiggle for a
   little while, but it would always start moving again uncontrollably after a minute
   or two. Over time, his twitching pinkie grew to a hand tremor, which eventually
   took over his arm. After seeing numerous physical therapists, doctors, and
   neurologists, he eventually received a diagnosis of this strange involuntary
   twitching: Parkinson’s disease.

   Michael was only 29, and Parkinson’s disease is rare at such a young age. His
   doctors intimated that because of the progressive nature of the tremors, shuffling
   walk, and dyskinesia (uncontrollable movements), he had at most 10 more good
   working years as an actor before the symptoms would prevent him from acting
   again. As we’ll see later, Michael’s Parkinson’s was a result of decreased
   dopamine levels, the neurotransmitter responsible for smooth movements. He
   was told that taking synthetic dopamine (L-dopa) would temporarily reduce, or
   even eliminate, the movement symptoms. Initially, he didn’t tell anyone but his
   wife and threw himself into acting while he still was able to appear healthy to
   viewers. In the next few years, he played both major and minor roles in six films,
   recorded voices for seven animated films, and starred in a major television show
   called Spin City. Eventually, the tremors and movement problems became
   noticeable enough that he admitted he had the disease to the public (M. J. Fox,
   2002).
   The time for quietly soldiering on is through. The war against Parkinson’s is a winnable
   war, and I have resolved to play a role in that victory.
   —Michael J. Fox
   After his diagnosis was made public. Michael could have simply asked for
   privacy and spent his time feeling sorry for himself. He did neither. Instead, he
   created one of the largest foundations dedicated to a cure for a single disorder—
   the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. In 1999, he testified in
   front of Congress advocating for more federal funds dedicated to Parkinson’s
   research (which typically receives a fraction of the funding that cancer and
   Alzheimer’s disease receive), and he has fostered countless scientific advances
   through his foundation. But more than that, he has grown comfortable with his
   disorder, treating his symptoms with L-dopa only when he wants to, and not just
   to look normal to others. As a result, he is not shy about showing the ravages of
   the disease on his own body, going off his L-dopa treatment in front of Congress
   to demonstrate how lack of dopamine changes your posture, movement, and
   speech while leaving your mind completely intact.
   The Body Senses
   We get information about our body from the somatosensory system and from the
   vestibular system. The somatosenses include proprioception; the skin senses,
   which tell us about conditions at the surface of our body; and the interoceptive
   system, concerned with sensations in our internal organs. The vestibular system
   informs the brain about body position and movement. The interoceptive system
   operates mostly in the background and participates less directly in behavior, so
   we will limit our attention to the other systems.
   Proprioception
   Proprioception (from the Latin proprius, “belonging to one’s self”) is the
   sense that informs us about the position and movement of our limbs and
   body. Its sensors report tension and length in muscles and the angle of the limbs
   at the joints. Proprioception is not as glamorous a sense as vision or audition, or
   even touch. However, without it we would have a great deal of difficulty, like
   Michael J. Fox, in maintaining posture, moving our limbs, and grasping objects.
   Oliver Sacks tells the story of Christina, who lost all sense of proprioception
   following a bout with neuritis, an inflammation of the nerves that is often caused
   by a viral infection. Deprived of proprioceptive feedback, for the first month she
   was floppy as a rag doll, unable even to sit upright. After a year of rehabilitation
   she was able to resume a reasonably normal life, relying solely on vision to sit
   and stand erect and to walk. Ian Waterman, who is similarly afflicted, crumples
   helplessly onto the floor if someone turns the lights out (J. Cole, 1995). In other
   words, proprioception does more than provide information; it is critically
   important in the control of movement.
   What is proprioception, and why is it important?
   The Skin Senses
   The commonly accepted skin senses are touch, warmth, cold, texture, and
   pain. However, three studies involving mice have found evidence that itch, until
   now believed to be a variant of pain, has its own receptors, neural pathway
   (spinothalamic tract), and receptor proteins (Han et al., 2012; Mishra & Hoon,
   2013; Pandey et al., 2017); itch (which also goes by the interesting name of
   pruriception) will most likely be added to the list of skin senses. Whatever the
   actual number of skin senses, the important point here is that each is distinct
   from the others, with its own receptors and separate “labeled line” pathway to
   the brain. To demonstrate this for yourself, move the point of a lead pencil
   slowly across your face. You will feel the touch of the pencil continuously, but
   the lead will feel cold only occasionally—because touch and cold are monitored
   by different receptors. Although their range is limited to the surface of our body,
   changes there are often due to external stimulation, so the skin senses inform us
   about both our body and the world. (We experience these sensations deeper in
   the body as well, but less often and with less sensitivity.) The skin sense
   receptors are illustrated in the diagram of a section of skin in Figure 11.1.
   Why are there so many kinds of skin receptors?
   Figure 11.1 Receptors of the Skin.
   There are two general types of receptors. Free nerve endings are simply
   processes at the ends of neuronal dendrites; they detect warmth, cold, and pain.
   All the other receptors are encapsulated receptors, which are more complex
   structures enclosed in a membrane; their role is to detect touch. Why are there so
   many receptors just for touch? Because touch is a complex sense that conveys
   several types of information. In the superficial layers of the skin, Meissner’s
   corpuscles respond with a brief burst of impulses, while Merkel’s disks give a
   more sustained response. Located near the surface of the skin as they are, they
   detect the texture and fine detail of objects. They also detect movement and
   come into play when you explore an object with gentle strokes of your hand or
   when a blind person reads Braille. Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings are in
   the deeper layers, where they detect stretching of the skin and contribute to our
   perception of the shape of grasped objects (Gardner, Martin, & Jessell, 2000).
   Because the density of the skin receptors varies throughout the body, so does
   sensitivity—as much as 10-fold in fact. The fingertips and the lips are the most
   sensitive, and the upper arms and calves of the legs are the least sensitive (S.
   Weinstein, 1968).
   The other three skin senses are detected by free nerve endings, but this statement
   is a bit misleading; those nerve endings have distinctly different receptors that
   make the neurons stimulus specific (Basbaum, Bautista, Scherrer, & Julius,
   2009). We can respond to a wide range of temperatures; at least two different
   receptors detect different levels of warmth, and another receptor responds to
   cooling of the skin. These receptors are all members of the transient receptor
   potential (TRP) family of protein ion channels. Detection of pain also requires
   several receptors, mostly because of the variety of pain sources; these sources
   are categorized as thermal, chemical, and mechanical. Two TRP receptors
   respond to painful heat; a receptor for painful cold has not been conclusively
   identified, but the coolness receptor does not account for this sensation.
   Chemical receptors react to a wide range of chemical irritants. Best known is the
   TRPV1 heat pain receptor, which also responds to capsaicin, the ingredient in
   chili peppers that makes spicy foods painfully hot. Ointments containing
   capsaicin alleviate the joint pain of arthritis, apparently because continued
   stimulation of the receptors depletes the neuropeptide that the neurons use to
   signal pain. This receptor also responds to the pain-inducing acid released in
   bone cancer, and a TRPV1 antagonist relieves this pain (Ghilardi et al., 2005).
   The TRPM8 coolness receptor produces the cool sensation of mint in toothpaste
   and candies, as well as the cooling effect of menthol and camphor on the skin;
   menthol and camphor creams are useful for treating muscle pain, skin irritations,
   and canker sores in the mouth. TRPA1 receptors are responsible for the painful
   irritation caused by vehicle exhaust, tobacco smoke, hydrogen peroxide, and tear
   gas, and they account for the pungency of mustard, garlic, and wasabi, as well as
   the tingle you get from a carbonated drink. As we will see shortly, the body
   produces its own irritants when tissues are damaged; these continue to produce
   pain well after the stimulus is past. The receptors for mechanical pain have not
   been determined, which is unfortunate because persistent hypersensitivity to
   touch is a major problem following tissue or nerve injury.
   The Vestibular Sense
   In Chapter 8, you saw that the cochlea in the ear is connected to a strange-
   looking appendage above it, the vestibular organ. The vestibular sense helps us
   maintain balance, and it provides information about head position and
   movement. The organs are the semicircular canals, the utricle, and the saccule
   (see Figure 11.2a). The physical arrangement of the semicircular canals, three
   loops arranged in different planes of orientation, makes them especially
   responsive to movement of the head in three directions. At the base of each canal
   is a gelatinous (jellylike) mass called a cupula, which has a tuft of hair cells
   protruding into it (Figure 11.2b). During acceleration (an increase in the rate of
   movement), the head (and the cupula) moves but the fluid does not, which
   causes the cupula to bend in the opposite direction of head movement
   proportionally to the rate of acceleration. This displacement bends the hairs
   attaching the cupula to the semicircular canal, which depolarizes them and
   increases the neuronal rate of firing. Moving the head in the opposite direction
   bends the hairs in the other direction, which hyperpolarizes the neuron and
   decreases the firing rate.
   What is the function of the vestibular sense?
   The system responds only to acceleration and stops responding when speed
   stabilizes. Just as the coffee sloshes out of your cup when you start up from a
   traffic light and then levels off in the cup when you reach a stable speed, the
   fluid in the canals also returns to its normal position. Otherwise, you would
   continue to sense the movement throughout an automobile trip or, worse yet,
   during a 500-mile per hour (805-km/hr) flight in an aircraft!
   The utricle and saccule monitor head position in relation to gravity (detect where
   “up” is). In Figure 11.2c, you can see that the receptors (the hair cells) are
   covered with a gelatinous mass embedded with small calcium crystals called
   otoliths. When the head tilts, gravity shifts the mass and the hair cells are
   depolarized or hyperpolarized, depending on the direction of tilt. The hair cell
   receptors in the utricle are arranged in a horizontal patch, whereas the saccule’s
   receptors are on its vertical wall; together, the two organs can detect tilt in any
   direction.
   Consider what would happen without a functioning vestibular system. Mr.
   MacGregor, one of Oliver Sacks’s patients, lost his vestibular sense to the neural
   degeneration of Parkinson’s disease (Sacks, 1990). When he walked, his body
   canted to the left, tilted a full 20 degrees. Strangely, Mr. MacGregor wasn’t
   aware of his tilt, even when his friends told him he was in danger of falling over.
   Once Sacks showed him a videotape, though, he was convinced. A retired
   carpenter, he put his expertise to work; three inches in front of his glasses he
   attached a miniature spirit level—a fluid-filled glass tube with a bubble in it that
   carpenters use to make sure their work is level with the world. By glancing at
   this makeshift device occasionally, he could walk without any slant, and after a
   few weeks, checking his tilt became so natural that he was no longer aware he
   was doing it.
   But the vestibular sense is not just for adjusting the body’s position. When we
   reach for an object, we must know not just where the object is in three-
   dimensional space but also the position of our body and the relation of our hand
   and arm to our body. The brain combines information about the object’s spatial
   location with inputs from the vestibular sense and from proprioception to tell us
   what arm and hand movements are required. Proprioception also triggers
   reflexive eye movements that keep focusing our gaze to a target object as we
   turn our head or as our body bobs up and down when we walk; otherwise, the
   world would become a meaningless blur and tracking moving objects would be
   very difficult. Movement encoded by the vestibular nerve is processed by the
   vestibular nuclei in the midbrain, which then send information to the ocular
   nerves to produce compensatory eye movements. When people have balance
   problems, one of the first clinical signs is a failure of the person to fixate on an
   object when moving.
   The semicircular canals and the utricle and saccule also send projections to the
   cerebellum and the brain stem, and there is also a pathway to the cortex,
   specifically, to an area called the parieto-insular-vestibular (PIV) cortex. This is
   the likely location where excessive eye movements, from reading in a moving
   car for example, cause dizziness and nausea. The same thing happens with
   excessive body motion, for example, during a rough boat ride or from spinning
   around quickly. Doing the latter eventually causes the vestibular fluid to move
   with the head (like stirring a glass of water with a straw; at first the water resists
   movement, but eventually the water moves with the straw). When that happens
   and you stop, the fluid keeps moving, which makes the cupula continue to bend
   and makes you feel like you’re spinning in the opposite direction. Figure skaters
   and gymnasts train themselves to focus on a single point when spinning and then
   turn their heads quickly to maintain that focus, which keeps the fluid from
   spinning. If you easily get motion or seasickness, chances are that you have a
   more sensitive PIV cortex. Taking an antihistamine drug (like Dramamine) can
   decrease PIV activation and, therefore, reduce nausea.

   Stories of Brain & Behavior
   How are the body senses like other senses?
   The Somatosensory Cortex and the Posterior Parietal
   Cortex
   The body is divided into segments called dermatomes, each served by a
   spinal nerve, as Figure 11.3 shows. The divisions are not as distinct as
   illustrated, because each dermatome overlaps the next by one third to one half.
   This way, if one nerve is injured, the area will not lose all sensation. Body sense
   information enters the spinal cord (via spinal nerves) or the brain (via cranial
   nerves) and travels to the thalamus. From there, the body sense neurons go to
   their projection area, the somatosensory cortex, located in the parietal lobes
   just behind the primary motor cortex and the central sulcus (Figure 11.4a).
   As with the auditory system, most of the neurons cross from one side of the body
   to the other side of the brain, so the touch of an object held in the right hand is
   registered mostly in the left hemisphere. Because not all neurons cross over,
   touching the object also stimulates the right somatosensory cortex, though much
   less.
   Sensory systems have many organizational and functional similarities; a
   comparison of the somatosensory cortex with the visual cortex will illustrate this
   point. First, it contains a somatotopic map of the body, with adjacent body
   parts represented in adjacent parts of the cortex, just as the visual cortex
   contains a map of the retina and the auditory cortex contains a map of the
   cochlea (Figure 11.4b). Second, some of the cortical cells have complex
   receptive fields on the skin. Some of them have excitatory centers and inhibitory
   surrounds like those we saw in the visual system (Mountcastle & Powell, 1959).
   Some of them are quite large, as in Figure 11.5a, while smaller excitatory-
   inhibitory fields sharpen the localization of excitation and help distinguish two
   points touching the skin. In Figure 11.5b and c, we see that other somatosensory
   neurons with complex fields are feature detectors; they have sensitivities for
   orientation, direction of movement, shape, surface curvature, or texture (Carlson,
   1981; Gardner & Kandel, 2000; Warren, Hämäläinen, & Gardner, 1986).
   Apparently, these neurons combine inputs from neurons with simpler functions,
   just as complex visual cells integrate the inputs of multiple simple cells
   (Iwamura, Iriki, & Tanaka, 1994). One type of receptive field includes multiple
   fingers; the cells’ firing rate depends on how many fingers are touched, so they
   give an indication of the size of a held object.
   Figure 11.3 Dermatomes of the Human Body.
   A third similarity is that somatosensory processing is hierarchical. The primary
   somatosensory cortex consists of four areas, each of which contains a
   somatotopic map of the body and plays a role in processing sensory
   information from the body. The thalamus sends its output to two of these
   subareas, which extract some information and pass the result on to the other two
   areas, which in turn send their output to the secondary somatosensory cortex. At
   this point in processing, information from the right and left sides of the body is
   mostly segregated.
   What processing occurs at each level of the somatosensory system?
   The secondary somatosensory cortex receives input from the left and the
   right primary somatosensory cortices, so it combines information from both
   sides of the body. Neurons in this area are particularly responsive to stimuli that
   have acquired meaning, for instance, by association with reward (Hsiao,
   O’Shaughnessy, & Johnson, 1993). The secondary somatosensory cortex sends
   connections to the part of the temporal lobe that includes the hippocampus. The
   hippocampus is important in learning, so these connections likely contribute to
   memory formation when somatosensory information is involved (Gardner &
   Kandel, 2000).
   The primary somatosensory cortex projects to the posterior parietal cortex as
   well as to the secondary somatosensory cortex. As you saw in Chapter 10, the
   posterior parietal cortex is an association area that brings together the body
   senses, vision, and audition (K. H. Britten, 2008). See Figure 11.4 again for the
   location of the posterior parietal cortex in relation to the somatosensory cortex.
   Here, the brain determines the body’s orientation in space; the location of the
   limbs; and the location in space of objects detected by touch, sight, and sound.
   When you take a bite of apple pie, your posterior parietal cortex combines visual
   information about the forkful of pie with information about where your arm and
   hand are in relation to your body, how your head is oriented in relation to your
   body, and where your eyes are oriented in relation to your head. In other words,
   it integrates the body with the world. The posterior parietal cortex is composed
   of several subareas, which are responsive to different sense modalities and make
   different contributions to a person’s interaction with the world. Some cells
   combine proprioception and vision to provide information about specific
   postures, for example, the location and positioning of the arm and the hand
   (Bonda, Petrides, Frey, & Evans, 1995; Graziano, Cooke, & Taylor, 2000;
   Sakata, Takaoka, Kawarasaki, & Shibutani, 1973). Others contribute to reaching
   and grasping movements and eye movements toward targets of interest (Batista,
   Buneo, Snyder, & Andersen, 1999; Colby & Goldberg, 1999). The posterior
   parietal cortex’s contribution is not solely perceptual, because many of its
   neurons fire before and during a movement. It does not itself produce
   movements but passes its information on to frontal areas that do (Colby &
   Goldberg).

   A unified body image is critical to our ability to function and even to our self-
   concept, so you can imagine that any disruption would have significant
   consequences. You saw in Chapter 10 that damage to the right posterior parietal
   cortex can produce neglect and that some stroke patients will deny ownership of
   a paralyzed arm or leg (called xenomelia). A few people with no apparent
   brain damage—or mental or emotional disorder, for that matter—are so
   convinced that a limb doesn’t belong to them that they ask to have it
   amputated; this disorder is called body integrity identity disorder, or
   apotemnophilia (McGeoch et al., 2009). When the limb is touched, there is no
   response in the superior parietal area. Skin conductance response to stimulation
   is doubled in that limb, though, which indicates a high level of emotional feeling
   about the limb. A related phenomenon involving the same brain area
   incorporates the entire body into the illusion; in an out-of-body experience, the
   individual hallucinates seeing his or her body from another location, for
   example, from a position above the detached body. Causes include traumatic
   damage and epilepsy affecting the junction between the parietal and temporal
   lobes; the experience can also be produced by electrical stimulation in that area
   (Blanke & Arzy, 2005). In a particularly spooky clinical example, a woman
   whose temporoparietal junction was stimulated to see if that was the source of
   her epileptic seizures reported a ghostly form right behind her that mimicked her
   body posture and movements precisely (Figure 11.6; Arzy, Seeck, Ortigue,
   Spinelli, & Blanke, 2006).

   Pain and Its Disorders
   In Chapter 8, we learned about the emotional aspect of pain and how it motivates
   our behavior. Now we need to put pain in the context of the body senses and see
   how it works as a sensory mechanism. In spite of our attention to pain earlier,
   there are still a few surprises left.
   Detecting Pain
   Pain begins when certain free nerve endings are stimulated by intense pressure
   or temperature, by damage to tissue, or by various chemicals. Tissue injury also
   causes the injured cells to release a wide array of signaling molecules, referred to
   as the “inflammatory soup”; these include histamine, proteins (bradykinin),
   lipids (prostaglandins), neurotransmitters (serotonin), and cytokines (Julius
   & Basbaum, 2001; Kidd & Urban, 2001). Some of these stimulate pain
   receptors, but they also produce the familiar swelling and redness of
   inflammation, and they enhance excitability of the pain neurons so much that the
   neurons respond even to light touch. This effect is adaptive because it
   encourages guarding of the injured area, but the resulting pain can be more
   troublesome than the original injury. From the injured area, pain information
   travels to the spinal cord over large, myelinated A-delta fibers and small, lightly
   myelinated or unmyelinated C fibers. Because A-delta fibers transmit more
   rapidly than C fibers, you notice a sharp, stinging pain almost immediately when
   you are injured, followed by a longer lasting dull, aching pain (Basbaum &
   Jessell, 2000). Sharp pain receptors tend to be superficially located and are much
   more densely packed, which makes localizing the source of the sharp pain easier.
   Dull pain receptors are deeper and respond to a wider array of painful stimuli,
   and the sensations are harder to localize (Raja, Meyer, Ringkamp, & Campbell,
   1999). Sharp pain makes a good danger signal and motivates you to take quick
   action, while dull pain hangs around for a longer time to remind you that you
   have been injured.
   What causes pain?
   In the spinal cord, pain neurons release the neurotransmitter glutamate; as
   stimulation becomes more intense, they release both glutamate and substance P,
   a neuropeptide that increases pain sensitivity (Cao et al., 1998). In Chapter 2,
   we saw that neuropeptides enhance the primary neurotransmitter’s effect at the
   synapse; in mice lacking substance P or its receptors, mild pain is unaffected but
   sensitivity to moderate and intense pain is impaired (Cao et al.). As with the
   other body senses, pain information passes through the thalamus to the
   somatosensory cortex; however, the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula carry
   out additional processing of the emotional implications of pain, and the
   prefrontal cortex is concerned with pain of longer duration.
   Treating Pain
   We saw in Chapter 2 that local anesthetics—those that are applied to or injected
   into the painful area—block sodium channels in the pain neurons and reduce
   their ability to fire. General anesthetics, which may be injected or inhaled, render
   the patient unconscious. They work in the central nervous system, though their
   mechanism is poorly understood. We know that they affect the functioning of
   several proteins, but we don’t know which ones are important to the anesthesia.
   The most frequently used pain drugs are aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and
   acetaminophen (Table 11.1). The first three drugs (also called NSAIDs) block
   inflammatory enzymes required for producing prostaglandins, so they primarily
   reduce swelling and peripheral pain. Acetaminophen weakly blocks the same
   enzymes so it has little anti-inflammatory benefit; its major effect is in the
   central nervous system. Ameliorating intense pain often requires more powerful
   substances called opiates, and morphine extracted from the opium poppy is the
   acknowledged gold standard, but their addictiveness and patients’ rapidly
   developing tolerance have spurred the development of numerous alternatives
   (refer to Chapter 5 for more on these drugs). The MDAN series of drugs, for
   example, targets the mu opioid receptor while blocking the delta opioid receptor;
   these drugs are reportedly 50 times more potent than morphine, without
   producing either tolerance or addiction (Dietis et al., 2009). One such drug
   (NKTR-181) just finished phase 3 clinical trials with promising results in
   decreasing chronic lower back pain without causing drowsiness or euphoria
   (Anson, 2017).
   Efforts are under way on a variety of other fronts, as well. Tanezumab, an
   antibody for nerve growth factor, has shown safety and effectiveness in clinical
   trials with chronic back pain and the inflammatory pain of joint arthritis (M. T.
   Brown et al., 2013; Cattaneo, 2010). An experimental drug that blocks the
   TRPV1 receptor produces modest reduction of bone cancer pain in mice, but
   much smaller doses significantly increase the effectiveness of morphine when
   the two are used in combination (Niiyama, Kawamata, Yamamoto, Furuse, &
   Namiki, 2009). There has also been some preliminary success with gene therapy;
   patients whose pain from cancer was not relieved by 200 mg per day of
   morphine experienced an 80% reduction following treatment with a gene that
   increases endorphin production (D. J. Fink et al., 2011). The fact that pain
   ultimately occurs in the brain has inspired a novel approach that is also showing
   promise; chronic pain patients given continuous functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) feedback of activity in their cingulate gyrus learned to reduce
   pain-related brain activity and their experience of pain (deCharms et al., 2005).
   Internal Mechanisms of Pain Relief
   People sometimes feel little or no pain in spite of serious injury; they may even
   fail to realize they are injured until someone calls it to their attention. In the
   account of his search for the mouth of the Nile River, the explorer and
   missionary David Livingstone (1858/1971) gave an intriguing example (Figure
   11.7):
   Starting, and looking half round, I saw the lion just in the act of springing
   upon me. I was upon a little height; he caught my shoulder as he sprang,
   and we both came to the ground below together. Growling horribly close to
   my ear, he shook me as a terrier dog does a rat. The shock produced a
   stupor similar to that which seems to be felt by a mouse after the first shake
   of the cat. It caused a sort of dreaminess, in which there was no sense of
   pain nor feeling of terror, though quite conscious of all that was happening.
   It was like what patients partially under the influence of chloroform
   describe, who see all the operation, but feel not the knife. (p. 12)
   How does the brain relieve pain?
   You learned in earlier chapters that the reason opiate drugs are so effective at
   relieving pain is that they operate at receptors for the body’s own pain relievers.
   Researchers combined the words endogenous (“from within”) and morphine to
   come up with the name endorphins for this class of neurochemicals. Endorphins
   function both as neurotransmitters and as hormones, and they act at opiate
   receptors in many parts of the nervous system. Pain is one of the stimuli that
   release endorphins, but it does so only under certain conditions. Rats subjected
   to inescapable electric shock were highly tolerant of pain 30 minutes later; rats
   given an equal number of shocks that they could escape by making the correct
   response had only a slight increase in pain resistance (S. F. Maier, Drugan, &
   Grau, 1982). We are sure you can see the benefit of eliminating pain in situations
   of helplessness like Livingstone’s and preserving pain when it can serve as the
   motivation to escape. An injection of naloxone eliminates the analgesia induced
   by inescapable shock but not the milder analgesia that follows escapable shock;
   the fact that naloxone blocks opiate receptors by occupying them indicates that
   the analgesia of inescapable shock is endorphin based. (You may be wondering
   how you would determine a rat’s pain resistance, since it cannot verbally report
   its pain sensation. One way is to place the rat’s tail under a heat lamp and record
   how long it takes the rat to flick its tail away.)

   Several kinds of stimulation result in endorphin release and pain reduction,
   including physical stress (Colt, Wardlaw, & Frantz, 1981), acupuncture (Watkins
   & Mayer, 1982), and vaginal stimulation in female rats (Komisaruk & Steinman,
   1987) and women (Whipple & Komisaruk, 1988). Analgesia resulting from
   vaginal stimulation probably serves to reduce pain during birth or intercourse.
   Even the pain relief from placebo, which doctors once took as evidence that the
   pain was not “real,” is often the result of increasing endorphins, as revealed both
   by naloxone blockage of opiate receptors and by PET scans (Figure 11.8;
   Amanzio, Pollo, Maggi, & Benedetti, 2001; Petrovic, 2005; Petrovic, Kalso,
   Petersson, & Ingvar, 2002). So convincing yourself that the pain is diminishing
   may actually decrease the pain!

   Not all stimulation-induced pain relief comes from endorphins. For example,
   naloxone does not reduce the analgesic effect of hypnosis, and naloxone blocks
   analgesia produced by acupuncture needles inserted at distant points from the
   pain site but not when the needles are placed near the site (Watkins & Mayer,
   1982). Research indicates that the acupuncture needle causes a 24-fold increase
   in adenosine, which acts as a local anesthetic (N. Goldman et al., 2010). (Note,
   by the way, that this study’s first author was a 16-year-old girl.)
   The Descending Pain Inhibition Circuit
   During a spring break in New Orleans, Bob was touring one of the Civil War–era
   plantation houses for which the area is noted. In a glass case was an assortment
   of artifacts that had been found on the plantation grounds. An odd part of the
   collection was a few lead rifle slugs with what were obviously deep tooth marks
   on them. When makeshift surgery had to be performed with only a large dose of
   whiskey for anesthesia, the unfortunate patient would often be given something
   to bite down on like a piece of leather harness or a relatively soft lead bullet.
   (You can probably guess the common expression that is associated with this
   practice.) As a toddler, when you scraped your knee you clenched your teeth and
   rubbed the area around the wound. And—tribute to your childhood wisdom—it
   really did help and got you through the pain without the benefit of either a lead
   bullet or whiskey. You might think that tooth clenching and rubbing simply take
   attention from the pain. Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall (1965) had another
   idea. In their gate control theory, they hypothesized that pressure signals
   arriving in the brain trigger an inhibitory message that travels back down
   the spinal cord, where it closes a neural “gate” in the pain pathway.
   How can we "gate" pain?
   Research has confirmed the general idea of their theory, and we now know that a
   descending pathway in the spinal cord is one of the ways the brain uses
   endorphins to control pain. Pain causes the release of endorphins in the
   periaqueductal gray (PAG), a brain stem structure with a large number of
   endorphin synapses (Basbaum & Fields, 1984). As you can see in Figure 11.9,
   endorphin release inhibits the release of substance P, closing the pain “gate” in
   the spinal cord. (Note that enkephalin, the type of endorphin in the spinal cord,
   reduces substance P release by presynaptic inhibition, as described in Chapter 2.)
   Activation of the endorphin circuit apparently has multiple neural origins,
   including the cingulate cortex during placebo analgesia and the amygdala in the
   case of fear-induced analgesia (Petrovic, 2005). Brain imaging shows that
   placebo reduces pain through this circuit, and so does simple distraction
   (Petrovic, 2005; Petrovic et al., 2002; Tracey et al., 2002). Electrical stimulation
   of the PAG is also a very effective pain reliever, but it has the drawback of
   implanting electrodes in the brain (Bittar et al., 2005). Women, unfortunately,
   have fewer mu opioid receptors in the PAG than men, so they receive less pain-
   relieving benefit from opiate drugs (Loyd, Wang, & Murphy, 2008). The PAG
   also contains cannabinoid receptors, which respond to endogenous cannabinoids
   and the active ingredient in marijuana (see Chapter 5), and they account for
   some forms of stimulation-induced pain relief (Hohmann et al., 2005).
   Pain’s Extremes: From Congenital Insensitivity to
   Chronic Pain
   Congenital insensitivity to pain (or congenital analgesia) is a very rare condition.
   This is fortunate, because those who are afflicted not only unknowingly hurt
   themselves but also often engage in risky and dangerous behavior that most
   other people avoid. One family with several afflicted members was discovered
   when researchers learned of a boy in northern Pakistan who entertained on the
   street by piercing his arms with knives; before he could be studied, he died when
   he celebrated his 14th birthday by jumping off a roof (J. J. Cox et al., 2006).
   Several genes have been identified as responsible for the different kinds of pain
   insensitivity. People with a mutation in the SCN9A gene have nonfunctioning
   versions of a specific sodium channel, so their pain neurons are disabled (J. J.
   Cox et al.). Mutations in the PRDM12 gene also prevent the development of
   pain-sensing neurons (Y.-C. Chen et al., 2015). Those with a mutation in the
   gene for nerve growth factor (NGFB), which stimulates development of sensory
   nerves, have a significant loss of unmyelinated neurons and less severe loss of
   myelinated fibers (Einarsdottir et al., 2004). Another cause of insensitivity is
   illustrated in the case of a 16-year-old boy whose most significant characteristic
   was elevated opioid levels in his cerebrospinal fluid (Manfredi et al., 1981).
   How does chronic pain differ from regular pain?
   Chronic pain is much more common, and its victims often experience lifelong
   suffering. How many people are afflicted is difficult to determine, because
   studies include different populations and use different criteria. As a result,
   estimates have ranged from 10% to 55%; averages for two different criteria were
   11.8% and 35.5% (Harstall & Ospina, 2003). Practitioners often attempt to
   distinguish chronic from acute pain in terms of duration, with standards varying
   from 1 month to 1 year. However, it makes more sense to define chronic pain as
   pain that persists after healing has occurred or beyond the time in which
   healing would be expected to occur.
   Whether pain becomes chronic is largely unrelated to the severity of injury.
   Chronic pain patients are often clinically depressed; this could logically be
   attributed to the pain, but evidence indicates that in patients who exaggerate the
   extent and intensity of their pain, the depression precedes the injury (Bortsov,
   Platts-Mills et al., 2013). Also, the strength of functional connectivity between
   the nucleus accumbens and the frontal cortex, measured shortly after back pain
   began, predicted with 85% accuracy which patients would continue to suffer
   pain one year later (Baliki et al., 2012). Both areas are important in evaluating
   and dealing with stressful events, and their connection likely determines how
   emotionally the person reacts to pain. Several genes play a role as well. A
   different allele of the SCN9A sodium channel gene mentioned earlier lowers pain
   threshold and contributes to two types of neuropathic pain (T. Z. Fischer &
   Waxman, 2010). Variations in the COMT gene also regulate pain sensitivity, as
   well as responsiveness to pain relievers, and they figure in several pain
   syndromes (Andersen & Skorpen, 2009). Six variations of a glucocorticoid gene
   were associated with increased pain intensity in patients following motor vehicle
   collisions, while a variant of a D 2 dopamine receptor gene reduced severity
   (Bortsov, Smith, et al., 2013; Qadri et al., 2012).
   Figure 11.9 The Descending Pain Inhibition Circuit.
   The nervous system undergoes extensive functional and structural changes
   during chronic pain. The pain pathways increase their sensitivity, new
   connections sprout where peripheral neurons make connections in the spinal
   cord, and normal spinal inhibitory mechanisms are depressed (Woolf & Salter,
   2000). The brain also participates in these changes. Brain stem pathways become
   more responsive (M. Lee, Zambreanu, Menon, & Tracey, 2008); activation
   increases in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula (Baliki et
   al., 2006); and the amount of somatosensory cortex devoted to the painful area
   expands (Flor, Braun, Elbert, & Birbaumer, 1997). There is considerable loss of
   gray matter, equivalent to 10–20 years of additional aging in patients with
   chronic back pain (Figure 11.10; Apkarian, Sosa, Sonty, et al., 2004) and 9.5
   years of additional aging per year of suffering with fibromyalgia (Kuchinad et
   al., 2007). Evidence of the functional disruption this causes is that chronic pain
   patients perform poorly, almost randomly, on the gambling test used to assess
   prefrontal impairment (described in Chapter 8; Apkarian, Sosa, Krauss, et al.,
   2004). One piece of good news is that cortical decline may be partially
   reversible; patients with chronic hip pain increased their gray matter volumes
   after receiving a hip replacement and going four months without pain
   (Rodriguez-Raecke, Niemeier, Ihle, Ruether, & May, 2009).

   Phantom Pain
   If damage to the right parietal cortex can eliminate recognition of a paralyzed
   left arm or leg, shouldn’t removing a person’s arm or leg eliminate all
   consciousness of the limb? Not if there are cortical areas still devoted to the
   missing body parts. Most amputees continue to experience the missing limb, not
   as a memory, but as vividly as if it were real (Melzack, 1992). A phantom leg
   seems to bend when the person sits down and then to become upright during
   standing; a phantom arm even feels as though it is swinging in coordination with
   the other arm during walking.
   What causes phantom pain?
   In about 75% of amputees, we see what is undeniably the strangest manifestation
   of chronic pain (Kern, Busch, Rockland, Kohl, & Birklein, 2009; Richardson,
   Glenn, Nurmikko, & Horgan, 2006). Phantom pain, pain that is experienced in
   a missing limb, is not simply pain at the stump but is felt in the missing arm or
   leg itself. The classical explanation was that the cut ends of nerves continue to
   send impulses to the part of the brain that once served the missing limb.
   Peripheral input is a factor in some cases, but anesthetizing these nerves relieves
   phantom pain in no more than half of patients (Birbaumer et al., 1997; Flor,
   2008), so something else must be going on.
   Following the clue that stimulating the face often produces sensations in a
   phantom arm, a team of researchers in Germany used brain imaging to map face
   and hand somatosensory areas in upper-limb amputees (Flor et al., 1995). In
   patients with phantom pain, neurons from the face area appeared to have invaded
   the area that normally receives input from the missing hand (Figure 11.11). The
   area activated by touch on the lips was shifted an average of 2.05 centimeters
   (cm) in the hemisphere opposite the amputation, compared with 0.43 cm for the
   patients without phantom pain, a fivefold difference. It is unclear how much the
   results were due to intrusion of foreign neurons or to activation of existing
   neurons. However, facial stimulation can evoke sensations in the phantom arm
   within 24 hours after amputation, which indicates that “unmasking” of existing
   but ordinarily silent inputs is at least a partial explanation (Borsook et al., 1998).
   We usually think of neural plasticity as adaptive, but sometimes it can lead to
   malfunction and, in this case, truly bizarre results. As you can imagine, treating
   phantom pain poses special problems, so we will give it special attention in the
   accompanying Application.

   What is the contribution of each of the three classes of body senses?
   In what ways are the somatosensory cortex and the visual cortex organized similarly?
   In what circumstances does the brain reduce pain?
   Movement
   A popular view of the brain is that it is mostly preoccupied with higher cognitive
   processes, such as thinking, learning, and language. However, a surprising
   proportion of the brain is devoted to planning and executing movements. We are
   talking about more than simply moving the body from one place to another;
   consider the surgeon’s coordinated hand movements during a delicate operation,
   the control of mouth and throat muscles and diaphragm required to sing an aria,
   or a baseball outfielder’s ability to track a fast-moving fly ball and arrive in time
   to catch it. Studies of the control of movement provided one of the earliest
   windows into the brain’s organization and functioning, and it is that facet of the
   research that will interest us most. Before we launch into that topic, we need
   some understanding of the equipment the brain has to work with.
   The Muscles
   We have three types of muscles. The ones you are most familiar with are the
   skeletal muscles, which move the body and limbs but can fatigue if overused;
   they are also called striated muscles because of their striped cellular appearance.
   Smooth muscles produce rhythmic contractions in the internal organs; for
   example, they move food through the digestive system, constrict blood vessels,
   and void the bladder. Cardiac muscles are the non-fatiguing muscles that
   make up the heart. Because our focus is on movement, we will concentrate on
   the skeletal muscles. Anyway, despite differences in appearance, the muscles
   function similarly.
   Application: Treating Pain in Limbs That Aren’t There

   Most treatments for phantom pain are ineffective and fail to consider the mechanisms producing
   the pain. Surgery and pharmacological interventions are typically no better than placebo and
   benefit less than 30% of patients (Flor, 2008). Postsurgical reorganization of cortical wiring is a
   likely cause of phantom limb pain (Yanagisawa et al., 2016), and several studies suggest that
   therapies that work either prevent or reverse the cortical reorganization that occurs following
   amputation (Birbaumer et al., 1997). Use of a functional prosthesis (as opposed to a purely
   cosmetic one) prevents cortical reorganization and reduces pain occurrence (Lotze et al., 1999);
   newer hand prostheses that have pressure sensors in the fingers to help amputees adjust their
   grip to different objects should reduce phantom pain even better (Friedrich-Schiller-Universität
   Jena, 2010). When a prosthesis is impractical, training to discriminate electrical stimuli applied
   to the stump reverses cortical reorganization and reduces pain in 60% of patients (Flor, Denke,
   Schaefer, & Grüsser, 2001).
   One promising behavioral technique is mirror therapy. The patient places the stump out of sight
   on one side of a mirror and the good limb on the other side, so the reflection of the good limb
   appears to replace the one that is missing (see figure). Then the patient is told to move the two
   limbs in unison. In one later study, 100% of patients using the mirror box experienced decreases
   in pain (Chan et al., 2007); another study confirmed that pain relief is accompanied by reversal
   of cortical reorganization (Flor, Diers, Christmann, & Koeppe, 2006). For obvious reasons,
   mirror therapy is most effective if it is used soon after injury (Foeli, Bekrater-Bodmann, Diers,
   & Flor, 2013), but a new augmented reality technique has shown effectiveness in patients more
   than five years on average since their amputation and previous treatment (Ortiz-Catalan et al.,
   2016). Instead of a mirror image, patients see themselves on a video screen with their amputated
   arm replaced by a virtual one; electrodes on the stump send electrical signals from the muscles
   to a computer to make the virtual arm move (see image). After 12 sessions, the patients’ pain
   decreased by 50%.
   These techniques may work because of the greater responsiveness of the mirror neuron system
   in phantom limb patients. Bob saw this firsthand in a colleague, Ed, who had lost both legs in an
   accident. As they watched a construction worker walking the girders of a new building, Bob felt
   a bit of anxiety and a sympathetic tension in his legs as he imagined himself up there balancing
   on the narrow beams but, to his surprise, Ed exclaimed, “That makes my ankles hurt!”
   Researchers believe that simulated feedback therapy works because the image triggers
   exaggerated activity in mirror neurons in the hemisphere that once served the missing limb
   (Chan et al., 2007; Ramachandran & Altschuler, 2009). Without contradictory feedback from
   the missing limb, the mirror neuron activity is interpreted as actual touch or movement, and with
   continued practice the brain’s reorganization is reversed.
   Like other tissues of the body, a muscle is made up of many individual cells, or
   muscle fibers. The muscle cells are controlled by motor neurons that synapse
   with a muscle cell at the neuromuscular junction using the neurotransmitter
   acetylcholine (Figure 11.12). The number of cells served by a single axon
   determines the precision of movement possible. The biceps muscles have about a
   hundred muscle fibers per axon, but the ratio is around three to one in the eye
   muscles, which must make very precise movements in tracking objects (Evarts,
   1979).
   A muscle fiber is made up of myosin and actin filaments. When a motor neuron
   releases acetylcholine, the muscle fiber is depolarized, which opens calcium
   channels; the calcium influx initiates a series of actions by the myosin that
   contract the muscle. Small protrusions along the myosin filaments attach to the
   surrounding actin filaments; they then make a stroking movement that causes the
   actin filaments to slide along the myosin filaments, which shortens the muscle
   fibers. This sequence repeats rapidly, contracting the muscle (Figure 11.13).
   Skeletal muscles are anchored to bones by tendons, which are tough fibrous
   bands of connective tissue. You can see in Figure 11.14 that by pulling against
   their attachments the muscles are able to operate the limbs like levers to produce
   movement. Muscles can only contract; a limb is both flexed and extended by
   pulling on the joint from one side or the other. You can see that limbs have
   antagonistic muscles that produce opposite movements at a joint. In this case,
   the biceps muscle decreases the arm angle to flex the arm, and the triceps
   increases the angle, extending the arm. Rather than one muscle relaxing while
   the other does all the work, movement involves opposing contraction from both
   muscles. The simultaneous contraction of antagonistic muscles creates a
   smoother movement, allows precise stopping, and maintains the limb angle with
   minimal tremor. Standing requires coordinating the countering effects of
   antagonistic muscles in the legs, as well as muscles in the torso. The amount of
   contraction in a muscle varies from moment to moment, so the balance between
   two antagonistic muscles is constantly shifting, constantly correcting. If
   maintaining the balance between opposed pairs of muscles required conscious,
   voluntary activity, we would find it very difficult to hold a camera still enough to
   get a sharp picture or even to stand or sit erect. Adjustments this fast must be
   controlled by reflexes at the level of the spinal cord.
   What is the function of antagonistic muscles?

   The Spinal Cord
   In Chapter 3, we introduced the idea of the spinal reflex. Everyone is familiar
   with the reflex that makes you quickly withdraw your hand from a hot stove.
   When you step on a sharp object, you reflexively withdraw your foot and
   simultaneously make a variety of reflexive postural adjustments to avoid losing
   your balance. The advantage of reflexes is that we can make the appropriate
   adjustments quickly, without the delay of having to figure out the right action.
   What do spinal reflexes and central pattern generators do?
   The monosynaptic reflex illustrated in Figure 11.15 should also be familiar. Your
   doctor taps the patellar tendon, which connects the quadriceps muscle to the
   lower leg bone. This stretches the muscle, which is detected by muscle stretch
   receptors called muscle spindles and relayed to the spinal cord. There the
   sensory neurons synapse on motor neurons, which return to the quadriceps and
   cause it to contract and extend the lower leg. (There is an inhibitory interneuron
   in the spinal cord that relaxes the antagonistic hamstring muscle in the back of
   the leg, but this isn’t shown in the figure.) The function of the stretch reflex is
   not just to amuse your doctor. It enables a muscle to resist very quickly if the
   muscle is stretched by activity in its antagonistic partner; this helps, for example,
   to maintain an upright posture. It also allows a muscle to respond quickly to an
   increased external load, for example, when you are holding a stack of books in
   front of you and a friend unexpectedly drops another book on top of it. Golgi
   tendon organs, receptors that detect tension in a muscle, trigger a spinal
   reflex that inhibits the motor neurons and limits the contraction. This prevents
   muscles from contracting so strongly that they might be damaged.

   Stories of Brain & Behavior
   More complex patterns of motor behavior are also controlled in the spinal cord.
   It has been known for at least a century that cats with severed spinal cords,
   eliminating control from the brain, can make rhythmic stepping movements, and
   walk when they are suspended with their feet on a treadmill (J. G. Jones, Tansey,
   & Stuart, 2011). This behavior depends on central pattern generators (CPGs),
   neuronal networks that produce a rhythmic pattern of motor activity, such
   as those involved in walking, swimming, flying, and breathing. Central
   pattern generators are in the spinal cord and in the brain, and have been found in
   all vertebrate animals. In humans, they are most obvious in infants below the age
   of one year, who can make stepping movements when held with their feet on a
   treadmill (Lamb & Yang, 2000). In adults, CPGs provide an important bit of
   automaticity to routine movements. They can be elicited in individuals with
   spinal cord injury to produce rhythmic stepping movements (Dimitrijevic,
   Gerasimenko, & Pinter, 1998), and researchers are working on ways to recruit
   them during therapy (Boulenguez & Vinay, 2009; Dietz, 2009; Edgerton & Roy,
   2009). Spinal reflexes produce quick, reliable responses, and CPGs provide
   basic routines the brain can call up when needed, freeing the brain for more
   important matters (Figure 11.16). But reflexes and CPGs cannot provide all our
   movement capabilities, so we will turn our attention to the contributions the
   brain makes to movement.

   The Brain and Movement
   In the motor system, we again see a hierarchical organization consisting of the
   forebrain, brain stem, and spinal cord. The motor cortex organizes complex acts
   and executes movements while modulating activity in the brain stem and spinal
   cord. The brain stem in turn modulates the activity of the spinal cord (Ghez &
   Krakauer, 2000). We will start with the cortex and give it most of our attention.
   Figure 11.17 The Motor Areas of the Cortex and Cerebellum.
   The motor cortex consists of the primary motor cortex and two major secondary
   motor areas, the supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex (Figure
   11.17). Like the primary area, the secondary areas contain a map of the body,
   with greater amounts of cortex devoted to the parts of the body that produce
   finer movements (Figure 11.18). The sequence of processing in the motor cortex
   is just the opposite of what we see in the sensory areas: Planning of movement
   begins in the association areas, and the primary motor cortex is the final cortical
   motor area. Along the way, a movement is modified by inputs from the
   somatosensory cortex, the posterior parietal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the
   cerebellum. As with many other functions, the prefrontal cortex plays an
   executive role, so it will receive our attention first. We will be covering several
   brain areas and their functions in the next few pages. It would be a good idea to
   review the summary in Table 11.2 before reading further, so that you will have
   an idea of where we are going.

   The Prefrontal Cortex
   You already know two functions of the prefrontal cortex that suit it for its role in
   movement control: First, it plans actions with regard to their consequences;
   second, it receives information from the ventral visual stream about object
   identity, which is useful in identifying targets of motor activity. As an initial step
   in motor planning, the prefrontal cortex integrates auditory and visual
   information about the world with information about the body (from the posterior
   parietal cortex); it then holds the information in memory while selecting the
   appropriate movement and its target (see Figure 11.17). Considering its
   activities, it really makes more sense to say that the role of the prefrontal cortex
   is not so much in planning movements as in planning for movements.
   These functions are typically investigated in monkeys while they perform some
   variation of a delayed match-to-sample task. The monkey is presented with a
   visual stimulus; then, after a delay of a few seconds in which the stimulus is
   absent, the monkey is presented two or more stimuli and required to select the
   original stimulus (by reaching for it) to obtain a reward, such as a sip of juice.
   Some cells in the prefrontal cortex start firing when the first stimulus is
   presented and continue to fire throughout the delay, suggesting that they are
   “remembering” the stimulus. At response time, another group of prefrontal cells
   starts firing before activity starts in the premotor areas; this indicates that the
   prefrontal cortex selects the target of behavior and the appropriate motor
   responses (Goldman-Rakic, Bates, & Chafee, 1992; Hoshi, Shima, & Tanji,
   2000; Rainer, Rao, & Miller, 1999).
   What is the relationship between the primary motor area and the association
   areas?
   The Secondary Motor Areas
   The premotor cortex begins programming a movement by combining
   information from the prefrontal cortex and the posterior parietal cortex
   (Krakauer & Ghez, 2000). A good example comes from a study in which
   monkeys were cued to reach for one of two targets, A or B, in different locations
   and to use the left arm on some trials and the right arm on others. Some
   premotor neurons increased their firing rate only if target A was cued, and other
   neurons were selective for target B. Other cells fired selectively depending on
   which arm was to be used. Still other cells combined the information of the first
   two kinds of cells; they increased their firing only when a target was cued and a
   particular arm was to be used (Hoshi & Tanji, 2000). Two other cell types
   combine visual and somatosensory information to provide visual guidance of
   reaching and object manipulation. The first responds to visual stimuli on or near
   a specific part of the body, as in Figure 11.19a; another shifts the location of its
   visual receptive field to coincide with the location of the monkey’s hand as it
   moves (Figure 11.19b; Graziano, Hu, & Gross, 1997; Graziano, Yap, & Gross,
   1994).

   A fascinating demonstration of the role these specialized cells play occurs in a
   bizarre phenomenon known as the “rubber hand illusion.” The individual sits at
   a table with the left hand hidden from view; the experimenter strokes the hidden
   left hand with a brush while simultaneously stroking a rubber hand, which is in
   full view (Figure 11.20). After a few seconds, the sensation seems to be coming
   from the rubber hand, which the subject identifies as “my hand.” A study used
   fMRI to determine where the illusion occurs in the brain (Ehrsson, Spence, &
   Passingham, 2004). The posterior parietal cortex, which combines the visual and
   touch information, was active whether the two hands were stroked in synchrony
   or in asynchrony. The premotor area, by contrast, became active only when the
   stroking was simultaneous, and only after the individual began to experience the
   illusion; moreover, the strength of activation was related to the intensity of the
   illusion reported by the subject.
   Output from the prefrontal cortex flows to the supplementary motor area, which
   assembles sequences of movements, such as those involved in eating or in
   playing the piano. In monkeys trained to produce several different sets of
   movement sequences, different neurons increase their firing during a delay
   period depending on which sequence has been cued for performance (Shima &
   Tanji, 2000; Tanji & Shima, 1994). An important form of movement sequencing
   is the coordination of movements between the two sides of the body. For
   example, when a monkey’s supplementary motor cortex is damaged in one
   hemisphere, its hands tend to duplicate each other’s actions instead of sharing
   the task (C. Brinkman, 1984). Humans with similar damage also have trouble
   carrying out tasks that require alternation of movements between the two hands
   (Laplane, Talairach, Meininger, Bancaud, & Orgogozo, 1977). Coordinating the
   actions of the limbs is one of the biggest problems to be overcome on the way to
   developing mechanized prostheses, as the accompanying Research Spotlight
   explains.
   The Primary Motor Cortex
   The primary motor cortex is responsible for the organization and execution
   of voluntary movements; its cells fire most during the movement instead of
   prior to it (G. E. Alexander & Crutcher, 1990; Riehle & Requin, 1989).
   Individual motor cortex cells are not reserved for a specific movement but
   contribute their function to a range of related behaviors (Saper, Iverson, &
   Frackowiak, 2000); the primary motor cortex orchestrates the activity of these
   cells into a useful movement and contributes control of the movement’s force
   and direction (Georgopoulos, Taira, & Lukashin, 1993; Maier, Bennett, Hepp-
   Reymond, & Lemon, 1993). This orchestration was particularly evident in a
   stimulation study by Graziano, Taylor, and Moore (2002). Instead of using the
   usual brief pulses of electricity, which produce only muscle twitches, they
   increased the duration to a half-second and saw complex, coordinated responses
   in the monkeys, such as grasping, moving the hand to the mouth, and opening
   the mouth. The primary motor cortex can put these complex movement
   sequences together with the aid of input from the secondary motor areas, the
   somatosensory cortex, and the posterior parietal area (see Figure 11.17)
   (Krakauer & Ghez, 2000). Presumably, information from the somatosensory and
   posterior parietal areas provides feedback needed for refining movements on the
   fly.
   Research Spotlight: Brain-Computer Interfaces
   Source: Larry French/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images
   Brain-controlled devices have been a science fiction trope for many years, such as the Russian
   thought-powered fighter jet in the 1977 book Firefox by Craig Thomas (and the 1982 movie
   starring Clint Eastwood). So far, most of the success with brain-computer interfaces has been
   limited to movement of a single body part, such as using a robotic arm to take a drink of coffee
   or eat a bit of chocolate (see the video in the “On the Web” section at the end of this chapter).
   Todd Kuiken at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago has developed a procedure called
   targeted reinnervation. The nerves that once served the muscles of the amputated limb are
   redirected to a “spare” muscle; the electrical signals generated when the individual activates this
   muscle are amplified and used to operate a motorized prosthesis. These devices, while much
   more advanced than the crude prosthetic limbs of a decade ago, are still in their infancy. They
   can restore motor function of a lost limb, but they lack both the sense of touch and the ability to
   regulate the amount of force used to pick up an object without damaging it. Kuiken and other
   research teams are now developing prosthetic hands with pressure sensors in the fingers that
   stimulate the reinnervated muscle groups and provide feedback that is perceived by the brain as
   touch sensations. An artificial leg developed by Hubert Egger at the University of Linz in
   Austria can provide amputees with the feeling of the texture of the ground the individual is
   standing on (Schwartz, 2015).
   How about making these artificial limbs more realistic by using synthetic materials that act like
   natural tissues in the way they bend, flex, and change with increasing force? Hugh Herr, at the
   MIT Biomechatronics group, lost both legs from frostbite while mountain climbing. He is
   designing synthetic limb prosthetics with these more natural and flexible materials. The limbs
   use residual nerve signals to control the actions of the limbs, but the strength of those signals
   can modify the flexibility and force of the artificial limb (Humphries, 2015). More recently,
   Dario Farina and colleagues (2017) developed new prosthetic arms that are controlled by
   undamaged spinal motor neurons, allowing more signals to be received and permitting more
   extensive range of movements than traditional prosthetics permit. Volunteers in Farina’s study
   were able to open and close their hand, move their elbow joint, and move their wrist from side
   to side. More extensive clinical trials are the next step in developing these new prosthetics and
   making them available outside the research laboratory.
   The Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum
   The basal ganglia and cerebellum produce no motor acts themselves. Rather,
   they modulate the activity of cortical and brain stem motor systems; in that role,
   they are necessary for posture and smooth movement (Ghez & Krakauer, 2000).
   The basal ganglia—the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus—use
   information from the primary and secondary motor areas and the
   somatosensory cortex to integrate and smooth movements. The basal ganglia
   send output directly to the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area,
   and to the premotor cortex via the thalamus. As you can see in Figure 11.21,
   these structures border the thalamus; they apparently smooth movements
   through both facilitating and inhibitory outputs to the thalamus (DeLong, 2000).
   The basal ganglia also are especially active during complex sequences of
   movements (Boecker et al., 1998). It appears that they are involved in learning
   movement sequences so that the movements can be performed as a unit
   (Graybiel, 1998). In fact, one of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, which is
   caused by degeneration in the basal ganglia, is impaired learning, whether motor
   behavior is involved or not (Knowlton, Mangels, & Squire, 1996). Malfunction
   in the basal ganglia results in postural abnormalities and involuntary movements
   in Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease, which can be treated using deep
   brain stimulation (see Wichmann & DeLong, 2016).
   What do the basal ganglia and cerebellum add?
   Figure 11.21 The Basal Ganglia.
   When the cerebellum receives information from the motor cortex about an
   intended movement, it determines the order of muscular contractions and their
   precise timing. It also uses information from the vestibular system to maintain
   posture and balance, refine movements, and control eye movements that
   compensate for head movements (Ghez & Thach, 2000). Once an intended
   movement has been modified, the cerebellum sends the information back to the
   primary motor cortex. We can see the contribution of the cerebellum in the
   deficits that occur when it is damaged. For example, we begin to shape our hand
   for grasping while the arm is moving toward the target, but a person with
   cerebellar damage reaches, pauses, and then shapes the hand. A normal
   individual touches the nose in what appears to be a single, smooth movement;
   cerebellar damage results in exaggerated, wavering corrections. The effects of
   cerebellar damage on coordination and accuracy in limb movements is like the
   effect of alcohol; the drunk driver who is pulled over by the police has trouble
   walking a straight line, standing on one foot with the eyes closed, or touching the
   nose with the tip of the finger. People with damage to the cerebellum are often
   mistakenly believed to be drunk.
   The cerebellum lives up to the meaning of its name, “little brain,” by applying its
   expertise to a variety of tasks. It is necessary for learning motor skills (D. A.
   McCormick & Thompson, 1984), but it also participates in nonmotor learning
   (Canavan, Sprengelmeyer, Diener, & Hömberg, 1994) and in making time and
   speed judgments about auditory and visual stimuli (Keele & Ivry, 1990). Also,
   patients with cerebellar damage have difficulty shifting visual attention to
   another location in space (whether this involves eye movements or not), taking
   0.8–1.2 seconds compared with 0.1 second for normal individuals (Townsend et
   al., 1999). We should think of the cerebellum in terms of its general functions
   rather than strictly as a motor organ.
   Disorders of Movement
   You might think that anything as complex as the movement system would be
   subject to malfunction; if so, you would be correct. Predictably, movement
   disorders are devastating to their victims. We will consider as representatives of
   these diseases Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, myasthenia gravis, and
   multiple sclerosis.
   Parkinson’s Disease
   As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, Parkinson’s disease is
   characterized by motor tremors, rigidity, loss of balance and coordination,
   and difficulty in moving, especially in initiating movements (Olanow &
   Tatton, 1999; Youdim & Riederer, 1997). Parkinson’s affects about 0.3% of the
   population in industrialized countries and 1% of people over the age of 60 years
   (Nussbaum & Ellis, 2003). The symptoms are caused by deterioration of the
   substantia nigra, whose neurons send dopamine-releasing axons to the
   striatum, which is composed of the basal ganglia’s caudate nucleus and
   putamen and the nucleus accumbens. In something less than 10% of cases, the
   disease is familial, meaning that it occurs more frequently among relatives of
   a person with the disease than it does in the population (Greenamyre &
   Hastings, 2004). If a member of a twin pair is diagnosed with Parkinson’s
   disease before the age of 51, the chance of an identical twin also having
   Parkinson’s is six times greater than it is for a fraternal twin (Tanner et al.,
   1999). The same study found no evidence of a genetic influence in individuals
   whose symptoms developed later in life; we will look at possible non-genetic
   causes shortly. Geneticists have located 28 chromosomal regions that are most
   likely related to Parkinson’s disease, and 6 of those regions contain genes whose
   mutations are known to cause the disease on their own (reviewed in Klein &
   Westenberger, 2012). These six play many roles in cellular functioning and
   protein synthesis, and at least two are associated with the presence of Lewy
   bodies, abnormal clumps of protein that form within neurons (Figure 11.22).
   Lewy bodies are often found in Parkinson’s patients as well as in patients with
   Alzheimer’s disease (Glasson et al., 2000; Spillantini et al., 1997). Lewy bodies
   probably contribute to the cognitive deficits and depression that often
   accompany Parkinson’s disease; they may represent the brain’s attempt to
   remove proteins that have been damaged by toxins. The patient’s complement of
   genes helps determine age of onset, rate of progression, and whether cognitive
   loss will be a part of the disease progression. Actor Robin Williams and
   television personality Casey Kasem had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s
   disease, and each showed signs of the disorder dementia with Lewy bodies
   (DLW) prior to their deaths (McKeith, 2015; Savica, 2014).
   What are the causes and effects of the movement disorders?

   1997, Nature 8/28/1997. Copyright © 1997. Used with permission.
   Several environmental influences have been implicated in Parkinson’s disease.
   One cause is subtle brain injury; being knocked unconscious once increases the
   risk by 32%, and the risk rises by 174% for those knocked out several times.
   Other research points to a variety of toxins, including industrial chemicals,
   carbon monoxide, herbicides, and pesticides (Olanow & Tatton, 1999).
   Numerous studies show an association between pesticide use and Parkinson’s,
   but the human studies are correlational, and establishing a causal relationship has
   been difficult (reviewed in Moretto & Colosio, 2013). Pesticide exposure
   produces some of the symptoms of Parkinson’s in animals, though with very
   high dosages. These studies also suggest that specific genes increase sensitivity
   to the toxic effects, providing another example of the interaction between
   hereditary and environmental effects. While firm conclusions have eluded us, a
   study in California’s highly agricultural Central Valley that found a tripling of
   risk with occupational exposure to the pesticides ziram, maneb, and paraquat (A.
   Wang et al., 2011) suggests extreme caution while we try to sort things out.
   Interestingly, the risk of Parkinson’s disease is reduced as much as 80% in coffee
   drinkers (G. W. Ross et al., 2000). The risk also drops by 50% in smokers
   (Fratiglioni & Wang, 2000), but of course no benefit of smoking outweighs its
   dangers. Rat studies indicate that cigarette smoke may prevent the accumulation
   of neurotoxins (Soto-Otero, Méndez-Alvarez, Sánchez-Sellero, Cruz-Landeira,
   & López-Rivadulla, 2001) and that caffeine reduces the effect of neurotoxins by
   blocking adenosine receptors, which we saw in Chapter 5 results in increased
   dopamine and acetylcholine release (J.-F. Chen et al., 2001). In heavy coffee
   drinkers, a variant of the glutamate receptor gene GRIN2A reduces Parkinson’s
   risk by 59% (Hamza et al., 2011). There has been some clinical success in
   treating Parkinson’s with adenosine and glutamate receptor antagonists
   (Gasparini, Di Paolo, & Gomez-Mancilla, 2013; Hickey & Stacy, 2012).
   How can we treat symptoms of Parkinson’s disease?
   Parkinson’s disease is typically treated by administering levodopa (L-dopa),
   which is the precursor for dopamine. Parkinson’s tends to be more severe in
   men than in women, presumably because estrogen indirectly raises dopamine
   levels (Haaxma et al., 2007). Dopamine will not cross the blood-brain barrier but
   L-dopa will, and the brain converts it to dopamine. Dopamine agonists can also
   be helpful, and even placebos increase dopamine release (de la Fuente-
   Fernández et al., 2001). But these treatments increase dopamine throughout the
   brain, which causes side effects ranging from restlessness and involuntary
   movements to hallucinations. Also, as more neurons die, more drug is required,
   increasing the side effects. While L-dopa remains the standard, its side effects
   mean that some patients are forced to use other drugs. Unfortunately, these drugs
   also treat only some of the symptoms and with limited benefit.
   Early attempts showed that implanted embryonic neural cells could survive in
   the striatum and produce dopamine (Figure 11.23; C. R. Freed et al., 2001;
   Greene & Fahu, 2002). However, behavioral improvement was not clinically
   significant, and some of the patients developed involuntary movements,
   apparently due to excess dopamine. More recent work using adult neural stem
   cells resulted in more than 80% improvement in motor behavior ratings; the
   improvement held up for three years but had disappeared at the end of five years
   (Lévesque, Neuman, & Rezak, 2009). Clinical application is hampered by
   immune reactions to stem cells and by the development of tumors at the implant
   site. Recent work indicates that immune response is minimal with stem cells
   taken from the individual (Morizane et al., 2013), and tumor development can be
   avoided by allowing the stem cells to mature into an early form of neural cell
   before implanting (Doi et al., 2012). Gene therapy has also been tried
   experimentally, with the intent of increasing dopamine levels or reducing excess
   activity in affected brain areas. Results have been mixed in the handful of
   clinical trials conducted at the phase 1 and phase 2 levels; so far, no procedure
   has reached the critical phase 3 level that could establish its effectiveness
   sufficiently for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
   (Denyer & Douglas, 2012). To avoid previous disappointments, the British
   company Oxford Biomedica has used a procedure called ProSavin to deliver a
   combination of three genes into the striatum to increase dopamine production
   there; all 15 drug-resistant patients improved in motor capability and maintained
   improvement for the full year of this phase 1/phase 2 safety and dosage trial
   (Palfi et al., 2014). These procedures are still in their infancy; we need to
   remember that the first several heart transplant operations failed, but they are
   almost routine today.

   Patient.

   Journal of Medicine, 334, pp. 710–719, fig. 3a and b, p. 717.
   Frustration with therapeutic alternatives is creating something of a revival in
   surgical treatments, which were largely abandoned when drugs for Parkinson’s
   disease became available (Cosgrove & Eskandar, 1998). Strategically placed
   lesions in the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus, both in the basal
   ganglia (see Figure 11.21), have provided some improvement for patients who
   have difficulty using dopaminergic drugs (Cosgrove & Eskandar). Michael J.
   Fox had such lesions, and they vastly improved his ability to control his
   movement (M. J. Fox, 2002). These two structures produce a rhythmic bursting
   activity like the rhythmic activity in parkinsonian tremors, which apparently
   explains why destroying them reduces this symptom ( Perkel & Farries, 2000).
   But the surgery can damage adjacent structures, resulting in other deficits, such
   as weakness in a part of the body. More recently, physicians are turning to a less
   drastic procedure known as deep brain stimulation (DBS), in which electrical
   stimulation through implanted electrodes is used to trigger dopamine
   release in areas deprived of that neurotransmitter. While effective, there is a
   higher risk of weight gain and sensitivity to the pleasurable aspects of food seen
   in some dopamine-increasing drugs (see the accompanying Application).
   Huntington’s Disease
   Like Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease is a degenerative disorder of
   the motor system involving cell loss in the striatum and cortex. Years before
   a diagnosis, Huntington’s disease begins with mild, infrequent jerky movements
   that result from impaired error correction (M. A. Smith, Brandt, & Shadmehr,
   2000). Later, involuntary movements appear, first as fidgeting and then as
   movements of the limbs and, finally, writhing of the body and facial grimacing.
   Because these movements sometimes resemble a dance, Huntington’s disease is
   also called Huntington’s chorea, from the Greek word choreia, which means
   “dance.” The patient loses the ability to carry out daily activities. Death usually
   follows within 15–30 years after the onset of the disease.
   Unlike Parkinson’s disease, cognitive and emotional deficits are a universal
   characteristic of Huntington’s disease. These deficits include impaired judgment,
   difficulty with a variety of cognitive tasks, depression, and personality changes.
   The motor symptoms are due to the degeneration of inhibitory GABA-releasing
   neurons in the striatum, whereas defective or degenerated neurons in the cortex
   probably account for the psychological symptoms (Figure 11.24; J. B. Martin,
   1987; Tabrizi et al., 1999).
   This is a scary thing. . . . There is a test available, but I haven’t had the guts to take it yet.

   Although almost 30 years old, an effective treatment for the motor tremors and repetitive
   movements seen in Parkinson’s disease patients continues to be a procedure called deep brain
   stimulation (DBS). The mechanism by which DBS works is to block electrical signals that are
   responsible for the tremors associated with Parkinson’s. In this technique, neurosurgeons
   implant electrodes into the brain and run insulated wires under the skin down the neck into the
   upper chest area. There, the wires are attached to a pacemaker-like device that is also implanted
   into the patient’s chest. In this way, a precise set of electrical pulses can be sent to the target area
   (usually the basal ganglia) to “reset” activity in the brain area(s) and restore normal function.
   After a set of stimulations, tremor usually dissipates within seconds (Blahak et al., 2009),
   whereas effective treatment for dystonia (uncontrollable repetitive muscle contractions) may
   take additional months of treatment.
   So what does DBS do in the brain? There’s a lot of debate as to what exactly the stimulation
   does to improve motor function. Early research concluded the stimulation temporarily knocked
   out neurons in the stimulation site (like a reversible lesion; Wichmann, Bergman, & DeLong,
   1994), but later teams suggested the added electrical charges made dendritic inputs stronger
   (McIntyre, Grill, Sherman, & Thakor, 2004). Other findings suggest an increase in chemical
   neurotransmitters such as adenosine (Bekar et al., 2008) and dopamine (Gale et al., 2013).
   Improved motor functioning, allowing L-dopa reduction, has been reported for as long as 10
   years (reviewed in Fasano, Daniele, & Albanese, 2012). Results are mixed regarding reducing
   cognitive deficits, which often are more disabling and resistant to treatment than the motor
   symptoms. DBS usually improves or eliminates impulse control problems in the 13%–16% of
   patients affected, possibly due to L-dopa reduction.
   This improvement does carry some risk: Some studies have reported the onset of pathological
   gambling, hypersexuality, and compulsive eating. Recent work has suggested that side effects of
   DBS of the subthalamic nucleus include increased impulsivity and sensitivity to food rewards,
   resulting in undesired weight gain, which indicates that the neurons and circuits play a role in
   multiple behaviors. In addition, there is some loss of verbal fluency after DBS, and apathy
   increases in some patients.
   Huntington’s disease results from a mutated form of the huntingtin gene
   (Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993). The loss of
   neurons is probably due to the accumulation of the gene’s protein, also known as
   huntingtin, whose function is unknown (DiFiglia et al., 1997). In normal
   individuals, the gene has less than 26 repetitions of the bases cytosine, adenine,
   and guanine (CAG repeats; see Chapter 1). The more repeats the person has
   beyond 26, the earlier in life the person will succumb to the disease (F. O.
   Walker, 2007). Because the gene is dominant, a person who has a parent with
   Huntington’s has a 50% chance of developing the disease. This is an unusual
   example of a human disorder resulting from a single gene.
   Numerous drugs are used to treat the various symptoms, including
   antidepressants and antipsychotics, but only one (Tetrabenazine) has been
   approved specifically for Huntington’s disease by the FDA. It reduces the excess
   dopamine that causes the abnormal movements. Drugs that silence the huntingtin
   gene are showing promise in animals; a single injection of one of these drugs
   normalized movement in mice for the nine-month duration of the study and
   significantly reduced huntingtin protein levels for eight weeks in monkeys
   (Kordasiewicz et al., 2012). Grafting of fetal striatal cells has so far produced
   only modest and temporary improvement (Cicchetti et al., 2009), but a recent
   method using human stem cells overexpressing neural growth factors has shown
   some promise in improving function in a mouse model (Pollock et al., 2016).
   Autoimmune Diseases
   Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder of muscular weakness caused by
   reduced numbers or sensitivity of acetylcholine receptors. The muscle
   weakness can be so extreme that the patient has to be maintained on a respirator.
   In fact, 25 years ago the mortality rate from MG was about 33%; now few
   patients die from the disease, thanks to improved treatment (Rowland, 2000a).
   Figure 11.24 Loss of Brain Tissue in Huntington’s Disease.

   The loss of receptors was demonstrated in an interesting way. The venom of the
   many-banded Formosan krait, a very poisonous snake from Taiwan, paralyzes
   prey by binding to the acetylcholine receptor. When the venom’s toxin is labeled
   with radioactive iodine and applied to a sample of muscle tissue, it allows
   researchers to identify and count the acetylcholine receptors. The MG patients
   turned out to have 70%–90% fewer receptors than normal individuals
   (Fambrough, Drachman, & Satyamurti, 1973). Drugs that inhibit the action of
   acetylcholinesterase give temporary relief from the symptoms of myesthenia
   gravis (Figure 11.25; Rowland, Hoefer, & Aranow, 1960). Remember from
   Chapter 2 that acetylcholinesterase breaks down acetylcholine at the synapse;
   these inhibitors increase the amount of available neurotransmitter at the neuron-
   muscle junction.
   Although immune system therapy has sometimes been used (Shah & Lisak,
   1993), removal of the thymus (thymectomy) has now become a standard
   treatment for MG (Rowland, 2000a). The thymus is the major source of
   lymphocytes that produce antibodies. Improvement can take years, but
   thymectomy eliminates symptoms completely in almost 80% of patients and
   reduces them in another 13%–17% (Ashour et al., 1995; Jaretzki et al., 1988).
   Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a motor disorder with many varied symptoms,
   caused by deterioration of myelin (demyelination) and neuron loss in the
   central nervous system. In Chapter 2, you saw that demyelination causes
   slowing or elimination of neural impulses. Demyelination thus reduces the speed
   and strength of movements. Even before that happens, impulses traveling in
   adjacent neurons, which should arrive simultaneously, become desynchronized
   because of differential loss of myelin. An early sign of the disorder is
   impairment of functions that require synchronous bursts of neural activity, like
   tendon reflexes and vibratory sensation (Rowland, 2000b). As the disease
   progresses, unmyelinated neurons die, leaving areas of sclerosis, or hardened
   scar tissue (Figure 11.26). As a result, the person experiences muscular
   weakness, tremor, pain, impaired coordination, urinary incontinence, and visual
   problems. Studies indicate that neuron loss is more important than previously
   thought and suggest that the loss results from a degenerative process in addition
   to the demyelination (DeLuca, Ebers, & Esiri, 2004; De Stefano et al., 2003).
   Figure 11.25 Effect of an Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor on Myasthenia Gravis.

   and H. Aranow Jr., 1960, Research Publications-Association for Research
   in Nervous and Mental Disease, 38, pp. 547–560.
   Like myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease. Injecting
   foreign myelin protein into the brains of animals produces symptoms like those
   of MS (Wekerle, 1993), and T cells that are reactive to myelin proteins (see
   Chapter 8) have been found in the blood of MS patients (Allegretta, Nicklas,
   Sriram, & Albertini, 1990). A genome-wide study has implicated various
   immune system genes in MS (International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics
   Consortium, 2007), but some environmental condition may be needed to trigger
   the immune attack on myelin. One possibility is that the immune system has
   been sensitized by an earlier viral infection; for example, studies have found
   antibodies for Epstein-Barr virus in MS patients (H. J. Wagner et al., 2000), and
   patients more often had mumps or measles during adolescence (Hernán et al.,
   2001).
   Figure 11.26 The Brain of a Deceased Multiple Sclerosis Patient.
   Source: Science Source.
   Although many drugs are available to treat the various symptoms of the disease,
   only a few drugs modify the problematic immune activity in MS patients; these
   immune-suppressing drugs slow the progression but do not repair the harm
   already done. A drug that blocks voltage-gated potassium channels,
   dalfampridine, helps demyelinated axons transmit signals by increasing the
   strength of action potentials; it improves motor performance, particularly
   walking (Jeffrey, 2010), but it can increase the risk of seizures (U.S. Food and
   Drug Administration, 2012). In a multicenter stem cell study, 281 patients with
   progressive MS were treated by harvesting stem cells from their bone marrow,
   wiping out their immune systems using chemotherapy, and then injecting the
   stem cells back; 46% of the patients had no additional symptoms five years
   afterwards (Muraro et al., 2017).

   chapter?
   In Perspective
   Unless we have a disorder like Michael J. Fox does (described in the chapter
   introduction), we usually take our body senses and our capability for movement
   for granted. And yet just standing upright is a remarkable feat. Granted, a
   mechanical robot could do it easily, but only if it had a rigid body like R2D2’s. If
   the robot had our flexibility of movement and posture, it would have to devote a
   fair amount of its computer brain to making split-millisecond adjustments to
   avoid toppling over. Then another chunk of its computer would be required just
   to locate a visual object in space, to reach out smoothly and quickly for the
   object, and to shape its hand for grasping, deciding whether to use the whole
   hand or the finger and thumb and how much pressure to apply, and so on. You
   get the idea. Better let a human do it, because all that fancy equipment comes
   standard on the basic model.
   Now you see why so much of the brain is concerned with the sensory and motor
   components of movement. And when the system becomes damaged, even the
   easiest behaviors become quite difficult. It is a wonder that we have enough left
   over for the demands of learning, intelligence, and consciousness, but as you
   will see in the remaining chapters, we do.
   Chapter Summary
   The Body Senses
   The body senses include proprioception, which tells us about the position and movement
   of our limbs and body; the skin senses, which inform us about the conditions in the
   periphery of our body; and the vestibular sense, which contributes information about head
   position and movement and helps us maintain balance.
   The skin senses—touch, warmth, cold, and pain—tell us about conditions at the body
   surface and about objects in contact with our body.
   The body senses are processed in a series of structures in the primary and secondary
   somatosensory cortex and in the posterior parietal cortex, with several similarities to
   visual processing. Pain processing also extends into additional areas.
   In their quest to find better ways of relieving pain, researchers have learned how the
   nervous system detects painful stimulation and found that the body has its own ways of
   relieving pain. Chronic pain presents particularly difficult challenges.
   Movement
   There are three types of muscles: cardiac (heart); smooth (internal organs); and skeletal
   muscles, which move the body by tugging against their attachments to bones.
   Spinal reflexes produce quick responses and provide postural adjustments. Central pattern
   generators provide routines such as rhythmic walking movements.
   Cortical motor areas assess spatial and body information and construct movements by
   passing information through a succession of brain areas.
   The basal ganglia and cerebellum refine movements produced by the motor cortex.
   Several diseases attack the motor system at various points of vulnerability. Major causes
   that have been implicated are heredity, toxins, and autoimmune disorders.

   For Further Thought
   Of proprioception, the vestibular sense, pain, and the other skin senses, which do you think you
   could most afford to give up? Why?
   If pain is beneficial, why does the body have pain relief mechanisms?
   Imagine a robot with a humanlike body. It is programmed to walk, reach, grasp, and so on. It
   has visual and auditory capabilities, but no body senses. What would its movement be like?
   Judging by the examples given of movement disorders, what are the points of vulnerability in
   the motor system?

   At the age of seven, Henry Molaison’s life was forever changed by a seemingly
   minor incident: He was knocked down by a bicycle and was unconscious for five
   minutes. Three years later, he began to have minor seizures, and his first major
   seizure occurred on his 16th birthday. Still, Henry had a reasonably normal
   adolescence, taken up with high school, science club, hunting, and roller-skating,
   except for a two-year furlough from school because the other boys teased him
   about his seizures.
   Master the content.
   edge.sagepub.com/garrett5e
   After high school, he took a job in a factory, but eventually the seizures made it
   impossible for him to work. He was averaging 10 small seizures a day and 1
   major seizure per week. Because anticonvulsant medications were unable to
   control the seizures, Henry and his family decided on an experimental operation
   that held some promise. In 1953, when Henry was 27, a surgeon removed much
   of both of his temporal lobes, where the seizure activity was originating. The
   surgery worked, for the most part: With the help of medication, the petit mal
   seizures were mild enough not to be disturbing, and major seizures were reduced
   to about one a year. Henry returned to living with his parents. He helped with
   household chores, mowed the lawn, and spent his spare time doing difficult
   crossword puzzles. Later, he worked at a rehabilitation center, doing routine
   tasks like mounting cigarette lighters on cardboard store displays.
   Henry’s intelligence was not impaired by the operation; his IQ test performance
   even went up, probably because he was freed from the interference of the
   abnormal brain activity. However, there was one important and unexpected
   effect of the surgery. Although he could recall personal and public events and
   remember songs from his earlier life, Henry had difficulty learning and retaining
   new information. He could hold new information in memory for a short while,
   but if he were distracted or if a few minutes passed, he could no longer recall the
   information. When he worked at the rehabilitation center, he could not describe
   the work he did. He did not remember moving into a nursing home in 1980, or
   even what he ate for his last meal. And although he watched television news
   every night, he could not remember the day’s news events later or even recall the
   name of the president (Corkin, 1984; B. Milner, Corkin, & Teuber, 1968).
   Discovering the physical basis of learning in humans and other mammals is among the
   greatest remaining challenges facing the neurosciences.
   —T. H. Brown, Chapman, Kairiss, & Keenan, 1988
   Henry’s inability to form new memories was not absolute. Although he could not
   find his way back to the new home his family moved to after his surgery if he
   was more than two or three blocks away, he was able to draw a floor plan of the
   house, which he had navigated many times daily (Corkin, 2002). Over the years,
   he became aware of his condition, and he was very insightful about it. In his own
   words,
   Every day is alone in itself, whatever enjoyment I’ve had, and whatever
   sorrow I’ve had. . . . Right now, I’m wondering. Have I done or said
   anything amiss? You see, at this moment everything looks clear to me, but
   what happened just before? That’s what worries me. It’s like waking from a
   dream; I just don’t remember. (B. Milner, 1970, p. 37)
   Over a period of 55 years, Henry would be the subject of a hundred scientific
   studies that he could not remember; he was known to the world as patient HM to
   protect his privacy. In the next several pages, you will see why many consider
   HM’s surgery the most significant single event in the study of learning.
   Learning as the Storage of Memories
   Some one-celled animals “learn” surprisingly well, for example, to avoid
   swimming toward a light where they have received an electric shock before. I
   have placed the term learn in quotation marks because such simple organisms
   lack a nervous system; their behavior changes briefly, but if you take a lunch
   break during your subject’s training, when you return, you will have to start all
   over again. Such a temporary form of learning may help an organism avoid an
   unsafe area long enough for the danger to pass or linger in a place where food is
   more abundant. But without the ability to make a permanent record, you could
   not learn a skill, and experience would not help shape who you are. We will
   introduce the topic of learning by examining the problem of storage.
   Amnesia: The Failure of Storage and Retrieval
   HM’s symptoms are referred to as anterograde amnesia, an impairment in
   forming new memories. (Anterograde means “moving forward.”) This was not
   HM’s only memory deficit; the surgery also caused retrograde amnesia, the
   inability to remember events prior to impairment. His retrograde amnesia
   extended from the time of surgery back to about the age of 16; he had a few
   memories from that period, but he did not remember the end of World War II or
   his own graduation, and when he returned for his 35th high school reunion, he
   recognized none of his classmates. Better memory for earlier events than for
   recent ones may seem implausible, but it is typical of patients who have brain
   damage like HM’s. How far back the retrograde amnesia extends depends on
   how much damage there is and which specific structures are damaged.
   How does studying amnesia help us understand memory?
   HM’s surgery damaged or destroyed the hippocampus, nearby structures that
   along with the hippocampus make up the hippocampal formation, and the
   amygdala. Figure 12.1 shows the location of these structures. Because they are
   on or near the inside surface of the temporal lobe, they form part of what is
   known as the medial temporal lobe (remember that medial means “toward the
   middle”). Because HM’s surgery was so extensive, it is impossible to tell which
   structures are responsible for the memory functions that were lost. Studies of
   patients with varying degrees of temporal lobe damage have helped determine
   which structures are involved in amnesia and, therefore, in memory. Henry died
   in 2008 at the age of 82, but he continues to contribute, as the accompanying
   Application explains.
   The hippocampus consists of several substructures with different functions. The
   part known as CA1 provides the primary output from the hippocampus to other
   brain areas; damage in that part of both hippocampi results in moderate
   anterograde amnesia and only minimal retrograde amnesia. If the damage
   includes the rest of the hippocampus, anterograde amnesia is severe. Damage to
   the entire hippocampal formation results in retrograde amnesia extending back
   15 years or more (J. J. Reed & Squire, 1998; Rempel-Clower, Zola, Squire, &
   Amaral, 1996; Zola-Morgan, Squire, & Amaral, 1986). More extensive
   retrograde impairment occurs with broader damage or deterioration, like that
   seen in Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease,
   apparently because memory storage areas in the cortex are compromised (Squire
   & Alvarez, 1995).

   Mechanisms of Consolidation and Retrieval
   HM’s memory impairment consisted of two problems: consolidation of new
   memories and, to a lesser extent, retrieval of older memories. Consolidation is
   the process in which the brain forms a more or less permanent physical
   representation of a memory. Retrieval is the process of accessing stored
   memories—in other words, the act of remembering. When a rat presses a
   lever to receive a food pellet or a child is bitten by a dog or you skim through the
   headings in this chapter, the experience is held in memory at least for a brief
   time. But just like the phone number that is forgotten when you get a busy signal
   the first time you dial, an experience does not necessarily become a permanent
   memory; and if it does, the transition takes time. Until the memory is
   consolidated, it is particularly fragile. New memories may be disrupted just by
   engaging in another activity, and even older memories are vulnerable to intense
   experiences such as emotional trauma or electroconvulsive shock treatment (a
   means of inducing convulsions, usually in treating depression). Researchers
   divide memory into two stages, short-term memory and long-term memory.
   Long-term memory, at least for some kinds of learning, can be divided into two
   stages that have different durations and occur in different locations (Figure 12.2),
   as we will see later (McGaugh, 2000).
   Most memories, like humans and wines, do not mature instantly. Instead they are gradually
   stabilized in a process referred to as consolidation.
   —Yadin Dudai
   An animal study clearly demonstrates that the hippocampus participates in
   consolidation. Rats were trained in a water maze, a tank of murky water from
   which they could escape quickly by learning the location of a platform
   submerged just under the water’s surface (Figure 12.3; Riedel et al., 1999).
   Then, for seven days the rats’ hippocampi were temporarily disabled by a drug
   that blocks receptors for the neurotransmitter glutamate. Eleven days later—
   plenty of time for the drug to clear the rats’ systems—they performed poorly
   compared with control subjects (Riedel et al.). Researchers have been able to
   “watch” the consolidation happening in humans, using brain scans and event-
   related potentials. Presenting words or pictures activated the hippocampus and
   adjacent cortex; how well the material was remembered later could be predicted
   from how much activation occurred in those areas during stimulus presentation
   (Figure 12.4; Alkire, Haier, Fallon, & Cahill, 1998; Brewer, Zhao, Desmond,
   Glover, & Gabrieli, 1998; Fernández et al., 1999).

   Application: The Legacy of HM

   Not only did Henry Molaison devote much of his life to numerous scientific investigations, but
   his brain will continue to be the subject of study for many years to come (Lafee, 2009). Soon
   after his death, Molaison’s preserved brain was in a plastic cooler strapped in a seat on a flight
   from Boston to San Diego; in the next seat was Jacopo Annese, director of the Brain
   Observatory at the University of California at San Diego. After several months of preparation,
   Annese and his colleagues dissected Molaison’s brain into slices as thin as the width of a hair
   (70 µm). The 53-hour, uninterrupted procedure was recorded and live-streamed over the web to
   allow scientific scrutiny and to increase public awareness and engagement (Annese et al., 2014).
   Each slice of HM’s brain was microscopically photographed with such resolution that the data
   from each one would fill 200 DVDs. The data were then combined into a three-dimensional
   reconstruction of the brain, which is available online. Scientists can navigate through it to the
   area of their interest and then zoom in to the level of individual neurons. HM’s memory
   problems made him perhaps the most studied subject in neuroscience. Ironically, the man who
   could not remember will never be forgotten.
   Animals that were given the glutamate-blocking drug at the time of testing
   instead of immediately after training also had impaired recall in the water maze,
   indicating that the hippocampus has a role in retrieval as well as consolidation.
   Researchers have used PET scans to confirm that the hippocampus also retrieves
   memories in humans (D. L. Schacter, Alpert, Savage, Rauch, & Albert, 1996;
   Squire et al., 1992). Figure 12.5 shows increased activity in the hippocampi
   while the research participants recalled words learned during an experiment. The
   involvement of the hippocampus in retrieval seems inconsistent with HM’s
   ability to recall earlier memories. But the memories that patients with
   hippocampal damage can recall are of events that occurred at least two years
   before their brain damage. Many researchers have concluded that the
   hippocampal mechanism plays a time-limited role in consolidation and retrieval,
   a point we will examine shortly. This diminishing role of the hippocampus
   would explain why older memories suffer less than recent memories after
   hippocampal damage.

   Academy of Sciences, USA.
   The prefrontal area is also active during learning and retrieval, and some
   researchers think that it directs the search strategy required for retrieval (Buckner
   & Koutstaal, 1998). Indeed, the prefrontal area is active during effortful attempts
   at retrieval, whereas the hippocampus is activated during successful retrieval
   (see Figure 12.5; D. L. Schacter et al., 1996). We will look at the role of the
   frontal area again when we consider working memory and Korsakoff syndrome.
   We saw in Chapter 5 that rewards such as drugs increase activity in dopamine
   neurons. Because reward plays a crucial role in learning, we might suspect that
   dopamine has some function in learning, and that is indeed the case. Blocking
   dopamine receptors in guinea pigs shortly after learning impairs consolidation
   and memory (K.-N. Lee & Chirwa, 2015), and increasing dopamine levels by
   injecting the dopamine precursor levodopa improves memory in humans
   (Chowdhury, Guitart-Masip, Bunzeck, Dolan, & Düzel, 2012). Novel
   experience, such as exploring an unfamiliar environment, increases dopamine
   activity; placing rats in a novel environment before or after learning improves
   learning (S.-H. Wang, Redondo, & Morris, 2010). In humans, learning can be
   increased by dopamine-enhancing stimulation as simple as viewing novel
   photographs from National Geographic (Fenker, Frey, Schuetze, & Heipertz,
   2008).
   Dopamine-enhancing stimulation is effective whether it occurs before or after
   the learning experience; this is because dopamine directly affects consolidation
   of long-term memory, rather than by improving short-term memory (Lisman,
   Grace, & Duzel, 2011). Dopamine release initiates the synthesis of proteins in
   the postsynaptic neuron. These plasticity-related proteins are necessary for
   consolidation to occur, as we will see later, and drugs that block their synthesis
   inhibit learning (Clopath, 2012).
   Dopamine does not signal rewards so much as it signals errors in prediction.
   Firing increases in dopamine neurons only if the reward is unexpected—either of
   greater value than usual or occurring when it has been infrequent (Schultz,
   2016). If the reward is expected, the firing rate remains the same and it declines
   if the reward is less than expected. In other words, evolution has tailored
   learning specifically to help us cope with changes in our environment and in our
   circumstances.
   Where Memories Are Stored
   The hippocampal area is not the permanent storage site for memories. If it were,
   patients like HM would not remember anything that happened before their
   damage occurred. According to most researchers, the hippocampus stores
   information temporarily in the hippocampal formation; then, over time, a more
   permanent memory is consolidated elsewhere in the brain. A study of mice that
   had learned a spatial discrimination task supported the hypothesis: Over 25 days
   of retention testing, metabolic activity progressively decreased in the
   hippocampus and increased in the cortical areas (Bontempi, Laurent-Demir,
   Destrade, & Jaffard, 1999).
   Is there a place where memories are stored?
   To explore further the relationship between these two areas, Remondes and
   Schuman (2004) severed the pathway that connects CA1 of the hippocampus
   with the cortex. The lesions did not impair the rats’ performance in a water maze
   during training or 24 hours (hr) later, but after 4 weeks the rats had lost their
   memory for the task. The results supported the hypothesis that short-term
   memory depends on the hippocampus but long-term memory requires the cortex
   and an interaction over time between the two. To pin down the window of
   vulnerability of the memory, the researchers lesioned two additional groups of
   animals at different times following training. Those lesioned 24 hr after training
   were impaired in recall four weeks later, but those whose surgery was delayed
   until three weeks after training performed as well as the controls. This
   progression apparently takes longer in humans. Christine Smith and Larry Squire
   (2009) used fMRI to image the brain’s activity while subjects recalled news
   events from the past 30 years. Activity was greatest in the hippocampus and
   related areas as subjects recalled recent events, declined as they recalled events
   as far back as 12 years, and stabilized after that. At the same time, activity
   increased progressively with older memories in the prefrontal, temporal, and
   parietal cortex. So, your brain works rather like your computer when it transfers
   volatile memory from RAM to the hard drive—it just takes a lot longer.
   In Chapter 3, you learned that when Wilder Penfield (1955) stimulated
   association areas in the temporal lobes of surgery patients, he often evoked
   visual and auditory experiences that seemed like memories. We speculated that
   memories might be stored there, and more recent research has supported that
   idea, with memories for sounds activating auditory areas and memories for
   pictures evoking activity in the occipital region (Figure 12.6; M. E. Wheeler,
   Petersen, & Buckner, 2000). You also saw in Chapter 9 that when we learn a
   new language, it is stored near Broca’s area. Naming colors (which requires
   memory) activates temporal lobe areas near where we perceive color; identifying
   pictures of tools activates the hand motor area and an area in the left temporal
   lobe that is also activated by motion and by action words (A. Martin, Haxby,
   Lalonde, Wiggs, & Ungerleider, 1995; A. Martin et al., 1996); and spatial
   memories appear to be stored in the parietal area and verbal memories in the left
   frontal lobe (F. Rösler, Heil, & Henninghausen, 1995). Thus, all memories are
   not stored in a single area, nor is each memory distributed throughout the brain.
   Rather, different memories are in different cortical areas, apparently according to
   where the information they are based on was processed.
   An interesting example is the cells involved in place memory. Place cells, which
   increase their rate of firing when the individual is in a specific location in
   the environment, are found in the hippocampus. Each cell has a place field
   (overlapping somewhat with others), and together these cells form a map of the
   environment. This map develops during the first few minutes of exploration; the
   cells’ fields are then remapped on entering a new environment, but they are
   restored on returning to the original location (Figure 12.7; Guzowski, Knierim,
   & Moser, 2004; M. A. Wilson & McNaughton, 1993). The fields are dependent
   on spatial cues in the environment, including visual, tactile, and even olfactory
   cues (Shapiro, Tanila, & Eichenbaum, 1997). Place cells do more than indicate
   an individual’s current location. For example, they contribute the context of
   location that is so important in memories of events (D. M. Smith & Mizumori,
   2006). They also provide spatial memory required for planning navigation; as
   rats paused at choice points in a maze with which they were well experienced,
   cells with place fields in the alternative sections fired in sequence, as if the rats
   were simulating the two choices (Johnson & Redish, 2007). Functional MRI has
   confirmed that humans have place cells; their activity is so precise that the
   investigators could determine the subject’s “location” in a computer-generated
   virtual environment (Hassabis et al., 2009).

   Two Kinds of Learning
   Learning researchers were in for a revelation when they discovered that HM
   could readily learn some kinds of tasks (Corkin, 1984). One was mirror drawing,
   in which the individual uses a pencil to trace a path around a pattern, relying
   solely on a view of the work surface in a mirror. HM improved in mirror-
   drawing ability over three days of training, and he learned to solve the Tower of
   Hanoi problem (Figure 12.8). But he could not remember learning either task,
   and on each day of practice he denied even having seen the Tower puzzle before
   (N. J. Cohen, Eichenbaum, Deacedo, & Corkin, 1985; Corkin, 1984). What this
   means, researchers realized, is that there are two categories of memory
   processing. Declarative memory involves learning that results in memories of
   facts, people, and events that a person can verbalize or declare. For example,
   you can remember being in class today, where you sat, who was there, and what
   was discussed. Declarative memory includes a variety of subtypes, such as
   episodic memory (events), semantic memory (facts), autobiographical memory
   (information about oneself), and spatial memory (the location of the individual
   and of objects in space). Nondeclarative memory involves memories for
   behaviors; these memories result from procedural or skills learning,
   emotional learning, and stimulus-response conditioning. Learning mirror
   tracing or how to ride a bicycle or solve the Tower of Hanoi problem are
   examples of nondeclarative learning or, more specifically, procedural or skills
   learning; remembering practicing the tasks involves declarative learning.
   Another way of putting it, which is admittedly a bit oversimplified, is that
   declarative memory is informational, while nondeclarative memory is more
   concerned with the control of behavior. Just as we have what and where
   pathways in vision and audition, we have a what and a how in memory.
   What are the two kinds of learning?

   2006, Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 7, pp. 30–40. Nature Publishing
   Group.
   The main reason to distinguish between the two types of learning is that they
   have different origins in the brain; studying them can tell us something about
   how the brain carries out its tasks. For years, it looked like we were limited to
   studying the distinction in the rare human who had brain damage in just the right
   place; hippocampal lesions did not seem to affect learning in rats, so researchers
   thought that rats did not have an equivalent of declarative memory. But it just
   took selecting the right tasks. R. J. McDonald and White (1993) used an
   apparatus called the radial arm maze, a central platform with several arms
   radiating from it (Figure 12.9). Rats with damage to both hippocampi could learn
   the simple conditioning task of going into any lighted arm for food. But if every
   arm was baited with food, the rats could not remember which arms they had
   visited and repeatedly returned to arms where the food had already been eaten.
   Figure 12.8 The Tower of Hanoi Problem.
   Conversely, rats with damage to the striatum could remember which arms they
   had visited but could not learn to enter lighted arms. Because Parkinson’s
   disease and Huntington’s disease damage the basal ganglia (which include the
   striatum), people with these disorders have trouble learning procedural tasks,
   such as mirror tracing or the Tower of Hanoi problem (Gabrieli, 1998).
   Incidentally, the term declarative seems inappropriate with rats; researchers have
   often preferred the term relational memory, which implies that the individual
   must learn relationships among cues, an idea that applies equally well to humans
   and animals.
   Figure 12.9 A Radial Arm Maze.

   You already know that the amygdala is important in emotional behavior, but it
   also has a significant role in nondeclarative emotional learning. Bechara and his
   colleagues (1995) studied a patient with damage to both amygdalae and another
   with damage to both hippocampi. The researchers attempted to condition an
   emotional response in the patients by sounding a loud boat horn when a blue
   slide was presented but not when the slide was another color. The patient with
   amygdala damage reacted emotionally to the loud noise, indicated by increased
   skin conductance responses (see Chapter 8). He could also tell the researchers
   which slide was followed by the loud noise, but the blue slide never evoked a
   skin conductance increase; in other words, conditioning was absent. The patient
   with hippocampal damage showed an emotional response and conditioning, but
   he could not tell the researchers which color the loud sound was paired with.
   This neural distinction between declarative learning and nondeclarative
   emotional learning may well explain how an emotional experience can have a
   long-lasting effect on a person’s behavior even though the person does not
   remember the experience.
   The amygdala has an additional function that cuts across learning types. Both
   positive and negative emotions enhance the memorability of any event; the
   amygdala strengthens even declarative memories about emotional events,
   apparently by increasing activity in the hippocampus. Electrical stimulation of
   the amygdala activates the hippocampus, and it enhances learning of a non-
   emotional task, such as a choice maze (McGaugh, Cahill, & Roozendaal, 1996).
   In humans, memory for both pleasant and aversive emotional material is related
   to the amount of activity in both amygdalae while viewing the material (Cahill et
   al., 1996; Hamann, Ely, Grafton, & Kilts, 1999).
   Working Memory
   The brain stores a tremendous amount of information, but information that is
   merely stored is useless. It must be available, not just when it is being recalled
   into awareness but when the brain needs it for carrying out a task. Working
   memory provides a temporary “register” for information while it is being
   used. Working memory holds a password you just looked up long enough for
   you to type it in; it also holds information retrieved from long-term memory
   while it is integrated with other information for use in problem solving and
   decision making. Without working memory, we could not do long division, plan
   a chess move, or even carry on a conversation.
   Why is working memory important?
   Think of working memory as like the RAM in your computer. The RAM holds
   information temporarily while it is being processed or used, but the information
   is stored elsewhere on the hard drive. But we should not take any analogy too
   far. Working memory has a very limited capacity (with no upgrades available),
   and information in working memory fades within seconds. So, if you make a
   mistake entering the password you just looked up, you’ll probably have to look it
   up again.
   The person recalls in almost photographic detail the total situation at the moment of shock,
   the expression of face, the words uttered, the position, garments, pattern of carpet, recalls
   them years after as though they were the experience of yesterday.
   —G. M. Stratton, 1919
   The delayed match-to-sample task described in Chapter 11 provides an excellent
   means of studying working memory. During the delay period, cells remain active
   in one or more of the association areas in the temporal and parietal lobes,
   depending on the nature of the stimulus (Constantinidis & Steinmetz, 1996;
   Fuster & Jervey, 1981; Miyashita & Chang, 1988). Cells in these areas
   apparently help maintain the memory of the stimulus, but they are not the
   location of working memory. If a distracting stimulus is introduced during the
   delay period, the altered firing in these locations ceases abruptly, but the animals
   are still able to make the correct choice (Constantinidis & Steinmetz, 1996; E. K.
   Miller, Erickson, & Desimone, 1996). Cells in the prefrontal cortex have several
   attributes that make them better candidates as working memory specialists. Not
   only do they increase firing during a delay, but they also maintain the increase
   despite a distracting stimulus (E. K. Miller et al., 1996). Some respond
   selectively to the correct stimulus (di Pellegrino & Wise, 1993; E. K. Miller et
   al.). Others respond to the correct stimulus, but only if it is presented in a
   specific position in the visual field; they apparently integrate information from
   cells that respond only to the stimulus with information from cells that respond
   to the location (Rao, Rainer, & Miller, 1997). Prefrontal damage impairs
   humans’ ability to remember a stimulus during a delay (D’Esposito & Postle,
   1999). All these findings suggest that the prefrontal area plays the major role in
   working memory.
   Although the prefrontal cortex serves as a temporary memory register, its
   function is apparently more than that of a neural blackboard. In Chapters 3 and
   8, you learned that damage to the frontal lobes impairs a person’s ability to
   govern his or her behavior in several ways. Many researchers believe that the
   primary role of the prefrontal cortex in learning is as a central executive. That is,
   it manages certain kinds of behavioral strategies and decision making and
   coordinates activity in the brain areas involved in the perception and response
   functions of a task, all the while directing the neural traffic in working memory
   (Wickelgren, 1997).

   What determines the symptoms and the severity of symptoms of amnesia?
   Describe the two kinds of learning and the related brain structures.
   Working memory contributes to learning and to other functions. How?
   Brain Changes in Learning
   Learning is a form of neural plasticity that changes behavior by remodeling
   neural connections. Specialized neural mechanisms have evolved to make the
   most of this capability. We will look at them in the context of long-term
   potentiation.
   How do neurons change during learning?
   Long-Term Potentiation
   More than 50 years ago, Donald Hebb (1940) stated what has become known as
   the Hebb rule: If an axon of a presynaptic neuron is active while the
   postsynaptic neuron is firing, the synapse between them will be
   strengthened. We saw this principle in action during the development of the
   nervous system, when synaptic strengthening helped determine which neurons
   would survive; some of that plasticity is retained in the mature individual.
   Researchers have long believed that to understand learning as a physiological
   process, they would have to figure out what happens at the level of the neuron
   and, particularly, at the synapse.
   Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of synapses that
   results from the simultaneous activation of presynaptic neurons and
   postsynaptic neurons (Cooke & Bliss, 2006). LTP can be induced in the
   laboratory by stimulating both neurons at the same time, or by stimulating the
   presynaptic neuron adequately to cause the postsynaptic neuron to fire. As you
   can see in Figure 12.10a, the postsynaptic neuron’s response to a test stimulus is
   much stronger following induction of LTP. What is remarkable about LTP is that
   it can last for hours in tissue cultures and months in laboratory animals (Cooke
   & Bliss). LTP has been studied mostly in the hippocampus, but it also occurs in
   several other areas, including the visual, auditory, and motor cortex. So LTP
   appears to be a characteristic of much of neural tissue, at least in the areas most
   likely to be involved in learning.

   Neural functioning requires weakening synapses as well as strengthening them.
   Long-term depression (LTD) is a decrease in the strength of synapses that
   occurs when stimulation of presynaptic neurons is insufficient to activate
   the postsynaptic neurons (Cooke & Bliss, 2006). Potentiation can be depressed
   in a postsynaptic neuron by applying a low-frequency pulse to the presynaptic
   neuron for a few minutes, causing the presynaptic neuron to fire but not the
   postsynaptic neuron (Figure 12.10b). LTD is believed to be the mechanism the
   brain uses to modify memories and to clear old memories to make room for new
   information (Stickgold, Hobson, Fosse, & Fosse, 2001).
   Activity in presynaptic neurons also influences the sensitivity of nearby
   synapses. If a weak synapse and a strong synapse on the same postsynaptic
   neuron are active simultaneously, the weak synapse will be potentiated; this
   effect is called associative long-term potentiation (Figure 12.11). Associative
   LTP is usually studied in isolated brain tissue with artificially created weak and
   strong synapses, but it has important behavioral implications, which is why it
   interests us. Electric shock evokes a strong response in the lateral amygdala,
   where fear is registered, while an auditory stimulus produces only a minimal
   response there. Rogan, Stäubli, and LeDoux (1997) repeatedly paired a tone with
   shock to the feet of rats. Because of this procedure, the tone alone began to
   evoke a significantly increased response in the amygdala, as well as an
   emotional “freezing” response in the rats. You may recognize this scenario as an
   example of classical conditioning; we could easily change the labels in Figure
   12.11 from “Strong synapse” to “Electric shock” and from “Weak synapse” to
   “Auditory tone.” Researchers believe that associative LTP is the basis of
   classical conditioning, and Rogan et al.’s results support that view. LTP, LTD,
   and associative LTP can all be summed up in the expression “Cells that fire
   together wire together.”
   How LTP Happens
   LTP has been studied most often in the neurons connecting CA1 and CA3 of the
   hippocampus, and we will use those findings as our model here without going
   into the variations that occur in other areas of the brain. LTP is induced through a
   cascade of events at the synapse. In CA1 (and in most locations) the
   neurotransmitter involved is glutamate, which is detected by two types of
   receptors: the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic
   acid) receptor and the NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartic acid) receptor. Initially,
   glutamate activates AMPA receptors but not NMDA receptors, because they are
   blocked by magnesium ions (Figure 12.12). During LTP induction, activation of
   the AMPA receptors by the first few pulses of stimulation partially depolarizes
   the membrane, and this dislodges the magnesium ions. The resulting large influx
   of calcium ions activates a host of protein kinases, enzymes that alter or activate
   other proteins (Lüscher & Malenka, 2012). One of the protein kinases, CaMKII
   (calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II) is required for LTP. Mice with two
   mutant, nonfunctioning genes for the alpha form of CaMKII fail to show LTP;
   those with one mutant and one functioning gene do show LTP, but it is not
   consolidated into long-term memory (Figure 12.13; Frankland, O’Brien, Ohno,
   Kirkwood, & Silva, 2001). Several plasticity-related genes are activated as well
   (Kelleher, Govindarajan, & Tonagawa, 2004); they along with newly activated
   proteins begin producing structural changes in the synapse (Lüscher &
   Malenka).

   Within 45–60 minutes after LTP, postsynaptic neurons develop dramatically
   increased numbers of dendritic spines, outgrowths from the dendrites that
   partially bridge the synaptic cleft and make the synapse more sensitive
   (Figure 12.14; N. Toni, Buchs, Nikonenko, Bron, & Muller, 1999). Existing
   spines also enlarge or split down the middle to form two spines (Matsuzaki,
   Honkura, Ellis-Davies, & Kasai, 2004). Another important structural change is
   the appearance of new AMPA receptors, which increase synaptic strength
   (Lüscher & Malenka, 2012). These come from a pool of silent receptors that are
   transported into the spines from within the dendrite; they can recycle between
   the cytoplasm and the membrane or in the other direction within mere tens of
   minutes. A further change that occurs in support of learning is the generation of
   new neurons in the hippocampus; though the rate of neurogenesis is relatively
   low in adults, over the life span new neurons add up to an estimated 10%–20%
   of the population (Jacobs, van Praag, & Gage, 2000). Numerous studies show
   that learning is impaired by blocking neurogenesis and enhanced by increasing
   new cell birth. New neurons are more active than mature ones, have a lower
   threshold for LTP induction, and are better at making fine discriminations, such
   as distinguishing between the contexts in which reward occurs and does not
   occur (Yau, Li, & So, 2015). It also appears that the new neurons contribute to
   the shift in memory from the hippocampus to cortex and interfere with the LTP
   established in the hippocampus to clear the way for new memories (Kitamura &
   Inokuchi, 2014). Blocking neurogenesis with X-radiation prolongs hippocampal
   LTP and delays completion of the transfer to the cortex by as many as 28 days.
   How does the brain grow during learning?
   How do the roles of the hippocampus and the cortex differ?

   Axon Terminal and a Dendrite,” by N. Toni et al., Nature, 402 (6706), pp.
   421–425. Nature Publishing Group.
   With all that growth, you might suspect that there would be some increase in the
   volume of the brain areas that are involved in LTP. In fact, this does happen to
   some extent. London taxi drivers, who are noted for their ability to navigate the
   city’s complex streets entirely from memory, spend about two years learning the
   routes before they can be licensed to operate a cab. Maguire and her colleagues
   (2000) used MRI to scan the brains of 16 drivers. The posterior part of their
   hippocampi, known to be involved in spatial navigation, was larger than in males
   of similar age. (Overall hippocampal volume did not change; their anterior
   hippocampi were smaller.) The difference was greater for cabbies who had been
   driving for the longest time, which we would expect if the difference was caused
   by experience.
   Consolidation and Sleep
   The hippocampus can acquire learning “on the fly” while the event is in
   progress, but a longer time is needed for long-term storage of declarative
   memories in the cortex. Many researchers now believe that the hippocampus
   transfers information to the cortex during times when the hippocampus is less
   occupied, even during sleep (Lisman & Morris, 2001; McClelland,
   McNaughton, & O’Reilly, 1995). During sleep, neurons in the rats’ hippocampus
   and cortical areas repeat the pattern of firing that occurred during learning
   (Louie & Wilson, 2001; Y.-L. Qin, McNaughton, Skaggs, & Barnes, 1997).
   Human EEG and PET studies showed the hippocampus repeatedly activating the
   cortical areas that participated in the daytime learning, and this reactivation was
   accompanied by significant task improvement the next morning without further
   practice (Figure 12.15; Maquet et al., 2000; Wierzynski, Lubenov, Gu, & Siapas,
   2009). Even a daytime nap of around 90 minutes is enough to evoke this kind of
   activity in the hippocampus and improve performance on a word-association test
   (Studte, Bridger, & Mecklinger, 2015). Presumably, “offline” replay provides the
   cortex the opportunity to undergo LTP at the more leisurely pace it requires
   (Lisman & Morris, 2001). During sleep, more than 100 genes increase their
   activity; many of those have been identified as major players in protein
   synthesis, synaptic modification, and memory consolidation (Cirelli, Gutierrez,
   & Tononi, 2004).
   Changing Our Memories
   As hard as the brain works to make memories “permanent,” it is still important
   that these records not be inscribed in stone. Things change; the waterhole we
   learned was reliable over several visits is now becoming progressively more
   stagnant, so we must range in other directions until we find a new source of
   water. And sometimes erroneous learning must be corrected; the first two
   redheads we knew were hot tempered, and it will take meeting additional
   redheads to change what we have learned. A memory needs to be stable to be
   useful, but at the same time it must remain malleable; there are several ways the
   brain accomplishes this.

   855, fig. 2, p. 833. Nature Publishing Group.
   Extinction
   The first is extinction. The experimenter sounds a tone just before delivering a
   puff of air to your eye; after just a few trials, you blink just because you hear the
   tone. This doesn’t happen simply because you understand that the air blast is
   coming; it occurs more quickly than you can make a voluntary response. Then
   the experimenter sounds the tone several times without administering the puff of
   air. Slowly the tone loses its power to make you blink. The memory is not gone;
   if the experimenter repeats the puff of air, you will be back to blinking every
   time you hear the tone. Nor is this an example of forgetting. Rather, extinction
   involves new learning; one indication is that, like LTP, extinction requires
   activation of NMDA receptors, and blocking these receptors eliminates
   extinction (Santini, Muller, & Quirk, 2001).
   Forgetting
   Most memories dissipate at least somewhat over time if they are not used
   frequently. We invariably regard memory loss from forgetting as a defect, but
   researchers are finding clues that the brain actively removes useless information
   to prevent the saturation of synapses with information that is not called up
   regularly or has not made connections with other stored memories. One way the
   brain cleans house apparently involves the enzyme protein phosphatase 1 (PP1),
   a product of the PP1 gene. To study PP1’s effect, researchers created transgenic
   mice (see Chapter 4) with genes for a particularly active form of PP1 inhibitor
   (Genoux et al., 2002). The genes were inducible, which means that the
   researchers could activate them at any time. Mice were trained in a water maze,
   and then the genes were turned on in the transgenic animals; 6 weeks later, the
   control subjects’ memory for the task was completely absent, while the
   transgenic mice had forgotten very little. You may remember from your
   introductory psychology course that for most tasks, spreading out practice
   sessions (distributed practice) leads to better learning than massed practice.
   When the inhibitor genes were turned on during training, this advantage
   disappeared, which suggests that the reason distributed practice is superior is that
   PP1’s effects accumulate over massed practice trials. Another gene involved in
   forgetting is Drac1(V12). Its protein product, Rac, causes memory to decay after
   learning. Interestingly, continued training suppresses Rac, which means that
   additional practice has a dual benefit (Shuai et al., 2010).
   Application: Total Recall
   Source: iStock/michellegibson
   Most of us would like to remember more and forget less. But a few years ago, Jill Price wrote to
   neuropsychologist James McGaugh at the University of California, Irvine, asking for help
   because she couldn’t forget; she can remember what she did and what was happening in the
   world for practically every day of her life, and she is often tormented by bad memories (J.
   Marshall, 2008; E. S. Parker, Cahill, & McGaugh, 2006). Two years later two men with similar
   memory capabilities came forward, but unlike Price, Brad Williams and Rick Baron can keep
   their memories at bay (Elias, 2008; D. S. Martin, 2008). Williams uses his memory in his work
   as a radio news reporter; Baron is unemployed but supports himself in part by winning contests
   that utilize his memory for facts. The researchers are eager to understand what fuels this unusual
   ability, because the knowledge could help the memory impaired. Of the 33 super-memory
   people confirmed by McGaugh’s lab, 11 have undergone MRI scans; these revealed structural
   differences in nine brain areas, as well as greater white matter connections between areas
   (LePort et al., 2012).
   The interesting thing is that these individuals do no better than other people on memorization
   tests; they just don’t suppress their memories once they’re formed. So what might be going on in
   these individuals? One indication is that inadequate inhibition might be involved because they
   show signs of compulsive behavior. Each is a devoted collector—years of TV guides, rare
   record albums, hundreds of TV show tapes—and Baron arranges all the bills in his wallet
   according to the city of the Federal Reserve Bank where they were issued and how the sports
   teams in that city did.
   In The News: Enhancing Soldiers’ Learning With Neurostimulation
   In 2016, the U.S. military began a new project aimed at applying knowledge of how learning
   occurs in the brain in order to improve performance in a variety of tactical areas (DARPA Public
   Affairs, 2017). The Targeted Neuroplasticity Training (TNT) program is funding research at
   several academic institutions to develop invasive and noninvasive methods for coaxing the brain
   to form connections in areas involved in cognitive functioning. Arizona State University
   scientist Stephen Helms Tillery will be using a technology called transdermal electrical
   neuromodulation, a noninvasive method of electrically activating parts of the nervous system by
   stimulating nerves through the skin (B. Wang, 2017). Helms Tillery’s work will focus on
   stimulating the trigeminal nerve to activate a brain nucleus called the locus coeruleus, which
   releases the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Scientists know that norepinephrine is activated as
   part of the “fight or flight” response and people show enhanced sensory functioning as part of
   their response to stress. Participants in Helms Tillery’s studies will receive neuromodulation
   while performing a variety of perceptual and decision-making tasks, with the goal of increasing
   activity in related brain areas and improving performance on these tasks. Eventually, the military
   plans to use trigeminal nerve stimulation to enhance training of marksmen and drone pilots.
   Researchers at other institutions will be stimulating the vagus nerve, either through transdermal
   electrical neuromodulation or using invasive methods, to promote language learning; the
   technique could be useful, for example, in training intelligence experts (DARPA Public Affairs,
   2017). Because military applications of neuroenhancements are controversial, the TNT program
   has funded a workshop on the ethical implications of this and related investigations.
   Thought Questions
   1. How might neuromodulation impact the performance of military personnel in combat or
   noncombat roles?
   2. How can electrical stimulation through the skin be used to activate portions of the brain?
   3. What is one ethical issue that you think should be considered in these types of
   neuroscience applications?

   Efficient memory involves a balance between remembering and forgetting. Later
   in this chapter we will see how devastating memory impairment can be. The
   accompanying Application shows that there is another side to the coin as well.
   Reconsolidation
   Consolidation is a progressive affair extending over a relatively long period of
   time. During that time, the memory is vulnerable to disruption from several
   sources, including electroconvulsive shock and drugs that interfere with protein
   synthesis. In recent years, researchers have come to realize that each time a
   memory is retrieved, it must be reconsolidated, and during that time the memory
   becomes even more vulnerable (Dudai, 2004). For example, Nader, Schafe, and
   LeDoux (2000) conditioned a fear response (freezing) to a tone in mice by
   pairing the tone with electric shock to the feet. The antibiotic anisomycin blocks
   protein synthesis; it will eliminate the fear memory if it is injected shortly after
   learning, but injection 24 hours after training has no effect. However, as many as
   two weeks later, anisomycin eliminated the fear learning if the researchers
   induced retrieval of the memory by presenting the tone again (without the
   shock). You might very well wonder why the brain would give up protection of a
   consolidated memory during retrieval. Apparently, reopening a memory provides
   the opportunity to refine it, correct errors, and modify your emotional response
   to people who rubbed you the wrong way the first time you met them (J. L. C.
   Lee, 2009; McKenzie & Eichenbaum, 2011). Reconsolidation may even have
   therapeutic usefulness. It can be used to eliminate a learned fear response in
   humans, and (as you will see in Chapter 14) could provide an effective tool for
   erasing fear memories in people with posttraumatic stress disorder (D. Schiller et
   al., 2010). Although retrieval makes a memory vulnerable, reconsolidation
   during the labile period apparently strengthens the memory. Rats given several
   brief exposures to the training apparatus during the first few days after they
   learned a shock avoidance task showed no forgetting when tested 55 days after
   training (Inda, Muravieva, & Alberini, 2011).
   Of course, there is no way to guarantee that reconsolidation will always be
   adaptive; the opportunity to correct errors also allows the introduction of new
   errors. We have long known that memories get “reconstructed” over time,
   usually by blending with other memories. Reconstruction can be a progressive
   affair. Evidence suggests that one reason for the “recovery” of false childhood
   memories during therapy may be therapists’ repeated attempts to stimulate recall
   at successive sessions. Laboratory research has shown that people’s agreement
   with memories planted by the experimenter can increase over multiple
   interviews (E. F. Loftus, 1997). In one study, researchers using doctored
   photographs found that after being questioned three times, 50% of subjects were
   describing a childhood ride in a hot air balloon that never happened (Wade,
   Garry, Read, & Lindsay, 2002). More recently, Loftus and her colleagues (D. M.
   Bernstein, Laney, Morris, & Loftus, 2005) were able to shift their subjects’ food
   preferences by giving them a bogus computer analysis of their responses to a
   food questionnaire. For example, in a follow-up questionnaire, about 20% of the
   subjects agreed with the analysis that they had, in fact, been made sick by eating
   strawberry ice cream as children and reported that they would avoid it in the
   future.

   Learning Deficiencies and Disorders
   Learning may be the most complex of human functions. Not surprisingly, it is
   also one of the most frequently impaired. Learning can be compromised by
   accidents and violence that damage the structures we have been studying. But
   more subtle threats to learning ability come from aging and from disorders of the
   brain, including Alzheimer’s disease and Korsakoff syndrome, which we will
   discuss in this section.
   Effects of Aging on Memory
   Old Man: Ah, memory. It’s the second thing to go.
   Young Man: So what’s first?
   Old Man: I forget . . .
   Does the brain age, too?
   You may or may not find humor in this old joke, but declining memory is hardly
   a laughing matter to the elderly. The older person might mislay car keys, forget
   appointments, or leave a pot on the stove for hours. Working memory and the
   ability to retrieve old memories and to make new memories may all be affected
   (Fahle & Daum, 1997; Small, Stern, Tang, & Mayeux, 1999). Although we
   usually associate aging with brain cell loss, significant deficits occur only in the
   midbrain, basal forebrain (lower frontal lobes), and some prefrontal areas. Some
   parts of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus also decline in volume, likely due
   to a decrease in synaptic density. These areas, of course, are critical for learning,
   memory, and cognitive functioning (Mora, 2013).
   Deficits occur at the molecular level as well. One study, for example, examined
   the brains of deceased individuals and found 17 genes in the dentate gyrus of the
   hippocampus that undergo changed levels of expression with aging (Pavlopoulos
   et al., 2013). Downregulation of one of these genes results in less abundant
   production of the protein RbAp48 in humans and mice. This protein turns out to
   be important for memory: Young mice engineered to produce reduced RbAp48
   showed dysfunction in the dentate gyrus and performed like old mice on
   memory tests. In the study described earlier, Genoux and his colleagues (2002)
   found that aged mice were significantly impaired on the learning task after just
   one day without practice, but performance in old mice with the enhanced PP1
   inhibitor genes was still robust four weeks later. If we could find simple, safe
   ways to manipulate gene expression in humans, we could reduce many of the
   burdens of aging.
   Some elderly people seem immune to the effects of aging on learning and
   cognition. Certainly, a part of this is genetic, but there have been many research
   efforts to identify environmental interventions that could benefit the rest of the
   population. Housing animals in an enriched environment reduces age-related
   changes in dendritic branching, neurogenesis, spine density, and cortical
   thickness; physical exercise and calorie restriction have similar effects in
   animals’ brains and, in humans, improve cognitive functioning (Mora, 2013). We
   are beginning to appreciate the value of diet as well; consumption of fruits and
   vegetables containing flavonoids, for example, is associated with better language
   and episodic memory and slower cognitive decline in the elderly (Vauzour,
   2014). In animals, flavonoids have been found to activate cellular learning
   mechanisms, enhance LTP, and increase hippocampal neurogenesis. There have
   been additional attempts to improve memory and general cognitive performance
   in the elderly through training, but these have not met with much success
   (Salthouse, 2006), despite the hype for commercial training programs. There
   could be many reasons for the lack of effect, including how meaningful and
   engaging the training tasks are and the amount of time spent in training. One
   promising effort is the Synapse Project, in which elderly individuals showed
   gains in episodic memory capabilities after spending 16 hours a week for three
   months learning digital photography or quilting, tasks that are both interesting
   and cognitively demanding (D. C. Park et al., 2014).
   Alzheimer’s Disease
   Substantial loss of memory and other cognitive abilities (usually, but not
   necessarily, in the elderly) is referred to as dementia. The most common
   cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease, a disorder characterized by
   progressive brain deterioration and impaired memory and other cognitive
   abilities. Alzheimer’s disease was first described by the neuroanatomist and
   neurologist Alois Alzheimer in 1906, after autopsying the brain of a 56-year-old
   patient with memory problems. Alzheimer’s is primarily a disorder of the aged,
   but it can strike early in life. Of the nearly 5 million people in the United States
   with Alzheimer’s, 4.7 million are over the age of 65 (Hebert, Weuve, Scherr, &
   Evans, 2013). The earliest and most severe symptom is usually impaired
   declarative memory. Initially, the person is indistinguishable from a normally
   aging individual, though the symptoms may start earlier; the person has trouble
   remembering events from the day before, mislays items, forgets names, and must
   search for the right word in a conversation. Later, the person repeats questions
   and tells the same story again during a conversation. As time and the disease
   progress, the person eventually fails to recognize acquaintances and even family
   members. Alzheimer’s disease is not just a learning disorder but a disorder of the
   brain, so ultimately most behaviors suffer. Language, visual-spatial functioning,
   and reasoning are particularly affected, and there are often behavioral problems
   such as aggressiveness and wandering away from home. Alzheimer’s researcher
   Zaven Khachaturian (1997) eloquently described his mother’s decline: “The
   disease quietly loots the brain, nerve cell by nerve cell, like a burglar returning to
   the same house each night” (p. 21). Eventually, Alzheimer’s is fatal; it is the
   sixth leading cause of death in the United States (S. L. Murphy, Xu, &
   Kochanek, 2013).
   The Diseased Brain: Plaques and Tangles
   There are two notable characteristics of the Alzheimer’s brain, though they are
   not unique to the disease. Plaques are clumps of beta amyloid (Aβ), a type of
   protein, that cluster among axon terminals and interfere with neural
   transmission (Figure 12.16a). The main component is Aβ42, so called because
   it is 42 amino acids long; Aβ42 is particularly “sticky,” so it clumps easily to
   form the plaques. In addition, abnormal accumulations of the protein tau
   form neurofibrillary tangles inside neurons; tangles are associated with the
   death of brain cells (Figure 12.16b). Plaques and tangles move through the
   brain in a predictable succession of stages, beginning with the medial cortex and
   progressing to the limbic areas, particularly the hippocampus, and then to the
   neocortex, the outer layers of cortex responsible for our highest functions (H.
   Braak & Braak, 1991). This accounts for the pattern of changing symptoms as
   the disease advances. Recently we’ve learned that this sequence parallels a
   progressive variation in two significant factors in those areas: the relative level
   of expression of inflammatory genes and the balance between proteins that
   promote or inhibit the aggregation (accumulation and clumping) of plaques and
   tangles (Figure 12.17; Freer et al., 2016). Interestingly, this differential
   vulnerability among brain areas was discovered in healthy brains. Studying the
   progress of the disease can be difficult; we don’t get a chance to look at the
   afflicted human brain until the disease is well advanced and, as the Research
   Spotlight explains, the laboratory models have been less than satisfactory.
   What causes Alzheimer’s disease?

   Figure 12.18 compares the brain of a deceased Alzheimer’s patient with a
   normal brain. Notice the decreased size of the gyri and the increased width of the
   sulci in the diseased brain. Internally, enlarged ventricles tell a similar story of
   severe neuron loss. Many of the lesions are in the temporal lobes; because of
   their location, they effectively isolate the hippocampus from its inputs and
   outputs, which partly explains the early memory loss (B. T. Hyman, Van Horsen,
   Damasio, & Barnes, 1984). However, plaques and tangles also attack the frontal
   lobes, accounting for additional memory problems as well as attention and motor
   difficulties. The occipital lobes and parietal lobes may be involved as well;
   disrupted communication between the primary visual area and the visual
   association areas in the parietal and temporal lobes explains the visual deficits
   that plague some Alzheimer’s sufferers.
   Although amyloid plaques have been considered the hallmark of Alzheimer’s
   disease, the number of amyloid deposits is only moderately related to the degree
   of cognitive impairment (Selkoe, 1997), and about 25% of the elderly have
   plaques but suffer no dementia (Mintun et al., 2006). Researchers, however, are
   beginning to distinguish between insoluble forms of amyloid and soluble forms,
   which reach 70-fold higher levels in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s (M.
   E. Larson & Lesné, 2012), and in mice have been linked to memory failure, loss
   of synapses, and failure of LTP in the hippocampus (Gong et al., 2003). More
   recently we have learned that a modified form of tau, called acetylated tau
   (because of an added acetyl group), is particularly important because it depletes
   KIBRA, a protein required for inserting extra receptors into the neuronal
   membrane during learning (Tracy et al., 2016). Increasing KIBRA levels in
   cultured neurons reversed the effects of acetylated tau and restored their ability
   to strengthen connections, suggesting a new therapeutic approach.

   Research Spotlight: Alzheimer’s in a Dish
   Studying Alzheimer’s disease in the laboratory has been difficult because the models used so far
   don’t duplicate the pathology completely. Mice can be genetically engineered to produce the
   amyloid plaques, but not the neurofibrillary tangles; and cultures of neurons from Alzheimer’s
   patients’ brains produce amyloid and tau, but not the plaques and tangles. Researchers at
   Massachusetts General Hospital realized that the two-dimensional liquid cultures used in the
   laboratory are very different from the gelatinous environment of the brain, so they started using
   a three-dimensional gel to grow their cultures; to this they added stem cells that carried two gene
   variants known to cause Alzheimer’s (S. H. Choi et al., 2014). After six weeks, the culture had
   both the typical amyloid and the toxic form of amyloid, and was complete with plaques and
   tangles. When they blocked the formation of plaques, they obtained the first direct evidence that
   plaque formation is a precursor to the development of the synapse-damaging tangles. The
   researchers say that the 3-D culture will allow them to screen hundreds of thousands of potential
   new drugs in a few months’ time.
   Heredity and Environment
   Heredity is an important factor in Alzheimer’s disease. The first clue to a gene
   location came from a comparison of Alzheimer’s with Down syndrome (Lott,
   1982). Down syndrome individuals also have plaques and tangles, and they
   invariably develop Alzheimer’s disease if they live to the age of 50. Because
   Down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome 21, researchers zeroed in on
   that chromosome; there they found mutations in the amyloid precursor protein
   (APP) gene (Goate et al., 1991). When aged mice were genetically engineered
   with an APP mutation that increased plaques, both LTP and spatial learning were
   impaired (Chapman et al., 1999). Three additional genes that influence
   Alzheimer’s had been confirmed by the end of the 1990s; all of those affect
   amyloid production or its deposit in the brain (Selkoe, 1997). As you can see in
   Table 12.1, the genes fall into two classes, those associated with early-onset
   Alzheimer’s disease (often before the age of 60) and one found in patients with
   late-onset Alzheimer’s. The ε4 allele of the APOE gene is particularly interesting
   because it contributes to so many Alzheimer’s cases. It increases risk by three- to
   eightfold and is associated with plaques and tangles, but how it contributes to
   pathology is not well understood. Two studies indicate that carriers without
   dementia have lower cerebral blood flow (Thambisetty, Beason-Held, An, Kraut,
   & Resnick, 2010) and that 2- to 25-month-old children with the allele have
   reduced growth in temporal and parietal areas, which are affected in patients
   with Alzheimer’s (Dean et al., 2014).

   The four genes in the table account for just a little over half the cases of
   Alzheimer’s disease, so there are likely many rare or small-effect genes as well
   as environmental influences. Discovery of additional genes had to await whole-
   genome studies with large numbers of individuals. Such studies have the
   advantage that they allow gene searches without the need for a preconceived
   target area. Prior to 2009, 11 genes had been associated with Alzheimer’s, but a
   whole-genome study of 74,000 individuals was able to add 11 additional gene
   locations (Lambert et al., 2013). Although the genes themselves have not been
   identified yet, genes near the loci are involved in amyloid and tau pathways,
   inflammation, immune response, cell migration, and cellular functions.
   Sources: Marx (1998); Selkoe (1997).
   Genome-wide studies have also made it possible to do broad searches for
   epigenetic changes, and in the past few years the focus has been shifting in that
   direction. A recent study conclusively identified seven genes that were
   differentially methylated in Alzheimer’s patients by taking the unusual step of
   verifying their results in a second group of subjects (De Jager et al., 2014). If we
   could identify the environmental conditions that trigger these changes, then
   preventive measures could reduce the incidence of Alzheimer’s. A meta-analysis
   identified several environmental risks for dementia, including exposure to
   pesticides, fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides; airborne particulate matter;
   second-hand smoke; and electromagnetic fields (Killin, Starr, Shiue, & Russ,
   2016). On the health side, we can add vitamin D deficiency (Killin et al.),
   sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, obesity, smoking, and hypertension (Baumgart et
   al., 2015). In addition, studies with combat soldiers, football players, and boxers
   have established a strong link between traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer’s-
   like brain pathology and dementia (Vincent, Roebuck-Spencer, & Cernich,
   2014). A meta-analysis found a 5-fold increase in Alzheimer’s disease with
   Chlamydophila pneumoniae bacterial infection and a 10-fold increase with
   spirochete infection (Maheshwari & Eslick, 2015). Indeed, there is increasing
   evidence that beta amyloid can be triggered by infection and acts as an
   antimicrobial agent; in the first study in living models, human beta amyloid
   protected human neural cells from Candida infection and roundworms from
   infection by Candida and Salmonella, and significantly extended the survival
   time of mice after Salmonella infection (Kumar et al., 2016).
   Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease
   The Alzheimer’s Association (2017) estimates that the cost of caring for
   Alzheimer’s and other dementia patients in the United States in 2017 will be
   $259 billion. By 2050, the U.S. population is expected to increase by 50%, while
   the number of people over the age of 85 increases sixfold (Bureau of the Census,
   2001). As a result, experts have been predicting that Alzheimer’s rates will
   almost triple (Figure 12.19; Hebert et al., 2013. In the past few years, however,
   at least nine studies have shown a declining risk for Alzheimer’s in the
   wealthiest nations (Langa, 2015), including a 20% drop in the United Kingdom
   (Matthews et al., 2015) and a 26% decrease in the United States (Langa et al.,
   2017). One contributing factor is increasing educational levels (see the
   discussion of the cognitive reserve hypothesis in the next section), and the
   researchers believe that more effective treatment of health risks such as
   cardiovascular disease make up the rest of the difference.
   Five drugs are currently approved for the treatment of Alzheimer’s in the United
   States, but one of those is rarely prescribed due to side effects (Patoine &
   Bilanow, n.d.). Three of the ones in regular use are cholinesterase inhibitors;
   they restore acetylcholine transmission by interfering with the enzyme that
   breaks down acetylcholine at the synapse. Acetylcholine-releasing neurons are
   significant victims of degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease; blocking
   acetylcholine activity impairs learning in humans (Newhouse, Potter, Corwin, &
   Lenox, 1992), and in rats it interferes with learning by eliminating hippocampal
   theta (J. A. Deutsch, 1983), rhythmic neural activity that is necessary for LTP to
   occur. The fourth drug, memantine (marketed in the United States as Namenda),
   was the first approved for use in patients with moderate and severe symptoms.
   Some of the neuron loss in Alzheimer’s occurs when dying neurons trigger the
   release of the excitatory transmitter glutamate; the excess glutamate produces
   excitotoxicity, overstimulating NMDA receptors and killing neurons. Memantine
   limits the neuron’s sensitivity to glutamate, reducing further cell death. Studies
   indicate moderate slowing of deterioration and improvement in symptoms
   (Reisberg et al., 2003; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2003).
   Unfortunately, these drugs provide only modest relief for the memory and
   behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer’s, and they are little or no help when
   degeneration is advanced.
   Figure 12.19 Projected Increases in Alzheimer’s Disease in the United States.
   Source: Based on data from Hebert et al. (2013).
   In their quest for more effective treatments, researchers are mounting efforts on
   three major fronts: removing beta amyloid or blocking its formation, preventing
   tau from forming tangles, and reducing inflammation. However, no new drug has
   been approved by the FDA since 2003, and the disappointments continue to
   accumulate. The failure of two large trials of anti-amyloid antibodies, one of
   which was at the final phase 3 level, has some researchers now thinking that
   once symptoms have appeared the treatment is too late; they are shifting to
   pretreatment in asymptomatic individuals who are at genetic risk (Callaway,
   2012). Similarly, a phase 3 trial attempting to treat inflammation with injections
   of immunoglobulin has come up empty-handed (Weill Cornell Medical College,
   2014). However, the tangle-preventing drug LMTX is now in phase 3 clinical
   trials, after reducing symptom progression by 90% in phase 2 trials (TauRx
   Therapeutics, n.d.).
   Stem cell and gene therapy are obvious treatment possibilities, and although
   work is in the early stages, progress is being made. A Florida stem cell research
   company has a phase 1 human safety trial under way; if nothing else, the
   researchers expect benefits from the anti-inflammatory effects of stem cells
   (Stem Cells Portal, 2017). On the gene therapy front, a Chinese team has
   demonstrated that neural stem cells can be used to deliver RNA to silence the
   gene responsible for the key enzyme in beta amyloid production (Z. Liu et al.,
   2013); in the United States, researchers have increased axonal sprouting among
   degenerating neurons by inserting a gene for nerve growth factor into patients’
   brains (Tuszynski et al., 2015). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
   prevents the death of neurons and stimulates their functioning; individuals
   with the highest levels of BDNF were 33% less likely to develop dementia and
   Alzheimer’s disease than those with the lowest levels (G. Weinstein et al., 2014).
   BDNF is in phase 1 clinical trials; and nerve growth factor (NGF), which has
   similar effects, is in phase 2 trials (Tuszynski & Nagahara, 2016). Researchers
   also continue to focus on removing plaques from the brain. After much promise
   from animal studies and multiple failures with humans, one drug (aducanumab)
   has been successful in reducing both soluble and insoluble beta amyloid and
   slowing cognitive decline; the drug is now in phase 3 trials (Sevigny et al.,
   2016). Another approach showing promise in animals is ultrasound stimulation
   of the brain; it cleared plaques in the brains of mice engineered to duplicate
   some characteristics of Alzheimer’s, apparently by stimulating glia to ingest the
   plaques, resulting in reversal of lost memory capability (Leinenga & Götz,
   2015).
   Detecting Alzheimer’s Disease
   The aging individual dealing with memory problems typically wonders “Am I
   getting Alzheimer’s?” No single test can diagnose Alzheimer’s, but a battery of
   physical, neurological, and cognitive tests can do a reasonably good job, mostly
   by ruling out other forms of dementia that may be more treatable, if not
   reversible. The physician may also order an MRI to look for atrophy in the
   temporal and parietal areas. For many years, patients were told that a definite
   diagnosis could be made only on autopsy, after examining the brain for plaques
   and tangles, but recent advances in PET scanning and measurement of
   biomarkers is changing that. Using new tracers that specifically target plaques,
   PET scans can identify 75%–90% of individuals who are confirmed to have
   Alzheimer’s at the time of autopsy; measuring Aβ42 and tau in the cerebrospinal
   fluid is equally accurate (Fraller, 2013). Biological assessment should lead to
   more appropriate treatment planning by differentiating better between
   Alzheimer’s and other dementias; in addition, it will be possible to monitor
   therapeutic progress, detecting changes before they translate into cognitive
   gains. But because current treatments only slow the progress of Alzheimer’s,
   researchers are interested in detecting the disease well before it is full-blown and
   before irreversible damage has occurred. PET scanning for amyloid predicts
   about one-third of individuals with mild cognitive impairment who will be
   diagnosed with Alzheimer’s during the next several months; among the normal
   elderly, 25% with high amyloid levels are diagnosed within three years, while
   those with low levels have a 98% chance of remaining cognitively stable (Gelosa
   & Brooks, 2012). Biomarkers found in cerebrospinal fluid and blood have
   shown 90%–100% accuracy in predicting progression to Alzheimer’s over the
   next five to six years (De Meyer et al., 2010; Khan & Alkon, 2010; S. Ray et al.,
   2007).
   A study of Roman Catholic sisters that has been going on since 1986 revealed
   cognitive differences as many as five decades before some of them were
   diagnosed with Alzheimer’s (Riley, Snowdon, Desrosiers, & Markesbery, 2005).
   Autobiographical essays were available for 180 of the study participants, written
   when they joined the order at an average age of 22. These were scored for idea
   density, defined as the number of ideas expressed for every 10 words. Almost
   80% of the sisters with the lowest density scores eventually developed
   Alzheimer’s, compared with 10% among those who scored the highest. A
   surprising finding was the number of participants with high density scores and
   no symptoms of Alzheimer’s who had neurofibrillary tangles when they were
   autopsied (Iacono et al., 2009; Riley et al., 2005). Also, the sisters who remained
   healthy were just as likely as the ones with Alzheimer’s to have one or more
   ApoE4 alleles (Riley et al.). So, what protected some of the women from
   Alzheimer’s? This question leads us to the reserve hypothesis.
   Resistance to Alzheimer’s: The Reserve Hypothesis
   According to the reserve hypothesis, individuals with greater cognitive or
   brain capacity can compensate for brain changes due to aging, brain
   damage, or disorders such as Alzheimer’s. There is some evidence for
   compensation in the elderly through brain reserve, either by means of greater
   activation in the network involved or by recruiting other brain areas (reviewed in
   Y. Stern, 2012). However, most studies have focused on cognitive reserve, by
   assessing experiential factors and cognitive capabilities. For example, the risk of
   developing the symptoms of dementia decreases by 46% with higher educational
   and occupational levels and higher IQ and mental activity in earlier life. This
   compensation is an effortful activity; fMRI showed that older people with more
   beta amyloid deposits produced more activation in their brains’ memory areas,
   and they were more accurate in recalling material when they did so (Elman et al.,
   2014). The protection this affords is temporary, however; the delay may last the
   rest of the individual’s life but, if not, decline occurs more rapidly than in other
   Alzheimer’s patients.
   The elderly fare better if they have a history of both mental and physical activity,
   so they are frequently advised to stay active to stave off mental decline.
   However, choosing an active lifestyle may simply be a reflection of general
   fitness, rather than the cause of better cognitive health later; we should be careful
   about assuming cause until we have adequate experimental evidence and, so far,
   the results have been mixed. The most consistently positive results have been
   with exercise; cognitive training has not been very promising, except for
   complex computer games and role-playing games.
   Korsakoff Syndrome
   Another form of dementia is Korsakoff syndrome, brain deterioration that is
   almost always caused by chronic alcoholism. The deterioration results from a
   deficiency in the vitamin thiamine (B1), which has two causes: (1) The alcoholic
   consumes large quantities of calories in the form of alcohol in place of an
   adequate diet, and (2) the alcohol reduces absorption of thiamine in the stomach.
   The most pronounced symptom is anterograde amnesia, but retrograde amnesia
   is also severe; impairment is to declarative memory, while nondeclarative
   memory remains intact. The hippocampus and temporal lobes are unaffected; but
   the mammillary bodies (see Figures 3.20 and 8.4) and the medial part of the
   thalamus are reduced in size, and structural and functional abnormalities occur in
   the frontal lobes (Gebhardt, Naeser, & Butters, 1984; Kopelman, 1995; Squire,
   Amaral, & Press, 1990). A bizarre accident demonstrated that damage limited to
   the thalamic and mammillary areas can cause anterograde amnesia; a 22-year-
   old college student received a penetrating wound to the area when his roommate
   accidentally thrust a toy fencing foil up his left nostril, producing an amnesia
   that primarily affected verbal memory (Squire, Amaral, Zola-Morgan,
   Kritchevsky, & Press, 1989). Thiamine therapy can relieve the symptoms of
   Korsakoff syndrome somewhat if the disorder is not too advanced, but the brain
   damage itself is irreversible.
   What are the symptoms of Korsakoff syndrome?
   Some Korsakoff patients show a particularly interesting characteristic in their
   behavior, called confabulation; they fabricate stories and facts to make up
   for those missing from their memories. Non-Korsakoff amnesiacs also
   confabulate, and so do normal people occasionally when their memory is vague.
   However, Korsakoff patients are champions at this kind of “creative
   remembering,” especially during the volatile early period, when their symptoms
   have just heated up. We will talk about what causes confabulation shortly; in the
   meantime, try to refrain from assuming that confabulation involves intentional
   deception.
   For some, confabulation becomes a way of life. Mary Frances could converse
   fluently about her distant past as a college and high school English teacher and
   recite Shakespeare and poetry that she had written. But, robbed of the memory
   of more recent years by Korsakoff disease, she constantly invented explanations
   for her nursing home surroundings. One time, she was just “visiting” at the
   home, and she watched patiently through the glass front doors for her brother
   who would pick her up shortly for an automobile trip to Florida. Another time,
   she complained that she was stranded in a strange place and needed to get back
   to her “post”; she had in fact been in the army in World War II as a speechwriter
   for General Clark. On another occasion, she thought that she was in prison—
   probably suggested by the real memory that she had been a prisoner of war—and
   she was querying the nurse about what she had “done wrong.”
   Confabulation occurs following damage to a specific area in the frontal lobes
   (Turner, Cipolotti, Yousry, & Shallice, 2008). A Korsakoff patient studied by
   Benson and his colleagues (1996) did poorly on cognitive tests that are sensitive
   to impairment in frontal lobe functioning, and a brain scan showed that activity
   levels were reduced in the frontal area as well as in the diencephalon, the lower
   part of the forebrain that includes the thalamus and hypothalamus. Four months
   later, he had ceased confabulating, and the scan of the frontal area had returned
   to normal; however, his amnesia and deficient diencephalic activity continued.
   Confabulating amnesic patients have more trouble than nonconfabulating
   amnesiacs in suppressing irrelevant information they have learned earlier
   (Schnider & Ptak, 1999). Consequently, Benson and colleagues (1996) suggest
   that confabulation is due to an inability to distinguish between current reality and
   earlier memories. We will take up this topic again in Chapter 15.
   Concept Check
   Take a Minute to Check Your Knowledge and Understanding
   What changes occur in the brain during aging?
   What is the role of plaques and tangles in Alzheimer’s disease?
   How are Alzheimer’s disease and Korsakoff syndrome similar and different?
   In Perspective
   Learning is a form of neural plasticity. However, that simple statement ignores a
   variety of complex features that characterize learning. For example, different
   kinds of learning can be impaired selectively, as we see in patients who can learn
   and yet have no recollection of having learned. Our exploration of learning has
   been an abbreviated one, in part because many mysteries are waiting to be
   solved.
   Despite all we know about the learning process, we have little ability to enhance
   it. Researchers tell us that blueberries can reduce learning deficits in aging rats
   and that wearing a nicotine patch can improve memory, but they can do
   disappointingly little to help the Alzheimer’s patient. Curing learning disorders
   and improving normal learning ability are little more than aspirations today. But
   there is good reason to think the mysteries will be solved eventually, perhaps
   with your help.
   Chapter Summary
   Learning as the Storage of Memories
   Brain damage can cause amnesia by impairing the storage of new memories (anterograde)
   or the retrieval of old memories (retrograde).
   The hippocampus is involved in both consolidation and retrieval. The prefrontal area may
   play an executive role.
   Memories are stored near the area where the information they are based on is processed.
   There are at least two kinds of learning: declarative, mediated by the hippocampus, and
   nondeclarative, which involves the striatum and amygdala.
   Working memory holds new information and information retrieved from storage while it
   is being used.
   Brain Changes in Learning
   LTP increases synaptic strength, and LTD reduces it.
   LTP is necessary for learning; diminishing it impairs learning, and increasing it enhances
   learning.
   The hippocampus manages new declarative memories, but they are transferred later to the
   cortex.
   Changes at the synapse include protein activation and increases in the number of AMPA
   receptors and the number of dendritic spines. Increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus
   appears to aid memory transfer to the cortex.
   Learning Deficiencies and Disorders
   Aging usually involves some impairment of learning and memory, but in the normally
   aging brain, substantial loss of neurons and synapses is limited to a few areas.
   Alzheimer’s disease is a hereditary disorder that impairs learning and other brain
   functions, largely through the destruction of acetylcholine-producing neurons. Plaques
   and tangles are associated with cell death, but evidence they are the cause is not yet clear.
   Treatment usually involves increasing acetylcholine availability, but experimental
   treatments take other approaches.
   Korsakoff syndrome is caused by a vitamin B deficiency resulting from alcoholism.
   Anterograde and retrograde amnesia are effects.

   Some people are calling Cambridge’s theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking the
   most brilliant person living today. Following in Einstein’s footsteps, he has
   developed theories of the origin of the universe that are altering the way
   scientists think. He lectures around the world, mixing high-powered physics with
   a keen sense of humor. He has achieved all this despite having Lou Gehrig’s
   disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS), a degenerative disease that
   impairs voluntary movement. Confined to a wheelchair and able to make only
   small facial movements, he writes and speaks by moving a cursor on the screen
   of a computer equipped with a voice synthesizer (Figure 13.1).

   When we consider people like Hawking, we are forced to wonder what makes
   one person more intelligent than another. Is it genes, upbringing, hard work, or
   opportunity? And is the ultra-intelligent brain in some way different?
   Unfortunately, we have a problem with the presumption of who is smarter. Is
   Hawking more intelligent than Einstein, or has he just had the advantage of more
   predecessors’ accomplishments to build on? Is Marilyn vos Savant smarter than
   her husband because at the age of 10 she made the highest score recorded on an
   intelligence test (Yam, 1998) while he had trouble testing well enough to get into
   medical school, or is he smarter because he invented the Jarvik artificial heart?
   We cannot attempt to understand the biological bases of intelligence without
   having some appreciation of our limitations in measuring it or even defining
   what it is.
   The Nature of Intelligence
   There are many ideas about what intelligence is, which is the first clue that we
   don’t have consensus about what it is. Most definitions say something to the
   effect that intelligence is the ability to reason, to understand, and to profit
   from experience. That is what we think intelligence is; the problem comes when
   we try to translate that abstract definition into the behaviors that would indicate
   the presence of intelligence. That is what we must do to measure intelligence,
   which is the first step toward determining its biological basis.

   What Does “Intelligence” Mean?
   Understanding how we measure intelligence is important because we are in
   effect defining intelligence as what that test measures. The measure of
   intelligence is typically expressed as the intelligence quotient (IQ). The term
   originated with the scoring on early intelligence tests designed for use with
   children. The tests produced a score in the form of a mental age, which was
   divided by the child’s chronological age and multiplied by 100. The tests were
   designed to produce a score of 100 for a child performing at the average for his
   or her chronological age. The scoring is completely different now, partly because
   the tests were extended to adults, who do not increase consistently in intellectual
   performance from year to year. The base score is still 100, a value selected
   arbitrarily and preserved artificially by occasional adjustments to compensate for
   any drift in performance in the population. Most people are near the average, as
   Figure 13.2 shows, with relatively few people at either of the extremes. For
   example, only 2% of the population score above 130 points or below 70 points.
   The first intelligence test was devised by Alfred Binet in 1905, to identify
   French schoolchildren who needed special instruction (Binet & Simon, 1905).
   Predicting school performance is still what most intelligence tests do best, and
   intelligence tests have found their greatest use in the school setting. The
   correlation between IQ scores and school grades typically falls in the range of
   .40 to .60 (Kline, 1991). (If you’ve forgotten what a correlation coefficient
   means, see pages 112–113.) However, IQ is also related to job performance,
   income, and socioeconomic level and, negatively, to juvenile delinquency
   (Neisser et al., 1996).
   How meaningful are IQ scores?
   Critics believe that scores on traditional intelligence tests are closely related to
   academic performance and to higher socioeconomic levels mostly because the
   tests were designed to reflect that kind of success. According to these critics, the
   tests overemphasize verbal ability, education, and Western culture. A few tests
   are designed to be culture-free, like the Raven Progressive Matrices (Raven,
   2003). These tests are mostly nonverbal, and the tasks require no experience
   with a particular culture. They have an obvious advantage for testing people
   from a very different culture or language background or with impaired
   understanding of language. Some researchers also believe that these tests give
   them a better representation of “pure” intelligence.
   Claiming that true intelligence is much more than what the tests measure, these
   critics often point to instances where practical intelligence or “street smarts” is
   greater than conventional intelligence. For example, as young Brazilian street
   vendors conducted their business, they were adept at performing calculations
   that they were unable to perform in a classroom setting (Carraher, Carraher, &
   Schliemman, 1985). In another study, expert racetrack gamblers used a highly
   complex algorithm involving seven variables to predict racetrack odds, but their
   performance was unrelated to their IQ; in fact, four of them had IQs in the low to
   mid-80s (Ceci & Liker, 1986). More recently, Robert Sternberg (2000) compared
   the scores that the presidential candidates George W. Bush, Al Gore, and Bill
   Bradley made on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) when
   they applied for college; the SAT has many items similar to those on
   conventional intelligence tests. Two of the candidates scored above average for
   college applicants but not markedly so, and one had a score that was below
   average. To Sternberg, their success raises questions about the narrowness of
   what intelligence tests measure.

   Sternberg (1988) argues that intelligence does not exist in the sense we usually
   conceive of it but is “a cultural invention to account for the fact that some people
   are able to succeed in their environment better than others” (p. 71). Perhaps
   intelligence is, like the mind, just a convenient abstraction we invented to
   describe a group of processes. If so, we should not expect to find intelligence
   residing in a single brain location or even in a neatly defined network of brain
   structures. And to the extent we find processes or structures that are directly
   involved in intelligence, their performance may not be highly correlated with
   scores on traditional intelligence tests.
   The Structure of Intelligence
   Another controversy that is critical to a biological understanding of intelligence
   is whether intelligence is a single capability or a collection of several
   independent abilities. Intelligence theorists tend to fall into one of two groups,
   lumpers or splitters. Lumpers claim that intelligence is a single, unitary
   capability, which is usually called the general factor, or simply g. General factor
   theorists admit that there are separate abilities that vary somewhat in strength in
   an individual, but they place much greater weight on the underlying g factor.
   They point out that a person who is high in one cognitive skill is usually high in
   others, so they believe that a measure of g is adequate by itself to describe a
   person’s intellectual ability. General intelligence is sometimes assessed by the
   overall IQ score from a traditional intelligence test, such as the Wechsler Adult
   Intelligence Scale, whose 11 subtests measure more specific abilities. But many
   g theorists prefer to use other tests like the Raven Progressive Matrices, because
   they emphasize reasoning and problem solving and are relatively freer of
   influence from specific abilities such as verbal skills.
   Splitters, by contrast, hold that intelligence is made up of several mental abilities
   that are more or less independent of each other. Therefore, they are more
   interested in scores on the subtests of standard IQ tests or scores from tests of
   specific cognitive abilities. They may agree that there is a general factor, but
   they give more emphasis to separate abilities and to differences among them in
   an individual. An accurate description of a person’s intelligence would require
   the scores on all the subtests of these abilities. These theorists point to cases of
   brain damage in which one capability is impaired without affecting others and to
   the savant’s exceptional ability in a single area. Splitters disagree with each
   other, though, on how many abilities there are; a review of intelligence tests
   identified more than 70 different abilities that can be measured by available tests
   (Carroll, 1993).

   Take a Minute to Check Your Knowledge and Understanding
   What do IQ scores tell us, and not tell us, about a person’s capabilities?
   What difference does it make to our search for a biological basis for intelligence whether
   intelligence is a “real” entity or an invented concept?
   What is the lumper–splitter controversy?
   The Biological Origins of Intelligence
   With this background, we are now ready to explore the origins of intelligence.
   Based on our introduction, we will avoid two popular assumptions—that
   intelligence tests are the only way to define intelligence and that intelligence is a
   single entity. Instead, we will consider performance and achievement as
   additional indicators of intelligence, and we will first examine the evidence of a
   biological basis for a general factor and then consider the relationship between
   brain structures and individual abilities.
   The Brain and Intelligence
   Is a more intelligent brain different in any identifiable way from other brains?
   Anyone asking this question would naturally wonder how Albert Einstein’s brain
   was different from other people’s. Fortunately, the famous scientist’s brain was
   preserved, and it has been made available from time to time to neuroscientists
   (Figure 13.3). In cursory examinations, it turned out to be remarkably
   unremarkable. In fact, at 1,230 grams (g) it was almost 200 g lighter than the
   average weight of the control brains (Witelson, Kigar, & Harvey, 1999). The
   number of neurons did not differ from normal, and studies have disagreed about
   whether the neurons were more densely packed or the cortex was thinner,
   perhaps because the samples were taken from different locations (B. Anderson &
   Harvey, 1996; Kigar, Witelson, Glezer, & Harvey, 1997). One study found a
   higher ratio of glial cells to neurons in the left parietal lobe (M. C. Diamond,
   Scheibel, Murphy, & Harvey, 1985). The comparison brains averaged 12 years
   younger than Einstein’s at the time of death, and we know that glial cells
   continue proliferating throughout life (T. Hines, 1998), but the number of glial
   cells was not elevated in Einstein’s right parietal lobe or in either frontal sample.
   Each of Einstein’s hemispheres was a full centimeter wider than those of control
   brains, due to larger parietal lobes (Witelson et al., 1999), and there were
   intriguing variations in some of the parietal gyri (Falk, 2009). These anomalies
   are interesting because the parietal lobes are involved in mathematical ability
   and visual-spatial processing, and Einstein reported that he performed his
   mathematical thinking not in words but in images. Remember, though, that in
   Chapter 12 we saw that London taxi drivers have enlarged posterior hippocampi,
   and no one has suggested that large hippocampi explain why they became taxi
   drivers. In fact, a later follow-up study found that drivers who qualified at the
   end of their training increased in hippocampal volume, but drivers who failed to
   qualify did not (Woollett & Maguire, 2011). Whether Einstein’s large parietal
   lobes or intense mathematical activity came first is uncertain (assuming they are
   related).
   How are intelligent brains different?
   The contrast between the popular estimate of my powers and achievements compared to the
   reality is simply grotesque.

   Exceptional Brain of Albert Einstein,” by Witelson, S. F., Kigar, D. L., &
   Harvey, T. The Lancet, 353(9170), 2149–2153.
   It is interesting that the strongest finding in the examination of Einstein’s brain
   seems to be related to a specific ability rather than to overall intelligence. British
   researcher John Duncan and his colleagues (2000) sought the location of general
   intelligence in the brains of more ordinary folk. They used tasks that required
   reasoning and that are known to correlate with general intelligence more than
   with any specific ability. Although verbal and spatial tasks had different patterns
   of activation, prefrontal activation was common to both tasks; the authors
   concluded that general intelligence may be located there. But general
   intelligence is likely more complex than what happens in one area of the brain. A
   team of researchers scanned the brains of 241 individuals with brain damage and
   correlated the location of their lesions with their scores on a set of intelligence
   subtests chosen to measure g (Gläscher et al., 2010). They found that g requires
   a distributed system, a network that spans the frontal, parietal, and temporal
   lobes (Figure 13.4). They concluded that g involves the brain’s ability to pull
   together different kinds of processing, such as visual-spatial processing and
   working memory. The ability to integrate these functions depends on the quality
   of connections between the areas, which is highly heritable, up to 84% in some
   parts of the brain (Chiang et al., 2009).
   Words and language . . . do not seem to play any part in my thought processes.
   —Albert Einstein
   Brain Size
   Popular wisdom is that smart people have bigger brains, and that is true—to an
   extent, at least. A meta-analysis of 88 studies including more than 8,000
   individuals found a correlation between intelligence and brain size of .24
   (Pietschnig, Penke, Wicherts, Zeiler, & Voracek, 2015). This means that
   variations in brain size account for about 6% (0.24 2 ) of people’s differences in
   intelligence. And lest we give too much importance to brain size, Einstein’s
   1,230-gram brain was a bit more than 100 g under the average for a male of his
   age (Harrison, Freemantle, & Geddes, 2003). Nevertheless, brain size is a factor
   in intelligence, but we can’t generalize this across species; elephants have much
   larger brains, and not many people think elephants are smarter than we are. More
   important than brain size is our compact primate neural organization that packs
   more neurons into a smaller space; on top of that, we have the largest brains of
   all the primates and, so far as we know, the largest number of neurons
   (Pietschnig et al.).
   But if brain size accounts for just 6% of our differences in intelligence, then
   other factors must be more important. Men’s brains are 11% larger on average
   than women’s, yet men and women score equally on intelligence tests. Men may
   have a size advantage, but women apparently compensate with a different
   structural organization. They have a greater ratio of gray matter to white matter
   than do men (Haier, Jung, Yeo, Head, & Alkire, 2005), which increases their
   number of neurons. Women also have stronger connections between the
   hemispheres and more complex convolutions, and they rely on different parts of
   the brain than men to achieve comparable results in intelligence testing
   (Pietschnig et al.).
   Gray matter and white matter volumes are more specific measures than overall
   size of the brain, and both are predictive of intelligence. The correlation of gray
   matter volume with IQ has been measured at .37 (Narr et al., 2007); in men, the
   correlation is strongest in the frontal and parietal lobes, whereas women show
   the strongest gray matter relationship in frontal areas, including Broca’s area
   (Haier et al., 2005). White matter volume, which indicates the extent of
   connectivity within the brain, has a correlation of .26; variations in white matter
   volume are more important for women’s cognitive performance than for men’s
   (Figure 13.5). Note in Figure 13.5 that the widespread distribution of significant
   areas suggests that intellectual ability depends on a broad network of neural
   structures.

   Processing Speed and Efficiency
   Cognitive processes require the person to apprehend, select, and attend to
   meaningful items from a welter of stimuli arriving at the sensory organs. Then
   the person must retrieve information from memory, relate the new information to
   it, and then manipulate the mental representation of the combined information.
   All of this takes time. Back in 1883, when there were no intelligence tests, Sir
   Francis Galton attempted to relate measures of intellectual achievement like
   course grades and occupational status to people’s reaction times, but he couldn’t
   find a relationship. Later researchers have shown that IQ scores are correlated
   with reaction time and, even more so, with nerve conduction velocity (Figure
   13.6; T. E. Reed & Jensen, 1992). Neural conduction speed depends on the
   integrity of the white matter tracts; white matter integrity is correlated with
   intelligence and explains 10% of the variance (Penke et al., 2012). White matter
   integrity declines with age, and intelligence along with it (Bennett & Madden,
   2014). Faster nerve conduction may make its contribution through improved
   processing efficiency.
   White matter integrity and nerve conduction velocity are vital in determining
   how well information travels throughout the brain. One of the most important
   contributors to both and, therefore, to transmission efficiency is myelination,
   which increases conduction speed and protects against “cross-talk” between
   neurons. Humans have a greater proportion of white matter (myelinated
   processes) to gray matter than other animals, and IQ varies among individuals
   with the degree of myelination (Willerman, Schultz, Rutledge, & Bigler, 1994).
   In addition, myelination, speed of information processing, and intelligence all
   follow a curvilinear time path, increasing from childhood to maturity and then
   declining in old age.
   One indicator of the role of brain efficiency in intelligence is that individuals
   who are higher in IQ use less brain energy. This was indicated by a lower rate of
   glucose metabolism during a challenging task, playing the computer game Tetris
   (Haier, Siegel, Tang, Abel, & Buchsbaum, 1992). And, as you can see in Figure
   13.7, individuals with mild intellectual disability (IQs between 50 and 70)
   require 20% more neural activity to perform an attention-demanding task than
   do individuals with IQs of 115 or higher (Haier et al., 1995). You might think the
   more intelligent brain would be the more active one during a task, but remember
   that we are talking about efficiency.
   Improved technology, particularly the availability of diffusion tensor imaging,
   has shifted the conversation toward brain networks and network efficiency. After
   reviewing 37 imaging studies related to intelligence, Rex Jung and Richard
   Haier (2007) proposed the Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT).
   According to their theory, information processing takes place in four stages,
   primarily in the parietal and frontal lobes: (1) After sensory information has been
   processed in secondary areas, it is passed on to (2) parietal areas, which abstract
   the information and integrate it, and then (3) these areas interact with frontal
   areas in problem solving and evaluation. (4) Finally, the anterior cingulate cortex
   selects the response and inhibits alternative responses. Subsequent studies have
   lent support to the theory, identifying these areas as central to intelligence and
   the parietal cortex as the main hub (Langer et al., 2012; Y. Li et al., 2009). In
   addition, the brains of more intelligent individuals were more efficient, with
   more numerous interconnections within clusters of neural activity and shorter
   paths between clusters.

   Specific Abilities and the Brain
   Brain size, speed, and efficiency can reasonably be viewed as contributors to
   general intelligence; now we will consider evidence for individual components
   of intelligence. The statistical method called factor analysis has been useful in
   identifying possible components. The procedure involves giving a group of
   people several tests that measure cognitive abilities that might be related to
   intelligence; the tests may be intelligence tests, or they may be measures of more
   limited abilities such as verbal skills or reaction time. Then correlations are
   calculated among all combinations of the tests to locate “clusters” of abilities
   that are more closely related with each other than with the others. Performance
   on practically all tests of cognitive ability is somewhat related, which is
   consistent with the hypothesis of a general factor. However, factor analysis has
   also identified clusters of more specific abilities. Three capabilities have
   emerged frequently as major components of intelligence: linguistic, logical-
   mathematical, and spatial (A. R. Jensen, 1998).
   Figure 13.7 Greater Efficiency in the More Intelligent Brain.
   Source: From “Brain Size and Cerebral Glucose Metabolic Rate in
   Nonspecific Mental Retardation and Down Syndrome,” by R. J. Haier et al.,
   1995, Intelligence, 20, pp. 191–210.
   Several authors have argued that each of the cognitive abilities depends on a
   complex network or module in the brain that has evolved in ways that support
   that function. In other words, they believe that the brain is hardwired for
   functions like mathematics and language (Dehaene, 1997; Pinker, 1994). We
   have already seen examples of modular functions in earlier chapters; for
   example, the language (linguistic) module is made up of a network of structures
   located mainly in the left frontal and temporal lobes (see Chapter 9). Spatial
   ability depends mostly on functions in the parietal lobes. An MRI study at the
   University of Iowa revealed structural differences related to male spatial
   superiority on the Mental Rotations Test, a standard measure of spatial ability
   (Koscik et al., 2009). Women in the study had greater gray matter volume
   (relative to white matter) in the parietal lobes, but this was correlated with poorer
   spatial performance. Men, by contrast, had greater cortical surface area in the
   parietal lobes (after correction for brain size), and this was correlated with better
   performance. Previous work has indicated that greater cortical surface area
   translates to a larger number of neurons.
   Are there separate components of intelligence?
   Mathematical ability in humans depends on the prefrontal cortex and the parietal
   cortex. That fact by itself makes no distinction between mathematical ability and
   general intelligence; most likely the distinction lies in specifics of the
   interconnections and how the brain can recruit activity in the structures. For
   example, subjects who performed better on tests of basic arithmetic had greater
   cross-connection activity between the two parietal lobes during problem solving
   (J. Park, Park, & Polk, 2012). In addition, the areas are activated selectively
   according to the task and progressively as difficulty increases. The left prefrontal
   cortex is most active when an individual performs calculations from memory,
   such as 2 × 4 and 2 + 4; the area is probably the storage site of arithmetic facts.
   Both parietal areas come into play during estimation of values (Figure 13.8a;
   Dehaene, Spelke, Pinel, Stanescu, & Tsivkin, 1999); this makes sense, because
   visual-spatial representations of quantity, such as finger counting and the
   “number line,” are an almost universal stage in learning exact calculation.
   Calculation recruits both left and right prefrontal areas and both parietal cortices;
   activation increases further in the parietal lobes with increasing difficulty
   (incorporating an additional step to the calculation), and in the prefrontal areas
   as speed demands increase (Figure 13.8b; Menon, Rivera, White, Glover, &
   Reiss, 2000). Studies of brain damage support these conclusions. Individuals
   with damage to the left frontal language area can arrange numbers in rank order
   and estimate results, but they cannot perform precise calculations; those with
   parietal damage are impaired in the opposite direction (Butterworth, 1999;
   Dehaene & Cohen, 1997). Katherine Keller and Vinod Menon (2009) also
   observed frontal and parietal activation as their subjects did multistep mental
   arithmetic; but they also looked at the occipital areas and found activation there,
   demonstrating that people recruit additional resources as needed (in this case,
   visualization; Figure 13.8c). Four clusters in the right hemisphere were more
   activated in men than in women, but this did not translate to greater calculation
   accuracy; so, although brain differences sometimes result in performance
   differences, once again we see evidence of males and females using different
   brain strategies to achieve comparable results.

   Obviously, neither of these areas is dedicated exclusively to numeric functions.
   This is consistent with the suggestion in Chapter 9 that the language areas may
   simply use processing strategies that make them particularly suited to the
   demands of the task, rather than being dedicated to language processing.
   However, Wynn (1998) argues that the brain has a specialized mechanism for
   numbers by pointing to evidence that even infants and lower primates seem to
   have an inborn ability to estimate quantities. The infants she studied saw two
   objects placed one at a time behind a screen. They acted surprised—which
   means that they looked for a longer time—when the screen was removed to
   reveal three objects or only one object instead of the expected two (Wynn,
   1992). Rhesus monkeys tested in the wild responded to the task the same way
   (Hauser, MacNeilage, & Ware, 1996). Monkeys can rank-order groups of objects
   that differ in number by touching their images on a computer monitor in the
   correct order (Brannon & Terrace, 1998), and chimpanzees have learned to do
   the same with numerals (Kawai & Matsuzawa, 2000). The accompanying
   Research Spotlight offers some additional insight into animal intelligence.
   Research Spotlight: We Aren’t the Only Tool Users
   Source: Ingo Arndt/Minden Pictures/Getty.
   Humans have been fascinated with how intelligent animals’ behavior can seem. Termites build
   earthen mounds that are so well ventilated they stay cool under the African sun. Dolphins
   cooperate with each other to herd schools of fish into their pod mates’ waiting mouths. Kanzi
   communicates with symbols, Alex mastered simple concepts (see Chapter 9), and monkeys and
   chimpanzees can “count.”
   Especially intriguing is the concept of tool use. Chimpanzees have long been known to “fish”
   for termites by punching a hole in the nest and inserting a small green twig that the termites
   climb onto in defense of the nest, only to be slurped up by the chimp (Figure a; Holden, 2004b).
   Congo chimps add a unique twist: They fray the end of the twig, enabling them to pick up 20
   times as many termites (Sanz, Cali, & Morgan, 2009).
   New Caledonian and Hawaiian crows cut and shape twigs and use them to extract food from
   crevices, and they have been observed to spontaneously shape wire into hooks to retrieve food
   (Rutz et al., 2016; Weir, Chappell, & Kacelnik, 2002). But Santino, a chimp in a Swedish zoo
   (Osvath, 2009), may demonstrate the greatest ingenuity. Santino occasionally threw stones at
   visitors, but zookeepers weren’t concerned because there was so little ammunition on his island.
   Then stone throwing increased dramatically, so a caretaker watched to figure out where the
   stones were coming from. Each morning, Santino retrieved stones from the moat and placed
   them strategically for launching at the visitors. He was also seen dislodging chunks of concrete
   from a wall, after first tapping where there were cracks and listening for the hollow sound that
   meant a piece was loose enough to be removed.

   Uniquely Human Features,” by R. Peeters et al., 2009, Journal of Neuroscience, 29, pp. 11523–
   11539.
   So what do these research observations tell us? First, animals are more intelligent than we’ve
   given them credit for. Second, some of our capabilities aren’t unique after all. But we also have
   a chance to discover where we are truly different. For example, watching someone retrieve an
   object with the hand activates mirror neurons that are similarly located in humans and in
   monkeys (Peeters et al., 2009). However, when a human sees the object being retrieved with a
   tool, an additional area is activated in the anterior parietal lobe (Figure b); yet no such area for
   tool use showed up in the monkeys, even the ones that were trained for three to six weeks to use
   the same tools. Apparently we have developed some additional specialized structures, either
   through evolution or individual experience.
   An impartial observer would have to say that there is evidence for characteristics
   that contribute to an overall intelligence and for somewhat independent
   capabilities as well. An either–or stance is not justified now; it makes sense to
   continue the two-pronged approach of looking for biological bases for both
   general intellectual ability and separate capabilities.
   Heredity and Environment
   We saw in Chapter 1 that intelligence is the most investigated of the genetically
   influenced behaviors. Our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of
   intelligence hardly lives up to the amount of effort, however; this is because
   intelligence is so complex and poorly understood itself and because many genes
   are involved. In addition, environment accounts for half of the differences
   among us in intelligence, yet the environmental influences have themselves not
   been clearly identified (Plomin, 1990).

   Heritability of Intelligence
   Figure 13.9 shows the IQ correlations among relatives, averaged from many
   studies and several thousand people. You can see that IQ is more similar in
   people who are more closely related (T. J. Bouchard & McGue, 1981).
   Separating family members early in life does not eliminate the correlation; in
   fact, identical twins reared apart are still more similar in IQ than are fraternal
   twins reared together. Interestingly, the relative influence of heredity increases
   with age, from 41% in childhood to 55% in adolescence and 66% in adulthood
   (Haworth et al., 2009). Intuition tells us that environment should progressively
   overtake genetic effects as siblings go their separate ways and their experiences
   diverge, but J. R. Gray and Thompson (2004) suggest that the genes that
   influence intelligence also influence the individual’s choices of environment and
   experience.
   Which is more important, heredity or environment?
   Researchers have documented genetic influence on several of the functions that
   contribute to intelligence, including working memory, processing speed, and
   reaction time in making a choice (Ando, Ono, & Wright, 2001; Luciano et al.,
   2001; Posthuma, de Geus, & Boomsma, 2001). Most of the differences among
   individuals in the major structural contributors to intelligence are accounted for
   by genetic factors; estimated heritabilities in one twin study were 90% for brain
   volume, 82% for gray matter, and 88% for white matter (Figure 13.10; Baaré et
   al., 2001). General intelligence has higher heritability than more specific
   abilities, such as verbal and spatial abilities (McClearn et al., 1997), which is an
   additional argument for a stronger biological basis for g (J. R. Gray &
   Thompson, 2004).
   Locating the specific genes is another matter. Two genes that have received
   special interest underwent accelerated evolution following our separation from
   chimpanzees. The ASPM gene is a major determinant of brain size (J. Zhang,
   2003), while the PACAP precursor gene plays a role in neurogenesis and neural
   signaling and may have contributed to the formation of human cognitive abilities
   (Y. Wang et al., 2005). But the search for genes has been fraught with one
   replication failure after another. One reason is that effect sizes for individual
   genes are small, on the order of around 1%, which means that unless samples are
   very large, the genes will be missed. However, small samples often yield false
   positives that don’t hold up on further scrutiny. Recently, a large consortium of
   researchers has been combining genetic data with brain scanning to locate genes
   responsible for the structural foundations of intelligence. One of these studies
   has identified a genetic variant associated with brain size (the C allele of
   rs10784502; its possessors scored on average 1.29 points higher on IQ tests, and
   having two of the C alleles doubled the gain; J. L. Stein et al., 2012). A second
   study identified 24 genetic variations on six genes, which were related to the
   structural integrity of major brain pathways; some of these were associated with
   intelligence, and individuals with multiple of these variants scored several points
   higher than others on intelligence tests (Chiang et al., 2012). Another group
   identified a gene linking cortical thickness to intelligence; individuals with a
   particular variant had a thinner cortex in the left hemisphere and performed less
   well on intelligence tests (Desrivières et al., 2014). This variant, however,
   accounted for only 0.5% of the variation in IQ.

   Group.
   The Genetic Controversy
   The conclusion that intelligence is highly heritable has not been greeted with
   unquestioning acceptance. The heritability of intelligence is controversial on a
   variety of fronts; these controversies illustrate both the pervasive
   misunderstanding of genetic influence and the difficulty in resolving questions
   of heredity. Critics fear that inheritance of intelligence implies that intelligence is
   inborn and unchangeable (Weinberg, 1989). Nothing could be further from the
   truth, however; as Weinberg points out, genes do not fix behavior but set a range
   within which the person may vary. By way of illustration, height is about 90%
   heritable (Plomin, 1990), yet the average height has increased dramatically over
   the past few decades, due to improved nutrition. Similarly, IQ scores increased at
   the rate of 5–25 points over just a generation (termed the Flynn effect; Flynn,
   1987), so test constructors have been adjusting the test norms occasionally to
   maintain an average of 100 points. Although the environmental causes have not
   been identified, such rapid increases cannot be due to genetic changes. However,
   we know that the world is a much more stimulating, information-filled place and
   education has changed dramatically; and, as Flynn points out, in 1900 the
   median year of schooling was 6 years, compared with 13 years now, and schools
   taught by memorization and recitation (Flynn, te Nijenhuis, & Metzen, 2014).
   Some researchers argue that the correlation of IQ among relatives does not mean
   that intelligence is inherited. They suggest, for example, that identical twins’
   similarity in appearance and personality lead others to treat them similarly, even
   when they are reared apart, and this similar treatment results in similar
   intellectual development. Although physical features and behavior do affect how
   others react to a child, there is little evidence that these responses in turn
   influence intelligence. To test this possibility, researchers compared the IQs of
   twins who had been either correctly or incorrectly perceived by their parents as
   fraternal or identical. If similar environmental treatment accounts for IQ
   similarity, then the parents’ perception of their twins’ classification should be
   more important than the twins’ actual genetic classification. Instead, the studies
   showed that only the true genetic relationship influenced IQ similarity in the
   twins, not the parents’ perception (Scarr & Carter-Saltzman, 1982).
   In another controversy, a debate has raged since the 1930s over whether IQ
   differences between ethnic groups are genetically based. The question is not
   whether the ethnic groups differ in IQ scores, but how much the differences are
   due to heredity and to environment. Arthur Jensen (1969) has argued that
   environment and socioeconomic differences are inadequate to account for the
   observed IQ differences among groups. He and Philippe Rushton cite studies
   indicating that IQ differences are consistent around the world, with East Asians
   averaging 106 points whether in the United States or in Asia, Whites about 100,
   and African Americans at 85 and sub-Saharan Africans around 70 (Rushton &
   Jensen, 2005). In addition, they say that the IQ gaps correspond to differences in
   brain size. Their position has practical as well as theoretical implications. For
   example, extreme hereditarians believe that intervention efforts like Head Start
   not only do not work but also cannot work.
   Other intelligence researchers countered that Jensen and Rushton ignored or
   misinterpreted the most relevant data (Nisbett, 2005). For example, African
   Americans with more African ancestry scored as high on cognitive tests as those
   with mixed ancestry (Scarr, Pakstis, Katz, & Barker, 1977). Another study
   suggests that socioeconomic class is more important than ethnic origin; it found
   that IQ runs about 20–30 points lower in the lowest social classes than in the
   highest social classes (Locurto, 1991). Higher intelligence test results are not
   always found for Asians (Naglieri & Ronning, 2000), and their higher academic
   achievement is typically attributed to cultural and motivational differences
   (Dandy & Nettelbeck, 2002). A task force appointed by the American
   Psychological Association to study the intelligence debate concluded that there
   is not much direct evidence regarding the genetic hypothesis of IQ differences
   between African Americans and Whites, and what little there is does not support
   the hypothesis (Neisser et al., 1996).
   Environmental Effects
   Most intelligence researchers agree that intelligence is the result of the joint
   contributions of genes and environment; it has even been said that intelligence is
   100% hereditary and 100% environmental, because both are necessary.
   However, it has been more difficult than expected to identify just which
   environmental conditions influence intelligence, other than those that cause brain
   damage. We will give environmental influences more attention here than usual
   because intelligence is a good arena for illustrating the difficulties in sorting out
   heredity from environment. One problem is similar to the one we have
   encountered in identifying specific genes: The environmental influences are
   many and, for the most part, individually weak (A. R. Jensen, 1981). Even a twin
   study that looked at major environmental events such as severe infant and
   childhood illness failed to find an effect (Loehlin & Nichols, 1976). A second
   problem is that environmental influences are often hopelessly confounded with
   genetic effects. For example, family conditions such as socioeconomic level and
   parental education are moderately related to the offspring’s intelligence (T. J.
   Bouchard & Segal, 1985), but these characteristics also reflect the parents’
   genetic makeup, which they pass on to their children.
   The best way to demonstrate environmental influences is by environmental
   intervention. Although the Head Start program has produced long-term benefits
   in mathematics, educational attainment, and career accomplishments, the
   average increase of 7.42 IQ points compared with controls eventually
   disappears. The Abecedarian Project, which began at birth, produced IQ gains
   that were as strong 10 years later as those in the Head Start program after 2 years
   (Ramey et al., 2000). Apparently, intervention must occur at an earlier age; a
   new Early Head Start program now takes children from birth through age five.
   Adoption has a better chance of demonstrating any environmental influences on
   intelligence, because it alters the child’s entire environment (Scarr & Weinberg,
   1976). Adopted children’s IQs are more highly correlated with the intelligence of
   their biological parents than with the intelligence of their adoptive parents (Scarr
   & Weinberg; Turkheimer, 1991), but this does not mean that the children’s IQs
   do not go up or down according to the adoptive environment. When African
   American children were adopted from impoverished homes into middle-class
   homes, by the age of six their IQs had increased from the 90-point average for
   African American children in the geographic area to 106. The beneficial effects
   persisted a decade later (Scarr & Weinberg; Weinberg, Scarr, & Waldman, 1992).
   Does this mean there was no genetic effect at all? No. In fact, the correlation
   between the children’s IQs and their biological parents’ educational levels (used
   in the absence of IQ scores) increased over the 10-year follow-up period, while
   correlations with their adoptive parents’ educational levels decreased (Weinberg
   et al., 1992). It may puzzle you how the children’s IQs could be correlated with
   their biological parents’ intelligence if the children’s IQs had moved into the
   adoptive parents’ range. Although we usually think that correlation indicates
   similarity within pairs of scores (e.g., a parent’s and a child’s IQs), this is not
   necessarily the implication; rather, it means that the scores have similar rank
   orders in their groups. In other words, the parent with the highest IQ has the
   child with the highest IQ, the parent with the second highest IQ has the child
   with the second highest IQ, and so on. Now move the children into a new
   household and raise each child’s IQ by 10 points; the biological parent with the
   highest IQ still has the child with the highest IQ and the parent with the second
   highest IQ. . . . You get the point. The correlation tells us that the children’s IQs
   are still tied to their biological parents’ intelligence, as if by an elastic string that
   can stretch but nevertheless affects how much the IQ can change; that elastic
   string in this case is the influence of genes.
   Though it has been difficult to identify specific environmental influences that
   increase intelligence, we have had some success identifying influences that have
   a deleterious effect. One example is prenatal exposure to pesticides. In an
   agricultural community in California, children whose mothers who had high
   levels of organophosphate pesticide residue in their blood during pregnancy
   averaged 7.0 IQ points lower, compared with children of mothers with the lowest
   residue measures (M. F. Bouchard et al., 2011). The exposed children also
   scored lower on tests of working memory, processing speed, verbal
   comprehension, and perceptual reasoning. Similarly, children with the highest
   levels of prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos scored 2.7 points lower in IQ and 5.3
   points lower on a test of working memory (Rauch et al., 2011). Until it was
   banned for indoor use in 2001, chlorpyrifos was one of the most widely used
   insecticides for household pest control.
   Application: Enhancing Intelligence and Cognitive Performance
   Source: iStock/picmax13.
   Most of us feel the need for a bit of an edge as we deal with a demanding world. Drugs have
   long been the go-to solution; 34% of college students, for example, reported using stimulants
   ordinarily prescribed for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (DeSantis, Webb, & Noar,
   2008). The benefits of these drugs are modest and the drugs can impair some types of cognitive
   functioning while they are enhancing others (Husain & Mehta, 2011). Manipulating genes might
   seem an alternative, but remember that the known genes have a very small individual influence.
   Neuroscientists have created mutant strains of mice that were smarter at one task or another, but
   these mice also had their problems. One strain was overly fearful, and another solved some
   problems well but struggled with simpler ones (“Small, Furry... and Smart,” 2009).
   Faced with these realities, researchers have sought more benign strategies. They have reported
   long-term improvement in solving mathematical problems following electrical stimulation to the
   scalp over the prefrontal cortex (Snowball et al., 2013) and demonstrated cognitive gains after
   subjects played video games that required extensive use of working memory (Anguera et al.,
   2013; Jaeggi, Buschkuekhl, Jonides, & Shah, 2011). Furthermore, working memory training
   increased functional connectivity in the frontal-parietal networks (Jolles, van Buchem, Crone, &
   Rombouts, 2013; Mackey, Singley, & Bunge, 2013). Given these successes, some researchers
   have suggested the better question is not whether the techniques work but which training
   regimens produce the best real-life benefits (Jaeggi et al., 2011).
   Recently, two strategies have advanced to clinical trials. In studies of older (age 50 and over)
   individuals, both extensive training on various cognitive tasks (A. Corbett et al., 2015) and
   consumption of cocoa flavanols (nutrients in foods like cocoa, tea, grapes, and apples) for three
   months showed beneficial effects to cognition (Brickman et al., 2014). Another study reminds
   us of the importance of early stimulation. Psychologists visited the homes of Jamaican children
   aged 9–24 months who were stunted in growth (bottom 5th percentile for height; Gertler et al.,
   2014). Researchers played with the children weekly, provided books and toys, and taught the
   mothers better ways to interact with their children. Compared to nonstunted control children,
   those who received early stimulation had better grades and higher IQs, showed less depression,
   and got into fewer fights; later in adulthood they had 25% higher earnings.
   The bottom line is that there is no magic pill to increase intelligence; the most promising
   approaches appear to be very basic—early stimulation, adequate diet, and practice, practice,
   practice.
   Although childhood illness in general was not a predictor of later intelligence,
   infection does seem to be important. A study in a north Manhattan, New York,
   community designed to identify risk factors for stroke found that people with
   multiple risk-associated pathogens also had lower cognitive ability (Katan et al.,
   2013). Researchers at the University of New Mexico concluded that the level of
   infectious diseases is the best predictor of national differences in intelligence
   (Eppig, Fincher, & Thornhill, 2010). After controlling for confounding variables,
   including education, climate, and economy, the correlation between national
   average IQ and infectious disease ranged from –.76 to –.82, depending on the
   method of estimating intelligence (Figure 13.11). The investigators believe that
   fighting off infections during childhood robs the body of energy needed for
   normal brain development. Not only might disease prevalence partly account for
   racial differences in intelligence, but the researchers also suggest that reduction
   in the incidence of infectious diseases explains some of the IQ increase seen in
   the Flynn effect.

   We want to understand the antecedents of intelligence to enhance cognitive
   functioning and prevent the disorders that diminish it. We have already seen in
   Chapter 12 that this is a daunting challenge in the case of Alzheimer’s disease,
   and the accompanying Application reveals that enhancing performance in
   normally functioning individuals is not so easy, either.

   What is the likely neural basis of general intelligence and of separate components of
   intelligence?
   Suppose you read a quote from a researcher that “intelligence is not a matter of a place in the
   brain, but how well the brain does its job.” Explain why someone would say this.
   What are the relative contributions of heredity and environment to intelligence? Why is it so
   difficult to identify the genetic influences? The environmental influences?
   How can adopted children’s IQs increase into the range of their adoptive homes and yet be
   more highly correlated with their parents’ intelligence? (Hint: Draw a diagram, with made-up
   IQ scores of children from several families.)
   Deficiencies and Disorders of Intelligence
   Intelligence is as fragile as it is complex. Accordingly, the list of conditions that
   can impair intelligence is impressively, or depressingly, long. To give you a feel
   for the problems that can occur in this most revered of our assets, we will add a
   few thoughts to what we have already covered in Chapter 12 on aging, take a
   brief look at intellectual disability, then spend more time on autism in
   recognition of its half-century-long challenge to neuroscientists’ investigative
   skills, and finish with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
   Effects of Aging on Intelligence
   In Chapter 12, we discussed the most widely known cognitive disorder of aging,
   Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we will limit our attention to normal declines in
   cognitive abilities that are associated with aging. One source of normal decline is
   the reduced activity of numerous genes involved in long-term potentiation and
   memory storage due to age-related damage (T. Lu et al., 2004). Genes involved
   in synaptic functioning and plasticity, including those responsible for glutamate
   and GABA receptors and for synaptic vesicle release and recycling, are
   particularly affected.
   How much capability is lost by the elderly?
   Although intelligence and cognitive abilities do typically decline with age, the
   amount of loss has been overestimated. One reason is that people are often tested
   on rather meaningless tasks, like memorizing lists of words; when the elderly are
   tested on meaningful material the decline is moderate (Kausler, 1985). Another
   reason for the overestimation is that early studies were cross-sectional,
   comparing people at one age with different people at another age; you have
   already seen that more recent generations have an IQ test performance advantage
   over people from previous generations. When the comparison is done
   longitudinally—by following the same people through the aging process—the
   amount of loss diminishes (Schaie, 1994). Also, the loss depends on the type of
   intelligence measured. Crystallized intelligence—skills and overlearned
   knowledge—remains stable or improves; vocabulary, for example, improves
   through the seventh decade (Harada, Love, & Triebel, 2013). Problem solving,
   reasoning, and the ability to process and learn new information make up fluid
   intelligence, which declines beyond the third decade.
   Apparently, performance speed is particularly vulnerable during aging, and its
   loss turns out to be important. Schaie (1994) found that statistically removing the
   effects of speed from test scores significantly reduced elderly individuals’
   performance losses. We saw earlier that working memory is especially important
   to intellectual capability. A study of people ranging in age from 18 to 82 showed
   that speed of processing accounted for all but 1% of age-related differences in
   working memory (Salthouse & Babcock, 1991).
   You know that a determinant of general intelligence is the ability to integrate
   activity between brain areas. Even in healthy aging there is a loss of coordination
   in the default mode network, portions of the frontal, parietal, and temporal
   lobes that are active when the brain is at rest or focused internally rather
   than on the outside world; activity in the default mode network is thought
   to represent preparedness for action (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2007; Broyd et
   al., 2009). To the extent this coordination diminishes, cognitive ability does as
   well. Imaging reveals that the loss is due to a decline in white matter connections
   among the areas. In the elderly, those with better whole brain network efficiency
   (clustering and short path length) had higher processing speed and superior
   executive functions, including impulse control and decision making (Wen et al.,
   2011).

   The brain does have ways of compensating, such as the increased metabolism
   that is seen in subjects with mild intellectual disability and the recruitment of
   frontal areas in people with dyslexia during reading (see Chapter 9). Studies of
   elderly individuals who are “aging gracefully” indicate that they are holding
   their own through additional neural effort (Helmuth, 2002). For example, a
   memory task activated only the right prefrontal cortex in young adults and in
   older adults who performed poorly, but older adults who performed as well as
   the young adults used both prefrontal areas to perform the tasks (Figure 13.12;
   Cabeza, Anderson, Locantore, & McIntosh, 2002). The increase in frontal
   activity is in proportion to decreases in other areas, which supports the idea that
   the shift serves a compensatory function (S. W. Davis, Dennis, Daselaar, Fleck,
   & Cabeza, 2008). Compensation may not be limited to frontal activity; it has
   also been observed in the parahippocampal area during a memory recognition
   task (van der Veen, Nijhuis, Tisserand, Backes, & Jolles, 2006). This less-than-
   efficient adaptation might not be the only pathway to graceful aging; elderly
   subjects initially coped with a task via compensation, but after just five hours of
   training on the task, they showed brain patterns like those of young subjects
   (Erickson et al., 2007).
   Some of the loss in performance is due to nonphysical causes and is reversible;
   for example, older people often lack opportunity to use their skills. In one study,
   aged individuals regained part of their lost ability through skills practice, and
   many of them returned to their predecline levels; they still had some advantage
   over controls seven years later (Schaie, 1994). Elderly people also improved in
   memory test scores when their self-esteem was bolstered by presenting them
   with words that depict old age in positive terms such as wise, learned, and
   insightful (B. Levy, 1996).
   Loss in performance that has a physical basis may be reduced if not reversed.
   Diet appears to be one factor; for example, in a study of 6,000 people over the
   age of 65, cognitive decline was 13% less in those who ate two or more fish
   meals per week, compared with people who ate fish less than once per week (M.
   C. Morris, Evans, Tangney, Bienias, & Wilson, 2005). Evidence in this study and
   others suggested that the important factor was the overall pattern of fat intake.
   Vitamin supplements might also help. In elderly individuals with mild cognitive
   impairment, a combination of B vitamins reduced the rate of brain atrophy 50%
   and slowed cognitive decline, compared with subjects given a placebo (de Jager,
   Oulhai, Jacoby, Refsum, & Smith, 2012; Douaud et al., 2013). The B vitamins
   slow gray matter atrophy by reducing homocysteine, a toxic compound that is
   elevated in people with a diet high in animal proteins.
   Interestingly, the sex hormones provide some protection against the cognitive
   effects of aging. In menopausal women, estrogen replacement therapy reduces
   the decline in verbal and visual memory as well as lowering the risk of
   Alzheimer’s disease (Sherwin, 2003; van Amelsvoort, Compton, & Murphy,
   2001). The importance of estrogen is supported by the fluctuations in
   performance that occur during the menstrual cycle. First, remember from
   Chapter 7 that women tend to be superior to men on some types of verbal tasks
   and that men typically outperform women on tasks requiring spatial ability.
   During the part of the month when estrogen is high, women perform higher on
   verbal tasks; then during menstruation estrogen drops and so does performance
   on the verbal tasks, but spatial performance improves (Kimura & Hampson,
   1994; Maki, Rich, & Rosenbaum, 2002).
   How does estrogen produce these effects? We are not sure, but we do know that
   neurons throughout the brain have estrogen receptors; estrogen levels during the
   menstrual cycle are correlated with cortical excitability (M. J. Smith et al.,
   1999), increased glucose metabolism (Reiman, Armstrong, Matt, & Mattox,
   1996), blood flow in areas involved in cognitive tasks (Dietrich et al., 2001), and
   responsiveness to acetylcholine, which is important in memory and cognitive
   functioning (O’Keane & Dinan, 1992). Finally, untreated menopausal women
   are more impaired than women receiving estrogen replacement on tests of
   working memory, response switching, and attention, which tells us that estrogen
   improves functioning in prefrontal areas (Keenan, Ezzat, Ginsburg, & Moore,
   2001).
   So what about the male of the species? Men who maintain testosterone
   production past the age of 50 have better preserved visual and verbal memory
   and visual-spatial functioning (Moffat et al., 2002). The effects of replacement
   therapy have been variable, owing apparently to the form of the testosterone
   preparation used. However, numerous studies have shown improvement in
   spatial, verbal, and working memory (Cherrier, Craft, & Matsumoto, 2003;
   Cherrier et al., 2005; Gruenewald & Matsumoto, 2003). Interestingly,
   testosterone improves only spatial memory; additional memory improvement
   requires that the testosterone be delivered in the form of dihydrotestosterone,
   which can be converted to estrogen in the brain by the process of aromatization
   (Cherrier et al., 2003, 2005). When it comes to cognitive abilities, we could be
   tempted to consider estrogen a wonder drug.
   So, losses are smaller than believed, and they differ across people and across
   skills. In addition, practice, esteem enhancement, and an active lifestyle may
   slow cognitive decline during aging. Obviously, we cannot stereotype the older
   person as a person with diminished abilities.
   Intellectual Disability
   Intellectual impairment was previously referred to as retardation, but that term
   has taken on such negative meaning in popular usage that practitioners and
   authorities are shifting to the term intellectual disability. Intellectual disability
   (ID) is a limitation in intellectual functioning (reasoning, learning, problem
   solving) and adaptive behavior that is developmental in origin. The criteria
   set by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition
   (DSM-5), are an IQ at or below 70; deficits in adaptive functioning, such as
   communication, social participation, and independent living; and onset during
   the developmental period (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Looking
   back at Figure 13.2, you can see that 2% of the population falls in this IQ range,
   and a lower percentage would meet both criteria. Table 13.1 describes the areas
   of impairment that contribute to a diagnosis of functional impairment. Not only
   is any definition arbitrary, but it is situational and cultural as well; a person
   considered to have an intellectual disability in our society might fare reasonably
   well in a simpler environment. The situational nature is illustrated by the fact
   that many individuals shed the label as they move from a childhood of academic
   failure into adulthood and demonstrate their ability to live independent lives.
   Intellectual disability has an estimated prevalence of just over 1% worldwide,
   with a higher incidence in low- and middle-income countries (Maulik,
   Mascarenhas, Mathers, Dua, & Saxena, 2011). It can result from childhood
   infections, birth complications, extreme malnutrition and, as you saw in Chapter
   5, maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. Although intelligence is highly
   heritable, no reliable estimates of the heritability of ID exist. Determining which
   genes are at fault has also been difficult, in part because ID is made up of a large
   number of disorders. Another problem is that while milder forms of ID involve
   common forms of inheritance, severe ID more often results from de novo
   mutations, those that appear spontaneously in the individual rather than being
   passed down from the parents (Vissers, Gilissen, & Veltman, 2016).
   Nevertheless, more than 700 genes have been convincingly linked to ID;
   however, this very fact means that we can expect additional genes to have small
   effects and to be difficult to isolate.
   The most common genetic cause of intellectual disability is Down syndrome,
   with a prevalence of 1 in every 700 births (S. E. Parker et al., 2010). Usually
   caused by the presence of an extra 21st chromosome, Down syndrome
   typically results in individuals with IQs in the 40–55 range, although some
   are less impaired (Figure 13.13). Recall that the amyloid precursor protein gene
   that is involved in early-onset Alzheimer’s disease is located on chromosome 21
   and that it was discovered because Down syndrome individuals also develop
   amyloid plaques (Goate et al., 1991; Murrell, Farlow, Ghetti, & Benson, 1991).
   Ninety-five percent of people with Down syndrome have the entire extra
   chromosome (called complete trisomy 21). In 1% of cases some of the body’s
   cells have the extra chromosome, but not all of them do (mosaic trisomy 21). In
   a few cases only an end portion is present and is attached to another
   chromosome (translocation trisomy 21). A strain of mouse (Ts65Dn) engineered
   with a third copy of 55% of chromosome 21 has been a useful model for
   studying Down syndrome. As in people with that disorder, its glial cells secrete
   less of two proteins that support neuron survival. Treating pregnant Ts65Dn
   females with these proteins eliminates the developmental delays that would
   ordinarily be seen in their offspring (Toso et al., 2008). Conceivably this strategy
   could be used with pregnant women when amniocentesis (genetic testing of the
   amniotic fluid) reveals that the fetus has a third 21st chromosome. Another
   therapeutic possibility is postnatal correction of inadequate norepinephrine
   release in the hippocampus, a deficiency that is believed to contribute to learning
   impairment. After treatment with a drug that increased norepinephrine levels,
   Ts65Dn mice performed as well as normal mice (Salehi et al., 2009). However, it
   may be an oversimplification to focus only on the effects of chromosome 21
   genes. DNA methylation differs by more than 10% between subjects with Down
   syndrome and controls, and the degree of methylation difference is correlated
   with cognitive function (Dekker, De Deyn, & Rots, 2014). Although the
   differentially methylated genes were found on other chromosomes, the authors
   attributed the hypermethylation to the presence of the third chromosome 21.

   Another frequent genetic cause of intellectual disability is fragile X
   syndrome, which is due to a mutation in the fragile X mental retardation 1
   gene (FMR1). The FMR1 gene normally contains between 6 and 45 repetitions
   of the nucleotide sequence C, G, G. If the number of CGG repeats reaches 200,
   the gene is turned off, and no protein is made. Fragile X syndrome is the result,
   with IQs typically below 75. An intermediate number of CGG repeats results in
   reduced protein production, accompanied by a slight increase in the chance of
   intellectual disability. Males are affected more often, and when fragile X does
   occur in females, the symptoms are usually milder. In FMR1 knockout mice,
   unusual numbers of dendrites and immature spines indicate a failure to prune
   excess synapses (Bagni & Greenough, 2005).

   Phenylketonuria is due to an inherited inability to metabolize the amino acid
   phenylalanine; the excess phenylalanine interferes with myelination during
   development. Newborn infants are routinely tested for phenylalanine in the
   urine or blood, and intellectual disability can be prevented by avoiding foods
   containing phenylalanine. The artificial sweetener aspartame is a familiar
   example of a substance that is high in phenylalanine. Without dietary treatment,
   the individual is severely or profoundly disabled, with an adult IQ around 20
   points.
   Hydrocephalus occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the cerebral
   ventricles; the increased fluid volume crowds out neural tissue, usually causing
   intellectual disability (Figure 13.14). As we saw in Chapter 3, hydrocephalus can
   also be treated if caught early, by installing a shunt that prevents the
   accumulation of the excess cerebrospinal fluid. Also in that chapter, you learned
   that some individuals seem not to be harmed by the dramatic loss of cortex; in
   fact, half of those whose ventricles fill 95% of the cranium have IQs over 100
   (Lewin, 1980).
   Zika virus, one of the infectious causes of intellectual disability, can have a
   devastating effect on brain development and intelligence. The accompanying In
   the News feature describes the effect of Zika on neural development.
   Autism Spectrum Disorder
   Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental disorders
   characterized by social deficits, communication difficulties, and repetitive
   behaviors. In DSM-5, autism spectrum disorder includes the previously used
   diagnoses of autism, Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not
   otherwise specified, and childhood disintegrative disorder (American Psychiatric
   Association, 2013). For simplicity, we will refer to the disorder as autism or
   ASD. The prevalence of ASD was 1 in 150 children (3.7%) in the years 2000 and
   2002 but increased to 1 in 68 in 2010 (1.4%) (Figure 13.15; Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention, 2016a). Rates in North America, Asia, and Europe are
   similar, averaging between 1% and 2%. At least some of the increase can be
   attributed to improved detection, broader diagnostic criteria, and doctors’ greater
   willingness to use the label because of decreasing stigmatization of autism and
   because the diagnosis will qualify the family for increased services and financial
   assistance (Rutter, 2005). Some observers believe the increase is real and due,
   for example, to rising environmental toxins, but the position of most authorities
   is that we simply don’t know how much the actual rate has increased or why.
   The good news is that there was no further increase between 2010 and 2012, but
   it is too early to tell whether that signifies a trend. One statistic is not in dispute:
   The prevalence is almost five times higher among males than females (Centers
   for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016a).
   Cognitive and Social Impairment
   In a study of cognitive abilities in children with ASD, 55% had intellectual
   disability (defined as IQ < 70), and 16% had moderate to severe disability, with
   IQs below 50 (Charman et al., 2011). Impairment was not universal, however;
   28% had average intelligence (IQs of 85–115), and 3% scored above 115.
   Autistic individuals share a common core of impairment in communication,
   imagination, and socialization (Frith, 1993). Trouble understanding verbal and
   nonverbal communication often makes testing difficult, raising questions about
   the meaningfulness of test results. In some cases, nonverbal tests such as the
   Raven Progressive Matrices are used or IQ is estimated from an assessment of
   adaptive behavior, but these do not eliminate the deficits. Difficulty with
   imagination also is common, in the form of an inability to pretend or to
   understand make-believe situations. Use of language is also very literal—“Can
   you pass me the salt?” is met with “Yes” with no compliance—and in some
   cases this literalism extends to an obsessive interest in facts, like that seen in the
   movie Rain Man.
   What is autism like?
   In The News: Zika Virus Impacts Neural Development
   During the summer of 2016, the outbreak of Zika virus became an increasing public health
   concern when babies born to Zika-infected mothers showed smaller than normal brains, a
   condition called microcephaly. Even with the knowledge from dozens of early investigations,
   there are many unanswered questions regarding Zika’s effects. Although Zika infection has been
   clearly linked to microcephaly, studies still must be done to determine the mechanisms by which
   Zika impacts fetal development (Tang et al., 2016). In addition, not all infants born to infected
   mothers show signs of microcephaly (Children’s National Health System, 2017). Fortunately,
   the infant brain retains much of the fetal brain’s plasticity, which leaves open the possibility that
   ways could be found of altering postnatal brain development, particularly of cortical areas, to
   compensate for the disruption caused by the virus.
   Tang and colleagues (2016) have investigated how Zika affects the brain by infecting stem cells,
   then coaxing them to develop into neural tissue. The results were clear: Infection resulted in
   reduced overall neural cell numbers, both by increasing cell death and by disrupting the cell
   cycle (Tang et al., 2016). Other scientists have evaluated brain development using MRIs to see
   how often the fetal brain is impacted by the mother’s infection (Children’s National Health
   System, 2017); in a preliminary report on a sample of 48 fetuses, only 3 showed abnormal
   development. Other studies are planned to determine the long-term consequences of exposure
   and whether exposed babies born with normal-appearing brains might still be affected
   neurologically.
   Thought Questions
   1. How do scientists think Zika virus might result in microcephaly in exposed infants?
   2. What potential insights into neural development might come about through long-term
   studies of infants who were exposed prenatally to Zika virus?

   These characteristics make it difficult to socialize with others, which is what sets
   apart children with autism the most. They usually prefer to be alone and ignore
   people around them (Figure 13.16). Their interaction with others often is limited
   to requests for things they want; they otherwise treat people as objects,
   sometimes even walking or climbing over them. Verbalization is usually limited,
   and the child often repeats what others say (echolalia).
   Some researchers believe that much of the social behavior problem is that the
   person with autism lacks a theory of mind, the ability to attribute mental
   states to oneself and to others. In other words, the autistic person cannot infer
   what other people are thinking. One man with autism said that people seem to
   have a special sense that allows them to read other people’s thoughts (Rutter,
   1983), and an observant autistic youth asked, “People talk to each other with
   their eyes. What is it that they are saying?” (Frith, 1993). In a study that
   measured this deficiency, children watched hand puppet Anne remove a marble
   from a basket where puppet Sally had placed it, and put it in a box while Sally
   was out of the room. On Sally’s return, children were asked where she would
   look for the marble. Normal four year olds had no problem with this task, nor
   did Down syndrome children with a mental age of five or six. But 80% of
   children with autism with an average mental age of nine answered that Sally
   would look in the box (Frith, Morton, & Leslie, 1991).

   Interaction.

   There are two hypotheses as to how we develop a theory of mind. According to
   the “theory theory,” we build hypotheses over time based on our experience.
   Simulation theory holds that we gain insight into people’s thoughts and
   intentions by mentally mimicking the behavior of others. This view gets some
   support from studies of the mirror neurons we talked about in Chapters 8 and 9.
   Individuals who score higher on a measure of empathy tend to have more
   activity in these mirror neurons (Gazzola, Aziz-Zadeh, & Keysers, 2006).
   Researchers have suggested that impaired mirror functions reduce the autistic
   person’s ability to empathize and to learn language through imitation. Children
   with autism engage in less contagious yawning than other children do (Senju et
   al., 2007), and they show neural deficiencies during mirroring tasks. For
   example, they can imitate others’ facial expressions, but mirror neuron activity
   while doing so is either delayed or nonexistent (Dapretto et al., 2005; Oberman
   et al., 2007). Other studies show reduced activation in the inferior frontal cortex
   and motor cortex, suggesting weakness in the dorsal stream connections that
   provide input to those areas (Nishitani, Avikainen, & Hari, 2004; Villalobos,
   Mizuno, Dahl, Kemmotsu, & Müller, 2005). This interpretation was supported in
   a study of individuals diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, the former term for
   high-functioning autism. When they imitated facial expressions, transmission
   over the dorsal stream (occipital to superior temporal to posterior parietal to
   frontal) was delayed by 45–60 milliseconds compared with normal controls
   (Nishitani et al., 2004).
   Brain Anomalies in Autism
   Autism was long thought to be purely psychological in origin, because no
   specific brain defects had been found. The problem was blamed on a lack of
   maternal bonding or a disastrous experience of rejection that caused the child to
   retreat into a world of aloneness (Frith, 1993). But no evidence could be found
   for this kind of influence; autistic children often had exemplary homes, and
   children with extremely negative experiences did not become autistic. The
   frequent association with intellectual disability and epilepsy implied that autism
   was a brain disorder. Later work found subtle but widespread brain anomalies,
   especially in the brain stem, the cerebellum, and the temporal lobes (Happé &
   Frith, 1996). The location of the damage varied among individuals, which
   suggests that there are various pathways to autism.
   There are many anomalies in the brains of individuals with autism, but the most
   striking characteristic is the atypical sequencing of brain development. The
   autistic brain undergoes dramatic growth during the first year of life, with the
   overgrowth focused in frontal and temporal areas that are important for the
   social, emotional, and language functions that are impaired in the disorder
   (Courchesne et al., 2007; Redcay & Courchesne, 2005). The excess growth ends
   around three to five years of age, but by then the brain has already reached
   normal adult size. In adulthood, these areas are under-activated during tasks that
   would ordinarily engage them, for example, when viewing animations that
   require the viewer to understand the mental state of the actor (Castelli, Frith,
   Happé, & Frith, 2002). Despite comparable overall brain volumes, adult patients
   have increased cortical volume and thickness and more gray matter volume in
   prefrontal and temporal areas, with reductions in other areas (Ecker et al., 2012;
   Greimel et al., 2013; Raznahan et al., 2010).
   Several studies have reported white matter and connectivity reductions in the
   brains of individuals with ASD, particularly in the corpus callosum and other
   long-distance connections (Figure 13.17; Aoki, Abe, Nippashi, & Yamasue,
   2013; Wilkinson, Wang, van der Kouwe, & Takahashi, 2016). These findings
   have led to the hypothesis that underconnectivity is a fundamental characteristic
   of the disorder. However, additional research has reported hyperconnectivity.
   One thorough study replicated its results with two different methodologies and
   found strong evidence of overconnection over both short and long distances in
   the brain (Supekar et al., 2013). An interesting observation supports an
   association between ASD and hyperconnectivity: Synesthesia is found 2.6 times
   more often in people with ASD than in the general population (Baron-Cohen et
   al., 2013), and we saw in Chapter 10 that evidence favors hyperconnectivity
   between sensory areas as an explanation. So how do we reconcile these disparate
   results? Studies by researchers at San Diego State University suggest two
   possible reasons. One study reported frontal underconnectivity in milder cases of
   ASD and temporal-occipital overconnectivity in more severe cases (Keown et
   al., 2013); indeed, Supekar and his colleagues noted that children with greater
   functional connectivity had more severe social deficits. More severely affected
   individuals are less likely to be included in studies because of their inability to
   cooperate with the scanning procedure. The other study found underconnectivity
   in several areas, including prefrontal cortex, but hyperconnectivity in the
   temporal lobe; the researchers pointed out that the underconnectivity occurred in
   earlier-maturing parts of the cortex and overconnectivity was associated with a
   later-maturing area (Nair et al., 2013). This study raises the possibility of both
   under- and overconnectivity occurring to varying degrees within an individual or
   an individual exhibiting one or the other, in both cases depending on the time
   progression of the disorder.

   Biochemical Anomalies in Autism
   As researchers looked for genetic links to autism, several of the genes that turned
   up pointed in turn to serotonin, glutamate, GABA, and oxytocin (Freitag, Staal,
   Klauck, Duketis, & Waltes, 2010; Sutcliffe, 2008). Serotonin has received
   considerable attention because of its contribution to neural development.
   Prenatal serotonin activity is regulated by cortisol levels, and cortisol is
   increased in the mother by psychological stress, depression, type 2 diabetes,
   inflammatory disorders, and obesity (Rose’Meyer, 2013). Neuroimaging studies
   have found diminished serotonin synthesis in children with ASD, and treatment
   with serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as Prozac, decreases repetitive and
   obsessive behavior in some autistic individuals. The antipsychotic drug
   risperidone antagonizes dopamine as well as serotonin, and its stronger
   therapeutic track record implicates that neurotransmitter. According to an
   analysis of 22 previously published studies, several autism symptoms improve
   during treatment with risperidone (Sharma & Shaw, 2012). High levels of the
   excitatory transmitter glutamate have also been found in autism (Hassan et al.,
   2013). Treatment with glutamate antagonists alone has produced unremarkable
   results, but pairing the anti-Alzheimer’s drug memantine with risperidone
   decreased irritability more than risperidone alone (Ghanizadeh & Moghimi-
   Sarani, 2013).
   In Chapter 7 we saw that oxytocin facilitates bonding and social recognition; for
   that reason, it is known as the “sociability molecule.” Most studies have found
   that oxytocin is reduced in individuals with autism, though not in all (reviewed
   in Anagnostou et al., 2014, and S. Y. Lee et al., 2015). Even studies using a
   single dose of oxytocin have reported improvements in repetitive behaviors, self-
   injury, empathy, social interaction, and ability to recognize mental or emotional
   state from photos of the eyes. Results of an fMRI study indicated that oxytocin
   improves trust by reducing activity in fear areas in the amygdala and midbrain
   (Figure 13.18; Baumgartner, Heinrichs, Vonlanthen, Fischbacher, & Fehr, 2008).
   In two studies with high-functioning ASD participants, oxytocin improved brain
   functioning by increasing previously deficient activity in the right anterior insula
   during an emotion inference task (Aoki et al., 2014) and increasing functional
   connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   (Watanabe et al., 2015). Research with mice indicated that oxytocin enhances
   social reward by increasing serotonin activity in the nucleus accumbens (Dölen,
   Darvishzadeh, Huang, & Malenka, 2013).

   The Environment and Autism
   Parental treatment has been ruled out as the cause of autism, but numerous other
   environmental conditions have been identified as contributing factors. One’s
   suspicions immediately turn to environmental pollutants, such as those generated
   by automobile traffic, agricultural practices, and industrial activity. Researchers
   usually assess such effects by studying people living near agricultural fields or a
   busy highway, but two studies are notable for employing more meaningful
   measures of pollution. Using localized estimates of traffic pollution based on
   Environmental Protection Agency data, traffic volume, and climatic conditions
   during each child’s gestational period and first year of life, researchers found
   that living in homes where traffic pollution was highest tripled the rate of autism
   (Volk, Lurmann, Penfold, Hertz-Picciotto, & McConnell, 2014). Recognizing
   that ASD occurs in geographic clusters, University of Chicago researchers used
   county-level data on genital malformation in male children as a surrogate for
   environmental exposure and found that the incidence of ASD increased 283%
   for every percentage point increase in incidence of malformations (Rzhetsky et
   al., 2014).
   Other environmental influences originate in the mother herself. For example,
   infection during the second trimester of pregnancy tripled the chance of bearing
   a child who would later be diagnosed with ASD (Zerbo et al., 2015). Ten percent
   of women who have a child with autism have immune molecules in the blood
   that react with proteins in the brain; this rate is four times higher than in the
   general population of women of childbearing age (Brimberg, Sadiq, Gregersen,
   & Diamond, 2013). Other researchers identified six brain proteins that anti-brain
   antibodies attach to; all of them are involved in neuronal development
   (Braunschweig et al., 2013). Maternal metabolic conditions, including obesity,
   diabetes, and hypertension, may also be associated with ASD; mothers of
   autistic children were 40% more likely to be obese and 47% more likely to have
   any one of these conditions (Krakowiak et al., 2012; also see the earlier
   discussion of serotonin). The news is not all bad: Mothers who took folic acid
   during pregnancy were half as likely to bear a child who would later be
   diagnosed with autism (Surén et al., 2013). In addition, as the accompanying
   Application explains, there is no evidence that vaccines are linked to autism.
   Heredity and Autism Spectrum Disorders
   Siblings of children with autism are 25 times more likely to be diagnosed with
   autism than other children (Abrahams & Geschwind, 2008); the number would
   be even higher, but parents tend to stop having children after the first autism
   diagnosis. For the identical twin of a child with autism, the risk of autism is at
   least 60%. However, relatives frequently have autistic-like cognitive and social
   characteristics. When these symptoms are also considered, the concordance for
   identical twins jumps to 92%, compared with 10% for fraternal pairs (A. Bailey
   et al., 1995). In the largest study to date, researchers examined data from all two
   million children born in Sweden between 1982 and 2006 and estimated the
   heritability of ASD to be 50% and of autism at 54%, with the remainder due to
   nonshared (nonfamilial) environmental influence (Sandin et al., 2014).
   As you might expect, genes that have been identified contribute to neuron
   development and migration, synapse formation, and neurotransmitter activity
   (Freitag et al., 2010; Sutcliffe, 2008). For example, several genes that code for
   synaptic proteins have been implicated (J. Chen, Yu, Fu, & Li, 2014); synaptic
   proteins are required for the formation and functioning of synapses. Genes for
   GABA A and GABA B receptors and for both AMPA and NMDA glutamate
   receptors have also been linked to ASD, and a GABA B receptor agonist
   improves social function and behavior. But once again, it has been difficult to
   identify the specific genes involved. So-called common variants—genes that
   occur in 5% or more of the population—have weak effects individually,
   requiring multiple “hits” to have an effect (Anney et al., 2012). Small effect is
   not the only reason identifying autism genes is difficult; a recent genetic analysis
   estimates that half of all autism cases are the result of de novo mutations
   (Iossofov et al., 2015). There is a limited window of opportunity to identify the
   genes because the mutations appear spontaneously and typically are not passed
   on because the individuals are unlikely to reproduce.
   Application: Childhood Vaccines and Autism
   Source: From Wakefield et al. (1998). Retrieved from
   http://vaccines.procon.org/sourcefiles/retracted-lancet-paper.pdf.
   In 1998 Andrew Wakefield and several colleagues published a paper in which they linked the
   measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism. Years later, two reviews of all the
   available studies concluded that there was no credible link between autism and the MMR
   vaccine or the mercury-derived preservative (thimerosal) used in some vaccines (Demicheli,
   Jefferson, Rivetti, & Price, 2005; Immunization Safety Review Committee, 2004). In early 2010
   the General Medical Council, which oversees doctors in Britain, decided that Wakefield’s study
   was methodologically flawed and that he had acted unethically. The Lancet, which published the
   study, called the report “the most appalling catalog and litany of some of the most terrible
   behavior in any research” and took the rare action of withdrawing the study (M. Park, 2010).
   More recently, a comprehensive meta-analysis examined scientific data from more than 1.25
   million children and concluded that there was no relationship between vaccines, components of
   vaccines, or multiple vaccine administrations and the development of autism or autism spectrum
   disorder (L. E. Taylor, Swerdfeger, & Eslick, 2014).
   Many parents whose children’s first signs of autism coincided with a round of childhood
   vaccinations say they find these reports unconvincing. More than 5,000 families have brought
   suit; a U.S. federal court has denied the claims in four test cases (“Vaccine Court Finds... ,”
   2010), but that does not signal the end of litigation or of the controversy. In the meantime, there
   has been a disturbing decrease in the rate of childhood immunization in several countries in
   spite of the health risks, leading to large outbreaks of measles and other childhood diseases that
   could have been prevented.
   Of course, oxytocin genes come into play as well. Several studies have reported
   a relationship between the oxytocin receptor genes (OXTR) and ASD; evidence
   suggests that downregulation of the gene in some subgroups of ASD results in
   increased activity in the temporal-parietal junction, which participates in social
   perception (S. Y. Lee et al., 2015). Also, individuals with ASD who had a mutant
   allele of CD38 had lower oxytocin levels than others with ASD.
   Irene Voineagu and her colleagues (2011) identified over 500 genes that were
   expressed at different levels between the frontal and temporal cortices of healthy
   brains, and only 8 in ASD brains. ASD genes are particularly expressed in
   superficial layers of the cortex, where they interfere with the development of
   connections between the layers and between the hemispheres (Parikshak et al.,
   2013). As you have seen before, environmental influences almost certainly exert
   their effect through epigenetic modification of gene expression; this fact offers a
   glimmer of hope in that drugs designed to reverse those modifications might be
   used as a treatment for autism (Siniscalco, Cirillo, Bradstreet, & Antonucci,
   2013). An additional important factor in understanding genetic influence in
   autism and other disorders is that some genes exert control over many additional
   genes. The RORA gene, for example, codes for the protein RORA1, which
   regulates the activity of more than 2,500 other genes; some of these are involved
   in neuron and synapse development and synaptic transmission, and at least 6
   have been associated with ASD (Sarachana & Hu, 2013).
   Researchers attempting to explain the higher incidence of ASD in males have
   most often looked to the X chromosome. They have had little luck pinning down
   the responsible genes, but now researchers at Emory University have a
   promising candidate. In their study, mutations in the AFF2 gene occurred five
   times more frequently in boys with ASD than in boys without ASD (Mondal et
   al., 2012). Male vulnerability may not be the whole story, however; females may
   enjoy some protection. Girls with ASD had very long copy number variations
   (differences in how often a segment of DNA is repeated) more often than boys
   with ASD; this implied that it takes more mutations to produce ASD in a female,
   which suggested a “female protective model” (Jacquemont et al., 2014).
   Although cortical levels of the RORA protein are decreased in both males and
   females with autism, levels are higher in unaffected females than in unaffected
   males (V. W. Hu, Sarachana, Sherrard, & Kocher, 2015). The apparent reason is
   that the RORA gene is upregulated by estrogen and downregulated by
   testosterone (Sarachana & Hu). We’re also learning that male–female differences
   in vulnerability may be qualitative as well as quantitative. One study found that
   adult males and females with autism had markedly different patterns of white
   and gray matter increases compared to neurotypical controls (M.-C. Lai et al.,
   2013).
   Autistic Savants and High-Functioning Autism
   A savant is a person with exceptional intellectual skills, beyond the level of
   “typical” genius, like Leonardo da Vinci or Albert Einstein. However, the term is
   more frequently used to describe individuals who have one or more
   remarkable skills but whose overall functioning is below normal; half of
   these individuals with islands of exceptional capabilities are autistic savants
   (Treffert & Christensen, 2006). Some can play a tune on the piano after hearing
   it once, another can memorize whole books, while others take cube roots of large
   numbers in their heads or calculate the day of the week for any date thousands of
   years in the past or future. Stephen Wiltshire’s remarkable talent is for
   architectural art; after brief helicopter flights, he has produced a detailed drawing
   of a 4-square-mile (10-square-kilometer) area of London and a 98-foot-long (30-
   meter-long) mural of Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbor and the surrounding
   cityscape (see Figure 13.20; Stephen Wiltshire MBE—Biography, n.d.). A few
   “ordinary” individuals can perform similar feats, but the savant’s performance is
   typically faster, more automatic, and without insight into how it is done (A. W.
   Snyder & Mitchell, 1999). The savant’s exceptional capability may be limited in
   scope, however; some who are calendar calculators cannot even add or subtract
   with accuracy (Sacks, 1990).
   The source of the autistic savant’s enhanced ability is unknown. Dehaene (1997)
   suggests that it is due to intensely concentrated practice, but more typically the
   skill appears without either practice or instruction, as in the case of a three-year-
   old autistic girl who began drawing animated and well-proportioned horses in
   perfect perspective (Selfe, 1977). Allan Snyder and John Mitchell (1999) believe
   that these capabilities are within us all and are released when brain centers that
   control executive or integrative functions are compromised. This, they say, gives
   the savant access to speedy lower levels of processing that are unavailable to us.
   But, lacking the executive functions, the savants perform poorly on apparently
   similar tasks that require higher-order processing. The idea gains some
   credibility from the case of a man impaired in his left temporal and frontal areas
   by dementia; despite limited musical training, he began composing classical
   music, some of which was performed publicly (B. L. Miller, Boone, Cummings,
   Read, & Mishkin, 2000; also see Figure 13.19). The best-known savant was Kim
   Peek, the model used by Dustin Hoffman in his portrayal of Raymond Babbitt in
   Rain Man; Peek’s brain had several anomalies, particularly in the left
   hemisphere (Figure 13.20; Treffert & Christensen, 2006). A few researchers
   have attempted to unleash savant-like capabilities by using transcranial electrical
   or magnetic stimulation to inhibit neural activity in the frontal-temporal area
   (Snyder, 2009). Most of the results have been unremarkable, but 40% of subjects
   receiving excitatory right-hemisphere stimulation along with inhibitory left-
   hemisphere stimulation were able to solve a problem that none of the control
   subjects could solve (Chi & Snyder, 2012). Whatever the explanation, the
   phenomenon adds to the argument that intellectual ability involves multiple and
   somewhat independent modules.

   If these savants have an island of exceptional ability, autism is an island of
   impairment in high-functioning individuals with ASD. As an infant, Temple
   Grandin would stiffen and attempt to claw her way out of her affectionate
   mother’s arms (Sacks, 1995). She was slow to develop language and social
   skills, and she would spend hours just dribbling sand through her fingers. A
   speech therapist unlocked her language capability, starting a slow emergence
   toward a normal life. Even so, she did not develop decent language skills until
   the age of six and did not engage in pretend play until she was eight.

   As an adult, Grandin earned a doctorate in animal science; she teaches at
   Colorado State University and designs humane facilities for cattle, while
   lecturing all over the world on her area of expertise and on autism. Still, her
   theory of mind is poorly developed, and she must consciously review what she
   has learned to decide what others would do in a social situation. She says that
   she is baffled by relationships that are not centered on her work and that she
   feels like “an anthropologist on Mars.”
   Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
   Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by
   impulsiveness, inability to sustain attention, learning difficulty, and
   hyperactivity. Behaviorally, what we see is fidgeting and inability to sit still,
   difficulty organizing tasks, distractibility, forgetfulness, blurting out answers in
   class, and risk taking (Smalley, 1997). Diagnosticians recognize three types of
   ADHD; combined inattention and hyperactivity-impulsiveness is most common,
   but some individuals are predominantly inattentive or predominantly
   hyperactive-impulsive. ADHD is the most common among childhood-onset
   behavioral disorders. A meta-analysis of 179 studies estimated prevalence at
   7.2% worldwide (Thomas et al., 2015); boys are more than twice as likely as
   girls to be diagnosed (Visser et al., 2014). Although ADHD is often thought of
   as a learning disorder (and many children with ADHD do have at least one
   learning disability), its effects are felt in every aspect of a person’s life. Besides
   having the expected difficulties with life and work, these individuals have
   greatly increased rates of antisocial personality disorder, criminal behavior, and
   drug abuse (Biederman, 2004); in fact, 35% of people seeking treatment for
   cocaine abuse have a history of childhood ADHD (F. R. Levin, Evans, & Kleber,
   1998). People with ADHD are also twice as likely to die prematurely, mostly
   from accidents (Dalsgaard, Østergaard, Leckman, Mortensen, & Pedersen,
   2015).
   Drugs are usually prescribed to control the symptoms of ADHD, and from 2002
   to 2010 the prescription rate jumped 46% in the United States (Chai et al., 2012),
   while in Denmark it went up a whopping 630% (Dalsgaard, Nielsen, &
   Simonsen, 2013). With 69% of diagnosed children taking medication (Visser et
   al.), some observers have raised concerns that children are being overdiagnosed
   and overmedicated as an easy solution to classroom behavioral problems. The
   link with drug abuse fostered concerns that treating children with stimulant
   drugs such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) and amphetamine was leading to
   addiction later in life. However, research that followed children with ADHD into
   adolescence and adulthood revealed that, at worst, stimulant treatment made no
   difference (Barkley, Fischer, Smallish, & Fletcher, 2003) and that it might even
   be protective against drug abuse (Figure 13.21; Wilens, Faraone, Biederman, &
   Gunawardene, 2003). The more positive outcome for the treated individuals
   could have been due to the reduction of symptoms, or it could have been the
   result of other factors, such as the support of parents who opted for treatment,
   but at least these results do not support fears that the medications act as gateway
   drugs.
   Although ADHD is considered a childhood disorder, in a 13-year-long study of
   2,040 twins in the United Kingdom, 22% of the children diagnosed with ADHD
   continued to meet criteria at age 18 (Agnew-Blais et al., 2016). DSM-5
   diagnostic criteria require onset during childhood, but 68% of the 18 year olds
   who met diagnostic criteria without regard to age of onset had not done so in any
   of the four previous screenings. These results are not unique to the United
   Kingdom; they were confirmed in an even larger study in Brazil (Caye et al.,
   2016) and are supported by an earlier study in New Zealand. Unfortunately, the
   data can’t tell us whether adult-onset ADHD is a different form or if these
   individuals were simply able to compensate for their impairments through
   childhood. We do know, however, that the adult-onset ADHD group had higher
   IQs than the childhood-onset group and was preponderantly female.

   Individuals Receiving Stimulant Treatment for ADHD as Children, Compared

   Brain Anomalies in ADHD
   Numerous studies have reported one difference or another in the brains of
   individuals with ADHD, but the results have been inconsistent. Brain MRIs cost
   anywhere between $1,000 and $5,000, so study samples are usually small; brain
   differences in psychological disorders are typically slight, on the order of just a
   few cubic centimeters of volume, so reliable detection of these differences
   requires large samples. Now a nine-country international group has solved that
   problem by compiling data from 1,700 people diagnosed with ADHD and 1,500
   people without (Hoogman et al., 2017). They found reductions in overall brain
   volume and in five specific structures involved in emotion, motivation, and
   reward processing: the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, amygdala,
   and hippocampus. The amygdala had the most pronounced deficit, which is
   important because the amygdala has functions not only in emotion but also in
   response inhibition. Reductions were greatest in children and leveled off in
   adults, which lent support to the brain maturation theory of ADHD.
   White matter integrity also is reduced in children with ADHD, both in
   interhemispheric connections and in anterior-posterior pathways (Figure 13.22a;
   Ameis et al., 2016). They share this characteristic with children diagnosed with
   ASD and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In fact, the children with greater white
   matter impairment also had more impairment in functioning, regardless of their
   diagnosis. Because of this reduced connectivity, activity is segregated into
   localized clusters rather than being integrated across larger areas (Griffiths et al.,
   2016). There is a hub of local connections centered around the amygdala; the
   researchers suggested that the ADHD brain may be configured to respond
   impulsively instead of having the neural organization to regulate and inhibit
   responses. Other studies have found overall reductions in brain volume,
   particularly in prefrontal and parietal-temporal areas and the cerebellum, along
   with reductions in cortical thickness (Figure 13.22b; Proal et al., 2011). The
   reductions were observable in adults at 33-year follow-up, though there was
   some evidence of mitigation of the deficiencies in those who were symptom
   free.
   Genes, Neurotransmitters, and ADHD
   To say that ADHD runs in families would be an understatement: Heritability
   averages 76% across studies (Biederman & Faraone, 2005; Brikell, Kuja-
   Halkola, & Larsson, 2015), and concordances have been variously estimated at
   58%–83% for identical twins and 31%–47% for fraternal twins (Wender, Wolf,
   & Wasserstein, 2001). Like autism, ADHD is a complex, multisymptom
   disorder, and different individuals display different combinations of symptoms.
   Whole-genome studies have implicated genes involved in cell migration,
   synaptic excitability, and neuronal plasticity (Jain et al., 2012). Another study
   found 222 copy number variations (CNVs) in ADHD patients that were not
   found in control subjects (Elia et al., 2010). These CNVs were in or near genes
   involved in synaptic transmission, neural development, and learning and other
   psychological functions. Numerous CNVs are in chromosomal locations that
   have been identified in autism and schizophrenia (N. M. Williams et al., 2010);
   participation of a gene in more than one disorder should not be surprising, since
   different disorders share some symptoms. And remember that we are not talking
   about a gene for autism or a gene for ADHD or a gene for schizophrenia, but
   genes that regulate brain growth, receptor development, and so on.

   Brain.

   Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,” by E. R. Sowell et al., Lancet,
   362, figs. 2 & 3, pp. 1702–1703. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
   However, the genes most frequently implicated in ADHD are involved with
   neurotransmission. In fact, it is difficult to discuss the genetics of ADHD
   without simultaneously discussing neurotransmitters. A review of genetic studies
   identified 24 “hot genes,” each of which had been linked to ADHD in at least
   five studies (Li, Chang, Zhang, Gao, & Wang, 2014). The large majority of these
   genes are involved with dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine transmission,
   including synthesis, transport, and receptors. In addition, one gene’s protein
   contributes to the construction of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. For the
   past half-century, ADHD has been treated mostly with the stimulant drugs
   methylphenidate and amphetamines. These drugs increase dopamine and
   norepinephrine activity by blocking reuptake at the synapse, which supports a
   role for both transmitters. Most research, however, links ADHD to reduced
   activity in dopamine pathways, including the prefrontal cortex (Ernst et al.,
   1998) and the striatum (K.-H. Krause, Dresel, Krause, King, & Tatsch, 2000).
   These structures’ functions include executive control, impulse inhibition,
   working memory, movement, learning, and reward—all functions that are
   affected in ADHD. The significance of reward may be less immediately obvious,
   but several researchers believe that impaired reward contributes to impulsiveness
   because the allure of later rewards is too weak to overcome the temptation of
   immediate gratification (Castellanos & Tannock, 2002; Tripp & Wickens, 2009).
   Some 20%–30% of patients do not respond to the traditional medications or
   cannot tolerate them (Biederman & Faraone, 2005). Two drugs sometimes used
   in their place, modafinil and atomoxetine, block norepinephrine reuptake, adding
   support for its role in ADHD as suggested by genetic studies.
   The Environment and ADHD
   What appears to be an environmental cause of ADHD often turns out to be an
   indication of a genetic predisposition in the parents. This includes correlations of
   ADHD with maternal smoking and stress during pregnancy (A. Rodriguez &
   Bohlin, 2005); parental abuse of alcohol, stimulants, and cocaine; and parental
   mood and anxiety disorders (Chronis et al., 2003). Confirmed environmental
   influences include brain injury, stroke, and complications during pregnancy and
   birth (Biederman & Faraone, 2005; Castellanos & Tannock, 2002), along with
   some toxins. Lead, for example, is a known neurotoxin; although eliminating
   lead in gasoline and paint has reduced levels in the environment, it is
   occasionally found in children’s costume jewelry and imported candies as well
   as in the soil and water. A recent study confirmed higher blood levels of lead in
   children diagnosed with ADHD, and lead levels were correlated with teacher and
   parent ratings of symptoms (Nigg, Nikolas, Knottnerus, Cavanagh, & Friderici,
   2010). Another source of concern is air pollution; children whose mothers were
   exposed during pregnancy to high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
   from sources such as traffic and fossil-fuel-burning electric plants had increased
   levels of ADHD symptoms, especially inattentiveness, at age nine (Perera et al.,
   2014).
   As with autism, another culprit is organophosphate pesticides; children with
   above average urinary levels of a metabolite of these pesticides are twice as
   likely to be diagnosed with ADHD compared with children with undetectable
   levels (M. F. Bouchard, Bellinger, Wright, & Weisskopf, 2010). Even chemicals
   found in cosmetics, perfumes, and shampoo are turning out to be a problem;
   mothers who had higher levels of phthalates in their urine during the third
   trimester of pregnancy reported that their children had significantly more trouble
   with attention, aggression, and depression (S. M. Engel et al., 2010). How
   phthalates cause this result is unknown, but they may disrupt thyroid hormones
   that are important during brain development.
   Although these examples are distinctly environmental, it is important to
   remember that environmental insults often exert their influence by changing
   gene functioning. For example, inducing concussion in rats altered over 1,200
   genes, 16 of which are linked to ADHD (Q. Meng et al., 2017). Another
   example is dietary: High fat and sugar in women’s diets during pregnancy was
   associated with increased methylation of the IGF2 gene, which is involved in
   development of brain areas implicated in ADHD, along with higher symptoms of
   ADHD (Rijlaarsdam et al., 2017). In addition, genes can influence whether an
   environmental condition has an effect; in children with ADHD who had a
   specific mutation in the C282Y gene, “safe” levels of lead exposure were
   associated with increased symptoms (Nigg, Elmore, Natarajan, Friderici, &
   Nikolas, 2016).

   Take a Minute to Check Your Knowledge and Understanding
   Make a list of the kinds of intellectual disability described and their causes.
   What neural and biochemical differences have been found in the brains of people with ASD?
   Why are males more prone to ASD than females?
   In Perspective
   As important as the assessment of intelligence is in our society for determining
   placement in school, opportunities for continued education, and employability
   and promotability, it is remarkable that so much disagreement remains about
   what intelligence is. This lack of agreement makes it more difficult to study the
   brain functions that make up intelligence. Nevertheless, we have identified
   several features that appear to contribute to greater mental power; brain size,
   neural conduction speed, processing efficiency, and working memory are among
   these. Although it would be an error to overlocalize any function in the brain, we
   also know that some areas have a special role in important cognitive functions
   related to intelligence. It remains to be seen whether any characteristic of these
   areas, such as size, explains why some people have a particularly strong talent in
   one area, such as creative writing or mathematics. Some people hope that we
   will eventually have objective brain measures that will tell us exactly how
   intelligent a person is or whether a child has ASD.
   When we reach that point, perhaps another dream will be realized: the ability to
   diminish or even reverse some of the defects that rob the intellectually disabled,
   the autistic, and the aged of their capabilities. We may even be able to increase
   the intelligence of normal individuals. We can only hope that our capacity to
   make the ethical decisions required keeps pace with our ability to manipulate the
   human condition.
   Chapter Summary
   The Nature of Intelligence
   Intelligence is usually assessed with tests designed to measure academic ability.
   Some people show strong abilities not tapped by these tests; our understanding of
   intelligence should be broader than what tests measure.
   Intelligence theorists are divided over their emphasis on a general factor or multiple
   components of intelligence.
   The Biological Origins of Intelligence
   Probable contributors to general intelligence are brain size, neural conduction speed,
   processing speed, quality of neural connections, and processing efficiency.
   The involvement of different brain areas suggests multiple components of intelligence.
   About half of the variation in intelligence among people is due to heredity. The closer the
   family relationship, the more correlated are the IQs. Apparently, many genes are
   involved; there are several leads to specific genes, but little certainty.
   Research has not supported a genetic basis for ethnic differences in intelligence. Adoption
   has resulted in dramatic increases in IQ above the ethnic group mean.
   Although half of the variation in intelligence is due to environment, demonstrating which
   environmental conditions are important has been difficult. Judging by experience with
   Head Start and similar programs, any influence must be early and intense. Adoption can
   have dramatic effects if the difference in environments is large.
   Deficiencies and Disorders of Intelligence
   Loss of intellectual functioning with age is less than previously believed and, like
   decreases in learning ability, it is not inevitable. Diminished speed of processing appears
   to be most important.
   Intellectual disability has many causes, including disease, fetal alcohol syndrome, Down
   syndrome, fragile X syndrome, phenylketonuria, and hydrocephalus.
   Down syndrome, caused by a third 21st chromosome, produces mild to moderate
   intellectual disability.
   Intellectual disability due to phenylketonuria, the inability to metabolize phenylalanine, is
   severe to profound.
   Hydrocephalus can usually be treated to avoid serious impairment, but there are
   hydrocephalic individuals with no apparent deficiencies.
   ASD is partially hereditary, with several gene locations implicated; heritability is around
   50%, and the environmental contribution consists mostly of pollution and maternal
   illnesses in the third trimester.
   ASD involves abnormalities in several brain areas and possible weak connections among
   them.
   ASD may involve anomalies in serotonin, glutamate, GABA, and oxytocin functioning.
   Pollutants, infections, and maternal factors can increase the chances of ASD.
   ADHD is a partially genetic disorder characterized by hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and
   impaired attention and learning; heritability averages 76%. ADHD is associated with a
   variety of anomalies in functioning and in dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and
   acetylcholine transmission. Several gene locations have been implicated.
   A variety of environmental influences have been associated with ADHD, including brain
   injury, environmental pollution, and pesticides.

   For Further Thought
   Environmental influences on intelligence have been hard to identify. Does this mean that we
   are stuck with our genetic destiny?
   Intelligence is subject to physical disorders and genetic and environmental deviations.
   Speculate about why intelligence is so vulnerable.
   As you look at autism and ADHD, you see several similarities in the causes. Why, for
   example, do you think one child exposed to organophosphate pesticides would develop ASD
   and another might be diagnosed with ADHD?

   Bob Garrett stood by his chair and waited for the students to take their places
   around the table, eagerly tying up the loose ends of conversations that the trek
   across campus hadn’t given them time to finish. As the bell in the East College
   tower tolled the start of the hour and he was about to call the class to order, Ned
   got up from his seat and approached him.
   Master the content.
   edge.sagepub.com/garrett5e
   “I forgot to give the bookstore cashier her pen after I used it to write a check.
   Can I take it back?”
   Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas’d
   Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow
   Raze out the written troubles of the brain
   —William Shakespeare, Macbeth
   “I think she can wait until class is over,” he answered. Ned accepted that
   judgment and returned to his seat, but he seemed restless for the remainder of the
   hour. As soon as class was over, he was one of the first out of the door. Bob
   couldn’t help but smile at Ned’s youthful impetuousness.
   The next day he understood that Ned’s behavior had a completely different
   origin. Around 10 o’clock the night before, his dorm mates found him huddled
   on the stair landing, fending off an imaginary alien spaceship circling over his
   head and firing projectiles at him. He was taken to the hospital and sedated; then
   his parents took him back to his hometown, where he spent several months in a
   hospital psychiatric ward. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.
   Fortunately, medication helped, and he was able to move to a home school with
   a comprehensive program of support and rehabilitation.
   Ned has now spent two thirds of his life at the home. A few years ago he wrote
   to Bob, and they have kept up a regular correspondence since; his primary
   motivation is that he remembers his brief time in college as the happiest in his
   life. It is not that the home is unpleasant. He is on the baseball, basketball, and
   golf teams; he works part time outside the home; and he has a girlfriend.
   Questions he asks in his letters reveal a healthy curiosity, usually provoked by
   something he has read or seen on television about the brain. Once he talked
   candidly about his diagnosis, and about how he prefers to believe that someone
   slipped him a dose of LSD on that fateful night. There is no evidence that
   happened, but even if it did, it only precipitated, rather than caused, the decades-
   long debilitation that followed. Despite Ned’s apparently good adjustment—and
   we see only the face that he wants to put on his situation—the preadolescent
   intellectual maturity of his letters and the barely legible scrawl of his
   handwriting suggest the havoc that schizophrenia has wreaked in his brain. Ned
   is unable to function outside the home’s protective environment and professional
   support, and he will never be able to leave.
   Researchers estimate that one out of every four adults in the United States
   suffers from a diagnosable mental illness, and that 46% will fall victim during
   their lifetime (R. C. Kessler et al., 2005). We aren’t sure how many people are
   mentally ill, because researchers rely primarily on self-reports, which are
   notoriously inaccurate. In late-life interviews people recalled bouts of mental
   illness 2–12 times less often, depending on the type of illness, than they had
   reported them in three interviews over the previous 25 years (Takayanagi et al.,
   2014). The monetary cost in terms of treatment and lost wages amounts to $467
   billion a year in the United States (Insel, 2015) and $2.5 trillion globally
   (Trautmann, Rehm, & Wittchen, 2016). According to the World Health
   Organization (2008), mental disorders are the leading cause of disability among
   people aged 15 to 44 in the United States and Canada (Figure 14.1). An obvious
   benefit of research is the development of improved therapeutic techniques; in
   addition, because the disorders involve malfunctions in neurotransmitter systems
   and brain structures, studying them helps researchers understand normal neural
   functioning as well. In this chapter, we will make good use of what you have
   already learned about brain structure and neurotransmitter activity as we
   examine schizophrenia, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders, and in turn this
   survey will further expand your knowledge of how the brain works.

   The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5;
   American Psychiatric Association, 2013), provides the framework for therapists,
   clinicians, and researchers in assessing an individual’s unique history and
   symptoms and arriving at a diagnosis from a long list of disorders (for example,
   see Table 14.1). Many of these disorders have been discussed in prior chapters,
   such as substance-related disorders (Chapter 5), eating disorders (Chapter 6),
   sexual and gender dysfunctions (Chapter 7), aggressive and disruptive disorders
   (Chapter 8), and neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders (Chapters 12 and
   13). This chapter will focus on several of the remaining disorders: schizophrenia
   spectrum disorders, affective disorders, anxiety disorders not covered in Chapter
   8, and obsessive-compulsive disorders.
   Schizophrenia
   Schizophrenia is a debilitating disorder characterized by perceptual,
   emotional, and intellectual deficits; loss of contact with reality; and inability
   to function in life. Schizophrenia is a psychosis, which simply means that the
   individual has severe disturbances of reality, orientation, and thinking.
   Schizophrenia is the most severe of the mental illnesses, and it is particularly
   feared because of the bizarre behavior it produces in many of its victims. All
   social classes are equally vulnerable; though patients themselves “drift” to lower
   socioeconomic levels, when they are classified by their parents’ socioeconomic
   level, the classes are proportionately represented (Huber, Gross, Schüttler, &
   Linz, 1980). Schizophrenia is diagnosed in about 1% of the population
   worldwide; in the United States the rate is 1.2%, or roughly 3.8 million people
   (Nemade & Dombeck, 2009). The economic burden of schizophrenia amounts to
   $156 billion annually in the United States, which included direct health care
   costs (24%), unemployment (38%), and caregiving (34%) (Cloutier et al., 2016).
   Fortunately, schizophrenia is one of the few psychological disorders that appear
   to be on the decline. Critics have attributed the apparent reduction to
   methodological flaws in studies, but a study of all people born in Finland
   between 1954 and 1965 found a significant decline in each successive age-
   group, totaling 29% for women and 33% for men (Suvisaari, Haukka,
   Tanskanen, & Lönnqvist, 1999). This decrease has been noted in other countries
   such as Canada (Woogh, 2001) and Japan (Toshitani et al., 2006), but as of 2017
   there hasn’t been a systematic study in the United States.
   What is schizophrenia, and what causes it?
   Characteristics of the Disorder
   The term schizophrenia was coined in 1911 by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen
   Bleuler (Figure 14.2) from the combination of two Greek words meaning “split
   mind.” Contrary to popular belief, schizophrenia has nothing to do with multiple
   personalities; the term refers to the distortion of thought and emotion, which are
   “split off” from reality. The schizophrenic has some combination of several
   symptoms: hallucinations (internally generated perceptual experiences, such as
   voices telling the person what to do); delusions (false, unfounded beliefs, such as
   that one is a messenger from God); paranoia, characterized by delusions of
   persecution; disordered thought; inappropriate emotions or lack of emotion; and
   social withdrawal. Note that Ned had a hallucination of a spaceship, the paranoid
   delusion that it was attacking him, and a possible delusion about the LSD.
   In the past, people with schizophrenia were subdivided into diagnostic categories
   based on which of these symptoms was predominant, such as paranoid or
   catatonic. However, patients often have overlapping symptoms and can receive
   multiple diagnoses, so there is little belief that these categories represent distinct
   disease processes. Also, as neuroscience and evidence-based practices progress,
   we are realizing that two people can have the same symptom with different
   causes or the same brain defect with different symptoms. As a result, the
   National Institute of Mental Health encourages researchers to shift their focus
   from diagnostic categories to underlying neural and genetic mechanisms (G.
   Miller, 2010). As a first step in that direction, the DSM-5 eliminated these
   subgroups of schizophrenia as diagnostic categories (American Psychiatric
   Association, 2013).
   Figure 14.2 Eugen Bleuler (1857–1939).

   Schizophrenia afflicts men and women about equally often, and there is no
   difference in incidence between urban and rural environments (Saha, Chant, &
   McGrath, 2005). Men usually show the first symptoms during their teens or
   twenties, as Ned did, while the onset for women ordinarily comes about a decade
   later (Figure 14.3). Acute symptoms develop suddenly and are typically more
   responsive to treatment; the prognosis is reasonably good despite brief
   relapses. Symptoms that develop gradually and persist for a long time with
   poor prognosis are called chronic. The media has frequently overplayed the
   bizarre features of schizophrenia; many patients are able to function reasonably
   well, especially if they are fortunate enough to be among those who respond to
   antipsychotic drugs. Among patients studied 20 years after their first psychiatric
   admission, 22% were fully recovered, another 43% were improved, and the
   symptoms of the remaining 35% had remained the same or worsened; 56% were
   fully employed (Huber et al., 1980). A more recent meta-analysis of over 114
   studies performed by Warner (2005) is consistent with this earlier study (20%–
   25% fully recovered).
   Figure 14.3 Risk for Schizophrenia by Age.
   Source: Data from Huber et al. (1980).
   In the late 1700s and early 1800s, doctors began to view mental illness as a
   medical problem; at that time, the mentally ill were literally released from their
   chains and given treatment (Figure 14.4; Andreasen, 1984). By the early 20th
   century, it was widely assumed that schizophrenia had a physiological basis. But
   when the search for biological causes produced little success, the emphasis
   shifted in the 1940s to the social causes of schizophrenia, especially in America,
   where Freud’s theory of psychoanalysis was in its ascendancy and biologically
   oriented psychiatrists were in the minority (Andreasen; Wender, Rosenthal, Kety,
   Schulsinger, & Welner, 1974). Until the 1960s, research techniques were not up
   to the task of demonstrating the validity of the physiological position. It was then
   that increasing knowledge of neurotransmitters, the advent of brain scanning
   techniques, and improved genetic studies shifted the explanation for
   schizophrenia back to the realm of biology and permanently changed the
   perception of mental illness.

   —Ross David Burke in When the Music’s Over: My Journey Into Schizophrenia
   Heredity
   Schizophrenia is a familial disorder, which means that the incidence of
   schizophrenia is higher among the relatives of people with schizophrenia than it
   is in the general population (Gottesman, McGuffin, & Farmer, 1987; Tsuang et
   al., 1991). Of course, this association could be due to environmental influence or
   to heredity; in fact, in the 1940s supporters for both the genetic and
   environmental bases argued for their positions from the same data (Wender et al.,
   1974). However, studies of twins and adoptees provided compelling evidence for
   a genetic influence.
   Twin and Adoption Studies
   In Figure 14.5, you can see that the shared incidence of schizophrenia increases
   with the genetic closeness of the relationship and that the concordance rate for
   schizophrenia is three times as high in identical twins as in fraternal twins
   (Lenzenweger & Gottesman, 1994). In other words, identical twins of people
   with schizophrenia are three times as likely to develop the disorder as the
   fraternal twins of patients. The heritability for schizophrenia has been estimated
   at between .60 and .90 (Tsuang et al., 1991). This means that 10%–40% of the
   variability is due to environmental factors.
   Information from adoption studies gives a more impressive indication of genetic
   influence; these studies show that adopting out of a home with schizophrenia
   provides little or no protection from developing schizophrenia symptoms. The
   incidence of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like symptoms was 28% among
   individuals adopted out of Danish homes in which there was one parent with
   schizophrenia, compared with 10% in matched adoptees from homes without an
   individual with symptoms (Lowing, Mirsky, & Pereira, 1983). Other studies
   have produced similar findings.
   Discordance among identical twins has been used as an argument that
   schizophrenia is environmentally produced. To address this issue, Gottesman and
   Bertelsen (1989) compared the incidence of schizophrenia in the offspring of
   affected and normal identical twins; they found that the offspring of the
   unaffected identical twins were just as likely to be schizophrenic as the offspring
   of the affected twins (Figure 14.6). This result would not have occurred unless
   the normal twins were carrying genes for schizophrenia. Discordance does raise
   the question, however, of whether some environmental factors determine
   whether the person’s schizophrenic genes will remain “silent.” Refer back to
   Chapter 6 for the discussion of these epigenetic effects on genes.

   The Search for the Schizophrenia Genes
   Although we have known for a long time that schizophrenia is partially genetic,
   identifying the genes involved has been difficult. One reason has been
   researchers’ inconsistency in including the spectrum disorders in their diagnosis
   of schizophrenia (Heston, 1970; Lowing et al., 1983). When identical twins are
   discordant for schizophrenia, 48%–54% of the nonschizophrenic twins have
   spectrum disorders (Heston; Onstad, Skre, Torgersen, & Kringlen, 1991). If the
   spectrum disorders are due to the same genes, then classifying these individuals
   as nonschizophrenic means that the genes will not appear to distinguish between
   schizophrenia and normality. A second problem is that schizophrenia apparently
   involves the cumulative effects of multiple genes, each of which has a small
   effect by itself. Evidence indicates that the number of variants contributing to
   schizophrenia is in the thousands (Wray & Visscher, 2010). A person’s risk of
   schizophrenia presumably increases with the number of these genes inherited.
   This view is supported by the fact that risk has been found to increase with the
   number of relatives who are schizophrenic and with the degree of the relatives’
   disability (Heston, 1970; Kendler & Robinette, 1983).
   Recent genome-wide studies have identified at least 108 genes suspected of a
   role in producing schizophrenia (Schizophrenia Working Group, 2014). These
   genes are typically related to neurodevelopment and plasticity,
   neurotransmission (such as dopamine, glutamate, and calcium channels),
   immune responses, and hormonal activity, such as the DISC1 (disrupted in
   schizophrenia 1) gene. This gene appears to change how neurons develop and
   migrate by disrupting a messenger system in neurons in areas involved in
   learning, memory, and mood (J. Y. Kim et al., 2009; Millar et al., 2000; Millar et
   al., 2005). Although many genes such as DISC1 have been linked to
   schizophrenia, they have small individual effects and together may account for
   less than 5% of the variability in susceptibility. Copy number variations (CNVs)
   have much larger effects; for example, a duplication of a segment of DNA on
   chromosome 7 produces a 10-fold increase in risk (Mulle et al., 2014). But
   CNVs are individually rare and make an even smaller contribution than common
   genes. The large majority of CNVs are inherited, but de novo mutations are more
   often implicated in diseases. Along with epigenetic modifications, they help
   account for discordance in identical twins, who otherwise have identical
   genomes. Epigenetic studies of schizophrenia are in their infancy. Though they
   have produced interesting results, our knowledge is based on small numbers of
   subjects and tissues taken from widely varying brain locations. According to one
   group of reviewers, some of the current results may be harder to interpret than
   early small-sample gene association studies (Dempster, Viana, Pidsley, & Mill,
   2013).
   Schizophrenia is a very old disease (see W. J. Ray, 2014, for a review). Disorders
   with psychotic-like symptoms have been reported for 4,000 years, and similar
   rates in disparate and long-separated societies suggest that the genes were
   present before humans left Africa some 100,000 years ago. So why wouldn’t
   genes as detrimental as those that produce schizophrenia be eliminated through
   evolution? One suggestion is that the genes that in combination can produce
   schizophrenia individually confer an evolutionary advantage. Ten or fifteen
   centuries ago, these individual genes might have helped individuals cope with
   the demands of burgeoning social culture. It has been pointed out that many
   gifted Nobel recipients, the likes of Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and John
   Nash (featured in the film A Beautiful Mind), either had some schizophrenic
   traits or had relatives thought to have schizophrenia. In addition, an individual’s
   overall risk for schizophrenia (as well as for bipolar disorder) is highly
   correlated with intellectual and artistic creativity (Power et al., 2015). Therefore,
   our amazing human ability to express, integrate, and create comes with an
   increased risk for psychotic disorders that can be triggered by the same genes
   and circuits.

   The Vulnerability Model
   Most researchers agree that genes determine only the person’s vulnerability for
   the illness; both heredity and environment are needed to explain the etiology
   (causes) of schizophrenia (Zubin & Spring, 1977) as well as most other
   disorders. According to the vulnerability model, some threshold of causal
   forces must be exceeded for the illness to occur; environmental challenges
   combine with a person’s genetic vulnerability to exceed that threshold. The
   environmental challenges may be external, such as bereavement, job difficulties,
   or divorce, or they may be internal, such as maturational changes, poor nutrition,
   infection, or toxic substances. There is mounting evidence that these
   environmental influences work in part by epigenetic means, that is, by
   upregulating and downregulating gene functioning (Tsankova, Renthal, Kumar,
   & Nestler, 2007). Vulnerability is viewed as a continuum, depending on the
   number of affected genes inherited. At one extreme, a small percentage of
   genetically predisposed individuals will become schizophrenic under the normal
   physical and psychological stresses of life; at the other extreme are individuals
   who will become schizophrenic only under the severest stress such as the trauma
   of battle (Fowles, 1992) or because of a constantly stressful life with poor social
   support and family environments (see Lange et al., 2017).
   Two Kinds of Schizophrenia
   Researchers disagree on whether schizophrenia represents one disease or many,
   but most authorities do agree that the symptoms fall into two major categories:
   positive and negative. Positive symptoms involve the presence or exaggeration
   of behaviors, such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and
   abnormal motor behaviors. Negative symptoms are characterized by the
   absence or insufficiency of normal behaviors and include lack of affect
   (emotion), inability to experience pleasure, lack of motivation, poverty of
   speech, and impaired attention and social interactions.
   Crow (1985) theorized that positive and negative symptoms are due to two
   different syndromes of schizophrenia, with different causes and different
   outcomes. His Type I and Type II schizophrenias are described in Table 14.2.
   Subsequent research has supported this distinction in many respects. Positive
   symptoms are more often acute, and they are more likely to respond to
   antipsychotic drugs than are negative symptoms (Fowles, 1992). Negative
   symptoms tend to be chronic; these patients show poorer adjustment prior to the
   onset of the disease (Andreasen, Flaum, Swayze, Tyrrell, & Arndt, 1990); poorer
   prognosis after diagnosis (Dollfus et al., 1996); more intellectual and other
   cognitive deficits, suggestive of a brain disorder (Andreasen et al., 1990); and
   greater reduction in brain tissue (Fowles). These findings led researchers to think
   in terms of two distinct groups of patients, a view we will modify shortly.
   What consoles me is that I am beginning to consider madness as an illness like any other,
   and that I accept it as such.

   The Dopamine Hypothesis
   Little could be done to treat psychotic patients until the mid-1950s, when a
   variety of antipsychotic medications arrived on the scene. For the first time in
   history, the population of hospitalized mental patients decreased in size. As is
   often the case in medicine, and more particularly in mental health, these new
   drugs had not been designed for this purpose—researchers had too little
   understanding of the disease to do so. Doctors tried chlorpromazine with a wide
   variety of mental illnesses because it calmed surgical patients, and it turned out
   to help those with schizophrenia as well. However, it was not clear why
   chlorpromazine worked, because tranquilizers have little or no usefulness in
   treating schizophrenia.
   So, investigators tried reverse engineering. You will remember from Chapter 5
   that amphetamine overdose causes psychotic behavior indistinguishable from
   schizophrenia, complete with hallucinations and paranoid delusions. In time,
   researchers determined that amphetamine produces these symptoms by
   increasing dopaminergic activity. This discovery eventually led to the dopamine
   hypothesis, that schizophrenia involves excessive dopamine activity in the
   brain. According to the theory, blockade of the D 2 type of dopamine receptors is
   essential for a drug to have an antipsychotic effect, and a drug’s effectiveness is
   directly related to the drug’s blocking potency. The theory has considerable
   support; schizophrenic patients typically have higher dopamine activity in the
   striatum (Abi-Dargham et al., 2000), and drugs that block dopamine receptors
   are effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (S. H. Snyder,
   Bannerjee, Yamamura, & Greenberg, 1974). In fact, the effective dosage for
   most antipsychotic drugs is directly proportional to their ability to block
   dopamine receptors (Figure 14.7; Seeman, Lee, Chau-Wong, & Wong, 1976).
   What exactly does dopamine do to trigger the symptoms of schizophrenia? One
   theory, called the aberrant salience hypothesis, suggests that heightened levels
   of dopamine increase attentional and motivational circuits to make ordinary
   environmental features seem significant. Therefore, an individual projects his
   or her own thoughts and imaginings as real-world events and experiences
   (Howes & Nour, 2016).
   Beyond the Dopamine Hypothesis
   However, the drugs did not help 30%–40% of schizophrenic patients, and—
   troublesome for the dopamine theory—nonresponsive patients experienced just
   as much D 2 receptor blockade as responders. In fact, in some of them the
   blockade exceeded 90%, while some responders showed remarkably low levels
   of receptor blocking (Kane, 1987; Pilowsky et al., 1993). Furthermore, some
   patients appear to have a dopamine deficiency, especially those with chronic,
   treatment-resistant symptoms (Grace, 1991; Heritch, 1990; Okubo et al., 1997).
   Another problem for the drugs was that the side effects could be permanently
   disabling. Prolonged use of antidopamine drugs often produces tardive
   dyskinesia, tremors and involuntary movements due to long-term blocking
   of dopamine receptors and resultant neuron death in the basal ganglia. Once
   dyskinesia develops, it persists even after the person stops taking the drug.
   Seventy years ago, this effect was believed to be so inevitably linked to the
   therapeutic benefit that the “right” dose was the one that caused some degree of
   motor side effects. Thus, the drugs used to treat schizophrenia became known as
   neuroleptics, because the term means “to take control of the neuron” (Julien,
   2008). The effect appears to be due to a compensatory increase in the sensitivity
   of D 2 receptors in the basal ganglia. (This is a good illustration of the fact that
   drugs do not affect just the part of the brain we want to treat.)

   Since the early 1990s, we have seen the introduction of several new
   antipsychotic substances that are referred to as atypical or second-generation
   drugs. Atypical antipsychotics block D 2 receptors less strongly, while also
   targeting non-dopamine receptors; as a result, they produce motor problems only
   at much higher doses, but they still reduce psychotic symptoms. Fortunately,
   avoiding motor side effects does not require a therapeutic compromise. The
   major atypical antipsychotics are at least equivalent to the first-generation drugs,
   and some are 15%–25% more effective; what is more, they often bring relief to
   treatment-resistant patients (Iqbal & van Praag, 1995; Leucht et al., 2009; Pickar,
   1995; Siever et al., 1991). So, is the dopamine hypothesis just another example
   of a beautiful hypothesis slain by ugly facts? Not entirely; although atypical
   antipsychotics mostly target other receptors, those that lack at least a modest
   effect at D 2 receptors are therapeutically ineffective (H. M. Jones & Pilowsky,
   2002). So, successful therapy apparently requires D 2 blockade and other effects.
   For a summary of the types of drugs prescribed for individuals with
   schizophrenia, and their side effects, see the accompanying Research Spotlight.
   And what are these other effects? One involves serotonin. The serotonergic
   system is suspect largely because of the 5-HT 2A receptor’s involvement in
   schizophrenic-like responses to hallucinogenic drugs, such as psilocybin and
   LSD. The number of 5-HT 2A receptors is upregulated in the brains of deceased
   schizophrenic subjects (González-Maeso et al., 2008), and atypical
   antipsychotics block serotonin 5-HT 2 receptors by as much as 90% (H. M. Jones
   & Pilowsky, 2002; Kapur, Zipursky, & Remington, 1999). But serotonin has not
   received nearly as much attention as glutamate activity, which also is affected by
   atypical antipsychotics. The drug phencyclidine (PCP), which inhibits the
   NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartic acid) subtype of glutamate receptor, mimics
   schizophrenia far better than amphetamine does, particularly in producing
   negative as well as positive symptoms (Sawa & Snyder, 2002). Glycine activates
   the NMDA receptor, and adding it or similar compounds to antipsychotic
   medications reduces both kinds of symptoms (Lisman et al., 2008). According to
   the glutamate theory, hypofunction of NMDA receptors results in increases
   in glutamate and downstream increases in dopamine, which together
   produce positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (Lisman et al.;
   Sendt, Giaroli, & Tracy, 2012). Indeed, genes that underlie glutamate signaling
   are correlated with the severity of schizophrenia and related disorders (N. L.
   O’Brien et al., 2014). However, it has been difficult to develop drugs that target
   NMDA receptors or reduce glutamate levels, and that are both therapeutically
   effective and well tolerated (Sendt et al.). Those that do work produce modest
   results, and a couple of them are in final phase 3 clinical trials.
   Research Spotlight: Antipsychotics and Their Side Effects
   Antipsychotic medication is generally classified in two different categories: first-generation
   antipsychotics (FGA), and second-generation (atypical) drugs (SGA). Each has its own unique
   qualities and side effects. Although each is effective in preventing the positive symptoms of
   schizophrenia, they are less likely to affect the negative symptoms.
   FGA drugs include Thorazine (chlorpromazine) and Haldol (haloperidol). Potent D 2 blockers,
   they help alleviate positive symptoms in most individuals with schizophrenia. They have four
   major categories of side effects (Preston, O’Neal, & Talaga, 2013). The first is called
   extrapyramidal effects and is a result of excessive blocking of dopamine receptors; impaired
   movement such as tardive dyskinesia, shuffling gait, tremors, and a blank facial expression are a
   result of damage to the basal ganglia (the “extrapyramidal” region) and mimic Parkinson’s
   disease. Although many of these side effects are immediately apparent with FGAs, the tardive
   dyskinesia is seen only after prolonged use. This is common for Haldol. Anticholinergic side
   effects are due to blocking acetylcholine receptors and the parasympathetic nervous system and
   includes dry mouth and eyes, constipation, and sedation; this is common for Thorazine.
   Antiadrenergic side effects are caused by blocking the sympathetic nervous system and can
   result in low blood pressure and lightheadedness.
   SGA drugs include clozapine, Abilify (aripiprazole), Latuda (lurasidone), and Seroquel
   (quetiapine). They weakly block D 2 receptors but strongly block serotonin receptors. Because
   dopamine is not strongly blocked, there is a much smaller risk of extrapyramidal effects and
   tardive dyskinesia. However, these drugs carry their own set of undesirable side effects. They
   tend to cause sleepiness, can result in weight gain, and are more effective in reducing the
   negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Two major side effects that rarely occur are
   agranulocytosis (a life-threatening blood disorder; Idänpään-Heikkilä, Alhava, Olkinuora, &
   Palva, 1977) and serotonin syndrome (which causes sweating, high body temperature, seizures,
   headaches, and confusion; Buckley, Dawson, & Isbister, 2014). Both are life threatening and
   must be treated by medical administration of either blood factors (for agranulocytosis) or
   serotonin agonists (for serotonin syndrome).
   Obviously, it would be a mistake to focus entirely on a single neurotransmitter,
   considering the complex interactions among them. The glutamate theory
   provides some recognition of this fact, and it is showing considerable usefulness
   in explaining schizophrenia and some promise in guiding drug development.
   While we wait for the glutamate story to unfold, we have additional clues about
   the origins of schizophrenia from structural and functional anomalies in the
   brain.
   Brain Anomalies in Schizophrenia
   Malfunctions have been identified in virtually every part of the brain in people
   with schizophrenia. The most consistent finding has been enlargement of the
   ventricles; another is hypofrontality, or reduced activity in the frontal lobes. We
   will examine each of these defects in turn.

   Schizophrenia.

   with permission.
   Brain Tissue Deficits and Ventricular Enlargement
   A signature characteristic of schizophrenia is a decrease in brain tissue, both
   gray and white matter, with deficits reported in at least 50 different brain areas
   (Honea, Crow, Passingham, & Mackay, 2005). The number of sites and the
   variability across studies attest to the multifaceted nature of schizophrenia, but
   the frequency with which deficiencies are found in the frontal and temporal
   lobes indicates that they are particularly important. These tissue losses are
   accompanied by alterations in neural functioning but not necessarily in the
   expected direction: Activity is decreased in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex but
   increased in the orbitofrontal cortex and in a subregion of the hippocampus
   (Schobel et al., 2009). In fact, the hippocampal activation is so characteristic of
   schizophrenia that in a group of people having brief psychotic symptoms, it
   identified with 70% accuracy those who would later be diagnosed with full-
   blown schizophrenia (Schobel et al.).
   What brain defects have been found in schizophrenia?
   An indication of the tissue deficits seen in schizophrenia is ventricular
   enlargement; this is because the ventricles expand to take up space normally
   occupied by brain cells (Figure 14.8). Both deficiencies are usually subtle, on the
   order of less than a tablespoonful increase in ventricular volume (Suddath et al.,
   1989) and a 2% decrease in brain volume (Haijma et al., 2012; Harrison et al.,
   2003), but these figures belie the functional importance of the losses. In fact, an
   often-distinguishing feature between identical twins discordant for schizophrenia
   is the size of their ventricles (Suddath, Christison, Torrey, Casanova, &
   Weinberger, 1990). Ventricular enlargement is not specific to schizophrenia;
   enlarged ventricles are also associated with several other conditions, including
   old age, dementia (loss of cognitive abilities), Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s
   chorea (Weinberger & Wyatt, 1983), and alcoholism with dementia (D. M. Smith
   & Atkinson, 1995). Nor are enlarged ventricles an inherent characteristic of
   schizophrenia. As you can see in Figure 14.8a, several controls have enlarged
   ventricles, and many of the patients have ventricle sizes in the normal range. We
   will look more closely at the tissue deficits later when we consider their origins.
   Hypofrontality
   Earlier, we saw that prefrontal functioning can be assessed by using the
   gambling task; an alternative technique is the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test,
   which requires individuals to change strategies in midstream, first sorting
   cards using one criterion but then changing to another. Many people with
   schizophrenia perform poorly on the test, persisting with the previous sorting
   strategy. Normal individuals show increased activation in the prefrontal area
   during the test; schizophrenic patients typically do not, despite normal activation
   in other areas (D. R. Weinberger, Berman, & Zec, 1986). Figure 14.9 shows a
   normal brain practically lighting up during the test, in comparison with the
   schizophrenic brain, especially in the frontal area called the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex. This hypofrontality apparently involves prefrontal dopamine
   deficiency, because administering amphetamine increases blood flow in the
   prefrontal cortex and improves performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
   (Daniel et al., 1991). Traumatic injury to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex causes
   impairments like the symptoms of schizophrenia: flat affect, social withdrawal,
   reduced intelligence and problem-solving ability, diminished motivation and
   work capacity, and impaired attention and concentration (Weinberger et al.,
   1986). Because of the frontal lobes’ involvement in planning actions,
   recognizing the consequences of actions, and managing working memory, it is
   not surprising that frontal dysfunction would cause major abnormalities in
   thinking and behavior.
   Neural Connections and Synchrony
   Recent attention has been shifting away from localized deficits and focusing
   instead on disrupted coordination of neural activity across brain areas. For
   example, in normal controls performing a working-memory task, activity in the
   hippocampal formation varies together with prefrontal activity, but this
   coordination is absent in people with schizophrenia (Meyer-Lindberg et al.,
   2005). The hypofrontality seen during the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test has been
   attributed to disrupted communication between the hippocampus and the
   prefrontal cortex (Weinberger, Berman, Suddath, & Torrey, 1992). Inadequate
   coordination between brain areas is at least partly due to white matter reduction;
   white matter loss has been consistently reported in the brains of people with
   schizophrenia, particularly in prefrontal and temporal areas (Begré & Koenig,
   2008; Ellison-Wright & Bullmore, 2009). Diffusion tensor imaging shows that
   the quality of connections is compromised throughout much of the brain (B. R.
   Lee et al., 2013). Recent studies also documented an overall decrease in cortical
   thickness, changes in neuronal maturation, and reduced cortical folding in the
   cingulate-frontal-temporal circuit, suggesting that hypofrontality may be a result
   of decreased gray and white matter in frontal-associated circuits (Alexander-
   Bloch et al., 2014; Nanda et al., 2014). Reduced connectivity between frontal
   and posterior regions of the brain correlates with positive and negative
   symptoms as well as with performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.

   Sorting Test.

   Cortex in Schizophrenia: I. Regional Cerebral Blood Flow Evidence,” by

   Psychiatry, 43, pp. 114–124.
   Brain functioning is coordinated by synchronized firing that links the activity of
   neurons within a cortical area, across areas, and even between hemispheres. This
   synchronization is widely believed to be critical to perceptual binding and
   cognitive performance, and it is one of the functions disrupted in schizophrenia
   (Uhlhaas & Singer, 2010). Synchronized activity in frontal-thalamocortical
   circuits occurred at lower frequencies in patients (Ferrarelli et al., 2012), perhaps
   because the reduced white matter connections cannot support coordination at
   higher frequencies. Frequency reduction averaged 10 Hz in the frontal cortex;
   the deficit was greatest in the prefrontal area, and the frequency loss there was
   correlated with positive and negative symptoms. To some extent we can
   correlate the patterns of synchrony with the symptoms of schizophrenia; in
   patients with positive symptoms, for example, oscillation synchrony is enhanced
   within limited areas but is deficient between areas (Uhlhaas & Singer). This
   enhanced synchrony, which indicates hyperexcitability, is seen in the occipital
   area in visual hallucinators (Spencer et al., 2004) and in the left auditory cortex
   in auditory hallucinators (Spencer, Niznikiewicz, Nestor, Shenton, & McCarley,
   2009). At the same time, auditory hallucinators fail to show normal synchrony
   between frontal and temporal areas while talking (Ford, Mathalon, Whitfield,
   Faustman, & Roth, 2002).

   It may surprise you to learn that hallucinations are associated with activity in the
   respective sensory areas. Scans of the brains of people with schizophrenia show
   that language areas are active during auditory hallucinations and visual areas are
   active during visual hallucinations (Figure 14.10; McGuire, Shah, & Murray,
   1993; McGuire et al., 1995; Silbersweig et al., 1995). Because these areas are
   activated in normal individuals when they are engaged in “inner speech” (talking
   to oneself) and imagining visual scenes, it appears that the hallucinating
   schizophrenic is not simply imagining voices and images but is misperceiving
   self-generated thoughts.

   gating in schizophrenia research: a review and evaluation,” by J. Smucny,

   5, pp. e587.
   One of the most documented symptoms of schizophrenia is the inability to
   suppress environmental sounds. With sensory gating impaired, the intrusion of
   non-attended stimuli such as traffic noise or a distant conversation is not just
   annoying but can be interpreted by the person with schizophrenia as threatening.
   Impaired sensory gating can be a useful diagnostic tool for schizophrenia. Most
   people will “gate out” the second of two clicks presented a half-second apart,
   indicated by a reduction in the P50 EEG wave, but individuals with
   schizophrenia typically have an abnormal P50 wave (Figure 14.11). This deficit
   is also associated with reduced synchrony across wide areas of the brain (M. H.
   Hall, Taylor, Salisbury, & Levy, 2010). Atypical antipsychotics improve gating,
   but nicotine normalizes it (Adler et al., 2004; Kumari & Postma, 2005). The
   smoking rate declined in the United States from 42% in 1965 to about 15% in
   2015 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015b), but the rate remained
   about 80% among people with schizophrenia (Keltner & Grant, 2006), in an
   apparent attempt at self-medication. Besides sensory gating, nicotine improves
   several negative symptoms, including impaired visual tracking of moving
   objects, working memory, and other cognitive abilities (Sacco, Bannon, &
   George, 2004; Sacco et al., 2005; Tregellas, Tanabe, Martin, & Freedman, 2005).
   Nicotine appears to compensate for diminished functioning of nicotinic
   acetylcholine receptors (S. I. Deutsch et al., 2005), increase glutamate and
   GABA release, and increase dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex where it is
   depleted in hypofrontality (Kumari & Postma; Sata et al., 2008). Three studies
   have linked schizophrenia with one of the genes responsible for nicotinic
   receptors (De Luca, Wang, et al., 2004; S. I. Deutsch et al., 2005).
   There may very well be other changes to the brain due to schizophrenia. A large
   coalition of European researchers and pharmaceutical companies is undertaking
   a €16.5 million ($18.8 million) study called PRISM (Psychiatric Ratings Using
   Intermediate Stratified Markers); they will follow individuals with schizophrenia
   and other neurological disorders to determine the biological roots of the negative
   symptom of social withdrawal that is common to the groups (Underwood, 2016).
   Environmental Origins of the Brain and Transmitter
   Anomalies
   An obvious potential cause of brain defects would be head injury. Several studies
   have reported an association between schizophrenia and brain damage that
   occurred within a few years prior to diagnosis (reviewed in David & Prince,
   2005). However, the studies have been criticized for several methodological
   inadequacies, including reliance on patients’ and relatives’ memory of the
   injuries, casual diagnosis of schizophrenia, and failure to consider accident
   proneness and preinjury symptoms as confounding factors (David & Prince,
   2005; Nielsen, Mortensen, O’Callaghan, Mors, & Ewald, 2002). A later study of
   almost 114,000 Danish citizens found a correlation between severe head injury
   and schizophrenia; injury occurring between 11 and 14 years of age increased
   the likelihood of schizophrenia by 65% (Orlovska et al., 2014). However,
   researchers cannot separate the effects of the physical injury to the brain from
   the emotional effects of the stress and anxiety caused by the injury experience.
   The evidence is stronger for a variety of influences at the time of birth or during
   the prenatal period. These include both physical complications (Cannon, Jones,
   & Murray, 2002) and emotional stresses on the mother, such as death of the
   father (Huttunen, 1989) and military invasion (van Os & Selten, 1998). Prenatal
   stress in mice results in upregulation of 5-HT 2A receptors and downregulation of
   mGlu 2 receptors, both of which are seen in the brains of schizophrenia patients
   (Holloway et al., 2013). One indication that birth and pregnancy complications
   contribute to brain deficits is that they are associated with enlarged ventricles
   later in life (Pearlson et al., 1989). They are a possible explanation for the
   difference in ventricle size between identical twins (Bracha, Torrey, Gottesman,
   Bigelow, & Cunniff, 1992).
   It is easy to see how birth complications, such as being born with the umbilical
   cord around the neck, could differentiate between twins, but different
   experiences in the womb require some explanation. Identical twins may share
   the same placenta and amniotic sac or they may have their own, depending on
   whether the developing organism splits in two before or after the fourth day of
   development. Identical twins who did not share a placenta had an 11%
   concordance rate for schizophrenia, compared with 60% for those who shared a
   placenta, presumably due to the sharing of infections (J. O. Davis, Phelps, &
   Bracha, 1995). In spite of the importance of prenatal factors, some researchers
   believe that they produce schizophrenia only in individuals who are already
   genetically vulnerable (Schulsinger et al., 1984).
   The winter birth effect refers to the fact that more people who develop
   schizophrenia are born during the winter and spring than during any other
   time of the year. The effect has been replicated in a large number of studies,
   some with more than 50,000 schizophrenic patients as subjects (T. N. Bradbury
   & Miller, 1985). The important factor in winter births is not cold weather, but the
   fact that infants born between January and May would have been in the second
   trimester of prenatal development in the fall or early winter, when there is a high
   incidence of infectious diseases (C. G. Watson, Kucala, Tilleskjor, & Jacobs,
   1984). There is good evidence that the mother’s exposure to viral infections
   during the fourth through sixth months of pregnancy (second trimester) increases
   the risk of schizophrenia. This appears to be caused not by the virus itself but by
   the immune reaction that it triggers. This conclusion is supported by a markedly
   higher level of interleukin-1β in the spinal fluid of first-episode patients,
   indicating that an immune response has occurred (Figure 14.12; Söderlund et al.,
   2009). Because the patients were infection free at the time, the infection must
   have occurred earlier, possibly during the prenatal period.

   Several illnesses have been implicated, but the effect of influenza has been
   researched most frequently, and a higher incidence of schizophrenic births has
   been confirmed following influenza outbreaks in several countries. Figure 14.13
   shows that during years of high influenza infection the birth rate of people later
   diagnosed with schizophrenia increases during winter and spring; also, there is a
   peak of such births a few months after the start of epidemics. However, these
   studies could not confirm that the individual mothers had been exposed to the
   influenza virus; by analyzing the blood specimens drawn from expectant
   mothers, Alan Brown and his colleagues (2004) found a sevenfold increased risk
   for schizophrenia and spectrum disorders when influenza antibodies were
   present, and they estimated that influenza infection accounts for 14% of
   schizophrenia cases. As was the case with stress, maternal infection with the
   influenza virus upregulates 5-HT 2A receptors and downregulates mGlu 2
   receptors in the frontal cortex of the offspring (Moreno et al., 2011). Injecting
   pregnant mice with a drug that activates the immune system produced the same
   result, suggesting that immune responses are responsible for the receptor
   alterations in schizophrenia (Holloway et al., 2013).
   Prenatal starvation is another pathway to schizophrenia that until recently was
   the subject of controversy. The idea came about after the rate of schizophrenia
   doubled among the offspring of mothers who were pregnant during Hitler’s
   1944–1945 food blockade of the Netherlands (Susser et al., 1996). However, the
   interpretation was questionable because the sample was small and because toxins
   in the tulip bulbs the women ate to survive could have been to blame. But now
   data from a much larger sample of adults born during the 1959–1961 famine in
   China have confirmed the association, with an increase in schizophrenia from
   0.84% to 2.15% (St. Clair et al., 2005).
   Most of the environmental influences we have been discussing occur during
   pregnancy or birth; one, however, relates to the father. There is a greater risk of
   schizophrenia if the father’s age at the time of conception exceeds 25, and by
   paternal age of 50 the risk has increased by two thirds (B. Miller et al., 2010).
   The mechanism for this effect is unknown, but chances are it is epigenetic, due
   either to the normal aging process or to an accumulation of external
   environmental insults. Epigenetic effects in general can be traced to a variety of
   environmental influences, including toxins, diet, starvation, drugs, and stress;
   they likely account for most of the environmental influences we have been
   talking about. The fact that obesity in the Dutch hunger winter offspring was
   linked to epigenetic changes (see Chapter 6) makes us suspect the same
   mechanism in the cases of schizophrenia in that group. This is a relatively new
   area of investigation, so there has been little documentation of epigenetic
   influences in schizophrenia.
   Schizophrenia as a Developmental Disease
   The defects in the brains of people diagnosed with schizophrenia apparently
   occur early in life, some at the time of birth or before. In some cases, it appears
   that many neurons in the temporal and frontal lobes failed to migrate to the outer
   areas of the cortex during the second trimester; they are disorganized and
   mislocated in the deeper white layers (Figure 14.14; Akbarian, Bunney, et al.,
   1993; Akbarian, Viñuela, et al., 1993). The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex
   are 30%–50% deficient in reelin, a protein that functions as a stop factor for
   migrating neurons (Fatemi, Earle, & McMenomy, 2000; Guidotti et al., 2000). In
   addition, neurons generated from stem cells derived from skin cells of
   individuals with schizophrenia exhibited impairment of signaling molecules that
   are responsible for neuronal differentiation (Topol et al., 2016). These
   observations and the association of schizophrenia with birth trauma and prenatal
   viral infection all argue for early damage to the brain or a disruption of
   development.

   Epidemics in England and Wales (1939–1960).

   This view is supported by behavioral data. Home movies of children who later
   became schizophrenic revealed more negative facial expressions and physical
   awkwardness than in their healthy siblings; the movies were rated by judges who
   were unaware of the children’s later outcome (Walker, Lewine, & Neumann,
   1996). Among New Zealanders followed from age 3 to 32, those who later
   developed schizophrenia had deficits in learning, attention, and problem solving
   during childhood, and for each year of life they fell an additional two to three
   months further behind other children (Reichenberg et al., 2010).
   Gray matter deficit and ventricular enlargement are ordinarily present at the time
   of patients’ diagnosis (Degreef et al., 1992). Most of the evidence indicates that
   the loss of brain volume occurs rapidly and dramatically in adolescence or young
   adulthood and then levels off (B. T. Woods, 1998). Adolescence is a particularly
   significant period in the development of schizophrenia. This is a time when
   symptoms of schizophrenia often begin to develop and a time of brain
   maturation, including frontal myelination and connection of temporal limbic
   areas (D. R. Weinberger & Lipska, 1995). Thompson, Vidal, et al. (2001)
   identified a group of adolescents who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia
   and used MRIs to track their brain development. At the age of 13, there was little
   departure from the normal amount of gray matter loss that occurs with circuit
   pruning, but over the next five years, loss occurred in some areas as rapidly as
   5% per year (Figure 14.15). The nature of the symptoms varied as the loss
   progressed from parietal to temporal to frontal areas. Studies have found no
   evidence of dying neurons or of the inflammation that would be expected with
   an ongoing degenerative disease; instead, gray matter deficits have been
   attributed to loss of synapses (Jarskog, Glantz, Gilmore, & Lieberman, 2005; D.
   A. Lewis & Levitt, 2002; D. R. Weinberger, 1987). This apparent severe pruning
   may reflect the elimination of circuits that have already been diminished (D. A.
   Lewis & Levitt) by a lack of glutamate activity (Coyle, 2006) or through
   neuronal cell death pathways (Jarskog et al., 2005); this view is supported by the
   fact that the diagnosis of schizophrenia preceded significant gray matter
   reductions in the schizophrenic adolescents.

   Affective Disorders
   The affective (mood) disorders include depressive disorders, mania, and bipolar
   disorders (Figure 14.16). Almost all of us occasionally experience depression,
   an intense feeling of sadness; we feel depressed over grades, a bad relationship,
   or loss of a loved one. This reactive depression can be severe, but major
   depression goes beyond the normal reaction to life’s challenges. In major (or
   unipolar) depressive disorder (MDD), a person often feels sad to the point of
   hopelessness for weeks at a time; loses the ability to enjoy life, relationships,
   and sex; and experiences loss of energy and appetite, slowness of thought,
   and sleep disturbance. In some cases, the person is also agitated or restless.
   Stress is often a contributing factor, but major depression can occur for no
   apparent reason. Mania involves excess energy and confidence that often
   leads to grandiose schemes; decreased need for sleep, increased sexual drive,
   and abuse of drugs are common.
   What are the affective disorders?
   The DSM-5 now considers bipolar disorder to be a cluster of disorders, separate
   from depressive disorders and serving as a bridge between depression and
   schizophrenia (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Bipolar disorder was
   once called “manic-depressive” disorder, but as you will learn in this chapter,
   mania is not always a characteristic of this group of disorders. In bipolar
   disorder, a person alternates between periods of depression and either mania
   (bipolar I) or hypomania (bipolar II); mania can occur in the absence of
   depression, but this is rare and the treatment is the same as for bipolar I disorder.
   In addition, bipolar I patients often demonstrate psychotic features such as
   delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, or bizarre behavior, which has led
   psychologists to consider bipolar I as a bridge disorder between schizophrenia
   and depression. Finally, there is a third major category of bipolar disorder called
   cyclothymic disorder, in which individuals cycle rapidly between hypomania and
   mild depression. Two quotes provide some insight into the disorders from the
   patients’ own perspectives (National Institute of Mental Health, 1986):
   Depression: I doubt completely my ability to do anything well. It seems as
   though my mind has slowed down and burned out to the point of being
   virtually useless. . . . [I am] haunt[ed] . . . with the total, the desperate
   hopelessness of it all. . . . If I can’t feel, move, think, or care, then what on
   earth is the point?
   Figure 14.16 Major Categories of Affective Disorders.
   Mania: At first when I’m high, it’s tremendous . . . ideas are fast . . . like
   shooting stars you follow until brighter ones appear . . . all shyness
   disappears, the right words and gestures are suddenly there. . . . Sensuality
   is pervasive, the desire to seduce and be seduced is irresistible. Your
   marrow is infused with unbelievable feelings of ease, power, well-being,
   omnipotence, euphoria . . . you can do anything . . . but, somewhere this
   changes.
   The most recent data indicate that 3 out of 10 people will suffer a mood disorder
   in their lifetimes, most likely depression (Kessler, Petukhova, Sampson,
   Zaslavsky, & Wittchen, 2012). Women are two to three times more likely than
   men to suffer from MDD during their lifetimes; bipolar disorder occurs equally
   often in both sexes (Gershon, Bunney, Leckman, Van Eerdewegh, & DeBauche,
   1976; P. W. Gold, Goodwin, & Chrousos, 1988) at a rate of about 4.5% (Kessler,
   Merikangas, & Wang, 2007). The risk for MDD increases with age in men,
   whereas women experience their peak risk between the ages of 35 and 45; the
   period of greatest risk for bipolar disorder is in the early 20s to around the age of
   30. Getting a handle on the economic burden of these disorders is difficult,
   because it depends on what costs are included and what assumptions are made.
   Estimates of the annual cost for all mood disorders in the United States have
   varied from $24 billion to $234 billion (Dilsaver, 2011; Greenberg et al., 2003;
   Uhl & Grow, 2004). Regardless of the economic cost, by 2020 depression will
   be the second largest cause of disability worldwide (Patel, 2009).
   Heredity
   As with schizophrenia, there is strong evidence that affective disorders are
   partially heritable. Part of that evidence is the increased incidence of affective
   disorders among patients’ relatives. When one identical twin has an affective
   disorder, the probability that the other twin will have the illness as well is about
   69%, compared with 13% in fraternal twins (Gershon et al., 1976). Lack of
   complete concordance in identical twins indicates that there is an environmental
   contribution. However, the concordance rate drops surprisingly little when
   identical twins are reared apart (J. Price, 1968), which may mean that the most
   important environmental influences occur in the prenatal period or shortly after.
   Genetic liability differs by gender; a Swedish twin study estimated heritability at
   29% for men and 42% for women (Kendler, Gatz, Gardner, & Pedersen, 2006).
   These results were consistent with studies in the United States and Australia, as
   well as with studies that identified different chromosomal locations for risk
   factors in men and women. In one study, seven genes were exclusive to men,
   nine were exclusive to women, and only three were shared between men and
   women (Zubenko, Hughes, Stiffler, Zubenko, & Kaplan, 2002). The sex
   disparity suggests one reason disorder genes can be difficult to locate in a
   clinical group, and it may explain the higher frequency of depression in women
   and the higher rate of suicide in men.
   Once again, the genes we are interested in are many and of small effect,
   requiring much larger sample sizes than are typically employed. Researchers are
   more and more resorting to meta-analyses, which pool the results of many
   studies. One finding is that the 5-HTTLPR portion of the SLC6A4 serotonin
   transporter gene has been associated with an increased vulnerability to
   depression, along with a 15% reduction in gray matter in the amygdala and a
   25% reduction in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (Pezawas et al., 2005).
   People with the short variation show an exaggerated amygdala response to
   fearful facial expressions (Hariri et al., 2002), apparently due to a loss of
   feedback from the cingulate cortex that would ordinarily dampen amygdala
   activity (Pezawas et al., 2005). According to some studies, these deficiencies
   increase susceptibility to stress, which leads to depression (Figure 14.17; Canli
   et al., 2006; Caspi et al., 2003). Although a meta-analysis that pooled 56 studies
   produced a strong confirmation of the linkage (Karg, Burmeister, Shedden, &
   Sen, 2011), not all studies have confirmed it. One reason may be that studies
   rarely consider gene interactions such as epistasis, the suppression of one gene’s
   effect by another. In this case, the VAL66MET allele of the gene for brain-
   derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that encourages neuron growth
   and survival, protects against the effects of the 5-HTTLPR short allele on brain
   development (Pezawas et al., 2008). A later meta-analysis confirmed that
   VAL66MET also reduces vulnerability to depression (Hosang, Shiles, Tansey,
   McGuffin, & Uher, 2014).
   Whole-genome studies have been extremely beneficial because researchers can
   explore the genome without any hypothesis or even an educated guess about
   what to look for. But the statistical procedure used to confirm an association
   must be corrected for the increased probability of a chance “hit” due to the
   millions of comparisons performed, which makes it even harder to find genes
   that have a small effect. One solution is to increase the effect size by targeting a
   limited group of subjects; a gene location on chromosome 3 was identified only
   when researchers limited their search to patients with severe depression (Breen
   et al., 2011). Another approach is to limit the search to the genes known to be
   involved in a relevant pathway; knowledge that the immune system is
   dysregulated in depression led researchers to discover several candidate immune
   system genes (Bufalino, Hepgui, Aguglia, & Pariaante, 2013).
   A common characteristic of depression is disruption of the circadian (day–night)
   cycle, which is controlled by numerous genes (Bunney et al., 2015). At last
   count, at least 11 circadian genes were disrupted in patients with major
   depression (J. Z. Li et al., 2013). These genes are in the pineal gland (which
   secretes the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin), the pituitary gland (which
   controls hormone levels in the body), and most important, the anterior cingulate
   cortex (which, as we discussed in Chapter 8, is involved in autonomic functions,
   reward, decision making, and emotion). It is this last area that probably causes
   the alteration in mood we see in affective disorders.
   Despite similarities between depression and bipolar disorder, they are genetically
   independent of each other (P. W. Gold et al., 1988; Moldin, Reich, & Rice,
   1991). In fact, there is a much higher genetic correlation between bipolar
   disorder and schizophrenia (68%) than mood disorders (43%; Cross-Disorder
   Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013). Bipolar disorder is more
   heritable than either depression or schizophrenia, with estimates of 85% and
   93% (Kieseppä, Partonen, Haukka, Kaprio, & Lönnqvist, 2004; McGuffin et al.,
   2003). Few genes have been confirmed, however, apparently again because of
   small sample sizes. An unusually large genome-wide study that included 9,747
   patients confirmed three previously discovered genes and added two more
   (Mühleisen et al., 2014). The genes’ functions involve a calcium channel at the
   nodes of Ranvier and cellular functioning and signaling. The Cross-Disorder
   Group study, with 33,332 patients, reported that some genes are shared among
   five disorders: bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, autism
   spectrum disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Cross-Disorder
   Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium). Genetic sharing is one of the
   arguments for considering these disorders as a continuum. Whether that is
   appropriate or not, you should understand that all five of these disorders do have
   a variety of functional and structural characteristics in common. Finally,
   mutations have been found in bipolar patients in three genes that control
   circadian rhythms, none of which overlapped with the five associated with
   depression (McGrath et al., 2009; Soria et al., 2010).
   The Monoamine Hypothesis of Depression
   The first effective treatment for depression was discovered accidentally, and
   theory again followed practice rather than the other way around. Iproniazid was
   introduced as a treatment for tuberculosis, but it was soon discovered that the
   drug produced elevation of mood (Crane, 1957) and was an effective
   antidepressant (Schildkraut, 1965). Iproniazid was later abandoned as an
   antidepressant because of its side effects, but its ability to increase activity at the
   monoamine receptors led researchers to the monoamine hypothesis, that
   depression involves reduced activity at norepinephrine and serotonin
   synapses. You may remember that the monoamines also include dopamine, but
   because dopamine agonists such as amphetamines produced inconsistent
   therapeutic results, researchers have limited their interest to norepinephrine and
   serotonin.
   What is the monoamine hypothesis?
   Figure 14.17 The Role of Stress and the Serotonin Transporter Gene in
   Depression.

   Polymorphism in the 5-htt Gene,” by A. Caspi et al., Science, 301, pp. 386–

   All the effective antidepressant drugs increase the activity of norepinephrine or
   serotonin, or both, at the synapses. They do this in different ways. Some block
   the destruction of excess monoamines by enzymes in the terminals (monoamine
   oxidase inhibitors), whereas others block reuptake at the synapse (tricyclic
   antidepressants). Atypical (second-generation) antidepressants affect a single
   neurotransmitter; for example, Prozac (fluoxetine) is one of several selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Finally, some antidepressants have a mixed effect
   on multiple neurotransmitter systems and are effective for specific combinations
   of disorders. For instance, Cymbalta (duloxetine) is one of several serotonin and
   norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. This last group’s effectiveness truly supports
   the monoamine hypothesis. The synaptic effects of antidepressants can occur
   within hours, but symptom improvement usually takes two to three weeks
   through the gradual modification of cortical circuits.
   Additional evidence to support the monoamine hypothesis is that serotonin and
   norepinephrine are involved in behaviors that are disturbed in affective
   disorders. Serotonin plays a role in mood, activity level, sleep and daily rhythms,
   feeding behavior, sexual activity, body temperature regulation, and cognitive
   function (Meltzer, 1990; Siever et al., 1991). Because the noradrenergic system
   is involved in responsiveness and sensitivity to the environment, reduced
   norepinephrine activity may contribute to the depressed individual’s slowed
   behavior, lack of goal-directed activity, and unresponsiveness to environmental
   change (Siever et al.).
   Earlier, we saw that nicotine provides some relief from symptoms of
   schizophrenia. Nonnicotine ingredients in tobacco smoke also have been found
   to act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors. This would explain why smoking is so
   frequent among those with depression and why they have difficulty giving up
   smoking (J. S. Fowler et al., 1996; Khalil, Davies, & Catagnoli, 2006). We
   mention a therapeutic effect of smoking for the second time only to illustrate
   again how people may self-medicate without being aware they are doing it and
   why some people have so much trouble quitting; if it sounds as though the
   benefits of smoking outweigh the cost to the smoker’s health, reread the section
   on nicotine in Chapter 5. Figure 14.18 is a dramatic demonstration of the
   extensive effect of smoking on monoamine oxidase inhibitor levels throughout
   the body.
   Treatment resistance and the delay required for drugs to take effect are serious
   issues, especially if the patient is suicidal. Experiments with ketamine, which
   was developed as an anesthetic but gained infamy as a club drug, suggest that
   these problems might be avoidable. In a study with patients who had shown
   resistance to at least two antidepressant drugs, a single injection of ketamine
   alleviated depression in 68%, and the improvement lasted seven days in 46% of
   the patients (Murrough et al., 2013). Relapse time is highly variable, though, and
   ketamine appears to be most valuable as a temporary treatment (aan het Rot et
   al., 2010). Ketamine also interests us because its effect is not on norepinephrine
   or serotonin; instead, it has its antidepressant effect by activating AMPA
   receptors (Zanos et al., 2016), implicating glutamate function in depression as
   well as in schizophrenia.

   About 30%–50% of depressed patients fail to respond to drug therapy, a statistic
   made worse by the fact that the placebo response rate alone is 30% (Depression
   Guideline Panel, 1993). Lack of response is partly related to symptom severity;
   patients with mild or moderate symptoms receive little or no relief, but for
   patients with severe depression the benefit of medications is substantial
   (Fournier et al., 2010). So how do we treat drug-resistant forms of depression?
   Cognitive-behavioral therapy is generally about as effective as antidepressants,
   and when it was added to the usual treatment in resistant patients, depression
   scores improved by 50% or more in 46% of patients, compared with 22% in
   those who remained in typical treatment (Wiles et al., 2013). One thing that must
   be clear to you by now is how much therapeutic effectiveness depends on
   designing drugs to affect the right receptors and avoiding effects at sites that
   would produce side effects. This is the subject of the accompanying Application.
   Application: Targeting Drugs to Specific Receptors

   As we have already mentioned, the most prescribed class of antidepressant medications today is
   the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Although mood disorders are most
   commonly linked to serotonin (5-HT), abnormal function of other receptors and
   neurotransmitters can cause similar behavioral changes. For instance, there could be an
   imbalance of norepinephrine or dopamine. Newer antidepressant medications are designed to
   stimulate different classes of receptors or to bind to only one of several receptor subtypes. For
   instance, a class of drugs called SNRIs increases the amounts of both serotonin and
   norepinephrine, which is useful for individuals with depression as well as emotional pain.
   Examples of these drugs include Cymbalta, Effexor, and Pristiq. Another class is the NDRIs, a
   relatively new class of drugs that raise norepinephrine as well as dopamine levels. These drugs
   are useful for treating some types of depression as well as attention-deficit/hyperactivity
   disorder (ADHD). Examples of this group include Focalin, Ritalin, Concerta, and Wellbutrin.
   One drug that targets a specific receptor subtype is the atypical antipsychotic Pimavanserin (in
   clinical trials), which specifically treats psychosis associated with Parkinson’s disease by
   stimulating 5-HT 2A receptors and leaving the other serotonin receptor subtypes alone
   (Friedman, 2013). Another drug, Cariprazine, stimulates the D 2 receptor family and not the D 1
   subfamily, which improves mania symptoms of both schizophrenia and bipolar I (Tohen, 2015).
   One of the oddest atypical antidepressants is Remeron (mirtazapine), which is classified as a
   norepinephrine and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA). This drug enhances the
   release of norepinephrine, increases serotonin release by presynaptic neurons, and modulates
   serotonin receptors in a complex way: It blocks 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors so that the
   increased serotonin can bind only to 5-HT1 receptors (Antilla & Leinonen, 2001). The 5-HT2
   and 5-HT3 receptors are associated with anxiety, changes in appetite, sexual dysfunction, and
   memory problems, so targeting only the 5-HT1 receptors provides effective antidepressant relief
   without as many side effects as with SSRIs (Schreiber, Melon, & DeVry, 1998).
   As we just indicated, there are many types of each receptor in your nervous system. You have at
   least seven different serotonin receptor families, two dopamine receptor families, and at least
   five norepinephrine receptors (two alpha and three beta). Many of these receptors are found not
   only in the brain but also throughout the body, and stimulating them broadly using tricyclic
   antidepressants, MAOIs, or even SSRIs triggers most of the unpleasant side effects of those
   drugs. The future of psychopharmacology will therefore be in designer drugs that interact only
   with a subset of receptors that match an individual’s symptoms and neurobiology.
   Electroconvulsive Therapy
   In extreme cases of treatment nonresponse or because of suicidal behaviors, an
   alternative is electroconvulsive therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
   involves applying 70–130 volts of electricity to the head of an anesthetized
   patient, which produces a seizure accompanied by convulsive contractions
   of the neck and limbs and lasting about a half minute to a minute (Figure
   14.19). Without the seizure activity in the brain that produces the convulsions,
   the treatment does not work. Within a few minutes, the patient is conscious and
   coherent, though perhaps a bit confused; the patient does not remember the
   experience. Usually ECT is administered two to three times a week for a total of
   6–12 treatments.

   ECT is the most controversial of the psychiatric therapies. Producing
   convulsions by sending a jolt of electricity through the brain sounds inhumane,
   and in fact the procedures used in the early days of ECT treatment often resulted
   in bone fractures and long-term memory deficits. Now patients are anesthetized
   and given muscle relaxants that eliminate injury and reduce emotional stress.
   The numbers of treatments and the voltage have been reduced, and stimulation is
   delivered in brief pulses rather than continuously. Though bilateral electrode
   placement produces a faster response that is desirable with suicidal patients,
   unilateral right hemisphere placement is usually favored because it minimizes
   cognitive side effects, such as temporary memory impairment (Kellner, Tobias,
   & Wiegand, 2010). These changes have made ECT safer and more effective
   (Weiner & Krystal, 1994). Follow-up studies indicate that memory and cognitive
   impairment induced by ECT dissipates within a few months (Crowe, 1984;
   Weeks, Freeman, & Kendell, 1980) and that cognitive performance even
   improves over pretreatment levels as the depression lifts (Sackeim et al., 1993).
   Brain scans and autopsies of patients and actual cell counts in animal subjects
   show no evidence of brain damage following ECT (reviewed in Devanand,
   Dwork, Hutchinson, Bolwig, & Sackheim, 1994).
   ECT is usually reserved for patients who do not respond to the medications or
   who cannot take them due to extreme side effects or because of pregnancy. In a
   recent analysis of 13 studies that compared ECT with antidepressant drugs, 79%
   of patients responded to ECT, compared with 54% of patients treated with
   antidepressants (Pagnin, de Queiroz, Pini, & Cassano, 2004). ECT works
   especially well when depression or mania is accompanied by psychosis
   (Depression Guideline Panel, 1993; Potter & Rudorfer, 1993), and it works
   rapidly, which is beneficial to suicidal patients who cannot wait for weeks while
   a drug takes effect (Rudorfer, Henry, & Sackeim, 1997). The disadvantage of
   ECT is that its benefit is often short term, but the patient can usually be
   maintained on drug therapy once a round of ECT has been completed.
   ECT is effective with depression, mania, and schizophrenia, which suggests that
   its effects are complex, and research bears this out. Several changes occur at the
   brain’s synapses. Like the drugs, ECT increases the sensitivity of postsynaptic
   serotonin receptors (Mann, Arango, & Underwood, 1990); in addition, the
   sensitivity of autoreceptors on the terminals of norepinephrine- and dopamine-
   releasing neurons is reduced, so the release of those transmitters is increased. A
   temporary slowing of the EEG, which is correlated with therapeutic
   effectiveness, suggests that ECT synchronizes neuronal firing over large areas of
   the brain (Ishihara & Sasa, 1999; Sackeim et al., 1996). This reduced excitability
   is likely due to the fact that ECT increases diminished GABA concentrations
   (Sanacora et al., 2003). However, as you will see in the next section, both
   antidepressants and ECT now appear to trigger dramatic remodeling of the
   depressed brain.
   Antidepressants, ECT, and Neural Plasticity
   Although antidepressant drugs and ECT have been used to treat depression for
   more than half a century, we are not sure how they work. Most puzzling is the
   delay between neurotransmitter changes and symptom relief; hypotheses that
   changes in receptor sensitivity account for the delay have not been successful
   (Yamada, Yamada, & Higuchi, 2005). A promising lead is that antidepressant
   drugs, lithium, and ECT all increase neuronal birth rate in the hippocampus, at
   least in rodents and presumably in humans as well (Figure 14.20; Inta et al.,
   2013; Mendez-David, Hen, Gardier, & David, 2013; Sairanen, Lucas, Ernfors,
   Castrén, & Castrén, 2005). Although increased neurogenesis can be detected
   within hours of antidepressant treatment, the time required for new hippocampal
   neurons to migrate to their new locations and form functional connections
   closely matches the delay in symptom improvement (Sairanen et al., 2005).
   After new cell development was blocked by X radiation, antidepressants no
   longer had an effect in mice, suggesting that neurogenesis is required for
   antidepressant action (Santarelli et al., 2003). An increase in cell numbers is not
   the basis, however, because cell death also accelerates; some researchers have
   suggested that the therapeutic effect is due to the greater plasticity of new cells
   (Gould & Gross, 2002), a point we saw in Chapter 12 in relation to their lower
   threshold for LTP. However, when researchers used a drug instead of X radiation
   to block neurogenesis, antidepressant effect was not diminished (Bessa et al.,
   2009). All three of the antidepressant drugs used increased dendritic remodeling
   and synaptic contact; this led the researchers to conclude that antidepressant
   drugs work by enhancing plasticity rather than by promoting neurogenesis.
   There is additional evidence for a plasticity hypothesis: Both antidepressants and
   ECT modify activity in a large number of genes, especially in the hippocampus;
   most of those genes contribute to neural plasticity and neuron survival, as well as
   to neurogenesis (Altar et al., 2004; Yamada et al., 2005). Neurogenesis might
   contribute to antidepressant effect, but it appears that restoration of plasticity is
   more important.
   Rhythms and Affective Disorders
   As we mentioned earlier, several circadian rhythm genes are implicated in
   depression, so it should be no surprise that depressed people often have
   problems with their biological rhythms. The circadian rhythm—the one that is
   a day in length—tends to be phase advanced in patients with affective
   disorders; this means that the person feels sleepy early in the evening and then
   wakes up in the early morning hours, regardless of the previous evening’s
   bedtime (Dew et al., 1996). The person also enters rapid eye movement sleep
   earlier in the night and spends more time in this state than normal (Kupfer,
   1976). As you will learn in Chapter 15, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is the
   stage of sleep during which dreaming occurs; the excess REM sleep is at the
   expense of the other stages of sleep. Patients with unipolar depression share this
   early onset of REM sleep with 70% of their relatives, and relatives with reduced
   REM latency are three times more likely to be depressed than relatives without
   reduced latency (Giles, Biggs, Rush, & Roffwarg, 1988).
   What are the roles of daily rhythms and seasons?
   Circadian Rhythms and Antidepressant Therapy
   Some patients who are unresponsive to antidepressant medication can get relief
   from their depression by readjusting their circadian rhythm. They can do this
   simply by staying up a half hour later each night until they reach the desired
   bedtime. In some patients, this treatment results in a relief from depression that
   lasts for months (D. A. Sack, Nurnberger, Rosenthal, Ashburn, & Wehr, 1985).
   Figure 14.20 Increased Neurogenesis in the Hippocampus During
   Antidepressant Treatment.

   Behavioral Effects of Antidepressants,” by L. Santarelli et al., Science, 301,
   805–809, fig. 2a and 2b, p. 806. © 2003. Reprinted with permission from
   AAAS.
   Some depressed patients also benefit temporarily from sleep deprivation. This
   was initially seen with REM sleep deprivation, which is accomplished by
   waking the person every time the EEG indicates that sleep has moved into the
   REM stage (J. C. Wu & Bunney, 1990). Interestingly, most antidepressant drugs
   also suppress REM sleep (G. W. Vogel, Buffenstein, Minter, & Hennessey,
   1990). Later research showed that depressed individuals also improve following
   non-REM sleep deprivation (Landsness, Goldstein, Peterson, Tononi, & Benca,
   2011) or total overnight sleep deprivation (Giedke & Schwärzler, 2002). To find
   out why, researchers at Tufts University School of Medicine dosed mice with a
   drug that mimics adenosine, a compound that builds up in the brain during
   wakefulness and produces sleepiness. Twelve hours later the mice showed
   increased resistance to treatments that produce depressive-like behavior (Hines,
   Schmitt, Hines, Moss, & Haydon, 2013). The mice slept normally, perhaps
   because the drug targeted only the A1 type of adenosine receptor; a similar drug
   might provide humans the antidepressant benefits of sleep deprivation without
   the sleepiness.
   Seasonal Affective Disorder
   There is another rhythm that is important in affective disorders; some people’s
   depression rises and falls with the seasons and is known as seasonal affective
   disorder (SAD). This is on a circannual rhythm, one that follows the changes
   of the seasons. Most SAD patients are more depressed during the fall and
   winter, and then improve in the spring and summer, which parallels onset for
   schizophrenia as well (Owens & McGorry, 2003). Others are more depressed in
   the summer and feel better during the winter. Members of either group may
   experience a mild mania-like activation called hypomania during their “good”
   season. While depressed, they usually sleep excessively, and they often have
   increased appetites, especially for carbohydrates, and gain weight. The length of
   day and the amount of natural light appear to be important in winter depression;
   symptoms improve when the patient travels farther south (or north, if the person
   lives in the Southern Hemisphere) even for a few days, and some report
   increased depression during cloudy periods in the summer or when they move to
   an office with fewer windows. Summer depression appears to be temperature
   related: Traveling to a cooler climate, spending time in an air-conditioned house,
   and taking several cold showers a day improves the symptoms. About 10% of all
   cases of affective disorder are seasonal, and 71% of SAD patients are women
   (Faedda et al., 1993). Although seasonal influences on affective disorder have
   been known for 2,000 years and documented since the mid-1850s, summer
   depression has received relatively little attention, so we will restrict our
   discussion to winter depression.
   A treatment for winter depression is phototherapy—having the patient sit in
   front of high-intensity lights for a couple of hours or more a day (Figure
   14.21). Patients begin to respond after two to four days of treatment with light
   that approximates sunlight from a window on a clear spring day; they relapse in
   about the same amount of time following withdrawal of treatment (Rosenthal et
   al., 1985). The fact that midday phototherapy is effective suggests that the
   increased amount of light is more important than extending the length of the
   shortened winter day; the observation that suicide rate is related to a locale’s
   amount of clear sunlight rather than the number of hours of daylight supports
   this conclusion (Wehr et al., 1986). Phototherapy resets the circadian rhythm
   (Lewy, Sack, Miller, & Hoban, 1987), so it is also helpful with circadian rhythm
   problems including jet lag, delayed sleep syndrome, and difficulties associated
   with shift work (Blehar & Rosenthal, 1989).
   Figure 14.21 A Woman Uses a High-Intensity Light to Treat Her Seasonal
   Affective Disorder.

   Physiological mechanisms for disorders of circadian and circannual rhythms
   include both neurotransmitter and prefrontal cortex changes. Lowered serotonin
   activity is involved in winter depression. Drugs that increase serotonin activity
   alleviate the depression and reduce carbohydrate craving (O’Rourke, Wurtman,
   Wurtman, Chebli, & Gleason, 1989). As we saw in Chapter 5, eating
   carbohydrates increases brain serotonin levels. So, rather than thinking that SAD
   patients lack willpower when they binge on junk food and gain weight, it might
   be more accurate to think of them as self-medicating with carbohydrates. But
   what areas of the brain change seasonally? A recent study suggests that the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex contains genes activated on a seasonal basis (Lim
   et al., 2017).
   Bipolar Disorder and Related Disorders
   The mystery of major depression is far from solved, but bipolar disorder is even
   more puzzling. Bipolar patients vary greatly in their symptoms: The depressive
   cycle usually lasts longer than mania, but either may predominate. There are
   three major forms of bipolar disorder: bipolar I (major depressive episodes with
   occasional manic episodes), bipolar II (major depression with mild hypomanic
   episodes), and cyclothymic disorder (frequent alternation between hypomanic
   and mild depressive episodes that are not severe enough for a diagnosis of
   bipolar II). Some patients cycle between depression and mania regularly (this is
   called rapid cycling), whereas others are unpredictable; cycles usually vary from
   weeks to months in duration, although some patients switch as frequently as
   every 48 hours (Bunney, Murphy, Goodwin, & Borge, 1972). Stress often
   precipitates the transition from depression into mania, followed by a more
   spontaneous change back to depression; the prospect of discharge from the
   hospital is particularly stressful and often will precipitate the switch into mania.
   However, as bipolar disorder progresses, manic episodes tend to occur
   independently of life’s stresses (P. W. Gold et al., 1988).
   It appears that bipolar disorder involves increased sensitivity to dopamine and
   either decreased sensitivity to serotonin or a more general dysregulation in the
   dopaminergic system (Miklowitz & Johnson, 2006). Drugs used to treat the
   disorder include several atypical antipsychotics, as well as carbamazepine,
   valproate, and lithium. Carbamazepine and valproate stabilize electrical activity
   in the brain and are typically used as anticonvulsants for the treatment of
   epilepsy. Lithium, a metal administered in the form of lithium carbonate, is
   the medication of choice for bipolar illness; it is most effective during the
   manic phase, but it also prevents further depressive episodes. Examination of
   lithium’s effects has not identified any critical neurotransmitters, partly because
   lithium affects several transmitter systems (Worley, Heller, Snyder, & Baraban,
   1988). It may be that lithium stabilizes neurotransmitter and receptor systems to
   prevent the large swings seen in manic-depressive cycling; its dual role as an
   antidepressant argues for a normalizing effect rather than a directional one
   (Gitlin & Altshuler, 1997). Closer examination, however, has revealed a specific
   effect on mania; lithium and valproate indirectly inhibit protein kinase C (PKC),
   a family of intracellular messengers that regulate neural excitability. The breast
   cancer drug tamoxifen is used to block estrogen receptors, but it also inhibits
   PKC. In a phase 2 clinical trial, 90% of patients receiving tamoxifen with
   lithium were considered in remission, versus 55% receiving lithium alone
   (Amrollahi et al., 2011). Tamoxifen itself may not be practical as a treatment for
   bipolar disorder because it antagonizes estrogen activity; if the drug continues to
   prove effective, an alternative that targets PKC only will have to be found.
   What brain irregularities are involved in affective disorders?
   Brain Anomalies in Affective Disorders
   As with schizophrenia, affective disorders are associated with structural
   abnormalities in several brain areas. Again, a larger ventricle size suggests loss
   of brain tissue, but the reductions are small and are not always found (Depue &
   Iacono, 1989). A review of numerous studies of depression reveals volume
   deficits in prefrontal areas, especially the dorsolateral cortex and the anterior
   cingulate cortex as well as in the hippocampus, but an increased volume in the
   amygdala (R. J. Davidson, Pizzagalli, Nitschke, & Putnam, 2002). Volume
   reduction apparently precedes depression rather than being a degenerative
   consequence of it; it is evident at the time of patients’ first episode, and it can
   even be detected in the nondepressed offspring of patients (M. C. Chen,
   Hamilton, & Gotlib, 2010; Peterson et al., 2009; Zou et al., 2010).

   Three Types of Depression,” by L. R. Baxter et al., 1999, Archives of
   General Psychiatry, 46 (14), pp. 243–249.
   These structural alterations are accompanied by changes in activity level. Not
   surprisingly, total brain activity is reduced in unipolar patients (Sackeim et al.,
   1990) and in bipolar patients when they are depressed (Baxter et al., 1989). Gray
   matter is particularly reduced in the hippocampus, the orbitofrontal cortex that
   regulates emotions (Figure 14.22; Egger et al., 2008), basal forebrain (Ribiez et
   al., 2013), prefrontal cortex, and cingulate cortex (Arnone, McIntosh, Ebmeier,
   Munafò, & Anderson, 2012). These decreases in brain tissue volume have been
   postulated to be predictors not only for depression but also for the likelihood that
   the person will improve following antidepressant treatment (Ribiez et al.). What
   is surprising is that some areas are more active in depressed patients. In unipolar
   depression, blood flow is higher in the amygdala and a frontal area connected to
   the amygdala called the ventral prefrontal cortex (Figure 14.23). The ventral
   prefrontal area may also be a “depression switch,” because activation comes and
   goes with bouts of depression. The amygdala continues to be active between
   episodes and returns to normal only after the remission of symptoms. Activity in
   the amygdala corresponds to the trait of depression—the continuing disorder—
   whereas activation of the ventral prefrontal area indicates the state of depression,
   which subsides from time to time in some individuals (Drevets, 2001; Drevets et
   al., 1992; Drevets & Raichle, 1995).

   It is also not surprising that during a manic episode, brain metabolism increases
   from its depressed level by 4%–36% (Figure 14.24; Baxter et al., 1989). The
   subgenual prefrontal cortex is particularly interesting because it has been
   suggested as a possible “switch” controlling bipolar cycling (Figure 14.25). Its
   metabolic activity is reduced during both unipolar and bipolar depression, but
   increases during manic episodes (Drevets et al., 1997). The structure is a part of
   the cingulate cortex, located at the midline; it is in a good position to act as a
   bipolar switch, because it has extensive connections to emotion centers such as
   the amygdala and the lateral hypothalamus and it helps regulate
   neurotransmitters involved in affective disorders. Imaging studies also implicate
   the anterior parts of the limbic system (Strakowski, 2011). Even when bipolar
   subjects were asymptomatic and working on a cognitive task, activity increased
   in limbic and associated areas (Strakowski, Adler, Holland, Mills, & DelBello,
   2004). The researchers suggested that individuals with bipolar I disorder are
   unable to suppress emotion networks during emotionally neutral activities.

   Bipolar Patient.

   Studies With Positron Emission Tomography and Fluorodeoxyglucose
   F18,” by L. R. Baxter et al., 1985, Archives of General Psychiatry, 42, pp.
   441–447.
   Both depressed and bipolar patients have anomalies in functional brain
   connectivity. Connectivity is reduced in the cortex, corpus callosum, and
   thalamus in individuals with bipolar disorder (Barysheva, Jahanshad, Foland-
   Ross, Altshuler, & Thompson, 2013). In depression, increased as well as
   decreased connectivity has been reported. For example, one study reported
   decreased connectivity between frontal areas and the ventral striatum, but
   increased connectivity between frontal areas and the dorsal striatum (Furman,
   Hamilton, & Gotlib, 2011). Treatment has been shown to increase deficient
   connectivity between some areas (Heller et al., 2013) and to decrease excess
   connectivity in others (Perrin et al., 2012). In both cases, the changes in
   connectivity were accompanied by symptom improvement.
   Suicide
   Suicide accounts for more deaths than homicide or war; it is the 13th leading
   cause of death worldwide and the 4th among those aged 15–44 years (World
   Health Organization, 2002). Ninety percent of people who attempt suicide have a
   diagnosable psychiatric illness; mood disorder alone accounts for 60% of all
   completed suicides (Figure 14.26; Mann, 2003). Bipolar patients are most at
   risk; about 20% of people who have been hospitalized for bipolar disorder
   commit suicide. According to the stress-diathesis model, the suicidal individual
   has a predisposition, known as a diathesis, and then stress such as a worsening
   psychiatric condition acts as an environmental “straw that breaks the camel’s
   back” (Mann, 2003). The stresses can be physical, as well as psychological, as
   the accompanying In the News feature illustrates.

   The predisposition is at least partly genetic; a study of depressed patients located
   six chromosome sites that were associated with suicidal risk but independent of
   susceptibility for mood disorders (Zubenko et al., 2004). Psychiatric patients
   who attempt suicide also are more likely to have low levels of the serotonin
   metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) than non-attempters, which
   means that their serotonin activity is particularly decreased. When a group of
   patients at risk for suicide was followed for one year, 20% of those who were
   below the group median in 5-HIAA level had committed suicide; none of the
   patients above the median had (Träskman, Åsberg, Bertilsson, & Sjöstrand,
   1981). Other studies have confirmed the association between lowered serotonin
   and suicidality (see Figure 14.27; Mann, 2003; Roy, DeJong, & Linnoila, 1989;
   M. Stanley, Stanley, Traskman-Bendz, Mann, & Meyendorff, 1986). Lowered 5-
   HIAA is found in suicide attempters with a variety of disorders and probably
   reflects impulsiveness rather than the patient’s specific psychiatric diagnosis
   (Mann et al., 1990; M. Stanley et al., 1986; Träskman et al., 1981); this view was
   supported by a later study in which impulsive suicide attempters were found to
   have lower 5-HIAA than either nonimpulsive attempters or controls (Spreux-
   Varoquaux et al., 2001).

   However, antidepressants can increase the risk of suicide. A variety of
   explanations have been offered, including the agitation that often accompanies
   SSRI use (Fergusson et al., 2005) and disappointment over slow improvement
   and side effects (Mann, 2003). Concern about the vulnerability of children and
   adolescents resulted in a 22% decrease in SSRI prescriptions for youths in the
   United States and the Netherlands; unfortunately, this turned out to be a case of
   throwing out the baby with the bathwater, since youthful suicides increased 14%
   in the United States in one year and 49% in the Netherlands over two years
   (Gibbons et al., 2007). Some observers believe that the suicidal acts of
   individuals on antidepressants is the result of rebounding energy levels, which
   allow those with suicidal ideation the ability to carry out suicidal thoughts.
   Rather than reducing prescriptions wholesale, therapists need to be selective and
   to monitor their patients for suicidal tendencies.
   Figure 14.27 Serotonin Levels and Suicide.
   Source: Based on data from Roy, DeJong, and Linnoila (1989).
   Research has identified heritable characteristics that distinguish people at risk for
   suicide from others, referred to as endophenotypes. The most reproduced
   personality indicators have been impulsivity and aggression (Courtet,
   Gottesman, Jollant, & Gould, 2011). Disadvantageous decision making,
   indicated by measures such as the Iowa Gambling Task, suggest a prefrontal
   deficiency, and this has been verified in terms of reduced neural activity and
   altered prefrontal serotonergic functioning. The heritability of suicidal behavior
   (ideation as well as attempts) has been estimated in various studies at 38%–55%
   (Brent & Melhem, 2008). Locating genes that predispose a person to suicide has
   been difficult, in part because of confounding with so many instigators to
   suicide; these include mental illness, physical illness, and life disappointments.
   Most studies have pointed to serotonin-related genes and genes involved with
   brain-derived neurotrophic factors, and a few other genes have been implicated,
   but there has been little confirmation (S.-J. Tsai, Hong, & Liou, 2011).

   What are some of the factors in suicide?
   Anxiety, Trauma, and Stress-Related Disorders
   As discussed in Chapter 8, anxiety is the anticipation of some future threat.
   Anxiety disorders include several illnesses. The major ones—phobia,
   generalized anxiety, and panic disorder—have lifetime risks of about 13%, 9%,
   and 6.8%, respectively (Kessler et al., 2012). But their significance lies less in
   their prevalence than in the disruptiveness of their symptoms. The panic disorder
   patient or the phobic patient may be unable to venture out of the house, much
   less hold down a job.
   Heredity
   Family and twin studies indicate that the anxiety disorders are genetically
   influenced, with heritability ranging between 20% and 47%, depending on the
   disorder (Abramowitz, Taylor, & McKay, 2009; P. E. Arnold, Zai, & Richter,
   2004; Hettema, Neale, & Kendler, 2001). Understanding the hereditary
   underpinnings of anxiety is difficult because of significant genetic overlap with
   other disorders. More than 90% of individuals with anxiety disorders have a
   history of other psychiatric problems (Kaufman & Charney, 2000). The overlap
   with mood disorders is particularly strong; 50%–60% of patients with major
   depression also have a history of one or more anxiety disorders (Kaufman &
   Charney), and panic disorder is found in 16% of bipolar patients (Doughty,
   Wells, Joyce, Olds, & Walsh, 2004). Some neural commonality between these
   two groups is suggested by the effectiveness of antidepressants in treating both
   mood disorders and anxiety disorders. The anxieties themselves appear to fall
   into three genetically related clusters, with generalized anxiety, panic, and
   agoraphobia (fear of crowds and open places) in one group; animal phobias and
   situational phobias in the second; and social phobia overlapping genetically with
   both groups (Hettema, Prescott, Myers, Neale, & Kendler, 2005).
   In The News: Heightened Suicide Risk After Concussion
   Concerns about the cognitive and emotional impacts of brain injury have received a lot of public
   attention due to well-publicized studies of retired National Football League (NFL) players and
   military veterans who had been injured due to improvised explosive devices. It now seems clear
   that the type of repeated injuries that occur in contact sports such as football can result in
   chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease of the brain
   resulting from trauma (Kutner, 2017). One possible effect researchers are investigating is
   whether head injury increases a person’s risk for suicide. Most media attention has focused on
   the suicides of retired NFL players such as Junior Seau and Dave Duerson, whose brains
   showed signs of CTE, but evidence is accumulating from other populations to support a suicide–
   brain injury link. A study of veterans who had experienced a concussion or cranial fracture
   found that they were twice as likely to commit suicide as other veterans (Brenner, Ignacio, &
   Blow, 2011), and a 20-year study reported a tripling of the suicide rate in civilians who had a
   concussion (Fralick, Thiruchelvam, Tien, & Redelmeier, 2016). Although more investigations
   are needed, the current data suggest that people who have experienced even one brain injury
   need to be monitored for long-term affective changes to prevent suicide.
   Thought Questions
   1. What evidence has shown a link between head injury and suicide risk?
   2. How do the types of head injuries experienced by football players differ from those
   experienced by military veterans and civilians who did not play a contact sport?
   3. Which information presented here do you find most convincing of a connection between
   head injuries and suicides?

   What causes anxiety disorders?
   Genetic research has most often implicated genes responsible for serotonin
   production, serotonin reuptake, and various subtypes of serotonin receptors
   (reviewed in P. E. Arnold et al., 2004; Rothe et al., 2004; You, Hu, Chen, &
   Zhang, 2005). Other leads include genes for monoamine oxidase (Tadic et al.,
   2003), for the adenosine receptor (P. E. Arnold et al.; Lam, Hong, & Tsai, 2005),
   and for cholecystokinin and its receptor (P. E. Arnold et al.).
   Generalized Anxiety, Panic Disorder, and Phobia
   Anxiety is often confused with fear; however, as we saw in Chapter 8, fear is a
   reaction to real objects or events present in the environment, whereas anxiety
   involves anticipation of events or an inappropriate reaction to the environment.
   A person with generalized anxiety has a feeling of stress and unease most of the
   time and overreacts to stressful conditions. In panic disorder, the person has a
   sudden and intense attack of anxiety, with symptoms such as rapid breathing,
   high heart rate, and feelings of impending disaster. A person with a phobia
   experiences fear or stress when confronted with a situation—for instance,
   crowds, heights, enclosed spaces, open spaces, or specific objects such as dogs
   or snakes.
   Neurotransmitters
   Benzodiazepines were the most frequently used anxiolytic (antianxiety) drugs in
   the past (Costall & Naylor, 1992) but now are considered a second line of
   defense because of their addiction potential. You may remember from our earlier
   discussion of drugs in Chapter 5 that benzodiazepines increase receptor
   sensitivity to the inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA),
   which is a major neurotransmitter in anxiety. A deficit in benzodiazepine
   receptors may be one cause of anxiety disorder. Marczynski and Urbancic (1988)
   injected pregnant cats with a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. When the offspring
   were one year old, they were restless and appeared anxious in novel situations.
   When their brains were studied later, several areas of the brain had compensated
   for the tranquilizer by reducing the number of benzodiazepine receptors.
   Anxiety also appears to involve lower activity at serotonin synapses. Antianxiety
   drugs initially suppress serotonin activity, but then they apparently produce a
   compensatory increase. The idea that a serotonergic increase is involved in
   anxiety reduction is supported by the fact that antidepressants are now the drug
   of choice for treating anxiety and related disorders.
   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
   Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prolonged stress reaction to a
   traumatic event; it is typically characterized by recurrent thoughts and
   images (flashbacks), nightmares, lack of concentration, and overreactivity
   to environmental stimuli, such as loud noises. Because of recent news
   coverage, we usually associate PTSD with combat experiences, but it can be
   triggered by all kinds of trauma, including robbery, sexual assault, hostage
   situations, and automobile accidents. Men are more often exposed to such
   traumas, but women are almost four times as likely to develop PTSD when they
   do experience trauma (Fullerton et al., 2001). PTSD symptoms are resistant to
   traditional drug and psychotherapy treatments; an alternative approach is
   exposure therapy, which allows the individual to confront anxiety-provoking
   stimuli in the safety of the therapist’s office. Exposure therapy is essentially an
   extinction process, and fear memories are notoriously resistant to extinction,
   especially in the 30% of people who have the VAL66MET allele (which we saw
   is also involved in depression). We know this gene plays a causal role in fear
   extinction, because when it was inserted into mice they showed the same
   increased resistance (Soliman et al., 2010). Brain imaging of human subjects
   during extinction trials showed why; connections between the prefrontal cortex
   and the amygdala that are important in fear conditioning and extinction were
   hypoactive in carriers of the allele.
   In their search for better therapies, researchers are resorting to novel approaches;
   some, for example, believe that therapists could take a lesson from the
   phenomenon of reconsolidation that you learned about in Chapter 12. A team led
   by Daniela Schiller (2010) used a mild electric shock to condition an emotional
   reaction (measured by skin conductance response) to a blue square. A day later,
   the response was extinguished by repeatedly presenting the blue square alone.
   However, two subgroups of subjects received a “reminder” of the fear memory,
   one 10 minutes before extinction began and the other six hours before; the
   reminder was intended to start reconsolidation, a window of opportunity that was
   expected to remain open during extinction for the 10-minute group but to be
   closed by the time the six-hour group’s extinction trials began. It worked: The
   skin conductance response was almost entirely absent in the 10-minute group but
   had recovered to near training levels in the other two groups; the effect persisted
   for a year. Researchers hope this technique of fear erasure can be used to help
   relieve PTSD sufferers of their lingering fear and anxiety.
   Anomalies in Brain Functioning
   For the most part, the various anxiety disorders share a commonality of
   functional brain anomalies. Not surprisingly, the amygdala is hyperresponsive;
   the anterior cingulate cortex is hyperactive in general anxiety, panic disorder,
   and phobias, and the insular cortex is overly responsive in phobias and PTSD
   (Etkin & Wager, 2007; Morey et al., 2012; Shin & Liberzon, 2010). PTSD is
   distinguished by decreased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and,
   according to some studies, in the hippocampus. Some structures have been
   reported to be smaller in people with anxiety disorders, particularly in those with
   PTSD. Researchers have usually assumed these variations were the result of the
   anxiety disorders, but we will see that this is not always the case.
   Whether trauma is followed by PTSD is unrelated to either the severity of the
   traumatic event or the individual’s distress at the time (Harvey & Bryant, 2002;
   Shalev et al., 2000); the key apparently is the person’s vulnerability. Mark
   Gilbertson and his colleagues (2002) used magnetic resonance imaging to
   measure hippocampal volumes in Vietnam combat veterans and their noncombat
   identical twins. Those who suffered from PTSD had smaller hippocampi than
   did PTSD-free veterans, as expected, but so did the PTSD subjects’ noncombat
   twins (Figure 14.28). Hippocampal reduction is often associated with childhood
   abuse, and Elizabeth Binder and her coworkers (2008) found that previously
   abused individuals were twice as likely to succumb to PTSD following traumatic
   events. Two mutations of the FKBP5 gene are more common among PTSD
   patients who were abused and apparently contribute to the vulnerability (Binder
   et al.). A smaller anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) may also be a vulnerability
   factor. After the Japanese earthquake and tsunami in 2011, researchers at Tohoku
   University asked 42 local residents who had previously received MRI scans to
   return and have their brains imaged again. Though none of the residents had full-
   blown PTSD, those with the highest scores had lower gray matter volumes in the
   orbitofrontal cortex and in the ACC, compared with control subjects (Sekiguchi
   et al., 2013). Reduced volume in the orbitofrontal cortex had occurred since the
   first scan, but the high-scoring subjects had lower ACC volume at the time of the
   first scan; this suggests that a smaller ACC is a vulnerability factor for PTSD.
   This makes sense, because the ACC is involved in the processing of fear and
   anxiety and in eliminating fear-related memories.

   Twins.

   Of course, these structures operate as part of circuits, rather than in isolation
   from each other or other parts of the brain. Chad Sylvester and his colleagues
   (2012) have identified four networks whose faulty performance they believe
   contributes to anxiety (Figure 14.29). The ventral attention network orients to
   attention-demanding stimuli and in people with anxiety disorders contributes to
   excessively stimulus-driven attention. Once a response to a situation is
   formulated, a salience network provides error detection by comparing the
   intended response with appropriate responses. A mismatch would signal the need
   for increased executive control, the domain of the frontoparietal network.
   Finally, the default mode network engages in self-monitoring, future planning,
   and emotion regulation; underactivity in this network results in poor emotional
   regulation.

   Personality Disorders
   The personality disorders are a group of 10 related disorders characterized by a
   relatively inflexible pattern of behavior that is different from one’s peers, has an
   onset around puberty to young adulthood, and causes distress or inability to
   function in society. Typical behavior patterns include distrust and suspicion
   (paranoid), unstable social and interpersonal relationships (asocial, avoidant,
   dependent, borderline), problems with control and attention (obsessive-
   compulsive), and emotional dysfunctions (histrionic, narcissistic). An abnormal
   psychology course will likely cover most of these personality disorders, but in
   this text we will concentrate on two types: obsessive-compulsive disorder and
   related disorders, and borderline personality disorder.

   Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
   Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) consists of two behaviors, obsessions
   and compulsions, which occur in the same person. The disorder affects about
   2.6% of the population over their lifetimes (Kessler et al., 2012). An obsession is
   a recurring, uncontrollable thought; a person may be annoyed by a tune that
   mentally replays over and over or by troubling thoughts such as wishing harm to
   another person. Normal people have similar thoughts, but for the obsessive
   individual, the experience is extreme and feels completely out of control. Just as
   the obsessive individual is a slave to thoughts, the compulsive individual is a
   slave to actions. Compulsions are ritualistic behaviors that must be done to
   remove the anxiety of the obsession, such as touching a door frame three times
   before passing through the door, endless bathing and hand washing, or checking
   to see if appliances are turned off and the door is locked (Rapoport, 1991).
   Prominent examples of this disorder are depicted in the films As Good as It Gets
   and The Aviator and in the television show Monk.
   What is obsessive-compulsive disorder, and what causes it?
   One psychiatrist described a patient who tired of returning home to check
   whether she had turned her appliances off and solved the problem by taking her
   coffeemaker and iron to work with her (Begley & Biddle, 1996). The playwright
   and humorist David Sedaris (1998) wrote that his short walk home from school
   during childhood took a full hour because of his compulsion to stop every few
   feet and press his nose to the hood of a particular car, lick a certain mailbox, or
   touch a specific leaf that demanded his attention. Once home, he had to make the
   rounds of several rooms, kissing, touching, and rearranging various objects
   before he could enter his own room. About a fourth of OCD patients have a
   family member with OCD, suggesting a genetic involvement; boys are afflicted
   more often than girls, but the ratio levels off in adulthood (Swedo, Rapoport,
   Leonard, Lenane, & Cheslow, 1989).
   What about individuals who are obsessed with neatness, organization, and
   generally making sure that their world is “where it should be?” This is not OCD,
   but a related disorder called obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD),
   in which the person does not experience the distress and anxiety over
   obsessively cleaning and organizing that someone with OCD would experience.
   Instead, those feelings of perfection are perceived to be rational and reasonable.
   OCPD is much harder to treat, compared to OCD.
   Imaging studies of OCD patients reveal increased activity in the orbitofrontal
   cortex, especially the left orbital gyrus, and in the caudate nuclei (Whiteside,
   Port, & Abramowitz, 2004). It is unclear whether these increases cause OCD or
   are merely activation increases associated with symptoms of OCD, such as
   worry. However, both drug treatment and behavior therapy reduce activation of
   the caudate nucleus and, in at least one study, the orbital gyrus (Figure 14.30;
   Porto et al., 2009; J. M. Schwartz et al., 1996; Swedo, Schapiro, et al., 1989).
   White matter reductions indicate that there are deficient connections between the
   cingulate gyrus and a circuit involving the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cortex,
   which apparently result in a loss of impulse control (Insel, 1992; Szeszko et al.,
   2005). An indication of dysfunction in this network is that orbitofrontal activity
   does not increase when OCD patients are required to reverse a previously correct
   choice; their unaffected relatives show the same deficit, suggesting that it is
   genetic (Chamberlain et al., 2008).
   OCD occurs with several diseases that damage the basal ganglia (H. L. Leonard
   et al., 1992), which, you will remember, are involved in motor activity. There is
   growing evidence that the disorder can be triggered in children by a bacterial
   infection that results in an autoimmune attack on the basal ganglia; vulnerability
   to the immune malfunction apparently is hereditary (P. D. Arnold & Richter,
   2001; P. E. Arnold et al., 2004). OCD has also been reported in cases of head
   injury (McKeon, McGuffin, & Robinson, 1984). Two of the most famous
   obsessive-compulsive individuals had a strong germ phobia (called
   mysophobia): the multimillionaire Howard Hughes (R. Fowler, 1986) and the
   star of the television show Deal or No Deal, comedian Howie Mandel (Mandel,
   2010). In Hughes’s case, some signs of disorder during childhood and his
   mother’s obsessive concern with germs suggest either genetic vulnerability or
   environmental influence. However, symptoms of OCD did not begin until after a
   series of airplane crashes and automobile accidents that left him almost
   unrecognizable (Figure 14.31). When a business associate died, Hughes gave
   explicit instructions that flowers for the funeral were to be delivered by an
   independent messenger who would not have any contact with the florist or with
   Hughes’s office—even to the point of sending a bill—to prevent “backflow” of
   germs (Bartlett & Steele, 1979). Assistants were required to handle his papers
   with gloves, sometimes several pairs, and he in turn grasped them with a tissue.
   He instructed his assistants not to touch him, talk directly to him, or even look at
   him; his defense for this behavior was that everybody carries germs and he
   wanted to avoid germs (R. Fowler).

   Researchers believe that OCD patients are high in serotonergic activity. This was
   suggested by the fact that people with OCD are inhibited in action and feel guilty
   about aggressive impulses; sociopaths, by contrast, feel no guilt after committing
   impulsive crimes, and they have lowered serotonin activity. But the only drugs
   that consistently improve OCD symptoms are antidepressants that inhibit
   serotonin reuptake (Insel, Zohar, Benkelfat, & Murphy, 1990). So, if OCD
   patients do have high serotonergic activity, then reuptake inhibitors must work
   by causing a compensatory reduction in activity; there is some evidence that
   treatment does decrease the sensitivity of serotonin receptors (Insel et al., 1990),
   but the nature of serotonin involvement remains uncertain (Graybiel & Rauch,
   2000).
   Figure 14.31 Howard Hughes.
   Source: Bettmann/Getty Images.
   Patient response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors is usually only partial, and some
   patients do not respond at all; a third of these patients benefit from
   antipsychotics, and an antiglutamate drug produces modest relief (Abramowitz
   et al., 2009), suggesting the involvement of these transmitters. For treatment-
   resistant patients, psychosurgery is an option. Forty-seven percent of patients
   went into remission following cingulotomy, which involves lesioning the ACC,
   and another 22% improved (Sheth et al., 2013). A less drastic procedure is deep
   brain stimulation (DBS), targeting the internal capsule, a bundle of fibers that
   connect the frontal lobe with the thalamus and other areas. A DBS device was
   approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2009) after it produced a
   40% reduction in symptoms in OCD patients.
   A meta-analysis of 113 studies found associations with two serotonin genes and,
   in males only, two genes involved in degradation of dopamine and serotonin (S.
   Taylor, 2013). There were trends for two dopamine-related genes and a
   glutamate-related gene, but these were not statistically significant. The rate of
   disorders in relatives of people with OCD suggests a genetic association with
   anxiety disorders, depression, tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome (discussed
   later), and grooming disorders such as hair pulling and skin picking (Bienvenu et
   al., 2012).
   Figure 14.32 Excessive Grooming and the Sapap3 Gene.

   OCD-Related Disorders
   The symptoms of OCD, particularly washing and “grooming” rituals and
   preoccupation with cleanliness, suggest to some researchers that it is a disorder
   of “excessive grooming” (H. L. Leonard, Lenane, Swedo, Rettew, & Rapoport,
   1991; Rapoport, 1991). Dogs and cats sometimes groom their fur to the point of
   producing bald spots and ulcers in a disorder known as acral lick syndrome.
   Some chimpanzees and monkeys engage in excessive self-grooming and hair
   pulling, and 10% of birds in captivity compulsively pull out their feathers,
   occasionally to the point that the bird is denuded and at risk for infection and
   hypothermia. Clomipramine, an antidepressant that inhibits serotonin reuptake,
   is effective in reducing all these behaviors (Grindlinger & Ramsay, 1991;
   Hartman, 1995; Rapoport, 1991).
   If you think that the excessive grooming idea sounds far-fetched, consider the
   human behaviors of nail biting and obsessive hair pulling (trichotillomania), in
   which the person pulls hairs out one by one until there are visible bald spots or
   even complete baldness of the head, eyebrows, and eyelashes. There are several
   similarities between hair pulling and OCD: Both behaviors appear to be
   hereditary, and hair pullers have a high frequency of relatives with OCD; both
   symptoms also respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Leonard et al., 1991;
   Swedo et al., 1991). However, trichotillomania and OCD sufferers appear to
   differ from each other in their versions of the Sapap3 gene (Bienvenu et al.,
   2008). The gene’s normal role is most likely a protective one, since mice that
   lack the gene groom to the point of self-injury; their behavior is relieved by a
   serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Figure 14.32; J. M. Welch et al., 2007).
   Hoarders are dedicated collectors, stashing away just about anything from string
   to old newspapers. People with OCD are often hoarders as well, but hoarding
   disorder is considered distinct from OCD. David Tolin and his colleagues (2012)
   placed people with hoarding disorder in an fMRI scanner and had them look at
   pictures of junk mail and newspapers and decide whether to keep or discard
   them. The subjects had brought 50 of the items from home, and another 50 were
   provided by the experimenters. Hoarders, people with OCD, and healthy
   controls all were willing to discard more than 40 of the 50 items that were not
   theirs. When it came to their own items, the healthy controls discarded 40 and
   those with OCD discarded 37, but the hoarders gave up only 29. More telling,
   during this part of the study the hoarders reported “not feeling right” and showed
   more activity than the others in the ACC, which evaluates behavior and detects
   errors, and in the insula, which is important to a sense of self. Apparently, giving
   up these possessions was threatening; this can lead to really bizarre behavior, as
   the accompanying Application reveals.
   Application: Of Hermits and Hoarders

   There is greater awareness about hoarding disorder because of documentary TV series such as
   Hoarders, which profiles extreme hoarders; in one segment, the home is so cluttered that people
   take meals in bed (Weiss, 2010). In each episode, clinicians and professional organizers, with
   the aid of friends and family, assist the hoarder in the cleanup of his or her home. The
   intervention is usually precipitated by a crisis, such as a threat to remove the children for health
   and safety reasons. Hoarding can be so extreme that it poses broader dangers as well; for
   example, 14 firefighters were injured when 150 of them were called to put out a fire in a New
   York City apartment filled with floor-to-ceiling junk (Newman, 2006).
   But the most severe hoarders that we know about may be the Collyer brothers, Homer and
   Langley. They grew up in a Fifth Avenue New York City mansion with their eccentric first-
   cousin parents; their father, a gynecologist, canoed to work at Bellevue Hospital and the family
   gave up their telephone, electricity, and gas to “simplify” their lives (Weiss, 2010). Homer
   became an attorney, and Langley graduated from Columbia University in mechanical
   engineering and chemistry and then tried a career as a concert pianist. After their parents died,
   the two brothers became reclusive hermits. Homer was confined to the home by blindness and
   arthritis, but Langley busied himself with nighttime treks through the neighborhood collecting
   odds and ends off the streets. On March 21, 1947, responding to a tip about an odor, police
   broke into the mansion through a second-story window after finding the foyer blocked by a solid
   wall of junk (“Collyer Brothers,” n.d.). They found Homer dead of starvation and no sign of
   Langley. The home was so cluttered that Langley had made tunnels through the debris in order
   to move from room to room; some of those tunnels were rigged with booby traps as a defense
   against intruders. Authorities removed the contents from the home; 18 days after Homer’s body
   was discovered, Langley was found just 10 feet away, crushed under one of his own traps. There
   was so little of value in the 130 tons of material that was removed from the home that an auction
   brought little money. For the next decade, children grew up with their mothers’ admonition,
   “Clean up your room or you’ll end up like the Collyer brothers!” (Weiss, p. 251).

   Another disorder associated with OCD is Tourette syndrome, whose victims
   suffer from a variety of motor and phonic (sound) tics. They twitch and
   grimace, blink their eyes rapidly, throw punches at the air, cough, grunt, bark,
   echo what others say, mimic people’s facial expressions and gestures, and
   (rarely) blurt out derogatory remarks and profanity. Both OCD and Tourette
   sufferers can manage their symptoms for short periods; for instance, Tourette
   patients are usually symptom free while driving a car, having sex, or performing
   surgery (yes, some of them are surgeons!). But neither OCD nor Tourette is a
   simple matter of will: Children often suppress compulsive rituals at school and
   “let go” at home, or they suppress tics during the day and then tic during their
   sleep. Neurologist Oliver Sacks (1990) graphically describes a woman on the
   streets of New York who was imitating other people’s expressions and gestures
   as she passed them on the sidewalk:
   Suddenly, desperately, the old woman turned aside, into an alley-way which
   led off the main street. And there, with all the appearances of a woman
   violently sick, she expelled . . . all the gestures, the postures, the
   expressions, the demeanours, the entire behavioural repertoires, of the past
   forty or fifty people she had passed. (p. 123)
   Symptoms begin between the ages of 2 and 15 years and usually progress from
   simple to more complex tics, with increasing compulsive or ritualistic qualities.
   The incidence of Tourette is difficult to determine; in recent studies the numbers
   have varied from 3 to 8 per 1,000 persons. In a survey of 64,000 children in the
   United States, the rate was 3 out of every 1,000, with three times as many males
   as females (Scahill, Bitsko, Visser, & Blumberg, 2009). Tourette syndrome is
   genetically influenced, with a concordance rate of 53% for identical twins and
   8% for fraternal twins (R. A. Price, Kidd, Cohen, Pauls, & Leckman, 1985).
   Tourette shares some genetic roots with OCD; a third of patients with early-onset
   OCD also have Tourette syndrome (do Rosario-Campos et al., 2005), and 30%
   of adults with Tourette are also diagnosed with OCD (R. A. King, Leckman,
   Scahill, & Cohen, 1998). Recent studies have identified a mutation of the
   SLITRK1 gene in Tourette and found a mutation of the Hdc gene in a man and
   his eight offspring, all of whom have the disorder (Abelson et al., 2005; Ercan-
   Sencicek et al., 2010). The genes function in neural development and
   transmission, and both are highly active in brain areas involved in Tourette.
   Tourette syndrome, like OCD, involves increased activity in the basal ganglia.
   But unlike OCD, the most frequently prescribed drug for Tourette is an
   antidopaminergic drug, haloperidol, though newer antidopamine drugs are also
   being used. One effect dopamine has is motor activation, and Malison and his
   colleagues (1995) found that dopamine activity is elevated in Tourette sufferers
   in the caudate nuclei of the basal ganglia (Figure 14.33). There has been some
   success treating Tourette with deep brain stimulation to the thalamus, which
   suppressed tics and produced feelings of calmness (Okun et al., 2013).
   Borderline Personality Disorder
   To finish up our tour of the psychological disorders, we end with one of the most
   intriguing personality disorders: borderline personality disorder (BPD). This
   condition, which affects 0.5–5.9% of the population (Grant et al., 2008), is
   characterized by unstable interpersonal relationships, poor self-image, and
   impulsivity. Individuals with this condition have an intense fear of abandonment
   and rejection and an equally strong desire to be loved. They often switch
   between intense feelings of “love” and “hate,” they engage in risky behaviors
   such as gambling and speeding, and they are at a very high risk for suicide and
   suicidal thoughts. In fact, 8%–10% of individuals with BPD kill themselves, and
   they are prone to taking medication far beyond the recommended dose in
   committing suicide.

   systematic review and proposal of an integrative model,” by A. Amad et al.,
   2014, Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 40, pp. 6–19. Copyright ©
   2014 Elsevier. Used with permission.
   BPD has a strong genetic basis, with a heritability about 40% (Amad, Ramoz,
   Thomas, Jardri, & Gorwood, 2014). Genes linked to BPD include ones
   responsible for serotonin receptors, serotonin transporters such as 5HTTLPR,
   dopamine transporters such as DAT1, and enzymes that make neurotransmitters
   (such as tyrosine hydroxylase), as well as genes that influence neuronal survival
   (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and neuronal death (see Amad et al., 2014,
   for a review of the research that led to these conclusions). Therefore, BPD
   appears to be caused by dysfunction of both serotonin and dopamine
   neurotransmitter systems, as well as by decreases in neuronal number. Of
   interest was a finding that the MAOA gene (discussed in Chapter 8) is linked to
   both aggressive behaviors and borderline personality disorder (Craig & Halton,
   2009). Even with these genetic correlates, the remaining 60% of the disorder
   likelihood is environmental; indeed, psychiatrists believe the genes predispose
   an individual toward the imbalance of BPD but that a set of environmental
   events must happen to activate the epigenetic changes that result in the disorder
   (Figure 14.34).

   Take a Minute to Check Your Knowledge and Understanding
   Describe the symptoms of OCD and the related disorders.
   What are the distinguishing characteristics of borderline personality disorder?
   What treatments are used with these disorders?
   In Perspective
   The past several decades have seen enormous progress in research, and we now
   know a great deal about the physiological causes of disorders. We owe these
   breakthroughs to advances in imaging techniques and genetics research
   technology and to our greatly improved understanding of the physiology of
   synapses, not to mention the persistence of dedicated researchers. The result is
   that we can now describe at the biological level many disorders that previously
   were believed to be “psychological” in origin or that were only suspected of
   having an organic basis.
   Despite these great research advances, we cannot reliably distinguish the
   schizophrenic brain from a normal one, or diagnose psychological disorders
   from a blood test. We may be able to someday, but in the meantime, we rely on
   changes in behavior of the individuals for a disorder diagnosis. This can be
   difficult, because these disorders frequently share common features (for
   example, schizophrenia, mood disorders with psychotic features, and bipolar I
   disorder). We know, at least to some extent, the physiological components of
   mental illness, but we do not understand the unique combination of
   physiological and environmental factors that determines who will suffer from a
   disorder and who will not. If that is true, our treatments will remain a pale hope
   rather than a bright promise.
   We have been reminded repeatedly that genetic vulnerability is not the same
   thing as fate. In most cases, the genes produce an illness only with the
   cooperation of the environment. This point is emphasized by the fact that
   psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy play an important role in
   treatment, enhancing and frequently exceeding the benefit that drugs can provide
   (see Durand & Barlow, 2006). While we search for genetic treatments of the
   disorders, we must remind ourselves once again that heredity is not destiny;
   improving the physical and psychological welfare of the population would go a
   long way toward preventing mental illness or reducing its severity.
   Just before the dawning of this new age of research, one frustrated schizophrenia
   researcher concluded, “Almost everything remains to be done” (Heston, 1970, p.
   254). Since then our knowledge of both the brain and its participation in the
   symptoms of mental illness has increased dramatically, but as you can see, much
   of our understanding remains tentative. The pace is quickening, and we are
   confident that in this second decade of the new millennium, we will be
   celebrating even more impressive advances than in the past.
   Chapter Summary
   Schizophrenia
   Schizophrenia is characterized by a mix of positive and negative symptoms such as
   hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, and social and emotional withdrawal.
   Twin and adoption studies indicate that heritability is .60 to .90. Genetic influences
   involve many small-effect genes and rarer copy number variations with stronger effects.
   Genes apparently determine the level of vulnerability.
   Positive and negative symptoms may be distinguished by excess dopamine activity versus
   brain deficits.
   Although there is evidence for the dopamine hypothesis, it is an incomplete explanation.
   The glutamate hypothesis is getting more attention because NMDA receptor antagonists
   produce symptoms of schizophrenia and drugs that activate NMDA receptors relieve
   them.
   The brain irregularities include ventricular enlargement (due to tissue deficits),
   hypofrontality, and impaired connections; these apparently arise from prenatal insults and
   impaired postnatal development, in interaction with genetic vulnerability. Reduced
   connectivity and impaired synchrony between areas are also involved.
   Maternal effect from illnesses such as influenza and prenatal starvation are examples of
   environmental influences.
   Affective Disorders
   The affective disorders include depression, mania, and bipolar disorder, an alternation
   between mania and depression.
   The affective disorders are also highly heritable, especially for women. Some genes are
   shared with schizophrenia, ASD, and ADHD.
   The most prominent explanation of affective disorders is the monoamine hypothesis—an
   imbalance in serotonin and epinephrine.
   Electroconvulsive therapy is a controversial but very effective last-resort therapy that has
   value when medications fail and as a temporary suicide preventative; both drugs and ECT
   increase neurogenesis and neural plasticity.
   People with affective disorders often have circadian rhythm disruptions. Others respond
   to circannual changes with winter depression or summer depression.
   Bipolar disorder is now considered to be a separate group of disorders, and is the bridge
   disorder between schizophrenia and depression.
   Bipolar disorder is less understood than unipolar depression. Response to atypical
   antipsychotics suggests involvement of dopamine and, possibly, serotonin.
   A number of brain anomalies distinguish depressed people from bipolar patients and both
   from normal people.
   Depression, low serotonin activity, and several genes are associated with suicide risk.
   Anxiety, Trauma, and Stress-Related Disorders
   The anxiety disorders are characterized mostly by brain hyperresponsiveness, but activity
   is decreased in some areas in posttraumatic stress disorder.
   Anxiety involves low serotonin activity; GABA transmission and benzodiazepine
   receptor deficiency may also be involved.
   The anxiety disorders are partially hereditary, and the serotonin system is most often
   implicated. There is considerable overlap with mood disorders.
   Personality Disorders
   In obsessive-compulsive disorder, activity is increased in the orbitofrontal cortex;
   deficient connections with the cingulate gyrus apparently reduce impulse control.
   OCD is associated with grooming disorders.
   Tourette syndrome shares some genetic roots with OCD, but OCD appears to involve
   high serotonin activity, whereas Tourette is treated with dopamine antagonists.
   In borderline personality disorder, there is a strong tendency for impulsivity, rapid
   emotional swings, and a series of damaging and maladaptive behaviors like cutting,
   suicide, and risky behaviors.
   BPD is thought to occur through the epigenetic activation of genes related to serotonin,
   dopamine, and aggression systems.

   Kenneth Parks got up from the couch where he had been sleeping and drove 14
   miles to his in-laws’ home. There he struggled with his father-in-law before
   stabbing his mother-in-law repeatedly, killing her. He then drove to the police
   station, where he told the police that he thought he had “killed some people.” In
   court, his defense was that he was sleepwalking. Based on the testimony of sleep
   experts and the lack of motive—Ken had an affectionate relationship with his in-
   laws—the jury acquitted him of murder (Broughton et al., 1994).

   Were Ken’s actions possible for someone who was sleepwalking? Was he really
   asleep and therefore not responsible? This case raises the question of what we
   mean by consciousness. Many psychologists, and especially neuroscientists,
   avoid the topic because they think that consciousness is inaccessible to research.
   This has not always been so; consciousness was a major concern of the fledgling
   discipline of psychology near the end of the 19th century. But the researchers’
   technique of introspection was subjective: The observations were open only to
   the individuals doing the introspecting, who often disagreed with each other.
   This failing encouraged the development of behaviorism, which was based on
   the principle that psychology should study only the relationships between
   external stimuli and observable responses. Behaviorism was a necessary means
   of cleansing psychology of its subjective methods, but its purge discarded the
   subject matter along with the methodology. The interests of psychologists would
   not shift back to include internal experience until the emergence of the field of
   cognitive psychology in the 1950s and 1960s.
   Many cognitive psychologists were finding it difficult to understand
   psychological functions such as learning and perception without taking account
   of various aspects of consciousness. Still, few of them tackled the subject of
   consciousness itself. The problem seemed too big, there was no clear definition
   of consciousness, and the bias that consciousness was a problem for
   philosophers still lingered. Gradually, some of them began to ally themselves
   with philosophers, biologists, and computer experts to develop new research
   strategies for exploring this last frontier of psychology. The greatest inroads have
   been made in the study of sleep, largely because sleep is readily observable.
   Also, because sleep is open to study by objective techniques, it has not had the
   stigma among researchers that characterizes other aspects of consciousness. We
   will begin this last leg of our journey with the topic of sleep and dreaming.
   Studying the brain without studying consciousness would be like studying the stomach
   without studying digestion.
   —John R. Searle
   Sleep and Dreaming
   Each night, we slip into a mysterious state that is neither entirely conscious nor
   unconscious. Sleep has intrigued humans throughout history: Metaphysically,
   dreaming suggested to our forebears that the soul took leave of the body at night
   to wander the world; practically, sleep is a period of enforced nonproductivity
   and vulnerability to predators and enemies.
   In spite of thousands of research studies, we are still unclear on the most basic
   question—What is the function of sleep? The most obvious explanation is that
   sleep is restorative. Support for this idea comes from the observation that species
   with higher metabolic rates typically spend more time in sleep (Zepelin &
   Rechtschaffen, 1974). A less obvious explanation is the adaptive hypothesis;
   according to this view, the amount of sleep an animal engages in depends on the
   availability of food and on safety considerations (Webb, 1974). Elephants, for
   instance, which must graze for many hours to meet their food needs, sleep
   briefly. Animals with low vulnerability to predators, such as the lion, sleep much
   of the time, as do animals that find safety by hiding, like bats and burrowing
   animals. Vulnerable animals that are too large to burrow or hide—for example,
   horses and cattle—sleep very little (Figure 15.1). In a study of 39 species, the
   combined factors of body size and danger accounted for 80% of the variability in
   sleep time (Allison & Cicchetti, 1976).
   Why do we sleep?
   An interesting new idea is that the brain cleanses itself of toxins during sleep.
   Researchers at the University of Rochester in New York recently discovered a
   network of channels formed by glia, which transport cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
   through the brain. By injecting a colored dye in the brains of mice as they slept
   and a dye of another color when they woke up, the researchers determined that
   large amounts of CSF flowed through the brain during sleep but not during the
   awake state. The researchers then injected β-amyloid proteins into the brains of
   the mice and found that the CSF cleared the proteins out of cells twice as fast
   during sleep (Xie et al., 2013). (Students note: This is one more argument for
   getting enough sleep!)
   Whatever the function of sleep may be, its importance becomes apparent when
   we look at the effects of sleep deprivation. These effects are nowhere more
   evident than in shift work. Shift workers sleep less than day workers, and their
   work performance suffers as a result (Tepas & Carvalhais, 1990). Also, they
   typically fail to adjust their sleep-wake cycles adequately, because their sleep is
   disturbed during the day and they conform to the rest of the world’s schedule on
   weekends. With their work and sleep schedules at odds with their biological
   rhythms, shift workers find that sleep intrudes into their work and daytime
   arousal interferes with their sleep. Another study with mice may give us a clue
   why this happens. After just a few days of sleeping three to five hours a day, the
   mice had lost 25% of the neurons in the locus coeruleus, a part of the brain that
   is important for alertness (J. Zhang et al., 2014).
   In long-term sleep deprivation studies, impairment follows a rhythmic cycle—
   performance declines during the night and then shows some recovery during the
   daytime (Horne, 1988). The persistence of this rhythm represents a safety hazard
   of gigantic proportions when people try to function at night. The largest number
   of single-vehicle traffic accidents attributed to “falling asleep at the wheel” occur
   around 2 a.m. (Mitler et al., 1988), and the number of work errors peaks at the
   same time (Broughton, 1975). In addition, the Three Mile Island nuclear plant
   accident took place at 4 a.m.; the Chernobyl nuclear plant meltdown began at
   1:23 a.m.; the Bhopal, India, chemical plant leakage, which poisoned more than
   2,000 people, began shortly after midnight; and the Exxon Valdez ran aground at
   12:04 a.m., spilling 11 million gallons of oil into fragile Alaskan waters (Alaska
   Oil Spill Commission, 1990; Mapes, 1990; Mitler et al., 1988).
   Travel across time zones also disrupts sleep and impairs performance,
   particularly when you travel eastward. It is difficult to quantify the effects of jet
   lag, but three researchers have attempted to do so in a novel way by comparing
   the performance of baseball teams. When East Coast and West Coast teams
   played at home, their percentage of wins was nearly identical—50% and 49%,
   respectively. When they traveled across the continent but had time to adjust to
   the new time zone, they showed a typical visitor’s disadvantage, winning 45.9%
   of their games. Teams traveling west without time to adjust won about the same,
   43.8% of their games, whereas teams traveling east won only 37.1% (Recht,
   Lew, & Schwartz, 1995). Sleep quality is better when you extend the day’s
   length by traveling west, rather than shorten it as you do when you travel east.
   One way of looking at this effect is that it is easier to stay awake past your
   bedtime than it is to go to sleep when you are not sleepy. We will examine a
   more specific explanation in the next section, when we consider circadian
   rhythms.
   Figure 15.1 Time Spent in Daily Sleep for Different Animals.
   Source: Based on data from “Animal Sleep: A Review of Sleep Duration
   Across Phylogeny,” by S. S. Campbell and I. Tobler, 1984, Neuroscience
   and Biobehavioral Reviews, 8, pp. 269–300.
   Circadian Rhythms
   We saw in Chapter 14 that a circadian rhythm is a rhythm that is about a day in
   length; the term circadian comes from the Latin circa, meaning
   “approximately,” and dia, meaning “day.” We operate on a 24-hour (hr) cycle, in
   synchrony with the solar day. We sleep once every 24 hr, and body temperature,
   alertness, urine production, steroid secretion, and a variety of other activities
   decrease during our normal sleep period and increase during our normal waking
   period, even when we reverse our sleep-wake schedule temporarily.
   Why are circadian rhythms important?
   The main biological clock that controls these rhythms in mammals is the
   suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Lesioning the SCN in
   rats abolishes the normal 24-hr rhythms of sleep, activity, body temperature,
   drinking, and steroid secretion (Abe, Kroning, Greer, & Critchlow, 1979;
   Stephan & Nunez, 1977). The SCN is what is known as a pacemaker, because it
   keeps time and regulates the activity of other cells. We know that the rhythm
   arises in the SCN, because rhythmic activity continues in isolated SCN cells
   (Earnest, Liang, Ratcliff, & Cassone, 1999; Inouye & Kawamura, 1979).
   Lesioned animals do not stop sleeping, but instead of following the usual day-
   night cycle, they sleep in naps scattered throughout the 24-hr period. So the SCN
   controls the timing of sleep, but sleep itself is controlled by other brain
   structures, which we will discuss later. The SCN is shown in Figure 15.2, and
   you can check Figure 6.2 to see its location.
   The SCN is entrained to the solar day by cues called zeitgebers (“time-givers”).
   If humans are kept in isolation from all time cues in an underground bunker or a
   cave, they usually lose their synchrony with the day-night cycle; in many
   studies, zeitgeber-deprived individuals “drifted” to a day that was about 25 hr
   long, with a progressively increasing delay in sleep onset (Figure 15.3; Aschoff,
   1984). For a long time, researchers believed that alarm clocks and the activity of
   others were the most important influences that entrain our activity to the 24-hr
   day, but research points more convincingly to light as the primary zeitgeber.
   The difference in light intensity between the light and dark periods is important
   for entraining the day-night cycle. One group of night workers worked under
   bright lights and slept in complete darkness during the day (light discrepant); a
   second group worked under normal light and slept in the semidarkness that is
   typical of the day sleeper (similar light). The light-discrepant workers scored
   higher in performance and alertness than the similar-light workers. Their
   physiological measures also synchronized with the new sleep-wake cycle; for
   example, their body temperature dropped to its low value around 3:00 p.m.,
   when they were asleep, but the similar-light group’s low continued to occur at
   3:30 a.m. in spite of being awake and working (Czeisler et al., 1990). If you’re
   thinking the take-home from this study is that you should keep the lights as
   bright as possible when you’re awake, you would be wrong. Compared with dim
   light, exposure to normal room light for the 8-hr period before bedtime reduces
   the duration of melatonin release by 90 minutes each night (Gooley et al., 2010).
   Melatonin is a hormone that induces sleepiness. The typically sleep-deprived
   state in modern society appears to be due in part to living under bright lights and
   spending evenings in front of a computer.
   Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.
   —Benjamin Franklin
   Just how much we rely on a regular lighting schedule for entrainment was
   underscored in a study of four Greenpeace volunteers living in isolation during
   the four-month darkness of the Antarctic winter; their sleep times and
   physiological measures free-ran on a roughly 25-hr interval, even though they
   had access to time information and social contact with each other (Kennaway &
   van Dorp, 1991). According to some observers, it is this “slow-running” clock
   that makes phase delays (going to sleep later) easier than phase advances (going
   to sleep earlier). So adjustment after westward travel is easier than after traveling
   east, and workers who rotate shifts sleep better and produce more if the rotation
   is to later shifts rather than to earlier ones (Czeisler, Moore-Ede, & Coleman,
   1982). Some people seem to be relatively insensitive to the environmental cues
   that entrain most of us to a 24-hr day and operate on a 25-hr clock under normal
   circumstances; and like a clock that runs too slowly, their physical and cognitive
   functioning moves in and out of phase with the rest of the world, resulting in
   insomnia and impaired functioning.
   Why the internal clock would operate on a 25-hr cycle is unclear, especially
   since animals kept in isolation typically run on a 24-hr cycle (Czeisler et al.,
   1999). Some researchers believe that it has something to do with the 24.8-hr
   lunar cycle, which influences the tides and activity cycles of a number of marine
   species (T. S. Kaiser, Neumann, & Heckel, 2011; Tessmar-Raible, Raible, &
   Arboleda, 2011). Czeisler and his colleagues (1999) suggested that the 25-hr
   cycle in isolation studies is no more than an artifact of allowing the individuals
   to control the room lighting. Bright light late in the day causes the cycle to
   lengthen, so Czeisler kept the light at a level that was too low to influence the
   circadian rhythm while people lived on a 28-hr sleep-wake schedule. Under that
   condition, their body temperature cycle averaged 24.18 hr, which led Czeisler to
   conclude that the biological rhythm is approximately 24 hr long. By the way, if
   you think a lunar influence on sleep is hard to believe, Swiss researchers have
   preliminary evidence for it. Near the time of the full moon, volunteers sleeping
   in a windowless laboratory slept 20 minutes less, produced half as much
   melatonin, and had 30% less of one stage of sleep than at other times of the
   month (Cajochen et al., 2013). The researchers believe this observation
   represents an inherent biological rhythm, but they admit that the results could
   have been influenced by exposure to brighter evening light before their subjects
   entered the laboratory.

   The SCN regulates the pineal gland’s secretion of melatonin. Melatonin is often
   used to combat jet lag and to treat insomnia in shift workers and in the blind
   (Arendt, Skene, Middleton, Lockley, & Deacon, 1997). Light resets the
   biological clock by suppressing melatonin secretion (Boivin, Duffy, Kronauer, &
   Czeisler, 1996). Most totally blind individuals are not entrained to the 24-hr day
   and suffer from insomnia in spite of regular schedules of sleep, work, and social
   contact. These individuals do not experience a decrease in melatonin production
   when exposed to light; however, totally blind people without insomnia do show
   melatonin suppression by light, even though they are unaware of the light
   (Czeisler et al., 1995).
   Animal studies explain how some blind individuals are able to entrain to the
   light-dark cycle and, thus, how the rest of us do so as well. Light information
   reaches the SCN by way of a direct connection from the retinas called the
   retinohypothalamic pathway; however, mice lacking rods and cones still show
   normal entrainment and cycling, so the signal must arise from some other retinal
   light receptors (M. S. Freedman et al., 1999; Lucas, Freedman, Muñoz, Garcia-
   Fernández, & Foster, 1999). Ganglion cells ordinarily receive information about
   light from the receptors, but about 1% of ganglion cells respond to light directly
   and send neurons into the retinohypothalamic pathway (Berson, Dunn, & Takao,
   2002; Hannibal, Hindersson, Knudsen, Georg, & Fahrenkrug, 2002; Hattar, Liao,
   Takao, Berson, & Yau, 2002). These ganglion cells contain melanopsin, which is
   a light-sensitive substance, or photopigment (Dacey et al., 2005; Panda et al.,
   2005; Qiu et al., 2005). The melanopsin is located in their widely branching
   dendrites, which suits the cells for detecting the overall level of light, as opposed
   to contributing to image formation (Figure 15.4). A study has confirmed that
   human retinas have melanopsin in some of their ganglion cells (Dkhissi-
   Benyahya, Rieux, Hut, & Cooper, 2006).

   However, synchronizing the rhythm does not account for the rhythm itself. The
   internal clock consists of a few genes and their protein products (Clayton,
   Kyriacou, & Reppert, 2001; Hastings, Reddy, & Maywood, 2003; Shearman et
   al., 2000); the genes fall into two groups, one group that is turned on while the
   other is turned off. When the genes are on, their particular protein products build
   up. Eventually, the accumulating proteins turn their genes off, and the other set
   of genes is turned on. This feedback loop provides the approximately 24- or 25-
   hr cycle, which then must be reset each day by light. This process is not limited
   to neurons in the SCN; there are additional clocks, located outside the brain and
   controlling the activities of the body’s organs (Hastings et al., 2003). These
   clocks operate independently of the SCN, but the SCN entrains them to the day-
   night cycle. Feeding is an example of an activity that is controlled independently.
   According to the researchers, local clocks that affect blood pressure and heart
   activity explain why there is a large increase in the risk of heart attack, stroke,
   and sudden cardiac death after waking in the morning. The clock in the SCN
   does not always operate properly, as we saw in Chapter 14 with some depressed
   patients.
   Rhythms During Waking and Sleeping
   Riding on the day-long wave of the circadian rhythm are several ultradian
   rhythms, rhythms that are shorter than a day in length. Hormone production,
   urinary output, alertness, and other functions follow regular cycles throughout
   the day. For example, the dip in alertness and performance in the wee hours of
   the morning is mirrored by another in the early afternoon, which cannot be
   accounted for by postlunch sleepiness, because it also occurs in people who skip
   lunch (Broughton, 1975). Incidentally, this dip coincides with the time of siesta
   in many cultures and a rest period in nonhuman primates. The basic rest and
   activity cycle is a rhythm that is about 90–100 minutes (min) long. When people
   wrote down what they were thinking every 5 min for 10 hr, the contents showed
   that they were daydreaming on a 90-min cycle; EEG recordings verified that
   these were periods of decreased brain activity (Kripke & Sonnenschein, 1973).
   What rhythms occur throughout the day and night?

   The common view of sleep is that it is a cessation of activity that occurs when
   the body and brain become fatigued. Sleep, however, is an active process. This is
   true in two respects. First, you will soon see that sleep is a very busy time; a
   great deal of activity goes on in the brain. Second, sleep is not like a car running
   out of gas but instead is turned on by brain structures and later turned off by
   other structures.
   The most important measure of sleep activity is the EEG. When a person is
   awake, the EEG is a mix of alpha and beta waves. Alpha is activity whose
   voltage fluctuates at a frequency of 8–12 hertz (Hz) and moderate amplitude;
   beta has a frequency of 13–30 Hz and a lower amplitude. Beta waves, which are
   associated with arousal and alertness, are progressively replaced by alpha waves
   as the person relaxes (Figure 15.5). It may seem strange that the amplitude of the
   EEG is lower during arousal. Remember that the EEG is the sum of the electrical
   activity of all the neurons between the two recording electrodes. When a person
   is cognitively aroused, neurons under the electrodes are mostly desynchronized
   in their firing as they carry out their separate tasks; with the neurons firing at
   different times, the EEG has a high frequency, but the amplitude is rather low.
   As the person relaxes, the neurons have less processing to do and fall into a
   pattern of synchronized firing. The rate is low, but the cumulative amplitude of
   the neurons firing at the same time is high.
   As the person slips into the light first stage of sleep, the EEG shifts to theta
   waves, with a frequency of 4–7 Hz (Figure 15.5). About 10 min later, Stage 2
   begins, indicated by the appearance of K complexes and sleep spindles. K
   complexes are sharp, large waves that occur about once a minute; sleep spindles
   are brief bursts of 12- to 14-Hz waves that appear to serve a gating function,
   preventing disruptive stimuli from reaching the cortex and waking the sleeper
   (Dang-Vu, McKinney, Buxton, Solet, & Ellenbogen, 2010). Stages 3 and 4 are
   known as slow-wave sleep and are characterized by large, slow delta waves
   at a frequency of 1–3 Hz. The person moves around in bed during this period,
   turning over and changing positions. Sleepwalking, bedwetting, and night
   terrors, disturbances that are common in children, occur during slow-wave sleep,
   too. Night terrors are not nightmares but involve screaming and apparent terror,
   which are usually forgotten in the morning; they are not a sign of a disorder
   unless they continue beyond childhood. After Stage 4, the sleeper moves rather
   quickly back through the stages in reverse order. But rather than returning to
   Stage 1, the sleeper enters rapid eye movement sleep.
   Figure 15.5 Electroencephalogram and the Stages of Sleep.

   Kalamazoo, MI: Upjohn.
   Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is so called because the eyes dart back and
   forth horizontally during this stage. The EEG returns to a pattern similar to a
   relaxed waking state, but the person does not wake up; in fact, the sleeper is not
   easily aroused by noise but does respond to meaningful sounds, such as the
   sleeper’s name. It is easy to see why some researchers call this stage paradoxical
   sleep, because paradoxical means “contradictory.” During REM sleep,
   respiration rate and heart rate increase. Males experience genital erection, and
   vaginal secretion increases in females. In spite of these signs of arousal, the body
   is very still—in fact, in a state of muscular paralysis or atonia. A complete cycle
   through the stages of sleep—like the daydreaming cycle—takes about 90 min to
   complete. The night’s sleep is a series of repetitions of this ultradian rhythm,
   although the length of REM sleep periods increases and the amount of slow-
   wave sleep decreases through the night (Figure 15.6).
   Figure 15.6 Time Spent in Various Sleep Stages During the Night.
   If people sleeping in the laboratory are awakened by the researcher during REM
   sleep, about 80% of the time they report dreaming. Dreams also occur during the
   other, non-REM sleep stages, but they are less frequent, less vivid, and less
   hallucinatory. Even people who say that they do not dream report dreaming
   when they are awakened from REM sleep; their non-REM sleep dreams are less
   frequent, though, and they often describe their experience as “thinking” (H. B.
   Lewis, Goodenough, Shapiro, & Sleser, 1966). Apparently, “nondreamers” just
   fail to remember their dreams in the morning; in fact, we ordinarily remember a
   dream only if we wake up before the short-term memory of the dream has faded
   (Koulack & Goodenough, 1976). High-density EEG recording (using 256
   channels) has revealed high-frequency activity (10–50 Hz) in areas related to the
   dream content—in the right posterior parietal cortex when the dream concerned
   a specific spatial setting, in Wernicke’s area when speech was involved, and in
   the fusiform face area when people’s faces were a part of the dream (Siclari et
   al., 2017).
   The Functions of Sleep
   The effects of sleep loss leave no doubt about the importance of sleep. You have
   seen, for example, that the early morning hours are particularly vulnerable times
   for traffic accidents and major disasters. Cognitive impairment suffers
   especially; reducing sleep time to 6 hr or 4 hr for 14 days reduced alertness and
   working memory performance, with deficits equivalent to one night or two
   nights of total sleep deprivation, respectively (Van Dongen, Maislin, Mullington,
   & Dinges, 2003). Early research efforts were based on the idea that the main
   function of sleep is rest and restoration, with the major focus on non-REM sleep.
   One reason is that after total sleep deprivation, Stage 4 non-REM sleep is
   recovered before REM sleep (Anders & Roffwarg, 1973). Another reason is that
   slow-wave sleep increases following exercise; after athletes competed in a 92-
   kilometer race, slow-wave sleep was elevated for four consecutive nights
   (Shapiro, Bortz, Mitchell, Bartel, & Jooste, 1981). However, this effect appears
   to be due to overheating rather than fatigue. The night after people ran on
   treadmills, slow-wave sleep increased, at the expense of REM sleep; but if they
   were sprayed with water while they ran, their body temperature increased less
   than half as much and there was no change in slow-wave sleep (Horne & Moore,
   1985). Horne & Harley (1989) believed that the slow-wave sleep increases are
   more related to the increase in the temperature of the brain than the increase in
   body temperature; heating only the head and face with a hair dryer was sufficient
   to increase slow-wave sleep later. According to Horne (1992), slow-wave sleep
   promotes cerebral recovery, especially in the prefrontal cortex, and there is
   evidence it restores processes involved in cognitive functioning. M. H. Bonnet
   and Arand (1996) gave people either caffeine or a placebo before a 3.5-hr nap.
   The caffeine group had reduced slow-wave sleep during the nap; although they
   felt more vigorous and no sleepier than the placebo group, they performed less
   well on arithmetic and vigilance tasks during a subsequent 41-hr work period.
   What are the functions of REM and slow-wave sleep?
   To find out what functions REM sleep serves, researchers deprived volunteers of
   REM sleep by waking the research participants every time EEG and eye
   movement recordings indicated that they were entering a REM period. When
   this was done the subjects showed a “push” for more REM sleep. They went into
   REM more frequently as the study progressed and had to be awakened more
   often; then, on uninterrupted recovery nights, they tended to make up the lost
   REM by increasing their REM from about 20% of total sleep time to 25% or
   30% (Dement, 1960). To psychoanalytically oriented theorists, these results were
   evidence of a psychological need for dreaming; but because REM sleep is so
   pervasive among birds and mammals, most neuroscientists believe that any
   explanation must be a biological one, and they treat dreaming as merely the by-
   product of spontaneous neural activity in the brain.
   One hypothesis is that REM sleep promotes neural development during
   childhood. Infant sleep starts with REM rather than non-REM sleep, and the
   proportion of sleep devoted to REM is around 50% during infancy and decreases
   through childhood until it reaches an adult level during adolescence (Roffwarg,
   Muzio, & Dement, 1966). According to this hypothesis, excitation that spreads
   through the brain from the pons during REM sleep encourages differentiation,
   maturation, and myelination in higher brain centers, similar to the way
   spontaneous waves of excitation sweep across the retina during development to
   help organize its structure (see Chapter 3). There is some evidence from studies
   of the immature visual systems of newborn cats that REM sleep, and particularly
   these waves from the pons, regulates the rate of neural development (Shaffery,
   Roffwarg, Speciale, & Marks, 1999). The fact that sleep is associated with the
   upregulation of a number of genes involved in neural plasticity (see Chapter 12),
   as well as other genes that contribute to the synthesis and maintenance of myelin
   and cell membranes (Cirelli et al., 2004), is certainly consistent with this
   neurodevelopmental hypothesis. In addition, it suggests our next topic, which
   deals with the role of sleep beyond the developmental period. In the words of
   Giulio Tononi and Chiara Cirelli, sleep is “the price we pay for plasticity” (2014,
   p. 12).
   Sleep, Plasticity, and Memory
   In Chapter 12, you learned that a period of sleep following learning enhances
   later performance (Figure 15.7). REM sleep has received the most attention; it
   increases during the sleep period following learning, and REM sleep deprivation
   after learning reduces retention (see review in Dujardin, Guerrien, & Leconte,
   1990; Karni, Tanne, Rubenstein, Askenasy, & Sagi, 1994; C. Smith, 1995). How
   much REM sleep increases depends on how well the subject learned (Hennevin,
   Hars, Maho, & Bloch, 1995). Observation of hippocampal activity after learning
   suggests why REM sleep is important. Replay during REM sleep of neural
   activity that occurred during learning (see Chapter 12) is synchronized with
   spontaneous theta-frequency (4–7 Hz) activity in the hippocampus (Stickgold,
   Hobson, Fosse, & Fosse, 2001); in other words, the peaks of one wave coincide
   with the peaks of the other. (You may remember from Chapter 12 that
   hippocampal theta is necessary for LTP to occur.) After four to seven days, the
   time during which memories become independent of the hippocampus, the
   replay shifts out of phase with the theta activity, with the peaks of one wave
   coinciding with the troughs of the other. This suggests that a period of
   consolidation is followed by one of deleting connections—representing old
   memories, inaccurate connections, or both.

   Some research suggests that consolidation is a multistep process requiring a
   combination of slow-wave and REM sleep. Overnight improvement on a visual
   discrimination task in humans was correlated with the percentage of slow-wave
   sleep during the first quarter of the night and the percentage of REM sleep in the
   last quarter of the night (Figure 15.8; Stickgold, Whidbee, Schirmer, Patel, &
   Hobson, 2000). Even a 60- to 90-min nap that included both REM and slow-
   wave sleep produced significant improvement in performance (Mednick,
   Nakayama, & Stickgold, 2003). According to Ribeiro and his colleagues (2004),
   neuronal replay is strongest during non-REM sleep, and ample evidence from
   animal and human studies indicates the importance of non-REM sleep for
   learning (Hairston & Knight, 2004). For example, applying a 0.75-Hz oscillating
   current over the frontal and temporal areas or sounding tones timed to coincide
   with individual EEG waves increases slow-wave activity and improves the recall
   of word associations learned prior to sleep (L. Marshall, Helgadóttir, Mölle, &
   Born, 2006; J. L. Ong et al., 2016; Papalambros et al., 2017; Westerberg et al.,
   2015). Replay during non-REM sleep is accompanied by 200-millisecond bursts
   of fast-frequency (100–120 Hz) activity known as ripples, which are generated
   by the hippocampus and activate the default mode network, which is otherwise
   quiescent during non-REM sleep (Kaplan et al., 2016; M. P. Walker &
   Robertson, 2016). The number of ripples increases after intensive learning, and
   this increase predicts the success of memory consolidation; electrical stimulation
   of the hippocampus suppresses ripples and impairs learning.
   In their synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, Tononi and Cirelli (2013, 2014) argue
   that there is far better evidence for synaptic pruning during sleep than for
   consolidation; they believe this pruning improves the accuracy of information
   that was stored during waking by eliminating inaccurate connections. According
   to them, ripples, slow waves, and sleep spindles down-select synapses that were
   activated rarely during waking or that fit less well with old memories, whereas
   synapses that were strengthened repeatedly during waking or that are better
   integrated with older memories are protected. Luisa de Vivo and her colleagues
   (2017) used three-dimensional electron microscopy to observe 6,920 synapses in
   mice and confirmed that, during sleep, synaptic spines decreased at smaller, less
   stable synapses, whereas stronger synapses were spared.
   Brain Structures of Sleep and Waking
   We have seen one of the ways sleep can be regarded as an active process: A
   great deal of activity goes on in the brain during sleep; in fact, the brain’s energy
   use is not significantly lower in sleep than during waking, and may even increase
   during slow-wave sleep (Dworak, McCarley, Kim, Kalinchuk, & Basheer, 2010).
   For the second aspect of this active process, we turn to the brain structures
   involved in turning sleep on and off. There is no single sleep center or waking
   center; sleep and waking depend on a variety of structures that integrate the
   timing of the SCN with homeostatic information about physical conditions such
   as fatigue, brain temperature, and time awake. Sleep is a homeostatic process, in
   that a period of deprivation is followed by a period of sleep; the balance between
   the two is brought about by mutually inhibiting wake and sleep centers. The
   network of structures governing sleep and waking is complex, so you will want
   to trace its connections carefully in Figures 15.9 and 15.11. Except where noted,
   the following discussion is taken from the thorough review of the literature by
   Clifford Safer and his Harvard colleagues (Saper, Fuller, Pedersen, Lu, &
   Scammell, 2010). We will begin with the structures that produce wakefulness.
   What brain structures are responsible for sleep and waking?
   Waking and Arousal Controls
   The waking network consists of two major pathways (Figure 15.9); we will start
   with the brainstem arousal centers, which send their activating signals to higher
   levels of the brain. This ascending pathway is itself made up of two branches.
   The first consists of pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei
   (PPT/LDT), which fire most rapidly during wakefulness and REM sleep and
   most slowly during non-REM sleep, apparently driving the cortical activation
   seen outside non-REM sleep. The second branch includes the locus coeruleus,
   raphe nuclei, tuberomammillary nucleus, and parabrachial nucleus. A
   distinction between the two branches is that although they both send projections
   to the prefrontal cortex, basal forebrain, and lateral hypothalamus, the PPT/LDT
   also has connections to the thalamus. Figure 15.10 shows how firing varies with
   sleep and waking in two of these areas.
   Figure 15.9 Structures of Waking and Arousal.
   Figures Brought to Life
   Although lesions of these brain stem structures produce a loss of wakefulness,
   both animals and humans recover normal sleep-wake cycles within a period of
   weeks or months; this underscores the additional contribution of the forebrain
   arousal centers. The basal forebrain produces wakefulness and
   desynchronization of the EEG; disabling the basal forebrain with an anesthetic
   results in deep non-REM sleep. Similarly, orexin (hypocretin)-releasing neurons
   in the lateral hypothalamus both sustain wakefulness and suppress REM sleep.
   Like the brain stem centers, the forebrain arousal centers innervate the prefrontal
   cortex; the prefrontal cortex in turn sends descending projections back to the
   basal forebrain, hypothalamus, and brain stem.

   Non-REM Sleep Controls
   The most important structure in the non-REM sleep network is the ventrolateral
   preoptic nucleus (VLPO; Figure 15.11). Many of the VLPO’s neurons fire two to
   four times faster during non-REM sleep than during wakefulness, and double
   that again as sleep deepens further. Lesions indicate that the VLPO’s core is
   partly responsible for non-REM sleep and the extended VLPO contributes to
   REM sleep. The VLPO sends inhibitory signals to the lateral hypothalamus and
   the second branch of the brain stem arousal network; Saper and his colleagues
   suggest that the VLPO and the ascending arousal system are the basis for
   switching between the awake and sleep states. Rats with lesions of the VLPO
   still sleep about 50% as much as normal rats, which means there must be other
   sleep centers inhibiting the arousal systems. At least one has been identified; the
   parafacial zone in the medulla contributes to non-REM sleep by sending
   inhibition to the parabrachial nucleus (Anaclet et al., 2014).

   REM Sleep Controls
   High-voltage PGO waves, so called because of their path of travel from the
   pons through the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus to the occipital
   area, begin about 80 seconds before the start of a REM period and
   apparently are what initiate the EEG desynchrony of REM sleep (Figure
   15.12; Mansari, Sakai, & Jouvet, 1989; Steriade, Paré, Bouhassira, Deschênes, &
   Oakson, 1989). PGO waves are as characteristic of REM sleep as rapid eye
   movements are. Their arousal of the occipital area may account for the visual
   imagery of dreaming. PGO waves are synchronized with bursts of firing in
   PPT/LDT nuclei, while firing in the other arousal centers (locus coeruleus, raphe
   nucleus, and tuberomammillary nucleus) almost disappears. This suggests that
   the PPT/LDT might interact with the PGO nuclei to regulate alternation between
   non-REM and REM sleep.
   The most important REM sleep center in the pons is the sublaterodorsal nucleus
   (SLD), which appears to govern switching in and out of REM sleep. Lesioning
   the SLD reduces REM sleep in rats; in cats it eliminates output to the
   magnocellular nucleus in the medulla, which is responsible for the atonia of
   REM sleep. The cats seemed to be acting out their dreams (assuming that cats
   dream), and their movements often woke them up (Shouse & Siegel, 1992).

   Sleep Disorders
   Insomnia
   Insomnia is the inability to sleep or to obtain adequate-quality sleep, to the
   extent that the person feels inadequately rested. Insomnia is important not
   only as a nuisance but also because sleep duration has important implications for
   health. In a study of 1.1 million men and women, sleeping less than 6 hr a night
   was associated with decreased life expectancy (Kripke, Garfinkel, Wingard,
   Klauber, & Marler, 2002). However, the surprise in the study was that sleeping
   more than 8.5 hr was associated with as great an increase in risk of death as
   sleeping less than 4.5 hr. Lack of sleep may also be a factor in the obesity
   epidemic. In a long-term study of sleep behavior, people who slept less than 8 hr
   a night had a higher body mass index, along with lower leptin and higher ghrelin
   levels (Taheri, Lin, Austin, Young, & Mignot, 2004).
   What are the causes of sleep disorders?
   The failure to get enough sleep is part of the lifestyle of industrialized countries,
   but many people who try to get an adequate amount of sleep complain that they
   have difficulty either falling asleep or staying asleep. In a survey by the National
   Sleep Foundation (2002), over half the respondents reported that they had
   trouble sleeping or woke up unrefreshed at least a few nights a week, and a third
   had experienced at least one symptom of insomnia every night or almost every
   night in the past year. Insomnia is one of the few disorders that is essentially
   self-diagnosed, and several studies suggest that the reported frequencies might
   be misleading. Although insomniacs may overestimate the time required to get
   to sleep and the amount of time awake through the night (Rosa & Bonnet, 2000),
   there are several indications that their sleep quality suffers from hyperarousal.
   These include excess high-frequency EEG during non-REM sleep (Perlis, Smith,
   Andrews, Orff, & Giles, 2001) and disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-
   adrenal axis (see Chapter 8), with increased secretion of cortisol and
   adrenocorticotropic hormone during the night (Vgontzas et al., 2001).
   Insomnia can be brought on by a number of factors, such as stress, but it also
   occurs frequently in people with psychological problems, especially affective
   disorders (Benca, Obermeyer, Thisted, & Gillin, 1992). Some loss of gray matter
   in the orbitofrontal cortex and the parietal cortex has been reported in
   insomniacs (Altena, Vrenken, Van Der Werf, van den Heuvel, & Van Someren,
   2010); this could be a cause of their insomnia, or it could reflect the association
   with psychological disorders. Another study found reduced white matter
   integrity in several right hemisphere areas, the thalamus, and the corpus
   callosum; deficiencies in the thalamus and corpus callosum were correlated with
   the duration of patients’ insomnia and with self ratings of depression (S. Li et al.,
   2016). Another frequent cause is the treatment of insomnia; most sleep
   medications are addictive, so attempts to do without medication or to reduce the
   dosage produce a rebound insomnia; this can happen after as little as three nights
   with some benzodiazepines (Kales, Scharf, Kales, & Soldatos, 1979). Insomnia
   can manifest itself as delayed sleep onset, nighttime waking, or early waking; a
   disruption of the circadian rhythm is often the culprit (M. Morris, Lack, &
   Dawson, 1990).
   People with sleep difficulties often show a shift in their circadian rhythm; this
   can be the result of bad sleep habits, but it is more likely the cause. Normally,
   people fall asleep when their body temperature is decreasing in the evening and
   wake up when it is rising. But if your body temperature is still high at bedtime
   (phase delay), you will experience sleep-onset insomnia; if your body
   temperature rises too early (phase advance) you will wake up long before the
   alarm clock goes off (Figure 15.13). Sleep is also more efficient if you go to bed
   when your body temperature is low; for example, a volunteer living in isolation
   from time cues averaged a 7.8-hr sleep length when he went to bed during his
   temperature minimum and a 14.4-hr sleep length when sleep began near his
   temperature peak (Czeisler, Weitzman, & Moore-Ede, 1980). Your chronotype—
   when your internal clock is synchronized to the 24-hr day—depends partly on
   your genes and partly on your environment (Roenneberg et al., 2004). People
   with advanced sleep phase disorder feel compelled to go to sleep around 7:30 in
   the evening and then wake up around 4:30 a.m. A mutation in the circadian clock
   gene CKI has been linked to the disorder (Xu et al., 2005); more recently, three
   mutations in another clock gene, PER2, have also been identified (Chong,
   Ptáček, & Fu, 2012). Delayed sleep phase syndrome—late bedtime and rising—
   has been associated with the PER3 clock gene (S. N. Archer et al., 2003).
   It is usually easier for people to delay sleep at night than to rise early, which led
   to a treatment that seems completely counterintuitive. The patients had a 5- to
   15-year history of sleep-onset insomnia so severe that they were not even going
   to bed until 4:15 a.m., on average. Rather than require them to retire earlier, the
   researchers had the patients stay up 3 hr later each day than the day before. After
   about a week of this routine—for example, going to bed at 8 a.m., 11 a.m., 2
   p.m., 5 p.m., 8 p.m., and 11 p.m. on successive nights—their average sleep-onset
   time had shifted from 4:50 a.m. to 12:20 a.m., and their average waking time had
   shifted from 1:00 p.m. to 7:55 a.m. All five patients were able to give up the
   sleeping pills they had become dependent on, and improvement was long lasting
   (Czeisler et al., 1981). Phototherapy is also sometimes used to reset the circadian
   clock.
   Figure 15.13 Effects of Disrupted Circadian Rhythm on Sleep.
   Sleepwalking
   Some of the sleep disorders are related to specific sleep stages. As we saw
   earlier, bedwetting, night terrors, and sleepwalking occur during slow-wave
   sleep. Although sleepwalking is most frequent during childhood, about 3%–8%
   of adults sleepwalk (A. Dalton, 2005). Kenneth Parks’s story in the opening
   vignette is not unique. The sleepwalking defense was first used in 1846 when
   Albert Tirrell was acquitted of the murder of his prostitute mistress and the arson
   of her brothel, and the plea has been successful in a few more recent instances as
   well (A. Dalton, 2005). Sleepwalking can be triggered by stress, alcohol, and
   sleep deprivation; Ken’s jury was convinced that he was not responsible because
   he was sleep deprived due to stress over gambling debts and the loss of his job
   for embezzling; there was a personal and family history of sleepwalking, sleep
   talking, and bedwetting; and he produced a high level of slow-wave sleep during
   sleep monitoring (Broughton et al., 1994).
   Vulnerability for sleepwalking is at least sometimes genetic. Children of
   sleepwalkers are 10 times more likely to sleepwalk than children without
   sleepwalking relatives, and people with a version of a gene that is also
   implicated in narcolepsy are 3.5 times as likely to sleepwalk as others
   (Lecendreux et al., 2003). The gene is a member of the human leukocyte antigen
   (HLA) family, a group of genes that target foreign cells for attack by the immune
   system, and the authors suspect that cells important in sleep regulation have been
   attacked by the individual’s immune system.
   A less known non-REM sleep behavior is sexsomnia, engaging in sexual
   behavior while asleep. Although usually the worst consequence is
   embarrassment, the behavior has sometimes led to criminal charges (often
   leading to acquittal on grounds of nonresponsibility). The prevalence of
   sexsomnia is uncertain, but 11% of men and 4% of women seeking treatment for
   sleep disorders reported engaging in sexual behavior while asleep (American
   Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2010). Patients with sexsomnia didn’t differ from
   the other patients in fatigue, depression, smoking, or caffeine consumption, but
   they were twice as likely to admit using illicit drugs.
   Somewhere in between people who commit mayhem during sleepwalking and
   those who simply wander about the house are those who suffer from a sleep-
   related eating disorder, the subject of the accompanying Application.
   Narcolepsy
   When stabilization of the sleep switch fails, the result is narcolepsy, a disorder
   in which individuals fall asleep suddenly during the daytime and go directly
   into REM sleep. Another symptom of narcolepsy is cataplexy, in which the
   person has a sudden experience of one component of REM sleep, atonia,
   and falls to the floor paralyzed but fully awake. People with narcolepsy do
   not sleep more than others; rather, the boundaries are lost between sleep and
   waking (Nobili et al., 1996). Dogs also develop the disorder, and the study of
   canine narcolepsy has identified a mutated form of the gene that is responsible
   for the orexin receptor (Figure 15.14; Lin et al., 1999).
   Application: In the Still of the Night
   Shirley Koecheler raids the refrigerator at night (Black & Robertson, 2010). She would like to
   quit because she’s gaining weight, but she isn’t aware she’s doing it until she wakes up in the
   morning to a crumb-filled bed and an uncomfortably full stomach. She even had her husband
   hide the Easter candy, but the next morning she found the wrappers from the chocolate bunnies
   in the wastebasket. Shirley’s 24-year-old daughter Amy is also a sleep eater and has been since
   she was a toddler; the difference is that she doesn’t gain weight. Anna Ryan, like Shirley, started
   sleep eating in adulthood; she didn’t even know about the nighttime kitchen forays that added
   60 pounds to her weight in a year and a half until she went to a sleep clinic to find out why she
   was exhausted every morning. Sleep eaters, usually women, ordinarily pass up healthy snacks
   for high-calorie junk food; they have also been known to eat soap, glue, frozen pizza, paper, and
   even egg shells (Epstein, 2010).
   Source: iStock/Artfoliophoto.
   Sleep-related eating likely has multiple causes. In some instances, the individuals have other
   sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, or a history of substance abuse. Some individuals who take
   pharmacological sleep aids (e.g., Ambien or benzodiazepines such as zolpidem) have reported
   drug-induced sleep-related eating, although the clinical features of these individuals seem to
   differ from those who have sleep-related eating as a primary diagnosis (Komada et al., 2016).
   A reliable and effective treatment has not yet been found. Amy has responded well to a drug
   used to prevent seizures; she still sleep eats occasionally, but it’s no longer the problem it once
   was. It took Anna and her doctor months of trial and error to find a combination of drugs that
   works, but now she sleeps through the night and is losing weight.
   Other researchers studied the effect of orexin as a feeding stimulant in mice by
   disabling both copies of the gene responsible for producing orexin, but what they
   observed was more interesting than eating behavior (Chemelli et al., 1999).
   Occasionally, the mice would suddenly collapse, often while walking around or
   grooming; the mice were narcoleptic! Most narcoleptic humans (those with
   cataplexy) turned out to have the same deficiency as the mice; they had low or
   undetectable levels of orexin, due to a loss of orexin-secreting neurons in the
   hypothalamus (Higuchi et al., 2002; Kanbayashi et al., 2002). The neurons are
   destroyed by an autoimmune reaction, which in some cases can be traced to an
   allele of the HLA immune system gene (Hallmayer et al., 2009). Narcolepsy’s
   concordance of 25%–31% in identical twins (Mignot, 1998) leaves plenty of
   room for environmental influence. Identifying the nongenetic causes has been
   difficult, but one appears to be the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) virus (De la
   Herran-Arita et al., 2013; Han et al., 2011). The onset of narcolepsy tends to be
   seasonal, nearly seven times more frequent shortly after winter; it also increased
   threefold following the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in China, and lab study has shown
   that the virus can trigger the immune reaction.
   REM Sleep Behavior Disorder
   An apparent opposite of cataplexy is REM sleep behavior disorder; affected
   individuals are uncharacteristically physically active during REM sleep,
   often to the point of injuring themselves or their bed partners. A study of 93
   patients, 87% of whom were male, found that 32% had injured themselves and
   64% had assaulted their spouses (E. J. Olson, Boeve, & Silber, 2000). A 67-year-
   old man had tied himself to his bed with a rope at night for 6 years because he
   had a habit of leaping out of bed and landing on furniture or against the wall.
   One night, he was awakened by his wife’s yelling because he was choking her;
   he was dreaming that he was wrestling a deer to the ground and was trying to
   break its neck (Schenck, Milner, Hurwitz, Bundlie, & Mahowald, 1989). REM
   sleep behavior disorder is often associated with a neurological disorder, such as
   Parkinson’s disease or a brain stem tumor (E. J. Olson et al., 2000). Lewy bodies
   have been found in patients’ brains, and two thirds of patients develop
   Parkinson’s about 10 years later (Boeve et al., 2003). These findings have
   contributed to the hypothesis that Parkinson’s disease is preceded by the
   development of Lewy bodies in the medulla, where inhibition of the
   magnocellular nucleus ordinarily produces atonia; the Lewy bodies then
   progress upward through the brain before reaching the substantia nigra years
   later, when the full-blown disease appears (Braak et al., 2003).

   Sleep as a Form of Consciousness
   At the beginning of this discussion, we said that sleep is neither entirely
   conscious nor unconscious. Francis Crick (1994), who shared a Nobel Prize for
   the discovery of DNA’s structure in 1962 before turning to neuroscience and the
   study of consciousness, believed that we are in a state of diminished
   consciousness during REM sleep and that we are unconscious during non-REM
   sleep. Certainly there are some elements of consciousness in the dream state,
   particularly in people who are lucid dreamers. You have probably had the
   occasional experience of realizing during a bad dream that it is not actually real
   and will end soon. That kind of experience is common for lucid dreamers—they
   are often aware during a dream that they are dreaming. People can be trained to
   become aware of their dreaming and to signal to the researcher when they are
   dreaming by pressing a handheld switch (Salamy, 1970). They can even learn to
   control the content of their dreams; they may decide before sleeping what they
   will dream about, or they may interact with characters in their dream
   (Gackenbach & Bosveld, 1989). This ability tells us that the sleeping person is
   not necessarily as detached from reality as we have thought. This point is further
   illustrated by sleepwalkers, who have driven cars; wandered the streets;
   brandished weapons (Schenck et al., 1989); and strangled, stabbed, and beaten
   people to death, all presumably during non-REM sleep.
   When you are asleep, are you unconscious?
   So it is not clear where or whether the transition from consciousness to
   nonconsciousness occurs during sleep. The idea of a dividing line is blurred even
   further by reports that surgical patients can sometimes remember the surgical
   staff’s conversations while they were anesthetized, and they show some memory
   later for verbal material presented at the time of surgery (Andrade, 1995;
   Bonebakker et al., 1996). Whether you draw the line of consciousness between
   waking and sleeping or between REM and non-REM sleep or between sleep and
   coma depends more on your definition of consciousness than on any clear-cut
   distinctions between these conditions. Perhaps it is better to think of sleep as a
   different state of consciousness along a continuum of consciousness. We can
   then concentrate on what the differences between waking and sleeping tell us
   about consciousness rather than worrying about classifications.
   The world shall perish not for lack of wonders, but for lack of wonder.

   The Neural Bases of Consciousness
   Although strict behaviorists had banned consciousness as neither observable nor
   necessary for explaining behavior, over the last half of the 20th century
   researchers began to find that various components of consciousness were
   necessary as they studied memory, attention, mental imagery, and emotion. Still,
   they carefully avoided using the word consciousness as they talked about
   awareness, attention, or cognition. Then, a few respected theorists began musing
   about consciousness in print and even suggesting that it was an appropriate
   subject for neuroscientists to study. Other scientists slowly began to come out of
   their closets, while their more cautious colleagues warned them not to allow
   consciousness to become a back door for the reentry of the mind or for the
   proverbial homunculus, the “little man” inside the head who pulls all the levers.
   In the words of one team of writers, “consciousness is not some entity deep
   inside the brain that corresponds to the ‘self,’ some kernel of awareness that runs
   the show” (Nash, Park, & Willwerth, 1995).
   The explanation of consciousness is essential for explaining most of the features of our
   mental life because in one way or another they involve consciousness.
   —John R. Searle
   So just what do we mean by consciousness? Actually, the term has a variety of
   connotations. We use it to refer to a state—a person is conscious or unconscious,
   and we use it in the sense of conscious experience, or awareness of something.
   Consciousness has additional meanings for researchers, though few try to define
   the term; Francis Crick (1994) suggested that any attempt at definition at this
   point in our knowledge would be misleading and would unduly restrict thinking
   about the subject. While agreeing on a definition is impractical, most researchers
   would likely be comfortable with the following assertions about consciousness.
   The person is aware, at least to some extent; as a part of awareness, the person
   holds some things in attention, while others recede into the background.
   Consciousness also involves memory, at least of the short-term variety, and fully
   conscious humans have a sense of self, which requires long-term memory.
   Consciousness varies in level, with coma and deep anesthesia on one extreme,
   alert wakefulness on the other, and sleep in between. There are also altered states
   of consciousness, including hypnosis, trances, and meditative states. Over the
   next several pages we will see how theorists have attempted to explain the neural
   bases of consciousness.
   Network Explanations of Consciousness
   One way researchers have sought the neural origins of consciousness is by
   identifying the structures where damage or stimulation can produce
   unconsciousness. We have long known that lesions to the thalamus can result in
   loss of consciousness; the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus are especially
   important, most likely because they are responsible for the ability of the
   thalamus and cortical areas to work as a system (Tononi, 2005). A more recently
   identified area is a very small region of the brain stem called the rostral
   dorsolateral pontine tegmentum. Among 12 veterans whose wartime head
   injuries had rendered them unconscious, 10 had lesions there, whereas only one
   of 24 controls did (D. B. Fischer et al., 2016).
   One is always a long way from solving a problem until one actually has the answer.
   —Stephen Hawking
   Consciousness does not reside in these structures, of course; they exert their
   influence through their connections with higher levels of the brain; the most
   important are with the anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insular cortex
   (Figure 15.15). These structures have numerous functions related to awareness
   and arousal, from attention and response selection to pain and emotional
   behavior (Medford & Critchley, 2010). For example, they are less active in
   response to emotional stimuli in individuals with depersonalization disorder,
   which is characterized by a sense of unreality in experience of self and
   surroundings. More important for our purposes, they are core components in the
   salience network, which detects significant stimuli that require attention.
   The salience network switches back and forth between the default mode
   network, which you will remember is active when the brain is at wakeful rest,
   and the central executive network, which is goal and task oriented and
   externally directed (Figure 15.16; Uddin, 2015).
   According to most theorists, consciousness occurs when functioning becomes
   coordinated between widespread networks, enabling them to share and integrate
   information (Baars, 2005; Dehaene & Naccache, 2001; Tononi, 2005). For
   example, when stimuli reach awareness they produce widespread activity in the
   prefrontal and parietal cortex (Figure 15.17; reviewed in Baars, 2005; see
   Dehaene et al., 2001; Sergent, Baillet, & Dehaene, 2005). By contrast, during
   deep sleep, coma, vegetative states, epileptic loss of consciousness, and general
   anesthesia, coordinated activity among brain areas disappears and auditory and
   pain stimuli fail to evoke activity beyond the primary areas. Many theorists
   believe that gamma frequency oscillations (30-90 Hz) between the thalamus and
   the cortex not only are the most likely means of achieving this coordination but
   also are necessary for consciousness (Ribary, 2005). This is difficult to
   demonstrate, but human imaging shows that during anesthesia-induced loss of
   consciousness, functional connectivity is disrupted between the thalamus and the
   cortex, and activity decreases in the frontal-parietal network and in the default
   mode network (Akeju et al., 2014). In addition, 40-Hz or 100-Hz stimulation of
   the central thalamus in mice arouses them from sleep and produces widespread
   activation of the forebrain, whereas stimulation at 10 Hz reduces forebrain
   activity, inhibits sensory cortex, and produces behavioral arrest (J. Liu et al.,
   2015). These results are consistent with Giulio Tononi’s hypothesis that
   consciousness depends on the brain’s ability to integrate information, an ability
   that is impaired by diminishing connectivity (Tononi, 2008). According to the
   accompanying In the News feature, LSD owes its ability to alter consciousness
   in part to changes it produces in network functioning.

   Distribution of consciousness suggests that there is no center of consciousness,
   but some researchers believe that there must be an executive, an area that
   coordinates or orchestrates the activity of all the other structures. Researchers
   have proposed a variety of locations for this executive, including the thalamus
   (Crick, 1994), the anterior cingulate cortex (Posner & Rothbart, 1998), and the
   claustrum (see Figure 15.15 again; Crick & Koch, 2005). Both lesions and
   stimulation of the claustrum have been associated with loss of consciousness
   (Chau, Salazar, Krueger, Cristofori, & Grafman, 2015; Koubeissi, Bartolomei,
   Beltagy, & Picard, 2014). But what intrigues some consciousness researchers is
   that the claustrum has reciprocal connections with all the primary sensory and
   motor areas as well as the limbic system, and imaging showed it had the highest
   density of connections with all areas examined (Torgerson, Irimia, Goh, & Van
   Horn, 2015). Crick and Koch hypothesized that the claustrum binds information
   from multiple brain regions; Smythies, Edelstein, and Ramachandran (2012,
   2014) have taken this a step further by hypothesizing that the claustrum does this
   by detecting neural synchrony between areas, and then it responds by sending
   out signals to initiate action. Whether this hypothesis is correct or not, support
   for a broad executive role for any structure remains weak. Just as consciousness
   appears to be distributed, its controls might be as well. And considering the
   complexity of consciousness that you see in Figure 15.18, those controls are
   likely to be numerous. These issues are not purely academic. As the
   accompanying Application shows, a better understanding of consciousness is a
   practical necessity. Following that, we will tackle the three components of
   consciousness we mentioned earlier.

   Awareness
   As an abstract concept, awareness is difficult to define and more difficult to
   study. Researchers have typically adopted the shorthand definition that
   awareness is equivalent to the content of consciousness (Chau et al., 2015) and
   focused their attention on awareness of something. Taking this approach has
   helped identify brain areas as potential locations of awareness. One strategy is to
   monitor the brain’s activity in a scanner while flashing a series of words on a
   screen so briefly that they are at the threshold of detectability. If a person doesn’t
   consciously notice the word, only the visual cortex is activated; as soon as the
   person becomes aware of the word, the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior
   parietal cortex become active. These two areas and the thalamus have more
   interconnections with each other and the rest of the brain than any other region.
   These and other observations have led Daniel Bor and Ankil Seth to propose that
   the prefrontal-parietal network is important to awareness and to consciousness
   in general (Bor, 2013; Bor & Seth, 2012).
   What happens when part of this network is damaged? There are many
   possibilities, but the case of a man who often attributed one object’s color or
   direction of movement to another object after both parietal lobes were damaged
   is particularly instructive (L. J. Bernstein & Robertson, 1998). What this tells us
   is that brain damage impaired his ability to bind the spatial, color, and movement
   information together into an integrated percept. Increasingly, researchers are
   becoming convinced that binding involves synchronization of neural activity.
   Synchronized activity occurs mostly in the gamma frequency range. Early
   studies found that during visual stimulation, 50%–70% of neurons in the visual
   area of cats fired in synchrony at an average rate of 40 Hz (Engel, König,
   Kreiter, & Singer, 1991; Engel, Kreiter, König, & Singer, 1991). For an
   illustration of 40-Hz synchrony, see Figure 15.19. In response to a moving
   stimulus, activity synchronized between V1, the primary visual area, and V5, the
   area that detects movement (Engel, Kreiter, et al., 1991). This makes sense,
   because studies have indicated that visual awareness requires feedback to V1
   from extrastriate areas like V5 (reviewed in Tong, 2003). (You may want to refer
   to Figure 10.29 for the location of V1 and V5.)
   How does the brain solve the “binding problem”?

   Sciences, 9, pp. 556–559.
   Later investigations revealed that activity is coordinated over much wider areas.
   For example, when researchers presented a light that had previously been paired
   with shock to the finger, activity became synchronized between the visual cortex
   and the finger area of the somatosensory cortex (Figure 15.20; Miltner, Braun,
   Arnold, Witte, & Taub, 1999). In a learning study, at the moment each subject
   became aware that one tone was associated with a visual stimulus and another
   was not, neural activity in the left prefrontal cortex became coordinated with
   activity in other parts of the brain, including the right prefrontal cortex, auditory
   association areas, visual cortex, and cerebellum (McIntosh, Rajah, & Lobaugh,
   1999). Another study better illustrates the integrative nature of this synchrony.
   Words were presented in various colors and at various locations on a screen;
   whether the subject became aware of the word’s color or of its location—
   indicated by being able to recall it later—depended on whether a frontal or
   temporal area was activated during the presentation. But if the individual
   registered both the color and the location, additional activity occurred in a part of
   the parietal cortex (Uncapher, Otten, & Rugg, 2006).

   Gaillard and his colleagues (2009) had the opportunity to record EEG activity
   from electrodes implanted in the brains of patients being evaluated for surgery to
   eliminate epileptic seizures; they recorded a cascade of awareness-defining
   events. Whether words reached awareness or not, they evoked coordinated
   gamma activity in the occipital area lasting about 300 milliseconds; if the words
   were recognized, this localized activity was followed by synchronized activity
   among occipital, parietal, and temporal areas. In addition, neurons in one area
   appeared to be triggering firing among neurons in the other areas.

   It is important to emphasize that much of our behavior is guided by processes
   that are outside awareness. A simple example would be our constant use of
   proprioceptive information to sit erect, to walk, and to reach accurately for
   objects in our environment. You learned in previous chapters that people with
   impaired facial recognition (prosopagnosics) are aroused by familiar faces that
   they do not otherwise recognize, that people with blindsight locate objects they
   deny seeing, and that patients with hippocampal damage improve over time on
   tasks that they deny having performed before. A more esoteric example is that by
   relying on nonvisual photoreceptors among the ganglion cells, blind people can
   tell whether a light is on or off better than chance, though they report that they
   don’t see it (Vandewalle et al., 2013). In one study, research participants were
   able to learn and use a pattern for predicting the location of a target on a
   computer screen, but not one of them was able to state what the pattern was—
   even when offered a reward of $100 for doing so. Through subtle training
   procedures, people have learned to associate a particular facial feature with a
   particular personality characteristic without being aware they had done so; in
   fact, when questioned, they did not believe that such a relationship existed
   (reviewed in Lewicki, Hill, & Czyzewska, 1992). We like to believe that our
   behavior is rational and guided by conscious decisions; perhaps we invent
   logical-sounding explanations for our behavior when we are not aware of its true
   origins. So what is the benefit of conscious awareness? This is actually a matter
   of debate, but one apparent advantage is that it enables a consistency and a
   planfulness in our behavior that would not be possible otherwise.
   Attention
   Separating attention and awareness is difficult, and it is even controversial
   whether we can do so. However, it is instructive to think of awareness as
   referring to the content of consciousness and attention as a process—the act of
   attending, or the act of selecting among the contenders for our awareness.
   Attention is the brain’s means of allocating its limited resources by focusing
   on some neural inputs to the exclusion of others. It’s hardly necessary to tell
   you how important attention is. When you are paying attention to a fascinating
   book, you may not notice all the hubbub around you. Some stimuli “grab” your
   attention, though; for example, the voice of a friend calling your name stands out
   above all the din. Also, what is attended to is easily remembered, and what
   escapes attention may be lost forever. The practical importance of attention is
   demonstrated in studies showing a fourfold increase in automobile accidents
   while drivers are using a cell phone (McEvoy et al., 2005; Redelmeier &
   Tibshirani, 1997). This is not due to the driver having one hand off the wheel,
   because the risk was just as high when the driver was using a speaker phone;
   clearly, the problem was attention.
   Application: Determining Consciousness When It Counts

   A disturbing aspect of brain damage is that it often deprives patients of the ability to
   communicate with family and caregivers. The worst are in a coma and completely unresponsive
   to stimulation. Those who are in a vegetative state respond reflexively to stimulation and cycle
   through wakefulness and sleep, but they do not interact voluntarily with their environment. The
   minimally conscious occasionally show voluntary responses, such as following visual movement
   or crying when they hear a family member’s voice, but they don’t reliably communicate. In
   contrast, patients with locked-in syndrome are fully conscious; however, they are paralyzed and
   are able to communicate only with eye movements or finger twitches, if at all.
   Physicians often rely on clinical observation for diagnosis rather than neurobehavioral testing.
   Thus, an estimated 40% of patients classified as being in a vegetative state are actually
   minimally conscious (Schnakers et al., 2009). Brain scans do a much better job (see figure), but
   they are expensive and not always available. J.-R. King and his associates (2013) developed a
   device that uses EEG to distinguish whether a series of beeps activates the auditory area or a
   larger network, signaling some level of consciousness. In a preliminary test, the device
   distinguished among patients who were in a vegetative state, in a minimally conscious state, or
   conscious. Determining level of consciousness is critical not only for care decisions but also for
   developing ways of communicating with patients and restoring function.
   When patients were asked to imagine two different activities during an fMRI, five out of six
   patients classified as being in a vegetative state produced distinctive activity in different regions
   of the brain (Monti et al., 2010). One of the patients, considered in a vegetative state for five
   years, was able to answer questions correctly by thinking about one of the activities for “yes”
   and the other for “no.” Adapting the task to EEG will allow locked-in patients to communicate
   in complex sentences by focusing on letters one at a time on a keyboard display (Sellers, Ryan,
   & Hauser, 2014).
   Detecting consciousness might also identify patients who could benefit from therapies as they
   develop. Both dopamine (Fridman et al., 2010) and GABA (Chatelle et al., 2014) agonists have
   improved consciousness and communication in minimally conscious patients. When Schiff and
   his colleagues (2007) electrically stimulated the thalamus of a man who had been unreliably
   responsive for six years following brain injury, he ate without tube feeding, watched movies,
   and communicated with gestures and phrases. After noninvasive ultrasound stimulation of the
   thalamus, another patient became fully conscious and was communicating with nods and
   headshakes and offering a fist-bump to one of his doctors (Monti, Schnakers, & Korb, 2016).
   Although you are aware of the importance of attention, you probably do not
   realize just how powerful it is. An interesting demonstration is the Cheshire cat
   effect, named after the cat in Alice in Wonderland, who would fade from sight
   until only his smile remained. Have a friend stand in front of you while you hold
   a mirror in your left hand so that it blocks your right eye’s view of your friend’s
   face but not the left eye’s (Figure 15.21). Then hold your right hand so that you
   can see it in the mirror. (This works best if you and your friend stand in the
   corner of a room with blank walls on two sides.) Your hand and your friend’s
   face will appear to be in the same position, but your friend’s face, or part of it,
   will disappear. If you hold your hand steady, you will begin to see your friend’s
   face again, perhaps through your “transparent” hand; move your hand slightly,
   and the face disappears again. By experimenting, you should be able to leave
   your friend with only a Cheshire cat smile. Your brain continues to receive
   information from both your hand and your friend’s face throughout the
   demonstration; but because the two eyes are sending the brain conflicting
   information, telling it that two objects are in the same location, binocular rivalry
   occurs. The brain attends to one stimulus for a time and then switches to the
   other. Attention also switches when your hand or your friend’s head moves and
   demands attention.
   Figure 15.21 Setup for Demonstrating the Cheshire Cat Effect.
   Attention is not just a concept; it is a physiological process, and changes in
   attention are accompanied by changes in neural activity. When an observer
   attends to an object, firing synchronizes between the brain areas involved, such
   as prefrontal with parietal neurons or parietal neurons with visual areas,
   depending on the task (Buschman & Miller, 2007; Saalmann, Pigarev, &
   Vidyasagar, 2007). When attention shifts, for example, during binocular rivalry,
   activity shifts from one group of neurons in the visual cortex to another, even
   though the stimulus inputs do not change (Leopold & Logothetis, 1996). When
   research participants focused on an object’s color, PET scans showed that
   activity increased in visual area V4; activation shifted to the inferior temporal
   cortex when they attended to the object’s shape, and it changed to area V5
   during attention to its movement (Chawla, Rees, & Friston, 1999; Corbetta,
   Miezin, Dobmeyer, Shulman, & Petersen, 1990). We know that the shifts were
   due to attention, because activation also increased in V4 during attention to color
   even when the stimuli were uncolored and in V5 during attention to movement
   when the stimuli were stationary (Chawla et al., 1999).
   What is the neural basis of attention?
   So our experience of attention is a reflection of changes in brain activity. The
   increases in cortical activity described here are at least partly due to the
   modulation of activity in the thalamus, which is the gateway for sensory
   information to the cortex (except for olfaction). The cortex can selectively
   inhibit thalamic neurons and determine which information will reach it (John,
   2005). When human subjects attended to a stimulus, neural responses to that
   stimulus increased in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, and
   responses to ignored stimuli decreased (O’Connor, Fukui, Pinsk, & Kastner,
   2002). (Remember that you saw similar results in Chapter 9.)
   Neural scientists are thus beginning to address aspects of the fundamental question of
   consciousness by focusing on a specific, testable problem: What neural mechanisms are
   responsible for focusing visual attention?
   —Eric R. Kandel
   Attention involves a number of structures, and imaging suggests that they are
   organized into two networks: a dorsal one that allocates attention under goal-
   directed control and a ventral one that responds to stimulus demands (Asplund,
   Todd, Snyder, & Marois, 2010). However, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
   may play an executive role (Figure 15.15). In individuals undergoing cingulate
   lesioning as a treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder, 19% of ACC
   neurons either increased or decreased their firing rate during attention-
   demanding cognitive tests (K. D. Davis, Hutchison, Lozano, Tasker, &
   Dostrovsky, 2000). (You have to admire the brave souls who were willing to
   submit to mental arithmetic during brain surgery!) The ACC is also active during
   the Stroop word-color test, in which subjects must read color names as quickly
   as possible (Peterson et al., 1999). This is a difficult task, because some of the
   words are printed in a conflicting color; the researchers believe that the ACC
   modulates activity in attentional pathways to focus attention on the word’s
   meaning and suppress attention to its color.
   The Sense of Self
   Consciousness is usually studied in relation to external reality—for example,
   object recognition or object awareness; this is in keeping with psychology’s
   preference during much of its history for studying phenomena that are “out
   there,” where we can observe them objectively. But an important aspect of
   consciousness is what we call the self; the sense of self includes an identity—
   what we refer to as “I”—and the sense of agency, the attribution of an action
   or effect to ourselves rather than to another person or external force.
   Where does our sense of self come from?
   The sense of self is shared with few other species. We have learned this by using
   a cleverly simple technique developed for children. When the researcher puts a
   spot of rouge on a child’s nose or forehead and places the child in front of a
   mirror, infants younger than about 15 months reach out and touch the child in the
   mirror or kiss it or hit it; older children will show self-recognition and use the
   mirror to examine the mysterious spot on their faces (M. Lewis & Brooks-Gunn,
   1979). Chimpanzees are also able, after a time, to recognize themselves in the
   mirror; they examine the rouge spot, and they use the mirror to investigate parts
   of their body they have never seen before, like their teeth and their behinds
   (Figure 15.22). Elephants, orangutans, porpoises, and—get this—magpies also
   recognize themselves, but monkeys do not (Gallup, 1983; Plotnik, de Waal, &
   Reiss, 2006; Prior, Schwarz, & Güntürkün, 2008; Reiss & Marino, 2001).
   Although monkeys learned how a mirror works and would turn to face a person
   whose reflection they saw in the mirror, after 17 years of continuous exposure to
   a mirror in their cage, they still treated their reflections like an intruder (Gallup
   & Povinelli, 1998). Stroke or the dementia of old age can impair mirror self-
   recognition in humans; the person may treat the mirror image as a companion, as
   an intruder who must be driven from the home, or as a stalker who appears in
   automobile and shop windows (T. E. Feinberg, 2001).
   Consciousness is a concept of your own self, something that you reconstruct moment by
   moment on the basis of your own body, your own autobiography and a sense of your
   intended future.
   —Antonio Damasio
   . .the self should not be considered as an essence, but as a set of processes. . .
   —Tony Prescott, director of Sheffield Robotics
   Investigators have had some success in identifying neural correlates of the sense
   of self. Frontal-temporal damage, for example, impairs episodic memory and
   may produce a detachment from the self (M. A. Wheeler, Stuss, & Tulving,
   1997). The anterior cingulate cortex and the insula (see Figure 15.15) are active
   when people recognize their own faces, identify memories as their own, or
   recognize descriptions of themselves (Devue et al., 2007; Farrer et al., 2003; G.
   R. Fink et al., 1998). Studies have also revealed that the medial parietal cortex
   and posterior cingulate cortex are responsible for self-related memory, whereas
   the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex function together in
   self-evaluation (Lou, Changeux, & Rosenstand, 2016). For example, applying
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the parietal area reduced subjects’
   advantage in remembering words they had used to describe themselves
   compared to the words they had used to describe their best friend; TMS over the
   medial prefrontal cortex had no effect (Lou, Luber, Stanford, & Lisanby, 2010).
   By contrast, TMS over the medial prefrontal cortex (but not parietal cortex)
   reduced and even reversed subjects’ tendency to describe themselves more
   positively than their best friend (Luber, Lou, Keenan, & Lisanby, 2012).
   Farrer and Frith and their colleagues suggest that the sense of agency is mediated
   by the anterior insula and the inferior parietal area (Farrer et al., 2003; Farrer &
   Frith, 2002). When the subjects believed that they were controlling movements
   of a virtual hand or a cursor on a computer screen, activity increased in both the
   left and right insulas; when it became obvious that the experimenter was
   controlling the movement, activity shifted to the angular gyrus (in the inferior
   parietal cortex), particularly on the right (Figure 15.23). In other research,
   activity increased in the inferior parietal cortex as the discrepancy increased
   between the person’s movements and feedback from the movements; Farrer and
   her colleagues (2008) interpret this as evidence that the angular gyrus
   contributes to the sense of agency by detecting discrepancies between actions
   and consequences. Later work found that sense of agency occurred during a task
   when the inferior parietal cortex initiated gamma-frequency communication with
   frontal cortical areas (Ritterband-Rosenbaum, Nielsen, & Christensen, 2014).
   People with schizophrenia who believe their behavior is controlled by another
   person or agent show heightened parietal activity compared with other
   schizophrenia patients and controls (Spence et al., 1997).

   We do not find in these studies, nor should we expect to find, a brain location for
   the self; instead, what we see is scattered bits and pieces. We should regard the
   self as a concept, not an entity, and the sense of self as an amalgamation of
   several kinds of information, mediated by networks made up of many brain
   areas. Body image, memory, and the activity of mirror neurons are among the
   contributors to the sense of self; we will examine these topics and then consider
   two disorders of the self.

   Body Image
   Body image contributes to a sense of self because we have an identification with
   our body and with its parts; it is our body, our hand, our leg. A good example of
   the importance of body image to the sense of self is the phantom limb
   phenomenon. You learned in Chapter 11 that most amputees have the illusion
   that their missing arm or leg is still there (Figure 15.24). The illusion occurs in
   80% of amputees and may persist for the rest of the person’s life, which attests to
   the power of the body image. Distortions in the phantom sometimes add
   credibility to this point: One man was unable to sleep on his back because his
   phantom arm was bent behind him, and another had to turn sideways when
   walking through a door because his arm was extended to the side (Melzack,
   1992). Researchers once thought that phantoms occurred only after a person
   developed a learned body image, but we now know that phantoms can occur in
   young children and even in people born with a missing limb. Because the body
   image is part of the equipment we are born with, it becomes an important part of
   the self—even when it conflicts with reality.

   Publishers, Inc.
   The “replacement” of a limb by a phantom does not prevent a feeling of loss,
   which can extend to the sense of self. This point was illustrated very graphically
   by S. Weir Mitchell, a Civil War physician who saw numerous amputees and
   presented some of his observations in the fictionalized account The Case of
   George Dedlow (S. W. Mitchell, 1866). Mitchell’s hero, who has lost both arms
   and both legs in battle, says,
   I found to my horror that at times I was less conscious of myself, of my
   own existence, than used to be the case. . . . I felt like asking someone
   constantly if I were really George Dedlow or not. (p. 8)
   In Chapter 11 we saw an example of a more extensive loss in the case of
   Christina. Watching a home movie of herself made before the disease had
   destroyed her proprioceptive sense, she exclaimed,
   Yes, of course, that’s me! But I can’t identify with that graceful girl any
   more! She’s gone, I can’t remember her, I can’t even imagine her. It’s like
   something’s been scooped right out of me, right at the centre. (Sacks, 1990,
   p. 51)
   Although information about the body is processed in the somatosensory cortex,
   body image is a phenomenon that develops primarily in adjacent parietal areas.
   An example comes from earlier attempts to eliminate phantoms by surgery;
   lesions in the somatosensory area had no effect, but lesioning the right posterior
   parietal cortex did suppress the sensations (Berlucchi & Aglioti, 1997). One of
   the functions of the insula is the integration of internal with external information;
   damage to the posterior part of the insula, which is located in the inferior parietal
   cortex, can produce a variety of symptoms, including denial that a paralyzed
   limb belongs to the patient or perception of an extra limb (Berlucchi & Aglioti;
   Karnath & Baier, 2010). In Chapter 11, we saw that damage to the inferior
   parietal area can also cause the most extreme of body image illusions, the out-of-
   body experience (Blanke & Arzy, 2005).
   Memory
   Without long-term memory, it is doubtful there can be a self, because there is no
   past and no sense of who the person is. In the words of the memory researcher
   James McGaugh, memory “is what makes us us” (A. Wilson, 1998). Loss of
   short-term memory is not as disruptive; patients like HM (described in Chapter
   12) have a lifetime of information about their past and about themselves as a
   background for interpreting current experience, even if they do not remember
   events that have occurred since their brain damage. However, for Alzheimer’s
   and Korsakoff patients, memory loss extends back several years before the onset
   of illness, as well as after the onset. Oliver Sacks’s patient Jimmie had lost 40
   years of memories to Korsakoff syndrome; restless, unable to say whether he
   was miserable or happy, he reported that he had not felt alive for a very long
   time (Sacks, 1990).
   Mary Frances, whom you met in Chapter 12, took another approach, explaining
   her situation with one false scenario after another. Another confabulator was Mr.
   Thompson, who took an unauthorized day’s liberty from the hospital. At the end
   of the day, the cabdriver told the staff that he had never had so fascinating a
   passenger: “He seemed to have been everywhere, done everything, met
   everyone. I could hardly believe so much was possible in a single life” (Sacks,
   1990, p. 110). According to Sacks, Mr. Thompson had to “make himself (and his
   world) up every moment” by turning everyone on the ward into characters in his
   make-believe world and weaving story after story as he attempted to create both
   a past and a present for himself.
   The confabulated stories amnesiacs tell can usually be traced back to fragments
   of actual experiences. This is consistent with the hypothesis introduced in our
   earlier discussion, that confabulation is a failure to suppress irrelevant memories
   due to damage in the frontal area (Benson et al., 1996; Schnider, 2003; Schnider
   & Ptak, 1999). But, like Mr. Thompson, confabulators often prefer an
   embellished past to an ordinary one (Fotopoulou, Solms, & Turnbull, 2004); this
   together with the involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex (Turner et al.,
   2008) makes one suspect that the confabulation is also serving the self-image.
   The motivated nature of confabulation suggests the importance of real or
   imagined memories to the person’s identity. As the movie director Luis Buñuel
   (1983) said as he contemplated his own failing memory,
   You have to begin to lose your memory, if only in bits and pieces, to realize
   that memory is what makes our lives. Life without memory is no life at all. .
   . . Our memory is our coherence, our reason, our feeling, even our action.
   Without it, we are nothing.
   Self, Theory of Mind, and Mirror Neurons
   A sense of self requires the distinction between our self and other selves and,
   arguably, some understanding of other selves. We saw in the discussion of
   autism that an ability to attribute mental states to others is called theory of mind
   and that researchers who study mirror neurons believe they are critical to our
   development of that comprehension (see Chapter 13). They give mirror neurons
   considerable credit for social understanding (Gallese & Goldman, 1998),
   empathy (Gazzola et al., 2006), and the ability to understand the intentions of
   others (Iacoboni et al., 2005). When volunteers watched a video clip, their mirror
   neurons responded more as a model reached for a full cup beside a plate of
   snacks (implying the intent to eat) than when the model reached for an empty
   cup beside an empty plate (implying the intent to clean up). The two scenes
   without the model produced no differences (Figure 15.25; Iacoboni et al., 2005).
   Malfunction in the mirror neuron system is one reason suggested for the autistic
   individual’s failure to develop a distinction between self and others, along with
   empathy and theory of mind (Cascio, Foss-Feig, Burnette, Heacock, & Cosby,
   2012; J. H. G. Williams, 2008). Children with autism spectrum disorder took
   twice as long as control subjects to develop the rubber hand illusion, and the
   delay was correlated negatively with an empathy measure (Cascio et al., 2012).
   Justin Williams and his associates suggest that the problem is not in the mirror
   neurons themselves but in the regulation of their function by the anterior
   cingulate cortex (J. H. G. Williams, Whiten, Suddendorf, & Perrtt, 2001).

   Split Brains and Dissociative Identity Disorder:
   Disorders of Self
   Chapter 3 describes a surgical procedure that separates the two cerebral
   hemispheres by cutting the corpus callosum. This surgery is used to prevent
   severe epileptic seizures from crossing the midline and engulfing the other side
   of the brain. Besides providing a unique opportunity to study the differing roles
   of the two hemispheres, split-brain patients also raise important questions about
   consciousness and the self. Gazzaniga (1970) described a patient who would
   sometimes find his hands behaving in direct conflict with each other—for
   instance, one pulling up his pants while the other tried to remove them. Once the
   man shook his wife violently with his left hand (controlled by the more
   emotional right hemisphere), while his right hand tried to restrain the left. If the
   person with a severed corpus callosum is asked to use the right hand to form a
   specified design with colored blocks, performance is poor because the left
   hemisphere is not very good at spatial tasks; sometimes the left hand, controlled
   by the more spatially capable right hemisphere, joins in to set the misplaced
   blocks aright and has to be restrained by the experimenter.
   What do the disorders tell us?
   Different researchers interpret these studies in different ways. At one extreme are
   those who believe that the major or language-dominant hemisphere is the arbiter
   of consciousness and that the minor hemisphere functions as an automaton, a
   nonconscious machine. At the other extreme are the researchers who believe that
   each hemisphere is capable of consciousness and that severing the corpus
   callosum divides consciousness into two selves. Sixty years of research have
   prompted most theorists to take positions somewhere along the continuum
   between those extremes.
   Gazzaniga, for instance, points to the right hemisphere’s differing abilities, such
   as the inability to form inferences, as evidence that the right hemisphere has only
   primitive consciousness (Gazzaniga, Ivry, & Mangun, 1998). He says the left
   hemisphere not only has language and inferential capability but also contains a
   module that he calls the “brain interpreter.” The role of the brain interpreter is
   to integrate all the cognitive processes going on simultaneously in other
   modules of the brain. Gazzaniga was led to this notion by observing the split-
   brain patient PS performing one of the research tasks. PS was presented a snow
   scene in the left visual field and a picture of a chicken’s foot in the right and
   asked to point to a picture that was related to what he had just seen. With the
   right hand he pointed to the picture of a chicken, and with the left he selected a
   picture of a shovel (Figure 15.26). When asked to explain his choices, he (his
   left hemisphere) said that the chicken went with the foot and the shovel was
   needed to clean out the chicken shed. Unaware that the right hemisphere had
   viewed a snow scene, the left hemisphere gave a reasonable but inaccurate
   explanation for the left hand’s choice. Although the right hemisphere has less
   verbal capability than the left, it can respond to simple commands; if the
   command “Walk” is presented to the right hemisphere, the person will get up
   and start to walk away. When asked where he or she is going, the patient will say
   something like “I’m going to get a Coke.” According to Gazzaniga, these
   confabulations are examples of the brain interpreter making sense of its inputs,
   even though it lacks complete information.

   Perhaps researchers who view the right hemisphere’s consciousness as primitive
   are confusing consciousness with the ability to verbalize the contents of
   consciousness. Assigning different levels of consciousness to the two
   hemispheres may be premature when our understanding of consciousness is
   itself so primitive. Research with split-brain patients tells us to avoid
   oversimplifying such a complex issue.
   Another disorder of self is dissociative identity disorder (DID; formerly known
   as multiple personality), which involves shifts in consciousness and behavior
   that appear to be distinct personalities or selves. You may be familiar with
   this disorder from the movie The Three Faces of Eve. Shy and reserved, Eve
   White would have blackouts while her alter ego, Eve Black, spent the night on
   the town dancing and drinking with strange men. The puritanical Eve White
   would have to deal with the hangover, explain a closetful of expensive clothes
   she didn’t remember buying, and sometimes fend off an amorous stranger she
   found herself with in a bar (Lancaster, 1958; Thigpen & Cleckley, 1957). Eve,
   whose real name was Chris Sizemore, went on to develop 22 different
   personalities before she successfully integrated them into a single self (Figure
   15.27; Sizemore, 1989). The causes of DID are not understood, but 90%–95% of
   patients report childhood physical and/or sexual abuse (Lowenstein & Putnam,
   1990; C. A. Ross et al., 1990). Most therapists believe that the individual creates
   alternate personalities (“alters”) as a defense against persistent emotional stress;
   the alters provide escape and, often, the opportunity to engage in prohibited
   forms of behavior (Fike, 1990; C. A. Ross et al., 1990).
   Although DID is listed as a diagnostic category in the Diagnostic and Statistical
   Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric
   Association, 2013), a dramatic spike in cases has aroused suspicions not only
   about overdiagnosis but about the legitimacy of the disorder. DID had been
   reported occasionally since the middle 1600s (E. L. Bliss, 1980), but the number
   of cases jumped from 500 in 1979 to 5,000 in 1985 (Braun, 1985); the DSM-5
   estimates the prevalence at 1.5% of American adults. Although some therapists
   believe that DID was underdiagnosed earlier (Putnam, 1991), critics say that the
   patients intentionally create the alternate personalities to provide an explanation
   for bizarre and troubling behavior, as a defense for criminal behavior, or at the
   urging of an overzealous therapist (Spanos, 1994). The case of Sybil (made
   famous by a book and a TV movie) is alleged to have been an elaborate hoax.
   According to writer Debbie Nathan (2011), it was motivated by Sybil’s need for
   more attention from her therapist and her therapist’s pursuit of professional
   recognition and a lucrative book deal. The possibility of numerous bogus cases
   justifies a certain amount of caution in interpreting the research in this area; at
   the same time there are a few research studies that indicate some intriguing
   physiological manifestations among individuals who report multiple
   personalities.

   Consistent with a history of maltreatment and trauma during the childhood of
   people with DID, one study found a 19% reduction in the size of the
   hippocampus and a 32% reduction in the amygdala (Vermetten, Schmahl,
   Lindner, Loewenstein, & Bremner, 2006). From this perspective, it seems more
   appropriate to think of the alters not as personalities but as different ways of
   coping with a traumatic development. Physiological measures support this
   interpretation; alters respond differently in skin conductance, EEG, visual event-
   related potentials, and cardiovascular measures (Reinders et al., 2006). Brain
   scans show reduced activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, along with increases in
   the other frontal areas (Sar, Unal, & Ozturk, 2007) and differences in activation
   between alters while listening to personally relevant traumatic material (Reinders
   et al.).

   Guochuan Tsai and his colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   to study a 33-year-old DID patient as she switched between her primary and an
   alter personality (Tsai, Condie, Wu, & Chang, 1999). During the switch from the
   primary to the alter, activity was inhibited in the hippocampus and
   parahippocampal area, particularly on the right side; during the switch back, the
   right hippocampus increased in activity (Figure 15.28). The hippocampal
   activity led the researchers to suggest that learning mechanisms are involved in
   development of the disorder. Imagining a new personality did not have the same
   effect even though it required as much effort. Several observations are consistent
   with the idea that learning structures are involved, and possibly impaired, in
   dissociation: Childhood abuse, which is frequent in patients’ backgrounds, can
   produce hippocampal damage (Bremner et al., 1997); an association has been
   reported between identity dissociation and epileptic activity in the temporal
   lobes, where the hippocampi are located (Mesulam, 1981); and differences in
   temporal lobe activity have been found between personalities in the same
   individual (Saxe, Vasile, Hill, Bloomingdale, & Van der Kolk, 1992; Sheehan,
   Thurber, & Sewall, 2006).

   In Perspective
   There was a time when the topic of sleep was totally mysterious and dreaming
   was the province of poets and shamans. Now sleep and dreaming are both
   yielding to the scrutiny of neuroscience. Although we are still unclear about the
   functions of sleep, we are learning how various structures in the brain turn it off
   and on, and how our body dances not only to a daily rhythm but also to another
   that repeats itself 16 times a day and controls our fluctuations in alertness,
   daydreaming, and night dreaming.
   In The News: LSD Provides New Insights Into Consciousness
   As you learned in Chapter 5, the psychedelic drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) had been
   studied previously by psychologists such as Timothy Leary for its ability to produce altered
   states of consciousness. Research on the effects of LSD had been halted for several decades due
   to bans on this illegal substance, but there is renewed interest in understanding LSD’s effects on
   subjective experience. By using modern brain imaging techniques such as
   magnetoencephalography (MEG), arterial spin labelling (ASL), and blood oxygen level–
   dependent measures (BOLD) while participants experience the effects of LSD, researchers have
   gained new insight into the neural bases of human consciousness. Robin Carhart-Harris and
   colleagues (2016) discovered that the consciousness-altering effects of LSD were associated
   with modifications of brain networks; for example, increased connectivity between the visual
   cortex and other brain areas was correlated with visual hallucinations. The researchers also
   observed decreased alpha wave power, particularly in the posterior cingulate cortex, which they
   interpreted as an indication of reduced filtering of information. Of particular interest, decreased
   connection between the parahippocampus and the retrosplenial cortex was related to
   participants’ loss of a sense of self and of meaning, indicating the circuit’s role in those two
   processes. Further studies of altered consciousness under psychedelic drugs may provide insight
   into disruptions of consciousness that occur in psychological disorders such as schizophrenia.
   Thought Questions
   1. How can modern brain imaging techniques reveal new information about people’s
   experiences while under the influence of a drug such as LSD?
   2. How can studies of people under the influence of drugs help scientists better understand
   typical brain function?

   resources.
   Consciousness is also giving up its secrets as researchers bring modern
   technologies to bear on awareness, attention, and memory. In other words, what
   was once a taboo topic is becoming accessible to the research strategies of
   science and is providing a whole new arena of opportunities to observe the brain
   at work.
   In this final chapter we have explored a unique field of research. The study of
   sleep has demonstrated neuroscience’s ability to unravel mysteries and dispel
   superstition. The investigation of consciousness has been more daring, taking
   scientists where none had gone before. That is the job of science, to push back
   darkness, whether by finding a treatment for depression or by explaining
   humanity’s most unique characteristics and capabilities. But we have traveled a
   road filled with questions and uncertain facts, and the words of the schizophrenia
   researcher that “almost everything remains to be done” still seem appropriate. If
   all this ambiguity has left you with a vaguely unsatisfied feeling, that is good;
   you may have the makings of a neuroscientist. And we have left the most
   exciting discoveries for you.
   Chapter Summary
   Sleep and Dreaming
   Circadian rhythms are rhythms that repeat on a daily basis, affecting the timing of sleep
   and several bodily processes. The suprachiasmatic nucleus is the most important control
   center but not the only one. The rhythm is primarily entrained to light.
   Several ultradian rhythms occur within the day. One involves alternating periods of
   arousal during waking and stages that vary in arousal during sleep.
   REM sleep is when most dreaming occurs, but it has also been implicated in neural
   development and learning.
   Slow-wave sleep may restore cerebral and cognitive functioning; it participates in
   learning and memory, possibly in the form of both consolidation and pruning.
   Waking, sleep, and sleep’s stages are controlled by separate, complex networks of brain
   structures.
   Insomnia, sleepwalking, narcolepsy, and REM sleep behavior disorder represent the
   effects of psychological disturbances in some cases and malfunction of the sleep-wake
   mechanisms in others.
   Sleep is an active period, a state of consciousness that is neither entirely conscious nor
   unconscious.
   The Neural Bases of Consciousness
   Any very specific definition of consciousness is premature, but normal consciousness
   includes awareness, attention, and a sense of self.
   How awareness comes about is unclear, but research has shown that it involves the
   thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, claustrum, and coordinated activity in
   brainwide networks.
   Attention allocates the brain’s resources, actually shifting neural activity among neurons
   or brain locations.
   Body image, memory, and mirror neurons are important contributors to a sense of self.
   Split-brain surgery provides an interesting research opportunity into consciousness, which
   has prompted debates about each hemisphere’s contribution to consciousness and to the
   self.
   Dissociative identity disorder involves what appear to be distinct personalities or selves.
   Reports indicate that the different states include different physical and physiological
   characteristics.

   For Further Thought
   Animals cycle on a 24-hr schedule, either sleeping at night and being active during the day or
   vice versa. An alternative would be to sleep when fatigue overtakes the body, regardless of the
   time. What advantages can you think of for a regular schedule?
   Machines and, probably, some simpler animals function just fine without awareness.
   Awareness places a significant demand on neural resources. What adaptive benefits do you
   see?
   Do you think we will be able to understand consciousness at the neural level? Why or why
   not? Will computers and robots achieve consciousness?
