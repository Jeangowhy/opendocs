Contributors to this Manual
===========================

Like Guile itself, the Guile reference manual is a living entity, cared
for by many people over a long period of time.  As such, it is hard to
identify individuals of whom to say “yes, this single person wrote the
manual.”

   Still, among the many contributions, some caretakers stand out.
First among them is Neil Jerram, who has worked on this document for
over ten years.  Neil’s attention both to detail and to the big picture
have made a real difference in the understanding of a generation of
Guile hackers.

   Next we should note Marius Vollmer’s effect on this document.  Marius
maintained Guile during a period in which Guile’s API was clarified—put
to the fire, so to speak—and he had the good sense to effect the same
change on the manual.

   Martin Grabmueller made substantial contributions throughout the
manual in preparation for the Guile 1.6 release, including filling out a
lot of the documentation of Scheme data types, control mechanisms and
procedures.  In addition, he wrote the documentation for Guile’s SRFI
modules and modules associated with the Guile REPL.

   Ludovic Courtès and Andy Wingo, who co-maintain Guile since 2010,
along with Mark Weaver, have also made their dent in the manual, writing
documentation for new modules and subsystems that arrived with Guile
2.0.  Ludovic, Andy, and Mark are also responsible for ensuring that the
existing text retains its relevance as Guile evolves.  *Note* Reporting
Bugs::, for more information on reporting problems in this manual.

   The content for the first versions of this manual incorporated and
was inspired by documents from Aubrey Jaffer, author of the SCM system
on which Guile was based, and from Tom Lord, Guile’s first maintainer.
Although most of this text has been rewritten, all of it was important,
and some of the structure remains.

   The manual for the first versions of Guile were largely written,
edited, and compiled by Mark Galassi and Jim Blandy.  In particular, Jim
wrote the original tutorial on Guile’s data representation and the C API
for accessing Guile objects.

   Significant portions were also contributed by Thien-Thi Nguyen, Kevin
Ryde, Mikael Djurfeldt, Christian Lynbech, Julian Graham, Gary Houston,
Tim Pierce, and a few dozen more.  You, reader, are most welcome to join
their esteemed ranks.  Visit Guile’s web site at

# 📜 1 Introduction
**************

Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language.  Scheme
(<http://schemers.org/>) is an elegant and conceptually simple dialect
of Lisp, originated by Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman, and since evolved
by the series of reports known as RnRS (the Revised^n Reports on
Scheme).

   Unlike, for example, Python or Perl, Scheme has no benevolent
dictator.  There are many Scheme implementations, with different
characteristics and with communities and academic activities around
them, and the language develops as a result of the interplay between
these.  Guile’s particular characteristics are that

   • it is easy to combine with other code written in C
   • it has a historical and continuing connection with the GNU Project
   • it emphasizes interactive and incremental programming
   • it actually supports several languages, not just Scheme.

The next few sections explain what we mean by these points.  The
sections after that cover how you can obtain and install Guile, and the
typographical conventions that we use in this manual.

1.1 Guile and Scheme
====================

Guile implements Scheme as described in the Revised^5 Report on the
Algorithmic Language Scheme (usually known as R5RS), providing clean and
general data and control structures.  Guile goes beyond the rather
austere language presented in R5RS, extending it with a module system,
full access to POSIX system calls, networking support, multiple threads,
dynamic linking, a foreign function call interface, powerful string
processing, and many other features needed for programming in the real
world.

   In 2007, the Scheme community agreed upon and published R6RS, a
significant installment in the RnRS series.  R6RS expands the core
Scheme language, and standardises many non-core functions that
implementations—including Guile—have previously done in different ways.
Over time, Guile has been updated to incorporate almost all of the
features of R6RS, and to adjust some existing features to conform to the
R6RS specification.  *Note* R6RS Support::, for full details.

   In parallel to official standardization efforts, the SRFI process
(<http://srfi.schemers.org/>) standardises interfaces for many practical
needs, such as multithreaded programming and multidimensional arrays.
Guile supports many SRFIs, as documented in detail in *note* SRFI
Support::.

   The process that led to the R6RS standard brought a split in the
Scheme community to the surface.  The implementors that wrote R6RS
considered that it was impossible to write useful, portable programs in
R5RS, and that only an ambitious standard could solve this problem.
However, part of the Scheme world saw the R6RS effort as too broad, and
as having included some components that would never be adopted by more
minimalistic Scheme implementations.  This second group succeeded in
taking control of the official Scheme standardization track and in 2013
released a more limited R7RS, essentially consisting of R5RS, plus a
module system.  Guile supports R7RS also.  *Note* R7RS Support::.

   With R6RS and R7RS, the unified Scheme standardization process
appears to have more or less run its course.  There will continue to be
more code written in terms of both systems, and modules defined using
the SRFI process, and Guile will support both.  However for future
directions, Guile takes inspiration from other related language
communities: Racket, Clojure, Concurrent ML, and so on.

   In summary, Guile supports writing and running code written to the
R5RS, R6RS, and R7RS Scheme standards, and also supports a number of
SRFI modules.  However for most users, until a need for
cross-implementation portability has been identified, we recommend using
the parts of Guile that are useful in solving the problem at hand,
regardless of whether they proceed from a standard or whether they are
Guile-specific.

1.2 Combining with C Code
=========================

Like a shell, Guile can run interactively—reading expressions from the
user, evaluating them, and displaying the results—or as a script
interpreter, reading and executing Scheme code from a file.  Guile also
provides an object library, “libguile”, that allows other applications
to easily incorporate a complete Scheme interpreter.  An application can
then use Guile as an extension language, a clean and powerful
configuration language, or as multi-purpose “glue”, connecting
primitives provided by the application.  It is easy to call Scheme code
from C code and vice versa, giving the application designer full control
of how and when to invoke the interpreter.  Applications can add new
functions, data types, control structures, and even syntax to Guile,
creating a domain-specific language tailored to the task at hand, but
based on a robust language design.

   This kind of combination is helped by four aspects of Guile’s design
and history.  First is that Guile has always been targeted as an
extension language.  Hence its C API has always been of great
importance, and has been developed accordingly.  Second and third are
rather technical points—that Guile uses conservative garbage collection,
and that it implements the Scheme concept of continuations by copying
and reinstating the C stack—but whose practical consequence is that most
existing C code can be glued into Guile as is, without needing
modifications to cope with strange Scheme execution flows.  Last is the
module system, which helps extensions to coexist without stepping on
each others’ toes.

   Guile’s module system allows one to break up a large program into
manageable sections with well-defined interfaces between them.  Modules
may contain a mixture of interpreted and compiled code; Guile can use
either static or dynamic linking to incorporate compiled code.  Modules
also encourage developers to package up useful collections of routines
for general distribution; as of this writing, one can find Emacs
interfaces, database access routines, compilers, GUI toolkit interfaces,
and HTTP client functions, among others.

1.3 Guile and the GNU Project
=============================

Guile was conceived by the GNU Project following the fantastic success
of Emacs Lisp as an extension language within Emacs.  Just as Emacs Lisp
allowed complete and unanticipated applications to be written within the
Emacs environment, the idea was that Guile should do the same for other
GNU Project applications.  This remains true today.

   The idea of extensibility is closely related to the GNU project’s
primary goal, that of promoting software freedom.  Software freedom
means that people receiving a software package can modify or enhance it
to their own desires, including in ways that may not have occurred at
all to the software’s original developers.  For programs written in a
compiled language like C, this freedom covers modifying and rebuilding
the C code; but if the program also provides an extension language, that
is usually a much friendlier and lower-barrier-of-entry way for the user
to start making their own changes.

   Guile is now used by GNU project applications such as AutoGen,
Lilypond, Denemo, Mailutils, TeXmacs and Gnucash, and we hope that there
will be many more in future.

1.4 Interactive Programming
===========================

Non-free software has no interest in its users being able to see how it
works.  They are supposed to just accept it, or to report problems and
hope that the source code owners will choose to work on them.

   Free software aims to work reliably just as much as non-free software
does, but it should also empower its users by making its workings
available.  This is useful for many reasons, including education,
auditing and enhancements, as well as for debugging problems.

   The ideal free software system achieves this by making it easy for
interested users to see the source code for a feature that they are
using, and to follow through that source code step-by-step, as it runs.
In Emacs, good examples of this are the source code hyperlinks in the
help system, and ‘edebug’.  Then, for bonus points and maximising the
ability for the user to experiment quickly with code changes, the system
should allow parts of the source code to be modified and reloaded into
the running program, to take immediate effect.

   Guile is designed for this kind of interactive programming, and this
distinguishes it from many Scheme implementations that instead
prioritise running a fixed Scheme program as fast as possible—because
there are tradeoffs between performance and the ability to modify parts
of an already running program.  There are faster Schemes than Guile, but
Guile is a GNU project and so prioritises the GNU vision of programming
freedom and experimentation.

1.5 Supporting Multiple Languages
=================================

Since the 2.0 release, Guile’s architecture supports compiling any
language to its core virtual machine bytecode, and Scheme is just one of
the supported languages.  Other supported languages are Emacs Lisp,
ECMAScript (commonly known as Javascript) and Brainfuck, and work is
under discussion for Lua, Ruby and Python.

   This means that users can program applications which use Guile in the
language of their choice, rather than having the tastes of the
application’s author imposed on them.


File: guile.info,  Node: Obtaining and Installing Guile,  Next: Organisation of this Manual,  Prev: Supporting Multiple Languages,  Up: Introduction

1.6 Obtaining and Installing Guile
==================================

Guile can be obtained from the main GNU archive site <ftp://ftp.gnu.org>
or any of its mirrors.  The file will be named guile-VERSION.tar.gz.
The current version is 3.0.9, so the file you should grab is:

   <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guile/guile-3.0.9.tar.gz>

   To unbundle Guile use the instruction

     zcat guile-3.0.9.tar.gz | tar xvf -

which will create a directory called ‘guile-3.0.9’ with all the sources.
You can look at the file ‘INSTALL’ for detailed instructions on how to
build and install Guile, but you should be able to just do

     cd guile-3.0.9
     ./configure
     make
     make install

   This will install the Guile executable ‘guile’, the Guile library
‘libguile’ and various associated header files and support libraries.
It will also install the Guile reference manual.

   Since this manual frequently refers to the Scheme “standard”, also
known as R5RS, or the “Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language
Scheme”, we have included the report in the Guile distribution; see
*note* Introduction: (r5rs)Top.  This will also be installed in your info
directory.

1.7 Organisation of this Manual
===============================

The rest of this manual is organised into the following chapters.

*Chapter 2: Hello Guile!*
     A whirlwind tour shows how Guile can be used interactively and as a
     script interpreter, how to link Guile into your own applications,
     and how to write modules of interpreted and compiled code for use
     with Guile.  Everything introduced here is documented again and in
     full by the later parts of the manual.

*Chapter 3: Hello Scheme!*
     For readers new to Scheme, this chapter provides an introduction to
     the basic ideas of the Scheme language.  This material would apply
     to any Scheme implementation and so does not make reference to
     anything Guile-specific.

*Chapter 4: Programming in Scheme*
     Provides an overview of programming in Scheme with Guile.  It
     covers how to invoke the ‘guile’ program from the command-line and
     how to write scripts in Scheme.  It also introduces the extensions
     that Guile offers beyond standard Scheme.

*Chapter 5: Programming in C*
     Provides an overview of how to use Guile in a C program.  It
     discusses the fundamental concepts that you need to understand to
     access the features of Guile, such as dynamic types and the garbage
     collector.  It explains in a tutorial like manner how to define new
     data types and functions for the use by Scheme programs.

*Chapter 6: Guile API Reference*
     This part of the manual documents the Guile API in
     functionality-based groups with the Scheme and C interfaces
     presented side by side.

*Chapter 7: Guile Modules*
     Describes some important modules, distributed as part of the Guile
     distribution, that extend the functionality provided by the Guile
     Scheme core.

*Chapter 8: GOOPS*
     Describes GOOPS, an object oriented extension to Guile that
     provides classes, multiple inheritance and generic functions.


File: guile.info,  Node: Typographical Conventions,  Prev: Organisation of this Manual,  Up: Introduction

1.8 Typographical Conventions
=============================

In examples and procedure descriptions and all other places where the
evaluation of Scheme expression is shown, we use some notation for
denoting the output and evaluation results of expressions.

   The symbol ‘⇒’ is used to tell which value is returned by an
evaluation:

     (+ 1 2)
     ⇒ 3

   Some procedures produce some output besides returning a value.  This
is denoted by the symbol ‘⊣’.

     (begin (display 1) (newline) 'hooray)
     ⊣ 1
     ⇒ hooray

   As you can see, this code prints ‘1’ (denoted by ‘⊣’), and returns
‘hooray’ (denoted by ‘⇒’).

2.1 Running Guile Interactively
===============================

In its simplest form, Guile acts as an interactive interpreter for the
Scheme programming language, reading and evaluating Scheme expressions
the user enters from the terminal.  Here is a sample interaction between
Guile and a user; the user’s input appears after the ‘$’ and
‘scheme@(guile-user)>’ prompts:

     $ guile
     scheme@(guile-user)> (+ 1 2 3)                ; add some numbers
     $1 = 6
     scheme@(guile-user)> (define (factorial n)    ; define a function
                            (if (zero? n) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
     scheme@(guile-user)> (factorial 20)
     $2 = 2432902008176640000
     scheme@(guile-user)> (getpwnam "root")        ; look in /etc/passwd
     $3 = #("root" "x" 0 0 "root" "/root" "/bin/bash")
     scheme@(guile-user)> C-d
     $

2.2 Running Guile Scripts
=========================

Like AWK, Perl, or any shell, Guile can interpret script files.  A Guile
script is simply a file of Scheme code with some extra information at
the beginning which tells the operating system how to invoke Guile, and
then tells Guile how to handle the Scheme code.

   Here is a trivial Guile script.  *Note* Guile Scripting::, for more
details.

     #!/usr/local/bin/guile -s
     !#
     (display "Hello, world!")
     (newline)


File: guile.info,  Node: Linking Guile into Programs,  Next: Writing Guile Extensions,  Prev: Running Guile Scripts,  Up: Hello Guile!

2.3 Linking Guile into Programs
===============================

The Guile interpreter is available as an object library, to be linked
into applications using Scheme as a configuration or extension language.

   Here is ‘simple-guile.c’, source code for a program that will produce
a complete Guile interpreter.  In addition to all usual functions
provided by Guile, it will also offer the function ‘my-hostname’.

     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <libguile.h>

     static SCM
     my_hostname (void)
     {
       char *s = getenv ("HOSTNAME");
       if (s == NULL)
         return SCM_BOOL_F;
       else
         return scm_from_locale_string (s);
     }

     static void
     inner_main (void *data, int argc, char **argv)
     {
       scm_c_define_gsubr ("my-hostname", 0, 0, 0, my_hostname);
       scm_shell (argc, argv);
     }

     int
     main (int argc, char **argv)
     {
       scm_boot_guile (argc, argv, inner_main, 0);
       return 0; /* never reached */
     }

   When Guile is correctly installed on your system, the above program
can be compiled and linked like this:

     $ gcc -o simple-guile simple-guile.c \
         `pkg-config --cflags --libs guile-3.0`

   When it is run, it behaves just like the ‘guile’ program except that
you can also call the new ‘my-hostname’ function.

     $ ./simple-guile
     scheme@(guile-user)> (+ 1 2 3)
     $1 = 6
     scheme@(guile-user)> (my-hostname)
     "burns"


File: guile.info,  Node: Writing Guile Extensions,  Next: Using the Guile Module System,  Prev: Linking Guile into Programs,  Up: Hello Guile!

2.4 Writing Guile Extensions
============================

You can link Guile into your program and make Scheme available to the
users of your program.  You can also link your library into Guile and
make its functionality available to all users of Guile.

   A library that is linked into Guile is called an “extension”, but it
really just is an ordinary object library.

   The following example shows how to write a simple extension for Guile
that makes the ‘j0’ function available to Scheme code.

     #include <math.h>
     #include <libguile.h>

     SCM
     j0_wrapper (SCM x)
     {
       return scm_from_double (j0 (scm_to_double (x)));
     }

     void
     init_bessel ()
     {
       scm_c_define_gsubr ("j0", 1, 0, 0, j0_wrapper);
     }

   This C source file needs to be compiled into a shared library.  Here
is how to do it on GNU/Linux:

     gcc `pkg-config --cflags guile-3.0` \
       -shared -o libguile-bessel.so -fPIC bessel.c

   For creating shared libraries portably, we recommend the use of GNU
Libtool (*note* Introduction: (libtool)Top.).

   A shared library can be loaded into a running Guile process with the
function ‘load-extension’.  The ‘j0’ is then immediately available:

     $ guile
     scheme@(guile-user)> (load-extension "./libguile-bessel" "init_bessel")
     scheme@(guile-user)> (j0 2)
     $1 = 0.223890779141236

Packages::.

2.5 Using the Guile Module System
=================================

Guile has support for dividing a program into “modules”.  By using
modules, you can group related code together and manage the composition
of complete programs from largely independent parts.

   For more details on the module system beyond this introductory
material, *Note* Modules::.

* Writing new Modules::
* Putting Extensions into Modules::


File: guile.info,  Node: Using Modules,  Next: Writing new Modules,  Up: Using the Guile Module System

2.5.1 Using Modules
-------------------

Guile comes with a lot of useful modules, for example for string
processing or command line parsing.  Additionally, there exist many
Guile modules written by other Guile hackers, but which have to be
installed manually.

   Here is a sample interactive session that shows how to use the
‘(ice-9 popen)’ module which provides the means for communicating with
other processes over pipes together with the ‘(ice-9 rdelim)’ module
that provides the function ‘read-line’.

     $ guile
     scheme@(guile-user)> (use-modules (ice-9 popen))
     scheme@(guile-user)> (use-modules (ice-9 rdelim))
     scheme@(guile-user)> (define p (open-input-pipe "ls -l"))
     scheme@(guile-user)> (read-line p)
     $1 = "total 30"
     scheme@(guile-user)> (read-line p)
     $2 = "drwxr-sr-x    2 mgrabmue mgrabmue     1024 Mar 29 19:57 CVS"


File: guile.info,  Node: Writing new Modules,  Next: Putting Extensions into Modules,  Prev: Using Modules,  Up: Using the Guile Module System

2.5.2 Writing new Modules
-------------------------

You can create new modules using the syntactic form ‘define-module’.
All definitions following this form until the next ‘define-module’ are
placed into the new module.

   One module is usually placed into one file, and that file is
installed in a location where Guile can automatically find it.  The
following session shows a simple example.

     $ cat /usr/local/share/guile/site/foo/bar.scm

     (define-module (foo bar)
       #:export (frob))

     (define (frob x) (* 2 x))

     $ guile
     scheme@(guile-user)> (use-modules (foo bar))
     scheme@(guile-user)> (frob 12)
     $1 = 24

   For more on how to install your module, *note* Installing Site
Packages::.


File: guile.info,  Node: Putting Extensions into Modules,  Prev: Writing new Modules,  Up: Using the Guile Module System

2.5.3 Putting Extensions into Modules
-------------------------------------

In addition to Scheme code you can also put things that are defined in C
into a module.

   You do this by writing a small Scheme file that defines the module
and call ‘load-extension’ directly in the body of the module.

     $ cat /usr/local/share/guile/site/math/bessel.scm

     (define-module (math bessel)
       #:export (j0))

     (load-extension "libguile-bessel" "init_bessel")

     $ file /usr/local/lib/guile/3.0/extensions/libguile-bessel.so
     ... ELF 32-bit LSB shared object ...
     $ guile
     scheme@(guile-user)> (use-modules (math bessel))
     scheme@(guile-user)> (j0 2)
     $1 = 0.223890779141236

   *Note* Foreign Extensions::, for more information.


File: guile.info,  Node: Reporting Bugs,  Prev: Using the Guile Module System,  Up: Hello Guile!

2.6 Reporting Bugs
==================

Any problems with the installation should be reported to
<bug-guile@gnu.org>.

   If you find a bug in Guile, please report it to the Guile developers,
so they can fix it.  They may also be able to suggest workarounds when
it is not possible for you to apply the bug-fix or install a new version
of Guile yourself.

   Before sending in bug reports, please check with the following list
that you really have found a bug.

   • Whenever documentation and actual behavior differ, you have
     certainly found a bug, either in the documentation or in the
     program.

   • When Guile crashes, it is a bug.

   • When Guile hangs or takes forever to complete a task, it is a bug.

   • When calculations produce wrong results, it is a bug.

   • When Guile signals an error for valid Scheme programs, it is a bug.

   • When Guile does not signal an error for invalid Scheme programs, it
     may be a bug, unless this is explicitly documented.

   • When some part of the documentation is not clear and does not make
     sense to you even after re-reading the section, it is a bug.

   Before reporting the bug, check whether any programs you have loaded
into Guile, including your ‘.guile’ file, set any variables that may
affect the functioning of Guile.  Also, see whether the problem happens
in a freshly started Guile without loading your ‘.guile’ file (start
Guile with the ‘-q’ switch to prevent loading the init file).  If the
problem does _not_ occur then, you must report the precise contents of
any programs that you must load into Guile in order to cause the problem
to occur.

   When you write a bug report, please make sure to include as much of
the information described below in the report.  If you can’t figure out
some of the items, it is not a problem, but the more information we get,
the more likely we can diagnose and fix the bug.

   • The version number of Guile.  You can get this information from
     invoking ‘guile --version’ at your shell, or calling ‘(version)’
     from within Guile.

   • Your machine type, as determined by the ‘config.guess’ shell
     script.  If you have a Guile checkout, this file is located in
     ‘build-aux’; otherwise you can fetch the latest version from
     <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD>.

          $ build-aux/config.guess
          x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

   • If you installed Guile from a binary package, the version of that
     package.  On systems that use RPM, use ‘rpm -qa | grep guile’.  On
     systems that use DPKG, ‘dpkg -l | grep guile’.

   • If you built Guile yourself, the build configuration that you used:

          $ ./config.status --config
          '--enable-error-on-warning' '--disable-deprecated'...

   • A complete description of how to reproduce the bug.

     If you have a Scheme program that produces the bug, please include
     it in the bug report.  If your program is too big to include,
     please try to reduce your code to a minimal test case.

     If you can reproduce your problem at the REPL, that is best.  Give
     a transcript of the expressions you typed at the REPL.

   • A description of the incorrect behavior.  For example, "The Guile
     process gets a fatal signal," or, "The resulting output is as
     follows, which I think is wrong."

     If the manifestation of the bug is a Guile error message, it is
     important to report the precise text of the error message, and a
     backtrace showing how the Scheme program arrived at the error.
     This can be done using the ‘,backtrace’ command in Guile’s
     debugger.

   If your bug causes Guile to crash, additional information from a
low-level debugger such as GDB might be helpful.  If you have built
Guile yourself, you can run Guile under GDB via the
‘meta/gdb-uninstalled-guile’ script.  Instead of invoking Guile as
usual, invoke the wrapper script, type ‘run’ to start the process, then
‘backtrace’ when the crash comes.  Include that backtrace in your
report.

# 📜 3 Hello Scheme!
***************

In this chapter, we introduce the basic concepts that underpin the
elegance and power of the Scheme language.

   Readers who already possess a background knowledge of Scheme may
happily skip this chapter.  For the reader who is new to the language,
however, the following discussions on data, procedures, expressions and
closure are designed to provide a minimum level of Scheme understanding
that is more or less assumed by the chapters that follow.

   The style of this introductory material aims about halfway between
the terse precision of R5RS and the discursiveness of existing Scheme
tutorials.  For pointers to useful Scheme resources on the web, please

3.1 Data Types, Values and Variables
====================================

This section discusses the representation of data types and values, what
it means for Scheme to be a “latently typed” language, and the role of
variables.  We conclude by introducing the Scheme syntaxes for defining
a new variable, and for changing the value of an existing variable.

* Definition::                  Defining variables and setting their values.


File: guile.info,  Node: Latent Typing,  Next: Values and Variables,  Up: About Data

3.1.1 Latent Typing
-------------------

The term “latent typing” is used to describe a computer language, such
as Scheme, for which you cannot, _in general_, simply look at a
program’s source code and determine what type of data will be associated
with a particular variable, or with the result of a particular
expression.

   Sometimes, of course, you _can_ tell from the code what the type of
an expression will be.  If you have a line in your program that sets the
variable ‘x’ to the numeric value 1, you can be certain that,
immediately after that line has executed (and in the absence of multiple
threads), ‘x’ has the numeric value 1.  Or if you write a procedure that
is designed to concatenate two strings, it is likely that the rest of
your application will always invoke this procedure with two string
parameters, and quite probable that the procedure would go wrong in some
way if it was ever invoked with parameters that were not both strings.

   Nevertheless, the point is that there is nothing in Scheme which
requires the procedure parameters always to be strings, or ‘x’ always to
hold a numeric value, and there is no way of declaring in your program
that such constraints should always be obeyed.  In the same vein, there
is no way to declare the expected type of a procedure’s return value.

   Instead, the types of variables and expressions are only known – in
general – at run time.  If you _need_ to check at some point that a
value has the expected type, Scheme provides run time procedures that
you can invoke to do so.  But equally, it can be perfectly valid for two
separate invocations of the same procedure to specify arguments with
different types, and to return values with different types.

   The next subsection explains what this means in practice, for the
ways that Scheme programs use data types, values and variables.


File: guile.info,  Node: Values and Variables,  Next: Definition,  Prev: Latent Typing,  Up: About Data

3.1.2 Values and Variables
--------------------------

Scheme provides many data types that you can use to represent your data.
Primitive types include characters, strings, numbers and procedures.
Compound types, which allow a group of primitive and compound values to
be stored together, include lists, pairs, vectors and multi-dimensional
arrays.  In addition, Guile allows applications to define their own data
types, with the same status as the built-in standard Scheme types.

   As a Scheme program runs, values of all types pop in and out of
existence.  Sometimes values are stored in variables, but more commonly
they pass seamlessly from being the result of one computation to being
one of the parameters for the next.

   Consider an example.  A string value is created because the
interpreter reads in a literal string from your program’s source code.
Then a numeric value is created as the result of calculating the length
of the string.  A second numeric value is created by doubling the
calculated length.  Finally the program creates a list with two elements
– the doubled length and the original string itself – and stores this
list in a program variable.

   All of the values involved here – in fact, all values in Scheme –
carry their type with them.  In other words, every value “knows,” at
runtime, what kind of value it is.  A number, a string, a list,
whatever.

   A variable, on the other hand, has no fixed type.  A variable – ‘x’,
say – is simply the name of a location – a box – in which you can store
any kind of Scheme value.  So the same variable in a program may hold a
number at one moment, a list of procedures the next, and later a pair of
strings.  The “type” of a variable – insofar as the idea is meaningful
at all – is simply the type of whatever value the variable happens to be
storing at a particular moment.

3.1.3 Defining and Setting Variables
------------------------------------

To define a new variable, you use Scheme’s ‘define’ syntax like this:

     (define VARIABLE-NAME VALUE)

   This makes a new variable called VARIABLE-NAME and stores VALUE in it
as the variable’s initial value.  For example:

     ;; Make a variable `x' with initial numeric value 1.
     (define x 1)

     ;; Make a variable `organization' with an initial string value.
     (define organization "Free Software Foundation")

   (In Scheme, a semicolon marks the beginning of a comment that
continues until the end of the line.  So the lines beginning ‘;;’ are
comments.)

   Changing the value of an already existing variable is very similar,
except that ‘define’ is replaced by the Scheme syntax ‘set!’, like this:

     (set! VARIABLE-NAME NEW-VALUE)

   Remember that variables do not have fixed types, so NEW-VALUE may
have a completely different type from whatever was previously stored in
the location named by VARIABLE-NAME.  Both of the following examples are
therefore correct.

     ;; Change the value of `x' to 5.
     (set! x 5)

     ;; Change the value of `organization' to the FSF's street number.
     (set! organization 545)

   In these examples, VALUE and NEW-VALUE are literal numeric or string
values.  In general, however, VALUE and NEW-VALUE can be any Scheme
expression.  Even though we have not yet covered the forms that Scheme
expressions can take (*note* About Expressions::), you can probably guess
what the following ‘set!’ example does...

     (set! x (+ x 1))

   (Note: this is not a complete description of ‘define’ and ‘set!’,
because we need to introduce some other aspects of Scheme before the
missing pieces can be filled in.  If, however, you are already familiar
with the structure of Scheme, you may like to read about those missing
pieces immediately by jumping ahead to the following references.

     depths of a compound data structure.)

3.2 The Representation and Use of Procedures
============================================

This section introduces the basics of using and creating Scheme
procedures.  It discusses the representation of procedures as just
another kind of Scheme value, and shows how procedure invocation
expressions are constructed.  We then explain how ‘lambda’ is used to
create new procedures, and conclude by presenting the various shorthand
forms of ‘define’ that can be used instead of writing an explicit
‘lambda’ expression.

* Lambda Alternatives::         Other ways of writing procedure definitions.


File: guile.info,  Node: Procedures as Values,  Next: Simple Invocation,  Up: About Procedures

3.2.1 Procedures as Values
--------------------------

One of the great simplifications of Scheme is that a procedure is just
another type of value, and that procedure values can be passed around
and stored in variables in exactly the same way as, for example, strings
and lists.  When we talk about a built-in standard Scheme procedure such
as ‘open-input-file’, what we actually mean is that there is a
pre-defined top level variable called ‘open-input-file’, whose value is
a procedure that implements what R5RS says that ‘open-input-file’ should
do.

   Note that this is quite different from many dialects of Lisp —
including Emacs Lisp — in which a program can use the same name with two
quite separate meanings: one meaning identifies a Lisp function, while
the other meaning identifies a Lisp variable, whose value need have
nothing to do with the function that is associated with the first
meaning.  In these dialects, functions and variables are said to live in
different “namespaces”.

   In Scheme, on the other hand, all names belong to a single unified
namespace, and the variables that these names identify can hold any kind
of Scheme value, including procedure values.

   One consequence of the “procedures as values” idea is that, if you
don’t happen to like the standard name for a Scheme procedure, you can
change it.

   For example, ‘call-with-current-continuation’ is a very important
standard Scheme procedure, but it also has a very long name!  So, many
programmers use the following definition to assign the same procedure
value to the more convenient name ‘call/cc’.

     (define call/cc call-with-current-continuation)

   Let’s understand exactly how this works.  The definition creates a
new variable ‘call/cc’, and then sets its value to the value of the
variable ‘call-with-current-continuation’; the latter value is a
procedure that implements the behaviour that R5RS specifies under the
name “call-with-current-continuation”.  So ‘call/cc’ ends up holding
this value as well.

   Now that ‘call/cc’ holds the required procedure value, you could
choose to use ‘call-with-current-continuation’ for a completely
different purpose, or just change its value so that you will get an
error if you accidentally use ‘call-with-current-continuation’ as a
procedure in your program rather than ‘call/cc’.  For example:

     (set! call-with-current-continuation "Not a procedure any more!")

   Or you could just leave ‘call-with-current-continuation’ as it was.
It’s perfectly fine for more than one variable to hold the same
procedure value.

3.2.2 Simple Procedure Invocation
---------------------------------

A procedure invocation in Scheme is written like this:

     (PROCEDURE [ARG1 [ARG2 ...]])

   In this expression, PROCEDURE can be any Scheme expression whose
value is a procedure.  Most commonly, however, PROCEDURE is simply the
name of a variable whose value is a procedure.

   For example, ‘string-append’ is a standard Scheme procedure whose
behaviour is to concatenate together all the arguments, which are
expected to be strings, that it is given.  So the expression

     (string-append "/home" "/" "andrew")

is a procedure invocation whose result is the string value
‘"/home/andrew"’.

   Similarly, ‘string-length’ is a standard Scheme procedure that
returns the length of a single string argument, so

     (string-length "abc")

is a procedure invocation whose result is the numeric value 3.

   Each of the parameters in a procedure invocation can itself be any
Scheme expression.  Since a procedure invocation is itself a type of
expression, we can put these two examples together to get

     (string-length (string-append "/home" "/" "andrew"))

— a procedure invocation whose result is the numeric value 12.

   (You may be wondering what happens if the two examples are combined
the other way round.  If we do this, we can make a procedure invocation
expression that is _syntactically_ correct:

     (string-append "/home" (string-length "abc"))

but when this expression is executed, it will cause an error, because
the result of ‘(string-length "abc")’ is a numeric value, and
‘string-append’ is not designed to accept a numeric value as one of its
arguments.)


File: guile.info,  Node: Creating a Procedure,  Next: Lambda Alternatives,  Prev: Simple Invocation,  Up: About Procedures

3.2.3 Creating and Using a New Procedure
----------------------------------------

Scheme has lots of standard procedures, and Guile provides all of these
via predefined top level variables.  All of these standard procedures
are documented in the later chapters of this reference manual.

   Before very long, though, you will want to create new procedures that
encapsulate aspects of your own applications’ functionality.  To do
this, you can use the famous ‘lambda’ syntax.

   For example, the value of the following Scheme expression

     (lambda (name address) BODY ...)

is a newly created procedure that takes two arguments: ‘name’ and
‘address’.  The behaviour of the new procedure is determined by the
sequence of expressions and definitions in the BODY of the procedure
definition.  (Typically, BODY would use the arguments in some way, or
else there wouldn’t be any point in giving them to the procedure.)  When
invoked, the new procedure returns a value that is the value of the last
expression in the BODY.

   To make things more concrete, let’s suppose that the two arguments
are both strings, and that the purpose of this procedure is to form a
combined string that includes these arguments.  Then the full lambda
expression might look like this:

     (lambda (name address)
       (string-append "Name=" name ":Address=" address))

   We noted in the previous subsection that the PROCEDURE part of a
procedure invocation expression can be any Scheme expression whose value
is a procedure.  But that’s exactly what a lambda expression is!  So we
can use a lambda expression directly in a procedure invocation, like
this:

     ((lambda (name address)
        (string-append "Name=" name ":Address=" address))
      "FSF"
      "Cambridge")

This is a valid procedure invocation expression, and its result is the
string:

     "Name=FSF:Address=Cambridge"

   It is more common, though, to store the procedure value in a variable
—

     (define make-combined-string
       (lambda (name address)
         (string-append "Name=" name ":Address=" address)))

— and then to use the variable name in the procedure invocation:

     (make-combined-string "FSF" "Cambridge")

Which has exactly the same result.

   It’s important to note that procedures created using ‘lambda’ have
exactly the same status as the standard built in Scheme procedures, and
can be invoked, passed around, and stored in variables in exactly the
same ways.


File: guile.info,  Node: Lambda Alternatives,  Prev: Creating a Procedure,  Up: About Procedures

3.2.4 Lambda Alternatives
-------------------------

Since it is so common in Scheme programs to want to create a procedure
and then store it in a variable, there is an alternative form of the
‘define’ syntax that allows you to do just that.

   A ‘define’ expression of the form

     (define (NAME [ARG1 [ARG2 ...]])
       BODY ...)

is exactly equivalent to the longer form

     (define NAME
       (lambda ([ARG1 [ARG2 ...]])
         BODY ...))

   So, for example, the definition of ‘make-combined-string’ in the
previous subsection could equally be written:

     (define (make-combined-string name address)
       (string-append "Name=" name ":Address=" address))

   This kind of procedure definition creates a procedure that requires
exactly the expected number of arguments.  There are two further forms
of the ‘lambda’ expression, which create a procedure that can accept a
variable number of arguments:

     (lambda (ARG1 ... . ARGS) BODY ...)

     (lambda ARGS BODY ...)

The corresponding forms of the alternative ‘define’ syntax are:

     (define (NAME ARG1 ... . ARGS) BODY ...)

     (define (NAME . ARGS) BODY ...)

For details on how these forms work, see *Note* Lambda::.

   Prior to Guile 2.0, Guile provided an extension to ‘define’ syntax
that allowed you to nest the previous extension up to an arbitrary
depth.  These are no longer provided by default, and instead have been
moved to *note* Curried Definitions::.

   (It could be argued that the alternative ‘define’ forms are rather
confusing, especially for newcomers to the Scheme language, as they hide
both the role of ‘lambda’ and the fact that procedures are values that
are stored in variables in the same way as any other kind of value.  On
the other hand, they are very convenient, and they are also a good
example of another of Scheme’s powerful features: the ability to specify
arbitrary syntactic transformations at run time, which can be applied to
subsequently read input.)

3.3 Expressions and Evaluation
==============================

So far, we have met expressions that _do_ things, such as the ‘define’
expressions that create and initialize new variables, and we have also
talked about expressions that have _values_, for example the value of
the procedure invocation expression:

     (string-append "/home" "/" "andrew")

but we haven’t yet been precise about what causes an expression like
this procedure invocation to be reduced to its “value”, or how the
processing of such expressions relates to the execution of a Scheme
program as a whole.

   This section clarifies what we mean by an expression’s value, by
introducing the idea of “evaluation”.  It discusses the side effects
that evaluation can have, explains how each of the various types of
Scheme expression is evaluated, and describes the behaviour and use of
the Guile REPL as a mechanism for exploring evaluation.  The section
concludes with a very brief summary of Scheme’s common syntactic
expressions.

File: guile.info,  Node: Evaluating,  Next: Tail Calls,  Up: About Expressions

3.3.1 Evaluating Expressions and Executing Programs
---------------------------------------------------

In Scheme, the process of executing an expression is known as
“evaluation”.  Evaluation has two kinds of result:

   • the “value” of the evaluated expression

   • the “side effects” of the evaluation, which consist of any effects
     of evaluating the expression that are not represented by the value.

   Of the expressions that we have met so far, ‘define’ and ‘set!’
expressions have side effects — the creation or modification of a
variable — but no value; ‘lambda’ expressions have values — the newly
constructed procedures — but no side effects; and procedure invocation
expressions, in general, have either values, or side effects, or both.

   It is tempting to try to define more intuitively what we mean by
“value” and “side effects”, and what the difference between them is.  In
general, though, this is extremely difficult.  It is also unnecessary;
instead, we can quite happily define the behaviour of a Scheme program
by specifying how Scheme executes a program as a whole, and then by
describing the value and side effects of evaluation for each type of
expression individually.

So, some(1) definitions...

   • A Scheme program consists of a sequence of expressions.

   • A Scheme interpreter executes the program by evaluating these
     expressions in order, one by one.

   • An expression can be

        • a piece of literal data, such as a number ‘2.3’ or a string
          ‘"Hello world!"’
        • a variable name
        • a procedure invocation expression
        • one of Scheme’s special syntactic expressions.

The following subsections describe how each of these types of expression
is evaluated.

* Menu:

* Eval Literal::                Evaluating literal data.
* Eval Variable::               Evaluating variable references.
* Eval Procedure::              Evaluating procedure invocation expressions.
* Eval Special::                Evaluating special syntactic expressions.

   (1) These definitions are approximate.  For the whole and detailed
truth, see *note* R5RS syntax: (r5rs)Formal syntax and semantics.


File: guile.info,  Node: Eval Literal,  Next: Eval Variable,  Up: Evaluating

### 3.3.1.1 Evaluating Literal Data
...............................

When a literal data expression is evaluated, the value of the expression
is simply the value that the expression describes.  The evaluation of a
literal data expression has no side effects.

So, for example,

   • the value of the expression ‘"abc"’ is the string value ‘"abc"’

   • the value of the expression ‘3+4i’ is the complex number 3 + 4i

   • the value of the expression ‘#(1 2 3)’ is a three-element vector
     containing the numeric values 1, 2 and 3.

   For any data type which can be expressed literally like this, the
syntax of the literal data expression for that data type — in other
words, what you need to write in your code to indicate a literal value
of that type — is known as the data type’s “read syntax”.  This manual
specifies the read syntax for each such data type in the section that
describes that data type.

   Some data types do not have a read syntax.  Procedures, for example,
cannot be expressed as literal data; they must be created using a
‘lambda’ expression (*note* Creating a Procedure::) or implicitly using
the shorthand form of ‘define’ (*note* Lambda Alternatives::).


File: guile.info,  Node: Eval Variable,  Next: Eval Procedure,  Prev: Eval Literal,  Up: Evaluating

### 3.3.1.2 Evaluating a Variable Reference
.......................................

When an expression that consists simply of a variable name is evaluated,
the value of the expression is the value of the named variable.  The
evaluation of a variable reference expression has no side effects.

   So, after

     (define key "Paul Evans")

the value of the expression ‘key’ is the string value ‘"Paul Evans"’.
If KEY is then modified by

     (set! key 3.74)

the value of the expression ‘key’ is the numeric value 3.74.

   If there is no variable with the specified name, evaluation of the
variable reference expression signals an error.


File: guile.info,  Node: Eval Procedure,  Next: Eval Special,  Prev: Eval Variable,  Up: Evaluating

### 3.3.1.3 Evaluating a Procedure Invocation Expression
....................................................

This is where evaluation starts getting interesting!  As already noted,
a procedure invocation expression has the form

     (PROCEDURE [ARG1 [ARG2 ...]])

where PROCEDURE must be an expression whose value, when evaluated, is a
procedure.

   The evaluation of a procedure invocation expression like this
proceeds by

   • evaluating individually the expressions PROCEDURE, ARG1, ARG2, and
     so on

   • calling the procedure that is the value of the PROCEDURE expression
     with the list of values obtained from the evaluations of ARG1, ARG2
     etc.  as its parameters.

   For a procedure defined in Scheme, “calling the procedure with the
list of values as its parameters” means binding the values to the
procedure’s formal parameters and then evaluating the sequence of
expressions that make up the body of the procedure definition.  The
value of the procedure invocation expression is the value of the last
evaluated expression in the procedure body.  The side effects of calling
the procedure are the combination of the side effects of the sequence of
evaluations of expressions in the procedure body.

   For a built-in procedure, the value and side-effects of calling the
procedure are best described by that procedure’s documentation.

   Note that the complete side effects of evaluating a procedure
invocation expression consist not only of the side effects of the
procedure call, but also of any side effects of the preceding evaluation
of the expressions PROCEDURE, ARG1, ARG2, and so on.

   To illustrate this, let’s look again at the procedure invocation
expression:

     (string-length (string-append "/home" "/" "andrew"))

   In the outermost expression, PROCEDURE is ‘string-length’ and ARG1 is
‘(string-append "/home" "/" "andrew")’.

   • Evaluation of ‘string-length’, which is a variable, gives a
     procedure value that implements the expected behaviour for
     “string-length”.

   • Evaluation of ‘(string-append "/home" "/" "andrew")’, which is
     another procedure invocation expression, means evaluating each of

        • ‘string-append’, which gives a procedure value that implements
          the expected behaviour for “string-append”

        • ‘"/home"’, which gives the string value ‘"/home"’

        • ‘"/"’, which gives the string value ‘"/"’

        • ‘"andrew"’, which gives the string value ‘"andrew"’

     and then invoking the procedure value with this list of string
     values as its arguments.  The resulting value is a single string
     value that is the concatenation of all the arguments, namely
     ‘"/home/andrew"’.

   In the evaluation of the outermost expression, the interpreter can
now invoke the procedure value obtained from PROCEDURE with the value
obtained from ARG1 as its arguments.  The resulting value is a numeric
value that is the length of the argument string, which is 12.


File: guile.info,  Node: Eval Special,  Prev: Eval Procedure,  Up: Evaluating

### 3.3.1.4 Evaluating Special Syntactic Expressions
................................................

When a procedure invocation expression is evaluated, the procedure and
_all_ the argument expressions must be evaluated before the procedure
can be invoked.  Special syntactic expressions are special because they
are able to manipulate their arguments in an unevaluated form, and can
choose whether to evaluate any or all of the argument expressions.

   Why is this needed?  Consider a program fragment that asks the user
whether or not to delete a file, and then deletes the file if the user
answers yes.

     (if (string=? (read-answer "Should I delete this file?")
                   "yes")
         (delete-file file))

   If the outermost ‘(if ...)’ expression here was a procedure
invocation expression, the expression ‘(delete-file file)’, whose side
effect is to actually delete a file, would already have been evaluated
before the ‘if’ procedure even got invoked!  Clearly this is no use —
the whole point of an ‘if’ expression is that the “consequent”
expression is only evaluated if the condition of the ‘if’ expression is
“true”.

   Therefore ‘if’ must be special syntax, not a procedure.  Other
special syntaxes that we have already met are ‘define’, ‘set!’ and
‘lambda’.  ‘define’ and ‘set!’ are syntax because they need to know the
variable _name_ that is given as the first argument in a ‘define’ or
‘set!’ expression, not that variable’s value.  ‘lambda’ is syntax
because it does not immediately evaluate the expressions that define the
procedure body; instead it creates a procedure object that incorporates
these expressions so that they can be evaluated in the future, when that
procedure is invoked.

   The rules for evaluating each special syntactic expression are
specified individually for each special syntax.  For a summary of
standard special syntax, see *Note* Syntax Summary::.


File: guile.info,  Node: Tail Calls,  Next: The REPL,  Prev: Evaluating,  Up: About Expressions

3.3.2 Tail calls
----------------

Scheme is “properly tail recursive”, meaning that tail calls or
recursions from certain contexts do not consume stack space or other
resources and can therefore be used on arbitrarily large data or for an
arbitrarily long calculation.  Consider for example,

     (define (foo n)
       (display n)
       (newline)
       (foo (1+ n)))

     (foo 1)
     ⊣
     1
     2
     3
     ...

   ‘foo’ prints numbers infinitely, starting from the given N.  It’s
implemented by printing N then recursing to itself to print N+1 and so
on.  This recursion is a tail call, it’s the last thing done, and in
Scheme such tail calls can be made without limit.

   Or consider a case where a value is returned, a version of the SRFI-1
‘last’ function (*note* SRFI-1 Selectors::) returning the last element of
a list,

     (define (my-last lst)
       (if (null? (cdr lst))
           (car lst)
           (my-last (cdr lst))))

     (my-last '(1 2 3)) ⇒ 3

   If the list has more than one element, ‘my-last’ applies itself to
the ‘cdr’.  This recursion is a tail call, there’s no code after it, and
the return value is the return value from that call.  In Scheme this can
be used on an arbitrarily long list argument.


   A proper tail call is only available from certain contexts, namely
the following special form positions,

   • ‘and’ — last expression

   • ‘begin’ — last expression

   • ‘case’ — last expression in each clause

   • ‘cond’ — last expression in each clause, and the call to a ‘=>’
     procedure is a tail call

   • ‘do’ — last result expression

   • ‘if’ — “true” and “false” leg expressions

   • ‘lambda’ — last expression in body

   • ‘let’, ‘let*’, ‘letrec’, ‘let-syntax’, ‘letrec-syntax’ — last
     expression in body

   • ‘or’ — last expression

The following core functions make tail calls,

   • ‘apply’ — tail call to given procedure

   • ‘call-with-current-continuation’ — tail call to the procedure
     receiving the new continuation

   • ‘call-with-values’ — tail call to the values-receiving procedure

   • ‘eval’ — tail call to evaluate the form

   • ‘string-any’, ‘string-every’ — tail call to predicate on the last
     character (if that point is reached)


   The above are just core functions and special forms.  Tail calls in
other modules are described with the relevant documentation, for example
SRFI-1 ‘any’ and ‘every’ (*note* SRFI-1 Searching::).

   It will be noted there are a lot of places which could potentially be
tail calls, for instance the last call in a ‘for-each’, but only those
explicitly described are guaranteed.

3.3.3 Using the Guile REPL
--------------------------

If you start Guile without specifying a particular program for it to
execute, Guile enters its standard Read Evaluate Print Loop — or “REPL”
for short.  In this mode, Guile repeatedly reads in the next Scheme
expression that the user types, evaluates it, and prints the resulting
value.

   The REPL is a useful mechanism for exploring the evaluation behaviour
described in the previous subsection.  If you type ‘string-append’, for
example, the REPL replies ‘#<primitive-procedure string-append>’,
illustrating the relationship between the variable ‘string-append’ and
the procedure value stored in that variable.

   In this manual, the notation ⇒ is used to mean “evaluates to”.
Wherever you see an example of the form

     EXPRESSION
     ⇒
     RESULT

feel free to try it out yourself by typing EXPRESSION into the REPL and
checking that it gives the expected RESULT.

3.3.4 Summary of Common Syntax
------------------------------

This subsection lists the most commonly used Scheme syntactic
expressions, simply so that you will recognize common special syntax
when you see it.  For a full description of each of these syntaxes,
follow the appropriate reference.

   ‘lambda’ (*note* Lambda::) is used to construct procedure objects.

   ‘define’ (*note* Top Level::) is used to create a new variable and set
its initial value.

   ‘set!’ (*note* Top Level::) is used to modify an existing variable’s
value.

   ‘let’, ‘let*’ and ‘letrec’ (*note* Local Bindings::) create an inner
lexical environment for the evaluation of a sequence of expressions, in
which a specified set of local variables is bound to the values of a
corresponding set of expressions.  For an introduction to environments,
see *Note* About Closure::.

   ‘begin’ (*note* begin::) executes a sequence of expressions in order
and returns the value of the last expression.  Note that this is not the
same as a procedure which returns its last argument, because the
evaluation of a procedure invocation expression does not guarantee to
evaluate the arguments in order.

   ‘if’ and ‘cond’ (*note* Conditionals::) provide conditional evaluation
of argument expressions depending on whether one or more conditions
evaluate to “true” or “false”.

   ‘case’ (*note* Conditionals::) provides conditional evaluation of
argument expressions depending on whether a variable has one of a
specified group of values.

   ‘and’ (*note* and or::) executes a sequence of expressions in order
until either there are no expressions left, or one of them evaluates to
“false”.

   ‘or’ (*note* and or::) executes a sequence of expressions in order
until either there are no expressions left, or one of them evaluates to
“true”.

3.4 The Concept of Closure
==========================

The concept of “closure” is the idea that a lambda expression “captures”
the variable bindings that are in lexical scope at the point where the
lambda expression occurs.  The procedure created by the lambda
expression can refer to and mutate the captured bindings, and the values
of those bindings persist between procedure calls.

   This section explains and explores the various parts of this idea in

3.4.1 Names, Locations, Values and Environments
-----------------------------------------------

We said earlier that a variable name in a Scheme program is associated
with a location in which any kind of Scheme value may be stored.
(Incidentally, the term “vcell” is often used in Lisp and Scheme circles
as an alternative to “location”.)  Thus part of what we mean when we
talk about “creating a variable” is in fact establishing an association
between a name, or identifier, that is used by the Scheme program code,
and the variable location to which that name refers.  Although the value
that is stored in that location may change, the location to which a
given name refers is always the same.

   We can illustrate this by breaking down the operation of the ‘define’
syntax into three parts: ‘define’

   • creates a new location

   • establishes an association between that location and the name
     specified as the first argument of the ‘define’ expression

   • stores in that location the value obtained by evaluating the second
     argument of the ‘define’ expression.

   A collection of associations between names and locations is called an
“environment”.  When you create a top level variable in a program using
‘define’, the name-location association for that variable is added to
the “top level” environment.  The “top level” environment also includes
name-location associations for all the procedures that are supplied by
standard Scheme.

   It is also possible to create environments other than the top level
one, and to create variable bindings, or name-location associations, in
those environments.  This ability is a key ingredient in the concept of
closure; the next subsection shows how it is done.

3.4.2 Local Variables and Environments
--------------------------------------

We have seen how to create top level variables using the ‘define’ syntax
(*note* Definition::).  It is often useful to create variables that are
more limited in their scope, typically as part of a procedure body.  In
Scheme, this is done using the ‘let’ syntax, or one of its modified
forms ‘let*’ and ‘letrec’.  These syntaxes are described in full later
in the manual (*note* Local Bindings::).  Here our purpose is to
illustrate their use just enough that we can see how local variables
work.

   For example, the following code uses a local variable ‘s’ to simplify
the computation of the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three
sides.

     (define a 5.3)
     (define b 4.7)
     (define c 2.8)

     (define area
       (let ((s (/ (+ a b c) 2)))
         (sqrt (* s (- s a) (- s b) (- s c)))))

   The effect of the ‘let’ expression is to create a new environment
and, within this environment, an association between the name ‘s’ and a
new location whose initial value is obtained by evaluating ‘(/ (+ a b c)
2)’.  The expressions in the body of the ‘let’, namely ‘(sqrt (* s (- s
a) (- s b) (- s c)))’, are then evaluated in the context of the new
environment, and the value of the last expression evaluated becomes the
value of the whole ‘let’ expression, and therefore the value of the
variable ‘area’.


File: guile.info,  Node: Chaining,  Next: Lexical Scope,  Prev: Local Variables,  Up: About Closure

3.4.3 Environment Chaining
--------------------------

In the example of the previous subsection, we glossed over an important
point.  The body of the ‘let’ expression in that example refers not only
to the local variable ‘s’, but also to the top level variables ‘a’, ‘b’,
‘c’ and ‘sqrt’.  (‘sqrt’ is the standard Scheme procedure for
calculating a square root.)  If the body of the ‘let’ expression is
evaluated in the context of the _local_ ‘let’ environment, how does the
evaluation get at the values of these top level variables?

   The answer is that the local environment created by a ‘let’
expression automatically has a reference to its containing environment —
in this case the top level environment — and that the Scheme interpreter
automatically looks for a variable binding in the containing environment
if it doesn’t find one in the local environment.  More generally, every
environment except for the top level one has a reference to its
containing environment, and the interpreter keeps searching back up the
chain of environments — from most local to top level — until it either
finds a variable binding for the required identifier or exhausts the
chain.

   This description also determines what happens when there is more than
one variable binding with the same name.  Suppose, continuing the
example of the previous subsection, that there was also a pre-existing
top level variable ‘s’ created by the expression:

     (define s "Some beans, my lord!")

   Then both the top level environment and the local ‘let’ environment
would contain bindings for the name ‘s’.  When evaluating code within
the ‘let’ body, the interpreter looks first in the local ‘let’
environment, and so finds the binding for ‘s’ created by the ‘let’
syntax.  Even though this environment has a reference to the top level
environment, which also has a binding for ‘s’, the interpreter doesn’t
get as far as looking there.  When evaluating code outside the ‘let’
body, the interpreter looks up variable names in the top level
environment, so the name ‘s’ refers to the top level variable.

   Within the ‘let’ body, the binding for ‘s’ in the local environment
is said to “shadow” the binding for ‘s’ in the top level environment.

3.4.4 Lexical Scope
-------------------

The rules that we have just been describing are the details of how
Scheme implements “lexical scoping”.  This subsection takes a brief
diversion to explain what lexical scope means in general and to present
an example of non-lexical scoping.

   “Lexical scope” in general is the idea that

   • an identifier at a particular place in a program always refers to
     the same variable location — where “always” means “every time that
     the containing expression is executed”, and that

   • the variable location to which it refers can be determined by
     static examination of the source code context in which that
     identifier appears, without having to consider the flow of
     execution through the program as a whole.

   In practice, lexical scoping is the norm for most programming
languages, and probably corresponds to what you would intuitively
consider to be “normal”.  You may even be wondering how the situation
could possibly — and usefully — be otherwise.  To demonstrate that
another kind of scoping is possible, therefore, and to compare it
against lexical scoping, the following subsection presents an example of
non-lexical scoping and examines in detail how its behavior differs from
the corresponding lexically scoped code.

* Menu:

* Scoping Example::             An example of non-lexical scoping.


File: guile.info,  Node: Scoping Example,  Up: Lexical Scope

### 3.4.4.1 An Example of Non-Lexical Scoping
.........................................

To demonstrate that non-lexical scoping does exist and can be useful, we
present the following example from Emacs Lisp, which is a “dynamically
scoped” language.

     (defvar currency-abbreviation "USD")

     (defun currency-string (units hundredths)
       (concat currency-abbreviation
               (number-to-string units)
               "."
               (number-to-string hundredths)))

     (defun french-currency-string (units hundredths)
       (let ((currency-abbreviation "FRF"))
         (currency-string units hundredths)))

   The question to focus on here is: what does the identifier
‘currency-abbreviation’ refer to in the ‘currency-string’ function?  The
answer, in Emacs Lisp, is that all variable bindings go onto a single
stack, and that ‘currency-abbreviation’ refers to the topmost binding
from that stack which has the name “currency-abbreviation”.  The binding
that is created by the ‘defvar’ form, to the value ‘"USD"’, is only
relevant if none of the code that calls ‘currency-string’ rebinds the
name “currency-abbreviation” in the meanwhile.

   The second function ‘french-currency-string’ works precisely by
taking advantage of this behaviour.  It creates a new binding for the
name “currency-abbreviation” which overrides the one established by the
‘defvar’ form.

     ;; Note!  This is Emacs Lisp evaluation, not Scheme!
     (french-currency-string 33 44)
     ⇒
     "FRF33.44"

   Now let’s look at the corresponding, _lexically scoped_ Scheme code:

     (define currency-abbreviation "USD")

     (define (currency-string units hundredths)
       (string-append currency-abbreviation
                      (number->string units)
                      "."
                      (number->string hundredths)))

     (define (french-currency-string units hundredths)
       (let ((currency-abbreviation "FRF"))
         (currency-string units hundredths)))

   According to the rules of lexical scoping, the
‘currency-abbreviation’ in ‘currency-string’ refers to the variable
location in the innermost environment at that point in the code which
has a binding for ‘currency-abbreviation’, which is the variable
location in the top level environment created by the preceding ‘(define
currency-abbreviation ...)’ expression.

   In Scheme, therefore, the ‘french-currency-string’ procedure does not
work as intended.  The variable binding that it creates for
“currency-abbreviation” is purely local to the code that forms the body
of the ‘let’ expression.  Since this code doesn’t directly use the name
“currency-abbreviation” at all, the binding is pointless.

     (french-currency-string 33 44)
     ⇒
     "USD33.44"

   This begs the question of how the Emacs Lisp behaviour can be
implemented in Scheme.  In general, this is a design question whose
answer depends upon the problem that is being addressed.  In this case,
the best answer may be that ‘currency-string’ should be redesigned so
that it can take an optional third argument.  This third argument, if
supplied, is interpreted as a currency abbreviation that overrides the
default.

   It is possible to change ‘french-currency-string’ so that it mostly
works without changing ‘currency-string’, but the fix is inelegant, and
susceptible to interrupts that could leave the ‘currency-abbreviation’
variable in the wrong state:

     (define (french-currency-string units hundredths)
       (set! currency-abbreviation "FRF")
       (let ((result (currency-string units hundredths)))
         (set! currency-abbreviation "USD")
         result))

   The key point here is that the code does not create any local binding
for the identifier ‘currency-abbreviation’, so all occurrences of this
identifier refer to the top level variable.

3.4.5 Closure
-------------

Consider a ‘let’ expression that doesn’t contain any ‘lambda’s:

     (let ((s (/ (+ a b c) 2)))
       (sqrt (* s (- s a) (- s b) (- s c))))

When the Scheme interpreter evaluates this, it

   • creates a new environment with a reference to the environment that
     was current when it encountered the ‘let’

   • creates a variable binding for ‘s’ in the new environment, with
     value given by ‘(/ (+ a b c) 2)’

   • evaluates the expression in the body of the ‘let’ in the context of
     the new local environment, and remembers the value ‘V’

   • forgets the local environment

   • continues evaluating the expression that contained the ‘let’, using
     the value ‘V’ as the value of the ‘let’ expression, in the context
     of the containing environment.

   After the ‘let’ expression has been evaluated, the local environment
that was created is simply forgotten, and there is no longer any way to
access the binding that was created in this environment.  If the same
code is evaluated again, it will follow the same steps again, creating a
second new local environment that has no connection with the first, and
then forgetting this one as well.

   If the ‘let’ body contains a ‘lambda’ expression, however, the local
environment is _not_ forgotten.  Instead, it becomes associated with the
procedure that is created by the ‘lambda’ expression, and is reinstated
every time that that procedure is called.  In detail, this works as
follows.

   • When the Scheme interpreter evaluates a ‘lambda’ expression, to
     create a procedure object, it stores the current environment as
     part of the procedure definition.

   • Then, whenever that procedure is called, the interpreter reinstates
     the environment that is stored in the procedure definition and
     evaluates the procedure body within the context of that
     environment.

   The result is that the procedure body is always evaluated in the
context of the environment that was current when the procedure was
created.

   This is what is meant by “closure”.  The next few subsections present
examples that explore the usefulness of this concept.


File: guile.info,  Node: Serial Number,  Next: Shared Variable,  Prev: Closure,  Up: About Closure

3.4.6 Example 1: A Serial Number Generator
------------------------------------------

This example uses closure to create a procedure with a variable binding
that is private to the procedure, like a local variable, but whose value
persists between procedure calls.

     (define (make-serial-number-generator)
       (let ((current-serial-number 0))
         (lambda ()
           (set! current-serial-number (+ current-serial-number 1))
           current-serial-number)))

     (define entry-sn-generator (make-serial-number-generator))

     (entry-sn-generator)
     ⇒
     1

     (entry-sn-generator)
     ⇒
     2

   When ‘make-serial-number-generator’ is called, it creates a local
environment with a binding for ‘current-serial-number’ whose initial
value is 0, then, within this environment, creates a procedure.  The
local environment is stored within the created procedure object and so
persists for the lifetime of the created procedure.

   Every time the created procedure is invoked, it increments the value
of the ‘current-serial-number’ binding in the captured environment and
then returns the current value.

   Note that ‘make-serial-number-generator’ can be called again to
create a second serial number generator that is independent of the
first.  Every new invocation of ‘make-serial-number-generator’ creates a
new local ‘let’ environment and returns a new procedure object with an
association to this environment.


File: guile.info,  Node: Shared Variable,  Next: Callback Closure,  Prev: Serial Number,  Up: About Closure

3.4.7 Example 2: A Shared Persistent Variable
---------------------------------------------

This example uses closure to create two procedures, ‘get-balance’ and
‘deposit’, that both refer to the same captured local environment so
that they can both access the ‘balance’ variable binding inside that
environment.  The value of this variable binding persists between calls
to either procedure.

   Note that the captured ‘balance’ variable binding is private to these
two procedures: it is not directly accessible to any other code.  It can
only be accessed indirectly via ‘get-balance’ or ‘deposit’, as
illustrated by the ‘withdraw’ procedure.

     (define get-balance #f)
     (define deposit #f)

     (let ((balance 0))
       (set! get-balance
             (lambda ()
               balance))
       (set! deposit
             (lambda (amount)
               (set! balance (+ balance amount))
               balance)))

     (define (withdraw amount)
       (deposit (- amount)))

     (get-balance)
     ⇒
     0

     (deposit 50)
     ⇒
     50

     (withdraw 75)
     ⇒
     -25

   An important detail here is that the ‘get-balance’ and ‘deposit’
variables must be set up by ‘define’ing them at top level and then
‘set!’ing their values inside the ‘let’ body.  Using ‘define’ within the
‘let’ body would not work: this would create variable bindings within
the local ‘let’ environment that would not be accessible at top level.


File: guile.info,  Node: Callback Closure,  Next: OO Closure,  Prev: Shared Variable,  Up: About Closure

3.4.8 Example 3: The Callback Closure Problem
---------------------------------------------

A frequently used programming model for library code is to allow an
application to register a callback function for the library to call when
some particular event occurs.  It is often useful for the application to
make several such registrations using the same callback function, for
example if several similar library events can be handled using the same
application code, but the need then arises to distinguish the callback
function calls that are associated with one callback registration from
those that are associated with different callback registrations.

   In languages without the ability to create functions dynamically,
this problem is usually solved by passing a ‘user_data’ parameter on the
registration call, and including the value of this parameter as one of
the parameters on the callback function.  Here is an example of
declarations using this solution in C:

     typedef void (event_handler_t) (int event_type,
                                     void *user_data);

     void register_callback (int event_type,
                             event_handler_t *handler,
                             void *user_data);

   In Scheme, closure can be used to achieve the same functionality
without requiring the library code to store a ‘user-data’ for each
callback registration.

     ;; In the library:

     (define (register-callback event-type handler-proc)
       ...)

     ;; In the application:

     (define (make-handler event-type user-data)
       (lambda ()
         ...
         <code referencing event-type and user-data>
         ...))

     (register-callback event-type
                        (make-handler event-type ...))

   As far as the library is concerned, ‘handler-proc’ is a procedure
with no arguments, and all the library has to do is call it when the
appropriate event occurs.  From the application’s point of view, though,
the handler procedure has used closure to capture an environment that
includes all the context that the handler code needs — ‘event-type’ and
‘user-data’ — to handle the event correctly.

3.4.9 Example 4: Object Orientation
-----------------------------------

Closure is the capture of an environment, containing persistent variable
bindings, within the definition of a procedure or a set of related
procedures.  This is rather similar to the idea in some object oriented
languages of encapsulating a set of related data variables inside an
“object”, together with a set of “methods” that operate on the
encapsulated data.  The following example shows how closure can be used
to emulate the ideas of objects, methods and encapsulation in Scheme.

     (define (make-account)
       (let ((balance 0))
         (define (get-balance)
           balance)
         (define (deposit amount)
           (set! balance (+ balance amount))
           balance)
         (define (withdraw amount)
           (deposit (- amount)))

         (lambda args
           (apply
             (case (car args)
               ((get-balance) get-balance)
               ((deposit) deposit)
               ((withdraw) withdraw)
               (else (error "Invalid method!")))
             (cdr args)))))

   Each call to ‘make-account’ creates and returns a new procedure,
created by the expression in the example code that begins “(lambda
args”.

     (define my-account (make-account))

     my-account
     ⇒
     #<procedure args>

   This procedure acts as an account object with methods ‘get-balance’,
‘deposit’ and ‘withdraw’.  To apply one of the methods to the account,
you call the procedure with a symbol indicating the required method as
the first parameter, followed by any other parameters that are required
by that method.

     (my-account 'get-balance)
     ⇒
     0

     (my-account 'withdraw 5)
     ⇒
     -5

     (my-account 'deposit 396)
     ⇒
     391

     (my-account 'get-balance)
     ⇒
     391

   Note how, in this example, both the current balance and the helper
procedures ‘get-balance’, ‘deposit’ and ‘withdraw’, used to implement
the guts of the account object’s methods, are all stored in variable
bindings within the private local environment captured by the ‘lambda’
expression that creates the account object procedure.

4.1 Guile’s Implementation of Scheme
====================================

Guile’s core language is Scheme, which is specified and described in the
series of reports known as “RnRS”. “RnRS” is shorthand for the
“Revised^n Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme”.  Guile complies
fully with R5RS (*note* Introduction: (r5rs)Top.), and is largely
compliant with R6RS and R7RS.

   Guile also has many extensions that go beyond these reports.  Some of
the areas where Guile extends standard Scheme are:

   • Guile’s interactive documentation system

   • Guile’s support for POSIX-compliant network programming

   • GOOPS – Guile’s framework for object oriented programming.

4.2 Invoking Guile
==================

Many features of Guile depend on and can be changed by information that
the user provides either before or when Guile is started.  Below is a
description of what information to provide and how to provide it.

* Command-line Options::        Command-line options understood by Guile.
* Environment Variables::       Variables that affect Guile’s behavior.


File: guile.info,  Node: Command-line Options,  Next: Environment Variables,  Up: Invoking Guile

4.2.1 Command-line Options
--------------------------

Here we describe Guile’s command-line processing in detail.  Guile
processes its arguments from left to right, recognizing the switches
described below.  For examples, see *note* Scripting Examples::.

‘SCRIPT ARG...’
‘-s SCRIPT ARG...’
     By default, Guile will read a file named on the command line as a
     script.  Any command-line arguments ARG... following SCRIPT become
     the script’s arguments; the ‘command-line’ function returns a list
     of strings of the form ‘(SCRIPT ARG...)’.

     It is possible to name a file using a leading hyphen, for example,
     ‘-myfile.scm’.  In this case, the file name must be preceded by
     ‘-s’ to tell Guile that a (script) file is being named.

     Scripts are read and evaluated as Scheme source code just as the
     ‘load’ function would.  After loading SCRIPT, Guile exits.

‘-c EXPR ARG...’
     Evaluate EXPR as Scheme code, and then exit.  Any command-line
     arguments ARG... following EXPR become command-line arguments; the
     ‘command-line’ function returns a list of strings of the form
     ‘(GUILE ARG...)’, where GUILE is the path of the Guile executable.

‘-- ARG...’
     Run interactively, prompting the user for expressions and
     evaluating them.  Any command-line arguments ARG... following the
     ‘--’ become command-line arguments for the interactive session; the
     ‘command-line’ function returns a list of strings of the form
     ‘(GUILE ARG...)’, where GUILE is the path of the Guile executable.

‘-L DIRECTORY’
     Add DIRECTORY to the front of Guile’s module load path.  The given
     directories are searched in the order given on the command line and
     before any directories in the ‘GUILE_LOAD_PATH’ environment
     variable.  Paths added here are _not_ in effect during execution of
     the user’s ‘.guile’ file.

‘-C DIRECTORY’
     Like ‘-L’, but adjusts the load path for _compiled_ files.

‘-x EXTENSION’
     Add EXTENSION to the front of Guile’s load extension list (*note*
     ‘%load-extensions’: Load Paths.).  The specified extensions are
     tried in the order given on the command line, and before the
     default load extensions.  Extensions added here are _not_ in effect
     during execution of the user’s ‘.guile’ file.

‘-l FILE’
     Load Scheme source code from FILE, and continue processing the
     command line.

‘-e FUNCTION’
     Make FUNCTION the “entry point” of the script.  After loading the
     script file (with ‘-s’) or evaluating the expression (with ‘-c’),
     apply FUNCTION to a list containing the program name and the
     command-line arguments—the list provided by the ‘command-line’
     function.

     A ‘-e’ switch can appear anywhere in the argument list, but Guile
     always invokes the FUNCTION as the _last_ action it performs.  This
     is weird, but because of the way script invocation works under
     POSIX, the ‘-s’ option must always come last in the list.

     The FUNCTION is most often a simple symbol that names a function
     that is defined in the script.  It can also be of the form ‘(@
     MODULE-NAME SYMBOL)’, and in that case, the symbol is looked up in
     the module named MODULE-NAME.

     As a shorthand you can use the form ‘(symbol ...)’, that is, a list
     of only symbols that doesn’t start with ‘@’.  It is equivalent to
     ‘(@ MODULE-NAME main)’, where MODULE-NAME is ‘(symbol ...)’ form.
     *Note* Using Guile Modules:: and *note* Scripting Examples::.

‘-ds’
     Treat a final ‘-s’ option as if it occurred at this point in the
     command line; load the script here.

     This switch is necessary because, although the POSIX script
     invocation mechanism effectively requires the ‘-s’ option to appear
     last, the programmer may well want to run the script before other
     actions requested on the command line.  For examples, see *note*
     Scripting Examples::.

‘\’
     Read more command-line arguments, starting from the second line of
     the script file.  *Note* The Meta Switch::.

‘--use-srfi=LIST’
     The option ‘--use-srfi’ expects a comma-separated list of numbers,
     each representing a SRFI module to be loaded into the interpreter
     before evaluating a script file or starting the REPL. Additionally,
     the feature identifier for the loaded SRFIs is recognized by the
     procedure ‘cond-expand’ when this option is used.

     Here is an example that loads the modules SRFI-8 (’receive’) and
     SRFI-13 (’string library’) before the GUILE interpreter is started:

          guile --use-srfi=8,13

‘--r6rs’
     Adapt Guile’s initial environment to better support R6RS. *Note*
     R6RS Incompatibilities::, for some caveats.

‘--r7rs’
     Adapt Guile’s initial environment to better support R7RS. *Note*
     R7RS Incompatibilities::, for some caveats.

‘--debug’
     Start with the debugging virtual machine (VM) engine.  Using the
     debugging VM will enable support for VM hooks, which are needed for
     tracing, breakpoints, and accurate call counts when profiling.  The
     debugging VM is slower than the regular VM, though, by about ten
     percent.  *Note* VM Hooks::, for more information.

     By default, the debugging VM engine is only used when entering an
     interactive session.  When executing a script with ‘-s’ or ‘-c’,
     the normal, faster VM is used by default.

‘--no-debug’
     Do not use the debugging VM engine, even when entering an
     interactive session.

     Note that, despite the name, Guile running with ‘--no-debug’ _does_
     support the usual debugging facilities, such as printing a detailed
     backtrace upon error.  The only difference with ‘--debug’ is lack
     of support for VM hooks and the facilities that build upon it (see
     above).

‘-q’
     Do not load the initialization file, ‘.guile’.  This option only
     has an effect when running interactively; running scripts does not
     load the ‘.guile’ file.  *Note* Init File::.

‘--listen[=P]’
     While this program runs, listen on a local port or a path for REPL
     clients.  If P starts with a number, it is assumed to be a local
     port on which to listen.  If it starts with a forward slash, it is
     assumed to be the file name of a UNIX domain socket on which to
     listen.

     If P is not given, the default is local port 37146.  If you look at
     it upside down, it almost spells “Guile”.  If you have netcat
     installed, you should be able to ‘nc localhost 37146’ and get a
     Guile prompt.  Alternately you can fire up Emacs and connect to the
     process; see *note* Using Guile in Emacs:: for more details.

          Note: Opening a port allows anyone who can connect to that
          port to do anything Guile can do, as the user that the Guile
          process is running as.  Do not use ‘--listen’ on multi-user
          machines.  Of course, if you do not pass ‘--listen’ to Guile,
          no port will be opened.

          Guile protects against the “HTTP inter-protocol exploitation
          attack”
          (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-protocol_exploitation), a
          scenario whereby an attacker can, via an HTML page, cause a
          web browser to send data to TCP servers listening on a
          loopback interface or private network.  Nevertheless, you are
          advised to use UNIX domain sockets, as in
          ‘--listen=/some/local/file’, whenever possible.

     That said, ‘--listen’ is great for interactive debugging and
     development.

‘--auto-compile’
     Compile source files automatically (default behavior).

‘--fresh-auto-compile’
     Treat the auto-compilation cache as invalid, forcing recompilation.

‘--no-auto-compile’
     Disable automatic source file compilation.

‘--language=LANG’
     For the remainder of the command line arguments, assume that files
     mentioned with ‘-l’ and expressions passed with ‘-c’ are written in
     LANG.  LANG must be the name of one of the languages supported by
     the compiler (*note* Compiler Tower::).  When run interactively, set
     the REPL’s language to LANG (*note* Using Guile Interactively::).

     The default language is ‘scheme’; other interesting values include
     ‘elisp’ (for Emacs Lisp), and ‘ecmascript’.

     The example below shows the evaluation of expressions in Scheme,
     Emacs Lisp, and ECMAScript:

          guile -c "(apply + '(1 2))"
          guile --language=elisp -c "(= (funcall (symbol-function '+) 1 2) 3)"
          guile --language=ecmascript -c '(function (x) { return x * x; })(2);'

     To load a file written in Scheme and one written in Emacs Lisp, and
     then start a Scheme REPL, type:

          guile -l foo.scm --language=elisp -l foo.el --language=scheme

‘-h, --help’
     Display help on invoking Guile, and then exit.

‘-v, --version’
     Display the current version of Guile, and then exit.

4.2.2 Environment Variables
---------------------------

The “environment” is a feature of the operating system; it consists of a
collection of variables with names and values.  Each variable is called
an “environment variable” (or, sometimes, a “shell variable”);
environment variable names are case-sensitive, and it is conventional to
use upper-case letters only.  The values are all text strings, even
those that are written as numerals.  (Note that here we are referring to
names and values that are defined in the operating system shell from
which Guile is invoked.  This is not the same as a Scheme environment
that is defined within a running instance of Guile.  For a description
of Scheme environments, *note* About Environments::.)

   How to set environment variables before starting Guile depends on the
operating system and, especially, the shell that you are using.  For
example, here is how to tell Guile to provide detailed warning messages
about deprecated features by setting ‘GUILE_WARN_DEPRECATED’ using Bash:

     $ export GUILE_WARN_DEPRECATED="detailed"
     $ guile

Or, detailed warnings can be turned on for a single invocation using:

     $ env GUILE_WARN_DEPRECATED="detailed" guile

   If you wish to retrieve or change the value of the shell environment
variables that affect the run-time behavior of Guile from within a
running instance of Guile, see *note* Runtime Environment::.

   Here are the environment variables that affect the run-time behavior
of Guile:

‘GUILE_AUTO_COMPILE’
     This is a flag that can be used to tell Guile whether or not to
     compile Scheme source files automatically.  Starting with Guile
     2.0, Scheme source files will be compiled automatically, by
     default.

     If a compiled (‘.go’) file corresponding to a ‘.scm’ file is not
     found or is not newer than the ‘.scm’ file, the ‘.scm’ file will be
     compiled on the fly, and the resulting ‘.go’ file stored away.  An
     advisory note will be printed on the console.

     Compiled files will be stored in the directory
     ‘$XDG_CACHE_HOME/guile/ccache’, where ‘XDG_CACHE_HOME’ defaults to
     the directory ‘$HOME/.cache’.  This directory will be created if it
     does not already exist.

     Note that this mechanism depends on the timestamp of the ‘.go’ file
     being newer than that of the ‘.scm’ file; if the ‘.scm’ or ‘.go’
     files are moved after installation, care should be taken to
     preserve their original timestamps.

     Set ‘GUILE_AUTO_COMPILE’ to zero (0), to prevent Scheme files from
     being compiled automatically.  Set this variable to “fresh” to tell
     Guile to compile Scheme files whether they are newer than the
     compiled files or not.

     *Note* Compilation::.

‘GUILE_HISTORY’
     This variable names the file that holds the Guile REPL command
     history.  You can specify a different history file by setting this
     environment variable.  By default, the history file is
     ‘$HOME/.guile_history’.

‘GUILE_INSTALL_LOCALE’
     This is a flag that can be used to tell Guile whether or not to
     install the current locale at startup, via a call to ‘(setlocale
     LC_ALL "")’(1).  *Note* Locales::, for more information on locales.

     You may explicitly indicate that you do not want to install the
     locale by setting ‘GUILE_INSTALL_LOCALE’ to ‘0’, or explicitly
     enable it by setting the variable to ‘1’.

     Usually, installing the current locale is the right thing to do.
     It allows Guile to correctly parse and print strings with non-ASCII
     characters.  Therefore, this option is on by default.

‘GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH’
     This variable may be used to augment the path that is searched for
     compiled Scheme files (‘.go’ files) when loading.  Its value should
     be a colon-separated list of directories.  If it contains the
     special path component ‘...’ (ellipsis), then the default path is
     put in place of the ellipsis, otherwise the default path is placed
     at the end.  The result is stored in ‘%load-compiled-path’ (*note*
     Load Paths::).

     Here is an example using the Bash shell that adds the current
     directory, ‘.’, and the relative directory ‘../my-library’ to
     ‘%load-compiled-path’:

          $ export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=".:../my-library"
          $ guile -c '(display %load-compiled-path) (newline)'
          (. ../my-library /usr/local/lib/guile/3.0/ccache)

‘GUILE_LOAD_PATH’
     This variable may be used to augment the path that is searched for
     Scheme files when loading.  Its value should be a colon-separated
     list of directories.  If it contains the special path component
     ‘...’ (ellipsis), then the default path is put in place of the
     ellipsis, otherwise the default path is placed at the end.  The
     result is stored in ‘%load-path’ (*note* Load Paths::).

     Here is an example using the Bash shell that prepends the current
     directory to ‘%load-path’, and adds the relative directory
     ‘../srfi’ to the end:

          $ env GUILE_LOAD_PATH=".:...:../srfi" \
          guile -c '(display %load-path) (newline)'
          (. /usr/local/share/guile/3.0 \
          /usr/local/share/guile/site/3.0 \
          /usr/local/share/guile/site \
          /usr/local/share/guile \
          ../srfi)

     (Note: The line breaks, above, are for documentation purposes only,
     and not required in the actual example.)

‘GUILE_EXTENSIONS_PATH’
     This variable may be used to augment the path that is searched for
     foreign libraries via ‘load-extension’, ‘dynamic-link’,
     ‘load-foreign-library’, or the like.  Its value should be a
     colon-separated (semicolon on Windows) list of directories.  *Note*
     Foreign Libraries::.

‘GUILE_WARN_DEPRECATED’
     As Guile evolves, some features will be eliminated or replaced by
     newer features.  To help users migrate their code as this evolution
     occurs, Guile will issue warning messages about code that uses
     features that have been marked for eventual elimination.
     ‘GUILE_WARN_DEPRECATED’ can be set to “no” to tell Guile not to
     display these warning messages, or set to “detailed” to tell Guile
     to display more lengthy messages describing the warning.  *Note*
     Deprecation::.

‘HOME’
     Guile uses the environment variable ‘HOME’, the name of your home
     directory, to locate various files, such as ‘.guile’ or
     ‘.guile_history’.

‘GUILE_JIT_THRESHOLD’
     Guile has a just-in-time (JIT) code generator that makes running
     Guile code fast.  *Note* Just-In-Time Native Code::, for more.  The
     unit of code generation is the function.  Each function has its own
     counter that gets incremented when the function is called and at
     each loop iteration in the function.  When the counter exceeds the
     ‘GUILE_JIT_THRESHOLD’, the function will get JIT-compiled.  Set
     ‘GUILE_JIT_THRESHOLD’ to ‘-1’ to disable JIT compilation, or ‘0’ to
     eagerly JIT-compile each function as it’s first seen.

‘GUILE_JIT_LOG’
     Set to ‘1’, ‘2’, or ‘3’ to give increasing amounts of logging for
     JIT compilation events.  Used for debugging.

‘GUILE_JIT_STOP_AFTER’
     Though we have tested the JIT compiler as well as we can, it’s
     possible that it has bugs.  If you suspect that Guile’s JIT
     compiler is causing your program to fail, set
     ‘GUILE_JIT_STOP_AFTER’ to a positive integer indicating the maximum
     number of functions to JIT-compile.  By bisecting over the value of
     ‘GUILE_JIT_STOP_AFTER’, you can pinpoint the precise function that
     is being miscompiled.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The ‘GUILE_INSTALL_LOCALE’ environment variable was ignored in
Guile versions prior to 2.0.9.

4.3 Guile Scripting
===================

Like AWK, Perl, or any shell, Guile can interpret script files.  A Guile
script is simply a file of Scheme code with some extra information at
the beginning which tells the operating system how to invoke Guile, and
then tells Guile how to handle the Scheme code.

* Menu:

* The Top of a Script File::    How to start a Guile script.
* The Meta Switch::             Passing complex argument lists to Guile
                                from shell scripts.

* Scripting Examples::


File: guile.info,  Node: The Top of a Script File,  Next: The Meta Switch,  Up: Guile Scripting

4.3.1 The Top of a Script File
------------------------------

The first line of a Guile script must tell the operating system to use
Guile to evaluate the script, and then tell Guile how to go about doing
that.  Here is the simplest case:

   • The first two characters of the file must be ‘#!’.

     The operating system interprets this to mean that the rest of the
     line is the name of an executable that can interpret the script.
     Guile, however, interprets these characters as the beginning of a
     multi-line comment, terminated by the characters ‘!#’ on a line by
     themselves.  (This is an extension to the syntax described in R5RS,
     added to support shell scripts.)

   • Immediately after those two characters must come the full pathname
     to the Guile interpreter.  On most systems, this would be
     ‘/usr/local/bin/guile’.

   • Then must come a space, followed by a command-line argument to pass
     to Guile; this should be ‘-s’.  This switch tells Guile to run a
     script, instead of soliciting the user for input from the terminal.
     There are more elaborate things one can do here; see *note* The Meta
     Switch::.

   • Follow this with a newline.

   • The second line of the script should contain only the characters
     ‘!#’ — just like the top of the file, but reversed.  The operating
     system never reads this far, but Guile treats this as the end of
     the comment begun on the first line by the ‘#!’ characters.

   • If this source code file is not ASCII or ISO-8859-1 encoded, a
     coding declaration such as ‘coding: utf-8’ should appear in a
     comment somewhere in the first five lines of the file: see *note*
     Character Encoding of Source Files::.

   • The rest of the file should be a Scheme program.

   Guile reads the program, evaluating expressions in the order that
they appear.  Upon reaching the end of the file, Guile exits.


File: guile.info,  Node: The Meta Switch,  Next: Command Line Handling,  Prev: The Top of a Script File,  Up: Guile Scripting

4.3.2 The Meta Switch
---------------------

Guile’s command-line switches allow the programmer to describe
reasonably complicated actions in scripts.  Unfortunately, the POSIX
script invocation mechanism only allows one argument to appear on the
‘#!’ line after the path to the Guile executable, and imposes arbitrary
limits on that argument’s length.  Suppose you wrote a script starting
like this:
     #!/usr/local/bin/guile -e main -s
     !#
     (define (main args)
       (map (lambda (arg) (display arg) (display " "))
            (cdr args))
       (newline))
   The intended meaning is clear: load the file, and then call ‘main’ on
the command-line arguments.  However, the system will treat everything
after the Guile path as a single argument — the string ‘"-e main -s"’ —
which is not what we want.

   As a workaround, the meta switch ‘\’ allows the Guile programmer to
specify an arbitrary number of options without patching the kernel.  If
the first argument to Guile is ‘\’, Guile will open the script file
whose name follows the ‘\’, parse arguments starting from the file’s
second line (according to rules described below), and substitute them
for the ‘\’ switch.

   Working in concert with the meta switch, Guile treats the characters
‘#!’ as the beginning of a comment which extends through the next line
containing only the characters ‘!#’.  This sort of comment may appear
anywhere in a Guile program, but it is most useful at the top of a file,
meshing magically with the POSIX script invocation mechanism.

   Thus, consider a script named ‘/u/jimb/ekko’ which starts like this:
     #!/usr/local/bin/guile \
     -e main -s
     !#
     (define (main args)
             (map (lambda (arg) (display arg) (display " "))
                  (cdr args))
             (newline))

   Suppose a user invokes this script as follows:
     $ /u/jimb/ekko a b c

   Here’s what happens:

   • the operating system recognizes the ‘#!’ token at the top of the
     file, and rewrites the command line to:
          /usr/local/bin/guile \ /u/jimb/ekko a b c
     This is the usual behavior, prescribed by POSIX.

   • When Guile sees the first two arguments, ‘\ /u/jimb/ekko’, it opens
     ‘/u/jimb/ekko’, parses the three arguments ‘-e’, ‘main’, and ‘-s’
     from it, and substitutes them for the ‘\’ switch.  Thus, Guile’s
     command line now reads:
          /usr/local/bin/guile -e main -s /u/jimb/ekko a b c

   • Guile then processes these switches: it loads ‘/u/jimb/ekko’ as a
     file of Scheme code (treating the first three lines as a comment),
     and then performs the application ‘(main "/u/jimb/ekko" "a" "b"
     "c")’.

   When Guile sees the meta switch ‘\’, it parses command-line argument
from the script file according to the following rules:

   • Each space character terminates an argument.  This means that two
     spaces in a row introduce an argument ‘""’.

   • The tab character is not permitted (unless you quote it with the
     backslash character, as described below), to avoid confusion.

   • The newline character terminates the sequence of arguments, and
     will also terminate a final non-empty argument.  (However, a
     newline following a space will not introduce a final empty-string
     argument; it only terminates the argument list.)

   • The backslash character is the escape character.  It escapes
     backslash, space, tab, and newline.  The ANSI C escape sequences
     like ‘\n’ and ‘\t’ are also supported.  These produce argument
     constituents; the two-character combination ‘\n’ doesn’t act like a
     terminating newline.  The escape sequence ‘\NNN’ for exactly three
     octal digits reads as the character whose ASCII code is NNN.  As
     above, characters produced this way are argument constituents.
     Backslash followed by other characters is not allowed.

4.3.3 Command Line Handling
---------------------------

The ability to accept and handle command line arguments is very
important when writing Guile scripts to solve particular problems, such
as extracting information from text files or interfacing with existing
command line applications.  This chapter describes how Guile makes
command line arguments available to a Guile script, and the utilities
that Guile provides to help with the processing of command line
arguments.

   When a Guile script is invoked, Guile makes the command line
arguments accessible via the procedure ‘command-line’, which returns the
arguments as a list of strings.

   For example, if the script

     #! /usr/local/bin/guile -s
     !#
     (write (command-line))
     (newline)

is saved in a file ‘cmdline-test.scm’ and invoked using the command line
‘./cmdline-test.scm bar.txt -o foo -frumple grob’, the output is

     ("./cmdline-test.scm" "bar.txt" "-o" "foo" "-frumple" "grob")

   If the script invocation includes a ‘-e’ option, specifying a
procedure to call after loading the script, Guile will call that
procedure with ‘(command-line)’ as its argument.  So a script that uses
‘-e’ doesn’t need to refer explicitly to ‘command-line’ in its code.
For example, the script above would have identical behaviour if it was
written instead like this:

     #! /usr/local/bin/guile \
     -e main -s
     !#
     (define (main args)
       (write args)
       (newline))

   (Note the use of the meta switch ‘\’ so that the script invocation
can include more than one Guile option: *Note* The Meta Switch::.)

   These scripts use the ‘#!’ POSIX convention so that they can be
executed using their own file names directly, as in the example command
line ‘./cmdline-test.scm bar.txt -o foo -frumple grob’.  But they can
also be executed by typing out the implied Guile command line in full,
as in:

     $ guile -s ./cmdline-test.scm bar.txt -o foo -frumple grob

or

     $ guile -e main -s ./cmdline-test2.scm bar.txt -o foo -frumple grob

   Even when a script is invoked using this longer form, the arguments
that the script receives are the same as if it had been invoked using
the short form.  Guile ensures that the ‘(command-line)’ or ‘-e’
arguments are independent of how the script is invoked, by stripping off
the arguments that Guile itself processes.

   A script is free to parse and handle its command line arguments in
any way that it chooses.  Where the set of possible options and
arguments is complex, however, it can get tricky to extract all the
options, check the validity of given arguments, and so on.  This task
can be greatly simplified by taking advantage of the module ‘(ice-9
getopt-long)’, which is distributed with Guile, *Note* getopt-long::.

4.3.4 Scripting Examples
------------------------

To start with, here are some examples of invoking Guile directly:

‘guile -- a b c’
     Run Guile interactively; ‘(command-line)’ will return
     ‘("/usr/local/bin/guile" "a" "b" "c")’.

‘guile -s /u/jimb/ex2 a b c’
     Load the file ‘/u/jimb/ex2’; ‘(command-line)’ will return
     ‘("/u/jimb/ex2" "a" "b" "c")’.

‘guile -c '(write %load-path) (newline)'’
     Write the value of the variable ‘%load-path’, print a newline, and
     exit.

‘guile -e main -s /u/jimb/ex4 foo’
     Load the file ‘/u/jimb/ex4’, and then call the function ‘main’,
     passing it the list ‘("/u/jimb/ex4" "foo")’.

‘guile -e '(ex4)' -s /u/jimb/ex4.scm foo’
     Load the file ‘/u/jimb/ex4.scm’, and then call the function ‘main’
     from the module ’(ex4)’, passing it the list ‘("/u/jimb/ex4"
     "foo")’.

‘guile -l first -ds -l last -s script’
     Load the files ‘first’, ‘script’, and ‘last’, in that order.  The
     ‘-ds’ switch says when to process the ‘-s’ switch.  For a more
     motivated example, see the scripts below.

   Here is a very simple Guile script:
     #!/usr/local/bin/guile -s
     !#
     (display "Hello, world!")
     (newline)
   The first line marks the file as a Guile script.  When the user
invokes it, the system runs ‘/usr/local/bin/guile’ to interpret the
script, passing ‘-s’, the script’s filename, and any arguments given to
the script as command-line arguments.  When Guile sees ‘-s SCRIPT’, it
loads SCRIPT.  Thus, running this program produces the output:
     Hello, world!

   Here is a script which prints the factorial of its argument:
     #!/usr/local/bin/guile -s
     !#
     (define (fact n)
       (if (zero? n) 1
         (* n (fact (- n 1)))))

     (display (fact (string->number (cadr (command-line)))))
     (newline)
   In action:
     $ ./fact 5
     120
     $

   However, suppose we want to use the definition of ‘fact’ in this file
from another script.  We can’t simply ‘load’ the script file, and then
use ‘fact’’s definition, because the script will try to compute and
display a factorial when we load it.  To avoid this problem, we might
write the script this way:

     #!/usr/local/bin/guile \
     -e main -s
     !#
     (define (fact n)
       (if (zero? n) 1
         (* n (fact (- n 1)))))

     (define (main args)
       (display (fact (string->number (cadr args))))
       (newline))
   This version packages the actions the script should perform in a
function, ‘main’.  This allows us to load the file purely for its
definitions, without any extraneous computation taking place.  Then we
used the meta switch ‘\’ and the entry point switch ‘-e’ to tell Guile
to call ‘main’ after loading the script.
     $ ./fact 50
     30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000

   Suppose that we now want to write a script which computes the
‘choose’ function: given a set of M distinct objects, ‘(choose N M)’ is
the number of distinct subsets containing N objects each.  It’s easy to
write ‘choose’ given ‘fact’, so we might write the script this way:

     #!/usr/local/bin/guile \
     -l fact -e main -s
     !#
     (define (choose n m)
       (/ (fact m) (* (fact (- m n)) (fact n))))

     (define (main args)
       (let ((n (string->number (cadr args)))
             (m (string->number (caddr args))))
         (display (choose n m))
         (newline)))

   The command-line arguments here tell Guile to first load the file
‘fact’, and then run the script, with ‘main’ as the entry point.  In
other words, the ‘choose’ script can use definitions made in the ‘fact’
script.  Here are some sample runs:
     $ ./choose 0 4
     1
     $ ./choose 1 4
     4
     $ ./choose 2 4
     6
     $ ./choose 3 4
     4
     $ ./choose 4 4
     1
     $ ./choose 50 100
     100891344545564193334812497256

   To call a specific procedure from a given module, we can use the
special form ‘(@ (MODULE) PROCEDURE)’:

     #!/usr/local/bin/guile \
     -l fact -e (@ (fac) main) -s
     !#
     (define-module (fac)
       #:export (main))

     (define (choose n m)
       (/ (fact m) (* (fact (- m n)) (fact n))))

     (define (main args)
       (let ((n (string->number (cadr args)))
             (m (string->number (caddr args))))
         (display (choose n m))
         (newline)))

   We can use ‘@@’ to invoke non-exported procedures.  For exported
procedures, we can simplify this call with the shorthand ‘(MODULE)’:

     #!/usr/local/bin/guile \
     -l fact -e (fac) -s
     !#
     (define-module (fac)
       #:export (main))

     (define (choose n m)
       (/ (fact m) (* (fact (- m n)) (fact n))))

     (define (main args)
       (let ((n (string->number (cadr args)))
             (m (string->number (caddr args))))
         (display (choose n m))
         (newline)))

   For maximum portability, we can instead use the shell to execute
‘guile’ with specified command line arguments.  Here we need to take
care to quote the command arguments correctly:

     #!/usr/bin/env sh
     exec guile -l fact -e '(@ (fac) main)' -s "$0" "$@"
     !#
     (define-module (fac)
       #:export (main))

     (define (choose n m)
       (/ (fact m) (* (fact (- m n)) (fact n))))

     (define (main args)
       (let ((n (string->number (cadr args)))
             (m (string->number (caddr args))))
         (display (choose n m))
         (newline)))

   Finally, seasoned scripters are probably missing a mention of
subprocesses.  In Bash, for example, most shell scripts run other
programs like ‘sed’ or the like to do the actual work.

   In Guile it’s often possible get everything done within Guile itself,
so do give that a try first.  But if you just need to run a program and
wait for it to finish, use ‘system*’.  If you need to run a sub-program
and capture its output, or give it input, use ‘open-pipe’.  *Note*
Processes::, and *Note* Pipes::, for more information.

4.4 Using Guile Interactively
=============================

When you start up Guile by typing just ‘guile’, without a ‘-c’ argument
or the name of a script to execute, you get an interactive interpreter
where you can enter Scheme expressions, and Guile will evaluate them and
print the results for you.  Here are some simple examples.

     scheme@(guile-user)> (+ 3 4 5)
     $1 = 12
     scheme@(guile-user)> (display "Hello world!\n")
     Hello world!
     scheme@(guile-user)> (values 'a 'b)
     $2 = a
     $3 = b

This mode of use is called a “REPL”, which is short for “Read-Eval-Print
Loop”, because the Guile interpreter first reads the expression that you
have typed, then evaluates it, and then prints the result.

   The prompt shows you what language and module you are in.  In this
case, the current language is ‘scheme’, and the current module is
‘(guile-user)’.  *Note* Other Languages::, for more information on
Guile’s support for languages other than Scheme.

4.4.1 The Init File, ‘~/.guile’
-------------------------------

When run interactively, Guile will load a local initialization file from
‘~/.guile’.  This file should contain Scheme expressions for evaluation.

   This facility lets the user customize their interactive Guile
environment, pulling in extra modules or parameterizing the REPL
implementation.

   To run Guile without loading the init file, use the ‘-q’ command-line
option.


File: guile.info,  Node: Readline,  Next: Value History,  Prev: Init File,  Up: Using Guile Interactively

4.4.2 Readline
--------------

To make it easier for you to repeat and vary previously entered
expressions, or to edit the expression that you’re typing in, Guile can
use the GNU Readline library.  This is not enabled by default because of
licensing reasons, but all you need to activate Readline is the
following pair of lines.

     scheme@(guile-user)> (use-modules (ice-9 readline))
     scheme@(guile-user)> (activate-readline)

   It’s a good idea to put these two lines (without the
‘scheme@(guile-user)>’ prompts) in your ‘.guile’ file.  *Note* Init
File::, for more on ‘.guile’.


File: guile.info,  Node: Value History,  Next: REPL Commands,  Prev: Readline,  Up: Using Guile Interactively

4.4.3 Value History
-------------------

Just as Readline helps you to reuse a previous input line, “value
history” allows you to use the _result_ of a previous evaluation in a
new expression.  When value history is enabled, each evaluation result
is automatically assigned to the next in the sequence of variables ‘$1’,
‘$2’, ....  You can then use these variables in subsequent expressions.

     scheme@(guile-user)> (iota 10)
     $1 = (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
     scheme@(guile-user)> (apply * (cdr $1))
     $2 = 362880
     scheme@(guile-user)> (sqrt $2)
     $3 = 602.3952191045344
     scheme@(guile-user)> (cons $2 $1)
     $4 = (362880 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)

   Value history is enabled by default, because Guile’s REPL imports the
‘(ice-9 history)’ module.  Value history may be turned off or on within
the repl, using the options interface:

     scheme@(guile-user)> ,option value-history #f
     scheme@(guile-user)> 'foo
     foo
     scheme@(guile-user)> ,option value-history #t
     scheme@(guile-user)> 'bar
     $5 = bar

   Note that previously recorded values are still accessible, even if
value history is off.  In rare cases, these references to past
computations can cause Guile to use too much memory.  One may clear
these values, possibly enabling garbage collection, via the
‘clear-value-history!’ procedure, described below.

   The programmatic interface to value history is in a module:

     (use-modules (ice-9 history))

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-history-enabled?
     Return true if value history is enabled, or false otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: enable-value-history!
     Turn on value history, if it was off.

 -- Scheme Procedure: disable-value-history!
     Turn off value history, if it was on.

 -- Scheme Procedure: clear-value-history!
     Clear the value history.  If the stored values are not captured by
     some other data structure or closure, they may then be reclaimed by
     the garbage collector.


File: guile.info,  Node: REPL Commands,  Next: Error Handling,  Prev: Value History,  Up: Using Guile Interactively

4.4.4 REPL Commands
-------------------

The REPL exists to read expressions, evaluate them, and then print their
results.  But sometimes one wants to tell the REPL to evaluate an
expression in a different way, or to do something else altogether.  A
user can affect the way the REPL works with a “REPL command”.

   The previous section had an example of a command, in the form of
‘,option’.

     scheme@(guile-user)> ,option value-history #t

Commands are distinguished from expressions by their initial comma
(‘,’).  Since a comma cannot begin an expression in most languages, it
is an effective indicator to the REPL that the following text forms a
command, not an expression.

   REPL commands are convenient because they are always there.  Even if
the current module doesn’t have a binding for ‘pretty-print’, one can
always ‘,pretty-print’.

   The following sections document the various commands, grouped
together by functionality.  Many of the commands have abbreviations; see
the online help (‘,help’) for more information.

File: guile.info,  Node: Help Commands,  Next: Module Commands,  Up: REPL Commands

### 4.4.4.1 Help Commands
.....................

When Guile starts interactively, it notifies the user that help can be
had by typing ‘,help’.  Indeed, ‘help’ is a command, and a particularly
useful one, as it allows the user to discover the rest of the commands.

 -- REPL Command: help [all | group | [-c] command]
     Show help.

     With one argument, tries to look up the argument as a group name,
     giving help on that group if successful.  Otherwise tries to look
     up the argument as a command, giving help on the command.

     If there is a command whose name is also a group name, use the ‘-c
     COMMAND’ form to give help on the command instead of the group.

     Without any argument, a list of help commands and command groups
     are displayed.

 -- REPL Command: show [topic]
     Gives information about Guile.

     With one argument, tries to show a particular piece of information;
     currently supported topics are ‘warranty’ (or ‘w’), ‘copying’ (or
     ‘c’), and ‘version’ (or ‘v’).

     Without any argument, a list of topics is displayed.

 -- REPL Command: apropos regexp
     Find bindings/modules/packages.

 -- REPL Command: describe obj
     Show description/documentation.

 -- REPL Command: import module ...
     Import modules / List those imported.

 -- REPL Command: load file
     Load a file in the current module.

 -- REPL Command: reload [module]
     Reload the given module, or the current module if none was given.

 -- REPL Command: binding
     List current bindings.

 -- REPL Command: in module expression
 -- REPL Command: in module command arg ...
     Evaluate an expression, or alternatively, execute another
     meta-command in the context of a module.  For example, ‘,in (foo
     bar) ,binding’ will show the bindings in the module ‘(foo bar)’.

........................

 -- REPL Command: time exp
     Time execution.

 -- REPL Command: profile exp [#:hz hz=100] [#:count-calls?
          count-calls?=#f] [#:display-style display-style=list]
     Profile execution of an expression.  This command compiled EXP and
     then runs it within the statprof profiler, passing all keyword
     options to the ‘statprof’ procedure.  For more on statprof and on
     the the options available to this command, *Note* Statprof::.

 -- REPL Command: trace exp [#:width w] [#:max-indent i]
     Trace execution.

     By default, the trace will limit its width to the width of your
     terminal, or WIDTH if specified.  Nested procedure invocations will
     be printed farther to the right, though if the width of the
     indentation passes the MAX-INDENT, the indentation is abbreviated.

   These REPL commands can also be called as regular functions in scheme
code on including the ‘(ice-9 time)’ module.

### 4.4.4.6 Debug Commands
......................

These debugging commands are only available within a recursive REPL;
they do not work at the top level.

 -- REPL Command: backtrace [count] [#:width w] [#:full? f]
     Print a backtrace.

     Print a backtrace of all stack frames, or innermost COUNT frames.
     If COUNT is negative, the last COUNT frames will be shown.

 -- REPL Command: up [count]
     Select a calling stack frame.

     Select and print stack frames that called this one.  An argument
     says how many frames up to go.

 -- REPL Command: down [count]
     Select a called stack frame.

     Select and print stack frames called by this one.  An argument says
     how many frames down to go.

 -- REPL Command: frame [idx]
     Show a frame.

     Show the selected frame.  With an argument, select a frame by
     index, then show it.

 -- REPL Command: locals
     Show local variables.

     Show locally-bound variables in the selected frame.

 -- REPL Command: error-message
 -- REPL Command: error
     Show error message.

     Display the message associated with the error that started the
     current debugging REPL.

 -- REPL Command: registers
     Show the VM registers associated with the current frame.

     *Note* Stack Layout::, for more information on VM stack frames.

 -- REPL Command: width [cols]
     Sets the number of display columns in the output of ‘,backtrace’
     and ‘,locals’ to COLS.  If COLS is not given, the width of the
     terminal is used.

   The next 3 commands work at any REPL.

 -- REPL Command: break proc
     Set a breakpoint at PROC.

 -- REPL Command: break-at-source file line
     Set a breakpoint at the given source location.

 -- REPL Command: tracepoint proc
     Set a tracepoint on the given procedure.  This will cause all calls
     to the procedure to print out a tracing message.  *Note* Tracing
     Traps::, for more information.

   The rest of the commands in this subsection all apply only when the
stack is “continuable” — in other words when it makes sense for the
program that the stack comes from to continue running.  Usually this
means that the program stopped because of a trap or a breakpoint.

 -- REPL Command: step
     Tell the debugged program to step to the next source location.

 -- REPL Command: next
     Tell the debugged program to step to the next source location in
     the same frame.  (See *note* Traps:: for the details of how this
     works.)

 -- REPL Command: finish
     Tell the program being debugged to continue running until the
     completion of the current stack frame, and at that time to print
     the result and reenter the REPL.

### 4.4.4.8 System Commands
.......................

 -- REPL Command: gc
     Garbage collection.

 -- REPL Command: statistics
     Display statistics.

 -- REPL Command: option [name] [exp]
     With no arguments, lists all options.  With one argument, shows the
     current value of the NAME option.  With two arguments, sets the
     NAME option to the result of evaluating the Scheme expression EXP.

 -- REPL Command: quit
     Quit this session.

   Current REPL options include:

‘compile-options’
     The options used when compiling expressions entered at the REPL.
     *Note* Compilation::, for more on compilation options.
‘interp’
     Whether to interpret or compile expressions given at the REPL, if
     such a choice is available.  Off by default (indicating
     compilation).
‘prompt’
     A customized REPL prompt.  ‘#f’ by default, indicating the default
     prompt.
‘print’
     A procedure of two arguments used to print the result of evaluating
     each expression.  The arguments are the current REPL and the value
     to print.  By default, ‘#f’, to use the default procedure.
‘value-history’
     Whether value history is on or not.  *Note* Value History::.
‘on-error’
     What to do when an error happens.  By default, ‘debug’, meaning to
     enter the debugger.  Other values include ‘backtrace’, to show a
     backtrace without entering the debugger, or ‘report’, to simply
     show a short error printout.

   Default values for REPL options may be set using
‘repl-default-option-set!’ from ‘(system repl common)’:

 -- Scheme Procedure: repl-default-option-set! key value
     Set the default value of a REPL option.  This function is
     particularly useful in a user’s init file.  *Note* Init File::.


File: guile.info,  Node: Error Handling,  Next: Interactive Debugging,  Prev: REPL Commands,  Up: Using Guile Interactively

4.4.5 Error Handling
--------------------

When code being evaluated from the REPL hits an error, Guile enters a
new prompt, allowing you to inspect the context of the error.

     scheme@(guile-user)> (map string-append '("a" "b") '("c" #\d))
     ERROR: In procedure string-append:
     ERROR: Wrong type (expecting string): #\d
     Entering a new prompt.  Type `,bt' for a backtrace or `,q' to continue.
     scheme@(guile-user) [1]>

   The new prompt runs inside the old one, in the dynamic context of the
error.  It is a recursive REPL, augmented with a reified representation
of the stack, ready for debugging.

   ‘,backtrace’ (abbreviated ‘,bt’) displays the Scheme call stack at
the point where the error occurred:

     scheme@(guile-user) [1]> ,bt
                1 (map #<procedure string-append _> ("a" "b") ("c" #\d))
                0 (string-append "b" #\d)

   In the above example, the backtrace doesn’t have much source
information, as ‘map’ and ‘string-append’ are both primitives.  But in
the general case, the space on the left of the backtrace indicates the
line and column in which a given procedure calls another.

   You can exit a recursive REPL in the same way that you exit any REPL:
via ‘(quit)’, ‘,quit’ (abbreviated ‘,q’), or ‘C-d’, among other options.


File: guile.info,  Node: Interactive Debugging,  Prev: Error Handling,  Up: Using Guile Interactively

4.4.6 Interactive Debugging
---------------------------

A recursive debugging REPL exposes a number of other meta-commands that
inspect the state of the computation at the time of the error.  These
commands allow you to

   • display the Scheme call stack at the point where the error
     occurred;

   • move up and down the call stack, to see in detail the expression
     being evaluated, or the procedure being applied, in each “frame”;
     and

   • examine the values of variables and expressions in the context of
     each frame.

*Note* Debug Commands::, for documentation of the individual commands.
This section aims to give more of a walkthrough of a typical debugging
session.

   First, we’re going to need a good error.  Let’s try to macroexpand
the expression ‘(unquote foo)’, outside of a ‘quasiquote’ form, and see
how the macroexpander reports this error.

     scheme@(guile-user)> (macroexpand '(unquote foo))
     ERROR: In procedure macroexpand:
     ERROR: unquote: expression not valid outside of quasiquote in (unquote foo)
     Entering a new prompt.  Type `,bt' for a backtrace or `,q' to continue.
     scheme@(guile-user) [1]>

   The ‘backtrace’ command, which can also be invoked as ‘bt’, displays
the call stack (aka backtrace) at the point where the debugger was
entered:

     scheme@(guile-user) [1]> ,bt
     In ice-9/psyntax.scm:
       1130:21  3 (chi-top (unquote foo) () ((top)) e (eval) (hygiene #))
       1071:30  2 (syntax-type (unquote foo) () ((top)) #f #f (# #) #f)
       1368:28  1 (chi-macro #<procedure de9360 at ice-9/psyntax.scm...> ...)
     In unknown file:
                0 (scm-error syntax-error macroexpand "~a: ~a in ~a" # #f)

   A call stack consists of a sequence of stack “frames”, with each
frame describing one procedure which is waiting to do something with the
values returned by another.  Here we see that there are four frames on
the stack.

   Note that ‘macroexpand’ is not on the stack – it must have made a
tail call to ‘chi-top’, as indeed we would find if we searched
‘ice-9/psyntax.scm’ for its definition.

   When you enter the debugger, the innermost frame is selected, which
means that the commands for getting information about the “current”
frame, or for evaluating expressions in the context of the current
frame, will do so by default with respect to the innermost frame.  To
select a different frame, so that these operations will apply to it
instead, use the ‘up’, ‘down’ and ‘frame’ commands like this:

     scheme@(guile-user) [1]> ,up
     In ice-9/psyntax.scm:
       1368:28  1 (chi-macro #<procedure de9360 at ice-9/psyntax.scm...> ...)
     scheme@(guile-user) [1]> ,frame 3
     In ice-9/psyntax.scm:
       1130:21  3 (chi-top (unquote foo) () ((top)) e (eval) (hygiene #))
     scheme@(guile-user) [1]> ,down
     In ice-9/psyntax.scm:
       1071:30  2 (syntax-type (unquote foo) () ((top)) #f #f (# #) #f)

   Perhaps we’re interested in what’s going on in frame 2, so we take a
look at its local variables:

     scheme@(guile-user) [1]> ,locals
       Local variables:
       $1 = e = (unquote foo)
       $2 = r = ()
       $3 = w = ((top))
       $4 = s = #f
       $5 = rib = #f
       $6 = mod = (hygiene guile-user)
       $7 = for-car? = #f
       $8 = first = unquote
       $9 = ftype = macro
       $10 = fval = #<procedure de9360 at ice-9/psyntax.scm:2817:2 (x)>
       $11 = fe = unquote
       $12 = fw = ((top))
       $13 = fs = #f
       $14 = fmod = (hygiene guile-user)

   All of the values are accessible by their value-history names (‘$N’):

     scheme@(guile-user) [1]> $10
     $15 = #<procedure de9360 at ice-9/psyntax.scm:2817:2 (x)>

   We can even invoke the procedure at the REPL directly:

     scheme@(guile-user) [1]> ($10 'not-going-to-work)
     ERROR: In procedure macroexpand:
     ERROR: source expression failed to match any pattern in not-going-to-work
     Entering a new prompt.  Type `,bt' for a backtrace or `,q' to continue.

   Well at this point we’ve caused an error within an error.  Let’s just
quit back to the top level:

     scheme@(guile-user) [2]> ,q
     scheme@(guile-user) [1]> ,q
     scheme@(guile-user)>

   Finally, as a word to the wise: hackers close their REPL prompts with
‘C-d’.

4.5 Using Guile in Emacs
========================

Any text editor can edit Scheme, but some are better than others.  Emacs
is the best, of course, and not just because it is a fine text editor.
Emacs has good support for Scheme out of the box, with sensible
indentation rules, parenthesis-matching, syntax highlighting, and even a
set of keybindings for structural editing, allowing navigation,
cut-and-paste, and transposition operations that work on balanced
S-expressions.

   As good as it is, though, two things will vastly improve your
experience with Emacs and Guile.

   The first is Taylor Campbell’s Paredit
(http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit).  You should not code in any
dialect of Lisp without Paredit.  (They say that unopinionated writing
is boring—hence this tone—but it’s the truth, regardless.)  Paredit is
the bee’s knees.

   The second is José Antonio Ortega Ruiz’s Geiser
(http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/).  Geiser complements Emacs’
‘scheme-mode’ with tight integration to running Guile processes via a
‘comint-mode’ REPL buffer.

   Of course there are keybindings to switch to the REPL, and a good
REPL environment, but Geiser goes beyond that, providing:

   • Form evaluation in the context of the current file’s module.
   • Macro expansion.
   • File/module loading and/or compilation.
   • Namespace-aware identifier completion (including local bindings,
     names visible in the current module, and module names).
   • Autodoc: the echo area shows information about the signature of the
     procedure/macro around point automatically.
   • Jump to definition of identifier at point.
   • Access to documentation (including docstrings when the
     implementation provides it).
   • Listings of identifiers exported by a given module.
   • Listings of callers/callees of procedures.
   • Rudimentary support for debugging and error navigation.
   • Support for multiple, simultaneous REPLs.

   See Geiser’s web page at <http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/>, for more
information.

4.6 Using Guile Tools
=====================

Guile also comes with a growing number of command-line utilities: a
compiler, a disassembler, some module inspectors, and in the future, a
system to install Guile packages from the internet.  These tools may be
invoked using the ‘guild’ program.

     $ guild compile -o foo.go foo.scm
     wrote `foo.go'

   This program used to be called ‘guile-tools’ up to Guile version
2.0.1, and for backward compatibility it still may be called as such.
However we changed the name to ‘guild’, not only because it is
pleasantly shorter and easier to read, but also because this tool will
serve to bind Guile wizards together, by allowing hackers to share code
with each other using a CPAN-like system.

   *Note* Compilation::, for more on ‘guild compile’.

   A complete list of guild scripts can be had by invoking ‘guild list’,
or simply ‘guild’.


File: guile.info,  Node: Installing Site Packages,  Next: Distributing Guile Code,  Prev: Using Guile Tools,  Up: Programming in Scheme

4.7 Installing Site Packages
============================

At some point, you will probably want to share your code with other
people.  To do so effectively, it is important to follow a set of common
conventions, to make it easy for the user to install and use your
package.

   The first thing to do is to install your Scheme files where Guile can
find them.  When Guile goes to find a Scheme file, it will search a
“load path” to find the file: first in Guile’s own path, then in paths
for “site packages”.  A site package is any Scheme code that is
installed and not part of Guile itself.  *Note* Load Paths::, for more on
load paths.

   There are several site paths, for historical reasons, but the one
that should generally be used can be obtained by invoking the
‘%site-dir’ procedure.  *Note* Build Config::.  If Guile 3.0 is installed
on your system in ‘/usr/’, then ‘(%site-dir)’ will be
‘/usr/share/guile/site/3.0’.  Scheme files should be installed there.

   If you do not install compiled ‘.go’ files, Guile will compile your
modules and programs when they are first used, and cache them in the
user’s home directory.  *Note* Compilation::, for more on
auto-compilation.  However, it is better to compile the files before
they are installed, and to just copy the files to a place that Guile can
find them.

   As with Scheme files, Guile searches a path to find compiled ‘.go’
files, the ‘%load-compiled-path’.  By default, this path has two
entries: a path for Guile’s files, and a path for site packages.  You
should install your ‘.go’ files into the latter directory, whose value
is returned by invoking the ‘%site-ccache-dir’ procedure.  As in the
previous example, if Guile 3.0 is installed on your system in ‘/usr/’,
then ‘(%site-ccache-dir)’ site packages will be
‘/usr/lib/guile/3.0/site-ccache’.

   Note that a ‘.go’ file will only be loaded in preference to a ‘.scm’
file if it is newer.  For that reason, you should install your Scheme
files first, and your compiled files second.  *Note* Load Paths::, for
more on the loading process.

   Finally, although this section is only about Scheme, sometimes you
need to install C extensions too.  Shared libraries should be installed
in the “extensions dir”.  This value can be had from the build config
(*note* Build Config::).  Again, if Guile 3.0 is installed on your system
in ‘/usr/’, then the extensions dir will be
‘/usr/lib/guile/3.0/extensions’.

4.8 Distributing Guile Code
===========================

There’s a tool that doesn’t come bundled with Guile and yet can be very
useful in your day to day experience with it.  This tool is Hall
(https://gitlab.com/a-sassmannshausen/guile-hall).

   Hall helps you create, manage, and package your Guile projects
through a simple command-line interface.  When you start a new project,
Hall creates a folder containing a scaffold of your new project.  It
contains a directory for your tests, for your libraries, for your
scripts and for your documentation.  This means you immediately know
where to put the files you are hacking on.

   In addition, the scaffold will include your basic “Autotools” setup,
so you don’t have to take care of that yourself (*note* (autoconf)The GNU
Build System::, for more information on the GNU “Autotools”).  Having
Autotools set up with your project means you can immediately start
hacking on your project without worrying about whether your code will
work on other people’s computers.  Hall can also generate package
definitions for the GNU Guix package manager, making it easy for Guix
users to install it.

# 📜 5 Programming in C
******************

This part of the manual explains the general concepts that you need to
understand when interfacing to Guile from C. You will learn about how
the latent typing of Scheme is embedded into the static typing of C, how
the garbage collection of Guile is made available to C code, and how
continuations influence the control flow in a C program.

   This knowledge should make it straightforward to add new functions to
Guile that can be called from Scheme.  Adding new data types is also
possible and is done by defining “foreign objects”.

   The *note* Programming Overview:: section of this part contains
general musings and guidelines about programming with Guile.  It
explores different ways to design a program around Guile, or how to
embed Guile into existing programs.

   For a pedagogical yet detailed explanation of how the data
representation of Guile is implemented, *Note* Data Representation::.
You don’t need to know the details given there to use Guile from C, but
they are useful when you want to modify Guile itself or when you are
just curious about how it is all done.

File: guile.info,  Node: Parallel Installations,  Next: Linking Programs With Guile,  Up: Programming in C

5.1 Parallel Installations
==========================

Guile provides strong API and ABI stability guarantees during stable
series, so that if a user writes a program against Guile version 2.2.3,
it will be compatible with some future version 2.2.7.  We say in this
case that 2.2 is the “effective version”, composed of the major and
minor versions, in this case 2 and 2.

   Users may install multiple effective versions of Guile, with each
version’s headers, libraries, and Scheme files under their own
directories.  This provides the necessary stability guarantee for users,
while also allowing Guile developers to evolve the language and its
implementation.

   However, parallel installability does have a down-side, in that users
need to know which version of Guile to ask for, when they build against
Guile.  Guile solves this problem by installing a file to be read by the
‘pkg-config’ utility, a tool to query installed packages by name.  Guile
encodes the version into its pkg-config name, so that users can ask for
‘guile-2.2’ or ‘guile-3.0’, as appropriate.

   For effective version 3.0, for example, you would invoke ‘pkg-config
--cflags --libs guile-3.0’ to get the compilation and linking flags
necessary to link to version 3.0 of Guile.  You would typically run
‘pkg-config’ during the configuration phase of your program and use the
obtained information in the Makefile.

   Guile’s ‘pkg-config’ file, ‘guile-3.0.pc’, defines additional useful
variables:

‘sitedir’
     The default directory where Guile looks for Scheme source and
     compiled files (*note* %site-dir: Installing Site Packages.).  Run
     ‘pkg-config guile-3.0 --variable=sitedir’ to see its value.  *Note*
     GUILE_SITE_DIR: Autoconf Macros, for more on how to use it from
     Autoconf.

‘extensiondir’
     The default directory where Guile looks for extensions—i.e., shared
     libraries providing additional features (*note* Foreign
     Extensions::).  Run ‘pkg-config guile-3.0 --variable=extensiondir’
     to see its value.

‘guile’
‘guild’
     The absolute file name of the ‘guile’ and ‘guild’ commands(1).  Run
     ‘pkg-config guile-3.0 --variable=guile’ or ‘--variable=guild’ to
     see their value.

     These variables allow users to deal with program name
     transformations that may be specified when configuring Guile with
     ‘--program-transform-name’, ‘--program-suffix’, or
     ‘--program-prefix’ (*note* (autoconf)Transformation Options::).

See the ‘pkg-config’ man page, for more information, or its web site,
<http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/>.  *Note* Autoconf Support::, for
more on checking for Guile from within a ‘configure.ac’ file.

5.2 Linking Programs With Guile
===============================

This section covers the mechanics of linking your program with Guile on
a typical POSIX system.

   The header file ‘<libguile.h>’ provides declarations for all of
Guile’s functions and constants.  You should ‘#include’ it at the head
of any C source file that uses identifiers described in this manual.
Once you’ve compiled your source files, you need to link them against
the Guile object code library, ‘libguile’.

   As noted in the previous section, ‘<libguile.h>’ is not in the
default search path for headers.  The following command lines give
respectively the C compilation and link flags needed to build programs
using Guile 3.0:

     pkg-config guile-3.0 --cflags
     pkg-config guile-3.0 --libs

* A Sample Guile Main Program::  Sources and makefiles.


File: guile.info,  Node: Guile Initialization Functions,  Next: A Sample Guile Main Program,  Up: Linking Programs With Guile

5.2.1 Guile Initialization Functions
------------------------------------

To initialize Guile, you can use one of several functions.  The first,
‘scm_with_guile’, is the most portable way to initialize Guile.  It will
initialize Guile when necessary and then call a function that you can
specify.  Multiple threads can call ‘scm_with_guile’ concurrently and it
can also be called more than once in a given thread.  The global state
of Guile will survive from one call of ‘scm_with_guile’ to the next.
Your function is called from within ‘scm_with_guile’ since the garbage
collector of Guile needs to know where the stack of each thread is.

   A second function, ‘scm_init_guile’, initializes Guile for the
current thread.  When it returns, you can use the Guile API in the
current thread.  This function employs some non-portable magic to learn
about stack bounds and might thus not be available on all platforms.

   One common way to use Guile is to write a set of C functions which
perform some useful task, make them callable from Scheme, and then link
the program with Guile.  This yields a Scheme interpreter just like
‘guile’, but augmented with extra functions for some specific
application — a special-purpose scripting language.

   In this situation, the application should probably process its
command-line arguments in the same manner as the stock Guile
interpreter.  To make that straightforward, Guile provides the
‘scm_boot_guile’ and ‘scm_shell’ function.

   For more about these functions, see *note* Initialization::.


File: guile.info,  Node: A Sample Guile Main Program,  Prev: Guile Initialization Functions,  Up: Linking Programs With Guile

5.2.2 A Sample Guile Main Program
---------------------------------

Here is ‘simple-guile.c’, source code for a ‘main’ and an ‘inner_main’
function that will produce a complete Guile interpreter.

     /* simple-guile.c --- Start Guile from C.  */

     #include <libguile.h>

     static void
     inner_main (void *closure, int argc, char **argv)
     {
       /* preparation */
       scm_shell (argc, argv);
       /* after exit */
     }

     int
     main (int argc, char **argv)
     {
       scm_boot_guile (argc, argv, inner_main, 0);
       return 0; /* never reached, see inner_main */
     }

   The ‘main’ function calls ‘scm_boot_guile’ to initialize Guile,
passing it ‘inner_main’.  Once ‘scm_boot_guile’ is ready, it invokes
‘inner_main’, which calls ‘scm_shell’ to process the command-line
arguments in the usual way.

5.2.3 Building the Example with Make
------------------------------------

Here is a Makefile which you can use to compile the example program.  It
uses ‘pkg-config’ to learn about the necessary compiler and linker
flags.
     # Use GCC, if you have it installed.
     CC=gcc

     # Tell the C compiler where to find <libguile.h>
     CFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags guile-3.0`

     # Tell the linker what libraries to use and where to find them.
     LIBS=`pkg-config --libs guile-3.0`

     simple-guile: simple-guile.o
             ${CC} simple-guile.o ${LIBS} -o simple-guile

     simple-guile.o: simple-guile.c
             ${CC} -c ${CFLAGS} simple-guile.c

5.2.4 Building the Example with Autoconf
----------------------------------------

If you are using the GNU Autoconf package to make your application more
portable, Autoconf will settle many of the details in the Makefile
automatically, making it much simpler and more portable; we recommend
using Autoconf with Guile.  Here is a ‘configure.ac’ file for
‘simple-guile’ that uses the standard ‘PKG_CHECK_MODULES’ macro to check
for Guile.  Autoconf will process this file into a ‘configure’ script.
We recommend invoking Autoconf via the ‘autoreconf’ utility.

     AC_INIT(simple-guile.c)

     # Find a C compiler.
     AC_PROG_CC

     # Check for Guile
     PKG_CHECK_MODULES([GUILE], [guile-3.0])

     # Generate a Makefile, based on the results.
     AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)

   Run ‘autoreconf -vif’ to generate ‘configure’.

   Here is a ‘Makefile.in’ template, from which the ‘configure’ script
produces a Makefile customized for the host system:
     # The configure script fills in these values.
     CC=@CC@
     CFLAGS=@GUILE_CFLAGS@
     LIBS=@GUILE_LIBS@

     simple-guile: simple-guile.o
             ${CC} simple-guile.o ${LIBS} -o simple-guile
     simple-guile.o: simple-guile.c
             ${CC} -c ${CFLAGS} simple-guile.c

   The developer should use Autoconf to generate the ‘configure’ script
from the ‘configure.ac’ template, and distribute ‘configure’ with the
application.  Here’s how a user might go about building the application:

     $ ls
     Makefile.in     configure*      configure.ac    simple-guile.c
     $ ./configure
     checking for gcc... ccache gcc
     checking whether the C compiler works... yes
     checking for C compiler default output file name... a.out
     checking for suffix of executables...
     checking whether we are cross compiling... no
     checking for suffix of object files... o
     checking whether we are using the GNU C compiler... yes
     checking whether ccache gcc accepts -g... yes
     checking for ccache gcc option to accept ISO C89... none needed
     checking for pkg-config... /usr/bin/pkg-config

5.3 Linking Guile with Libraries
================================

The previous section has briefly explained how to write programs that
make use of an embedded Guile interpreter.  But sometimes, all you want
to do is make new primitive procedures and data types available to the
Scheme programmer.  Writing a new version of ‘guile’ is inconvenient in
this case and it would in fact make the life of the users of your new
features needlessly hard.

   For example, suppose that there is a program ‘guile-db’ that is a
version of Guile with additional features for accessing a database.
People who want to write Scheme programs that use these features would
have to use ‘guile-db’ instead of the usual ‘guile’ program.  Now
suppose that there is also a program ‘guile-gtk’ that extends Guile with
access to the popular Gtk+ toolkit for graphical user interfaces.
People who want to write GUIs in Scheme would have to use ‘guile-gtk’.
Now, what happens when you want to write a Scheme application that uses
a GUI to let the user access a database?  You would have to write a
_third_ program that incorporates both the database stuff and the GUI
stuff.  This might not be easy (because ‘guile-gtk’ might be a quite
obscure program, say) and taking this example further makes it easy to
see that this approach can not work in practice.

   It would have been much better if both the database features and the
GUI feature had been provided as libraries that can just be linked with
‘guile’.  Guile makes it easy to do just this, and we encourage you to
make your extensions to Guile available as libraries whenever possible.

   You write the new primitive procedures and data types in the normal
fashion, and link them into a shared library instead of into a
stand-alone program.  The shared library can then be loaded dynamically
by Guile.

* Menu:

* A Sample Guile Extension::


File: guile.info,  Node: A Sample Guile Extension,  Up: Linking Guile with Libraries

5.3.1 A Sample Guile Extension
------------------------------

This section explains how to make the Bessel functions of the C library
available to Scheme.  First we need to write the appropriate glue code
to convert the arguments and return values of the functions from Scheme
to C and back.  Additionally, we need a function that will add them to
the set of Guile primitives.  Because this is just an example, we will
only implement this for the ‘j0’ function.

   Consider the following file ‘bessel.c’.

     #include <math.h>
     #include <libguile.h>

     SCM
     j0_wrapper (SCM x)
     {
       return scm_from_double (j0 (scm_to_double (x)));
     }

     void
     init_bessel ()
     {
       scm_c_define_gsubr ("j0", 1, 0, 0, j0_wrapper);
     }

   This C source file needs to be compiled into a shared library.  Here
is how to do it on GNU/Linux:

     gcc `pkg-config --cflags guile-3.0` \
       -shared -o libguile-bessel.so -fPIC bessel.c

   For creating shared libraries portably, we recommend the use of GNU
Libtool (*note* Introduction: (libtool)Top.).

   A shared library can be loaded into a running Guile process with the
function ‘load-extension’.  In addition to the name of the library to
load, this function also expects the name of a function from that
library that will be called to initialize it.  For our example, we are
going to call the function ‘init_bessel’ which will make ‘j0_wrapper’
available to Scheme programs with the name ‘j0’.  Note that we do not
specify a filename extension such as ‘.so’ when invoking
‘load-extension’.  The right extension for the host platform will be
provided automatically.

     (load-extension "libguile-bessel" "init_bessel")
     (j0 2)
     ⇒ 0.223890779141236

   For this to work, ‘load-extension’ must be able to find
‘libguile-bessel’, of course.  It will look in the places that are usual
for your operating system, and it will additionally look into the
directories listed in the ‘LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH’ environment variable.

   To see how these Guile extensions via shared libraries relate to the
module system, *Note* Putting Extensions into Modules::.

5.4 General concepts for using libguile
=======================================

When you want to embed the Guile Scheme interpreter into your program or
library, you need to link it against the ‘libguile’ library (*note*
Linking Programs With Guile::).  Once you have done this, your C code
has access to a number of data types and functions that can be used to
invoke the interpreter, or make new functions that you have written in C
available to be called from Scheme code, among other things.

   Scheme is different from C in a number of significant ways, and Guile
tries to make the advantages of Scheme available to C as well.  Thus, in
addition to a Scheme interpreter, libguile also offers dynamic types,
garbage collection, continuations, arithmetic on arbitrary sized
numbers, and other things.

   The two fundamental concepts are dynamic types and garbage
collection.  You need to understand how libguile offers them to C
programs in order to use the rest of libguile.  Also, the more general
control flow of Scheme caused by continuations needs to be dealt with.

   Running asynchronous signal handlers and multi-threading is known to
C code already, but there are of course a few additional rules when
using them together with libguile.

5.4.1 Dynamic Types
-------------------

Scheme is a dynamically-typed language; this means that the system
cannot, in general, determine the type of a given expression at compile
time.  Types only become apparent at run time.  Variables do not have
fixed types; a variable may hold a pair at one point, an integer at the
next, and a thousand-element vector later.  Instead, values, not
variables, have fixed types.

   In order to implement standard Scheme functions like ‘pair?’ and
‘string?’ and provide garbage collection, the representation of every
value must contain enough information to accurately determine its type
at run time.  Often, Scheme systems also use this information to
determine whether a program has attempted to apply an operation to an
inappropriately typed value (such as taking the ‘car’ of a string).

   Because variables, pairs, and vectors may hold values of any type,
Scheme implementations use a uniform representation for values — a
single type large enough to hold either a complete value or a pointer to
a complete value, along with the necessary typing information.

   In Guile, this uniform representation of all Scheme values is the C
type ‘SCM’.  This is an opaque type and its size is typically equivalent
to that of a pointer to ‘void’.  Thus, ‘SCM’ values can be passed around
efficiently and they take up reasonably little storage on their own.

   The most important rule is: You never access a ‘SCM’ value directly;
you only pass it to functions or macros defined in libguile.

   As an obvious example, although a ‘SCM’ variable can contain
integers, you can of course not compute the sum of two ‘SCM’ values by
adding them with the C ‘+’ operator.  You must use the libguile function
‘scm_sum’.

   Less obvious and therefore more important to keep in mind is that you
also cannot directly test ‘SCM’ values for trueness.  In Scheme, the
value ‘#f’ is considered false and of course a ‘SCM’ variable can
represent that value.  But there is no guarantee that the ‘SCM’
representation of ‘#f’ looks false to C code as well.  You need to use
‘scm_is_true’ or ‘scm_is_false’ to test a ‘SCM’ value for trueness or
falseness, respectively.

   You also can not directly compare two ‘SCM’ values to find out
whether they are identical (that is, whether they are ‘eq?’ in Scheme
terms).  You need to use ‘scm_is_eq’ for this.

   The one exception is that you can directly assign a ‘SCM’ value to a
‘SCM’ variable by using the C ‘=’ operator.

   The following (contrived) example shows how to do it right.  It
implements a function of two arguments (A and FLAG) that returns A+1 if
FLAG is true, else it returns A unchanged.

     SCM
     my_incrementing_function (SCM a, SCM flag)
     {
       SCM result;

       if (scm_is_true (flag))
         result = scm_sum (a, scm_from_int (1));
       else
         result = a;

       return result;
     }

   Often, you need to convert between ‘SCM’ values and appropriate C
values.  For example, we needed to convert the integer ‘1’ to its ‘SCM’
representation in order to add it to A.  Libguile provides many function
to do these conversions, both from C to ‘SCM’ and from ‘SCM’ to C.

   The conversion functions follow a common naming pattern: those that
make a ‘SCM’ value from a C value have names of the form ‘scm_from_TYPE
(...)’ and those that convert a ‘SCM’ value to a C value use the form
‘scm_to_TYPE (...)’.

   However, it is best to avoid converting values when you can.  When
you must combine C values and ‘SCM’ values in a computation, it is often
better to convert the C values to ‘SCM’ values and do the computation by
using libguile functions than to the other way around (converting ‘SCM’
to C and doing the computation some other way).

   As a simple example, consider this version of
‘my_incrementing_function’ from above:

     SCM
     my_other_incrementing_function (SCM a, SCM flag)
     {
       int result;

       if (scm_is_true (flag))
         result = scm_to_int (a) + 1;
       else
         result = scm_to_int (a);

       return scm_from_int (result);
     }

   This version is much less general than the original one: it will only
work for values A that can fit into a ‘int’.  The original function will
work for all values that Guile can represent and that ‘scm_sum’ can
understand, including integers bigger than ‘long long’, floating point
numbers, complex numbers, and new numerical types that have been added
to Guile by third-party libraries.

   Also, computing with ‘SCM’ is not necessarily inefficient.  Small
integers will be encoded directly in the ‘SCM’ value, for example, and
do not need any additional memory on the heap.  See *note* Data
Representation:: to find out the details.

   Some special ‘SCM’ values are available to C code without needing to
convert them from C values:

Scheme value   C representation
#f             SCM_BOOL_F
#t             SCM_BOOL_T
()             SCM_EOL

   In addition to ‘SCM’, Guile also defines the related type
‘scm_t_bits’.  This is an unsigned integral type of sufficient size to
hold all information that is directly contained in a ‘SCM’ value.  The
‘scm_t_bits’ type is used internally by Guile to do all the bit
twiddling explained in *note* Data Representation::, but you will
encounter it occasionally in low-level user code as well.

5.4.2 Garbage Collection
------------------------

As explained above, the ‘SCM’ type can represent all Scheme values.
Some values fit entirely into a ‘SCM’ value (such as small integers),
but other values require additional storage in the heap (such as strings
and vectors).  This additional storage is managed automatically by
Guile.  You don’t need to explicitly deallocate it when a ‘SCM’ value is
no longer used.

   Two things must be guaranteed so that Guile is able to manage the
storage automatically: it must know about all blocks of memory that have
ever been allocated for Scheme values, and it must know about all Scheme
values that are still being used.  Given this knowledge, Guile can
periodically free all blocks that have been allocated but are not used
by any active Scheme values.  This activity is called “garbage
collection”.

   Guile’s garbage collector will automatically discover references to
‘SCM’ objects that originate in global variables, static data sections,
function arguments or local variables on the C and Scheme stacks, and
values in machine registers.  Other references to ‘SCM’ objects, such as
those in other random data structures in the C heap that contain fields
of type ‘SCM’, can be made visible to the garbage collector by calling
the functions ‘scm_gc_protect_object’ or ‘scm_permanent_object’.
Collectively, these values form the “root set” of garbage collection;
any value on the heap that is referenced directly or indirectly by a
member of the root set is preserved, and all other objects are eligible
for reclamation.

   In Guile, garbage collection has two logical phases: the “mark
phase”, in which the collector discovers the set of all live objects,
and the “sweep phase”, in which the collector reclaims the resources
associated with dead objects.  The mark phase pauses the program and
traces all ‘SCM’ object references, starting with the root set.  The
sweep phase actually runs concurrently with the main program,
incrementally reclaiming memory as needed by allocation.

   In the mark phase, the garbage collector traces the Scheme stack and
heap “precisely”.  Because the Scheme stack and heap are managed by
Guile, Guile can know precisely where in those data structures it might
find references to other heap objects.  This is not the case,
unfortunately, for pointers on the C stack and static data segment.
Instead of requiring the user to inform Guile about all variables in C
that might point to heap objects, Guile traces the C stack and static
data segment “conservatively”.  That is to say, Guile just treats every
word on the C stack and every C global variable as a potential reference
in to the Scheme heap(1).  Any value that looks like a pointer to a
GC-managed object is treated as such, whether it actually is a reference
or not.  Thus, scanning the C stack and static data segment is
guaranteed to find all actual references, but it might also find words
that only accidentally look like references.  These “false positives”
might keep ‘SCM’ objects alive that would otherwise be considered dead.
While this might waste memory, keeping an object around longer than it
strictly needs to is harmless.  This is why this technique is called
“conservative garbage collection”.  In practice, the wasted memory seems
to be no problem, as the static C root set is almost always finite and
small, given that the Scheme stack is separate from the C stack.

   The stack of every thread is scanned in this way and the registers of
the CPU and all other memory locations where local variables or function
parameters might show up are included in this scan as well.

   The consequence of the conservative scanning is that you can just
declare local variables and function parameters of type ‘SCM’ and be
sure that the garbage collector will not free the corresponding objects.

   However, a local variable or function parameter is only protected as
long as it is really on the stack (or in some register).  As an
optimization, the C compiler might reuse its location for some other
value and the ‘SCM’ object would no longer be protected.  Normally, this
leads to exactly the right behavior: the compiler will only overwrite a
reference when it is no longer needed and thus the object becomes
unprotected precisely when the reference disappears, just as wanted.

   There are situations, however, where a ‘SCM’ object needs to be
around longer than its reference from a local variable or function
parameter.  This happens, for example, when you retrieve some pointer
from a foreign object and work with that pointer directly.  The
reference to the ‘SCM’ foreign object might be dead after the pointer
has been retrieved, but the pointer itself (and the memory pointed to)
is still in use and thus the foreign object must be protected.  The
compiler does not know about this connection and might overwrite the
‘SCM’ reference too early.

   To get around this problem, you can use ‘scm_remember_upto_here_1’
and its cousins.  It will keep the compiler from overwriting the
reference.  *Note* Foreign Object Memory Management::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that Guile does not scan the C heap for references, so a
reference to a ‘SCM’ object from a memory segment allocated with
‘malloc’ will have to use some other means to keep the ‘SCM’ object
alive.  *Note* Garbage Collection Functions::.

5.4.3 Control Flow
------------------

Scheme has a more general view of program flow than C, both locally and
non-locally.

   Controlling the local flow of control involves things like gotos,
loops, calling functions and returning from them.  Non-local control
flow refers to situations where the program jumps across one or more
levels of function activations without using the normal call or return
operations.

   The primitive means of C for local control flow is the ‘goto’
statement, together with ‘if’.  Loops done with ‘for’, ‘while’ or ‘do’
could in principle be rewritten with just ‘goto’ and ‘if’.  In Scheme,
the primitive means for local control flow is the _function call_
(together with ‘if’).  Thus, the repetition of some computation in a
loop is ultimately implemented by a function that calls itself, that is,
by recursion.

   This approach is theoretically very powerful since it is easier to
reason formally about recursion than about gotos.  In C, using recursion
exclusively would not be practical, though, since it would eat up the
stack very quickly.  In Scheme, however, it is practical: function calls
that appear in a “tail position” do not use any additional stack space
(*note* Tail Calls::).

   A function call is in a tail position when it is the last thing the
calling function does.  The value returned by the called function is
immediately returned from the calling function.  In the following
example, the call to ‘bar-1’ is in a tail position, while the call to
‘bar-2’ is not.  (The call to ‘1-’ in ‘foo-2’ is in a tail position,
though.)

     (define (foo-1 x)
       (bar-1 (1- x)))

     (define (foo-2 x)
       (1- (bar-2 x)))

   Thus, when you take care to recurse only in tail positions, the
recursion will only use constant stack space and will be as good as a
loop constructed from gotos.

   Scheme offers a few syntactic abstractions (‘do’ and “named” ‘let’)
that make writing loops slightly easier.

   But only Scheme functions can call other functions in a tail
position: C functions can not.  This matters when you have, say, two
functions that call each other recursively to form a common loop.  The
following (unrealistic) example shows how one might go about determining
whether a non-negative integer N is even or odd.

     (define (my-even? n)
       (cond ((zero? n) #t)
             (else (my-odd? (1- n)))))

     (define (my-odd? n)
       (cond ((zero? n) #f)
             (else (my-even? (1- n)))))

   Because the calls to ‘my-even?’ and ‘my-odd?’ are in tail positions,
these two procedures can be applied to arbitrary large integers without
overflowing the stack.  (They will still take a lot of time, of course.)

   However, when one or both of the two procedures would be rewritten in
C, it could no longer call its companion in a tail position (since C
does not have this concept).  You might need to take this consideration
into account when deciding which parts of your program to write in
Scheme and which in C.

   In addition to calling functions and returning from them, a Scheme
program can also exit non-locally from a function so that the control
flow returns directly to an outer level.  This means that some functions
might not return at all.

   Even more, it is not only possible to jump to some outer level of
control, a Scheme program can also jump back into the middle of a
function that has already exited.  This might cause some functions to
return more than once.

   In general, these non-local jumps are done by invoking
“continuations” that have previously been captured using
‘call-with-current-continuation’.  Guile also offers a slightly
restricted set of functions, ‘catch’ and ‘throw’, that can only be used
for non-local exits.  This restriction makes them more efficient.  Error
reporting (with the function ‘error’) is implemented by invoking
‘throw’, for example.  The functions ‘catch’ and ‘throw’ belong to the
topic of “exceptions”.

   Since Scheme functions can call C functions and vice versa, C code
can experience the more general control flow of Scheme as well.  It is
possible that a C function will not return at all, or will return more
than once.  While C does offer ‘setjmp’ and ‘longjmp’ for non-local
exits, it is still an unusual thing for C code.  In contrast, non-local
exits are very common in Scheme, mostly to report errors.

   You need to be prepared for the non-local jumps in the control flow
whenever you use a function from ‘libguile’: it is best to assume that
any ‘libguile’ function might signal an error or run a pending signal
handler (which in turn can do arbitrary things).

   It is often necessary to take cleanup actions when the control leaves
a function non-locally.  Also, when the control returns non-locally,
some setup actions might be called for.  For example, the Scheme
function ‘with-output-to-port’ needs to modify the global state so that
‘current-output-port’ returns the port passed to ‘with-output-to-port’.
The global output port needs to be reset to its previous value when
‘with-output-to-port’ returns normally or when it is exited non-locally.
Likewise, the port needs to be set again when control enters
non-locally.

   Scheme code can use the ‘dynamic-wind’ function to arrange for the
setting and resetting of the global state.  C code can use the
corresponding ‘scm_internal_dynamic_wind’ function, or a
‘scm_dynwind_begin’/‘scm_dynwind_end’ pair together with suitable
’dynwind actions’ (*note* Dynamic Wind::).

   Instead of coping with non-local control flow, you can also prevent
it by erecting a _continuation barrier_, *Note* Continuation Barriers::.
The function ‘scm_c_with_continuation_barrier’, for example, is
guaranteed to return exactly once.


File: guile.info,  Node: Asynchronous Signals,  Next: Multi-Threading,  Prev: Control Flow,  Up: General Libguile Concepts

5.4.4 Asynchronous Signals
--------------------------

You can not call libguile functions from handlers for POSIX signals, but
you can register Scheme handlers for POSIX signals such as ‘SIGINT’.
These handlers do not run during the actual signal delivery.  Instead,
they are run when the program (more precisely, the thread that the
handler has been registered for) reaches the next _safe point_.

   The libguile functions themselves have many such safe points.
Consequently, you must be prepared for arbitrary actions anytime you
call a libguile function.  For example, even ‘scm_cons’ can contain a
safe point and when a signal handler is pending for your thread, calling
‘scm_cons’ will run this handler and anything might happen, including a
non-local exit although ‘scm_cons’ would not ordinarily do such a thing
on its own.

   If you do not want to allow the running of asynchronous signal
handlers, you can block them temporarily with
‘scm_dynwind_block_asyncs’, for example.  *Note* Asyncs::.

   Since signal handling in Guile relies on safe points, you need to
make sure that your functions do offer enough of them.  Normally,
calling libguile functions in the normal course of action is all that is
needed.  But when a thread might spent a long time in a code section
that calls no libguile function, it is good to include explicit safe
points.  This can allow the user to interrupt your code with <C-c>, for
example.

   You can do this with the macro ‘SCM_TICK’.  This macro is
syntactically a statement.  That is, you could use it like this:

     while (1)
       {
         SCM_TICK;
         do_some_work ();
       }

   Frequent execution of a safe point is even more important in multi
threaded programs, *Note* Multi-Threading::.


File: guile.info,  Node: Multi-Threading,  Prev: Asynchronous Signals,  Up: General Libguile Concepts

5.4.5 Multi-Threading
---------------------

Guile can be used in multi-threaded programs just as well as in
single-threaded ones.

   Each thread that wants to use functions from libguile must put itself
into _guile mode_ and must then follow a few rules.  If it doesn’t want
to honor these rules in certain situations, a thread can temporarily
leave guile mode (but can no longer use libguile functions during that
time, of course).

   Threads enter guile mode by calling ‘scm_with_guile’,
‘scm_boot_guile’, or ‘scm_init_guile’.  As explained in the reference
documentation for these functions, Guile will then learn about the stack
bounds of the thread and can protect the ‘SCM’ values that are stored in
local variables.  When a thread puts itself into guile mode for the
first time, it gets a Scheme representation and is listed by
‘all-threads’, for example.

   Threads in guile mode can block (e.g., do blocking I/O) without
causing any problems(1); temporarily leaving guile mode with
‘scm_without_guile’ before blocking slightly improves GC performance,
though.  For some common blocking operations, Guile provides convenience
functions.  For example, if you want to lock a pthread mutex while in
guile mode, you might want to use ‘scm_pthread_mutex_lock’ which is just
like ‘pthread_mutex_lock’ except that it leaves guile mode while
blocking.

   All libguile functions are (intended to be) robust in the face of
multiple threads using them concurrently.  This means that there is no
risk of the internal data structures of libguile becoming corrupted in
such a way that the process crashes.

   A program might still produce nonsensical results, though.  Taking
hashtables as an example, Guile guarantees that you can use them from
multiple threads concurrently and a hashtable will always remain a valid
hashtable and Guile will not crash when you access it.  It does not
guarantee, however, that inserting into it concurrently from two threads
will give useful results: only one insertion might actually happen, none
might happen, or the table might in general be modified in a totally
arbitrary manner.  (It will still be a valid hashtable, but not the one
that you might have expected.)  Guile might also signal an error when it
detects a harmful race condition.

   Thus, you need to put in additional synchronizations when multiple
threads want to use a single hashtable, or any other mutable Scheme
object.

   When writing C code for use with libguile, you should try to make it
robust as well.  An example that converts a list into a vector will help
to illustrate.  Here is a correct version:

     SCM
     my_list_to_vector (SCM list)
     {
       SCM vector = scm_make_vector (scm_length (list), SCM_UNDEFINED);
       size_t len, i;

       len = scm_c_vector_length (vector);
       i = 0;
       while (i < len && scm_is_pair (list))
         {
           scm_c_vector_set_x (vector, i, scm_car (list));
           list = scm_cdr (list);
           i++;
         }

       return vector;
     }

   The first thing to note is that storing into a ‘SCM’ location
concurrently from multiple threads is guaranteed to be robust: you don’t
know which value wins but it will in any case be a valid ‘SCM’ value.

   But there is no guarantee that the list referenced by LIST is not
modified in another thread while the loop iterates over it.  Thus, while
copying its elements into the vector, the list might get longer or
shorter.  For this reason, the loop must check both that it doesn’t
overrun the vector and that it doesn’t overrun the list.  Otherwise,
‘scm_c_vector_set_x’ would raise an error if the index is out of range,
and ‘scm_car’ and ‘scm_cdr’ would raise an error if the value is not a
pair.

   It is safe to use ‘scm_car’ and ‘scm_cdr’ on the local variable LIST
once it is known that the variable contains a pair.  The contents of the
pair might change spontaneously, but it will always stay a valid pair
(and a local variable will of course not spontaneously point to a
different Scheme object).

   Likewise, a vector such as the one returned by ‘scm_make_vector’ is
guaranteed to always stay the same length so that it is safe to only use
scm_c_vector_length once and store the result.  (In the example, VECTOR
is safe anyway since it is a fresh object that no other thread can
possibly know about until it is returned from ‘my_list_to_vector’.)

   Of course the behavior of ‘my_list_to_vector’ is suboptimal when LIST
does indeed get asynchronously lengthened or shortened in another
thread.  But it is robust: it will always return a valid vector.  That
vector might be shorter than expected, or its last elements might be
unspecified, but it is a valid vector and if a program wants to rule out
these cases, it must avoid modifying the list asynchronously.

   Here is another version that is also correct:

     SCM
     my_pedantic_list_to_vector (SCM list)
     {
       SCM vector = scm_make_vector (scm_length (list), SCM_UNDEFINED);
       size_t len, i;

       len = scm_c_vector_length (vector);
       i = 0;
       while (i < len)
         {
           scm_c_vector_set_x (vector, i, scm_car (list));
           list = scm_cdr (list);
           i++;
         }

       return vector;
     }

   This version relies on the error-checking behavior of ‘scm_car’ and
‘scm_cdr’.  When the list is shortened (that is, when LIST holds a
non-pair), ‘scm_car’ will throw an error.  This might be preferable to
just returning a half-initialized vector.

   The API for accessing vectors and arrays of various kinds from C
takes a slightly different approach to thread-robustness.  In order to
get at the raw memory that stores the elements of an array, you need to
_reserve_ that array as long as you need the raw memory.  During the
time an array is reserved, its elements can still spontaneously change
their values, but the memory itself and other things like the size of
the array are guaranteed to stay fixed.  Any operation that would change
these parameters of an array that is currently reserved will signal an
error.  In order to avoid these errors, a program should of course put
suitable synchronization mechanisms in place.  As you can see, Guile
itself is again only concerned about robustness, not about correctness:
without proper synchronization, your program will likely not be correct,
but the worst consequence is an error message.

   Real thread-safety often requires that a critical section of code is
executed in a certain restricted manner.  A common requirement is that
the code section is not entered a second time when it is already being
executed.  Locking a mutex while in that section ensures that no other
thread will start executing it, blocking asyncs ensures that no
asynchronous code enters the section again from the current thread, and
the error checking of Guile mutexes guarantees that an error is
signalled when the current thread accidentally reenters the critical
section via recursive function calls.

   Guile provides two mechanisms to support critical sections as
outlined above.  You can either use the macros
‘SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_START’ and ‘SCM_CRITICAL_SECTION_END’ for very
simple sections; or use a dynwind context together with a call to
‘scm_dynwind_critical_section’.

   The macros only work reliably for critical sections that are
guaranteed to not cause a non-local exit.  They also do not detect an
accidental reentry by the current thread.  Thus, you should probably
only use them to delimit critical sections that do not contain calls to
libguile functions or to other external functions that might do
complicated things.

   The function ‘scm_dynwind_critical_section’, on the other hand, will
correctly deal with non-local exits because it requires a dynwind
context.  Also, by using a separate mutex for each critical section, it
can detect accidental reentries.

whenever they could block.  This is no longer needed with Guile 2.X.

5.5 Defining New Foreign Object Types
=====================================

The “foreign object type” facility is Guile’s mechanism for importing
object and types from C or other languages into Guile’s system.  If you
have a C ‘struct foo’ type, for example, you can define a corresponding
Guile foreign object type that allows Scheme code to handle ‘struct foo
*’ objects.

   To define a new foreign object type, the programmer provides Guile
with some essential information about the type — what its name is, how
many fields it has, and its finalizer (if any) — and Guile allocates a
fresh type for it.  Foreign objects can be accessed from Scheme or from
C.

5.5.1 Defining Foreign Object Types
-----------------------------------

To create a new foreign object type from C, call
‘scm_make_foreign_object_type’.  It returns a value of type ‘SCM’ which
identifies the new type.

   Here is how one might declare a new type representing eight-bit
gray-scale images:

     #include <libguile.h>

     struct image {
       int width, height;
       char *pixels;

       /* The name of this image */
       SCM name;

       /* A function to call when this image is
          modified, e.g., to update the screen,
          or SCM_BOOL_F if no action necessary */
       SCM update_func;
     };

     static SCM image_type;

     void
     init_image_type (void)
     {
       SCM name, slots;
       scm_t_struct_finalize finalizer;

       name = scm_from_utf8_symbol ("image");
       slots = scm_list_1 (scm_from_utf8_symbol ("data"));
       finalizer = NULL;

       image_type =
         scm_make_foreign_object_type (name, slots, finalizer);
     }

   The result is an initialized ‘image_type’ value that identifies the
new foreign object type.  The next section describes how to create
foreign objects and how to access their slots.

5.5.2 Creating Foreign Objects
------------------------------

Foreign objects contain zero or more “slots” of data.  A slot can hold a
pointer, an integer that fits into a ‘size_t’ or ‘ssize_t’, or a ‘SCM’
value.

   All objects of a given foreign type have the same number of slots.
In the example from the previous section, the ‘image’ type has one slot,
because the slots list passed to ‘scm_make_foreign_object_type’ is of
length one.  (The actual names given to slots are unimportant for most
users of the C interface, but can be used on the Scheme side to
introspect on the foreign object.)

   To construct a foreign object and initialize its first slot, call
‘scm_make_foreign_object_1 (TYPE, FIRST_SLOT_VALUE)’.  There are
similarly named constructors for initializing 0, 1, 2, or 3 slots, or
initializing N slots via an array.  *Note* Foreign Objects::, for full
details.  Any fields that are not explicitly initialized are set to 0.

   To get or set the value of a slot by index, you can use the
‘scm_foreign_object_ref’ and ‘scm_foreign_object_set_x’ functions.
These functions take and return values as ‘void *’ pointers; there are
corresponding convenience procedures like ‘_signed_ref’,
‘_unsigned_set_x’ and so on for dealing with slots as signed or unsigned
integers.

   Foreign objects fields that are pointers can be tricky to manage.  If
possible, it is best that all memory that is referenced by a foreign
object be managed by the garbage collector.  That way, the GC can
automatically ensure that memory is accessible when it is needed, and
freed when it becomes inaccessible.  If this is not the case for your
program – for example, if you are exposing an object to Scheme that was
allocated by some other, Guile-unaware part of your program – then you
will probably need to implement a finalizer.  *Note* Foreign Object
Memory Management::, for more.

   Continuing the example from the previous section, if the global
variable ‘image_type’ contains the type returned by
‘scm_make_foreign_object_type’, here is how we could construct a foreign
object whose “data” field contains a pointer to a freshly allocated
‘struct image’:

     SCM
     make_image (SCM name, SCM s_width, SCM s_height)
     {
       struct image *image;
       int width = scm_to_int (s_width);
       int height = scm_to_int (s_height);

       /* Allocate the `struct image'.  Because we
          use scm_gc_malloc, this memory block will
          be automatically reclaimed when it becomes
          inaccessible, and its members will be traced
          by the garbage collector.  */
       image = (struct image *)
         scm_gc_malloc (sizeof (struct image), "image");

       image->width = width;
       image->height = height;

       /* Allocating the pixels with
          scm_gc_malloc_pointerless means that the
          pixels data is collectable by GC, but
          that GC shouldn't spend time tracing its
          contents for nested pointers because there
          aren't any.  */
       image->pixels =
         scm_gc_malloc_pointerless (width * height, "image pixels");

       image->name = name;
       image->update_func = SCM_BOOL_F;

       /* Now wrap the struct image* in a new foreign
          object, and return that object.  */
       return scm_make_foreign_object_1 (image_type, image);
     }

   We use ‘scm_gc_malloc_pointerless’ for the pixel buffer to tell the
garbage collector not to scan it for pointers.  Calls to
‘scm_gc_malloc’, ‘scm_make_foreign_object_1’, and
‘scm_gc_malloc_pointerless’ raise an exception in out-of-memory
conditions; the garbage collector is able to reclaim previously
allocated memory if that happens.

5.5.3 Type Checking of Foreign Objects
--------------------------------------

Functions that operate on foreign objects should check that the passed
‘SCM’ value indeed is of the correct type before accessing its data.
They can do this with ‘scm_assert_foreign_object_type’.

   For example, here is a simple function that operates on an image
object, and checks the type of its argument.

     SCM
     clear_image (SCM image_obj)
     {
       int area;
       struct image *image;

       scm_assert_foreign_object_type (image_type, image_obj);

       image = scm_foreign_object_ref (image_obj, 0);
       area = image->width * image->height;
       memset (image->pixels, 0, area);

       /* Invoke the image's update function.  */
       if (scm_is_true (image->update_func))
         scm_call_0 (image->update_func);

       return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
     }


File: guile.info,  Node: Foreign Object Memory Management,  Next: Foreign Objects and Scheme,  Prev: Type Checking of Foreign Objects,  Up: Defining New Foreign Object Types

5.5.4 Foreign Object Memory Management
--------------------------------------

Once a foreign object has been released to the tender mercies of the
Scheme system, it must be prepared to survive garbage collection.  In
the example above, all the memory associated with the foreign object is
managed by the garbage collector because we used the ‘scm_gc_’
allocation functions.  Thus, no special care must be taken: the garbage
collector automatically scans them and reclaims any unused memory.

   However, when data associated with a foreign object is managed in
some other way—e.g., ‘malloc’’d memory or file descriptors—it is
possible to specify a “finalizer” function to release those resources
when the foreign object is reclaimed.

   As discussed in *note* Garbage Collection::, Guile’s garbage collector
will reclaim inaccessible memory as needed.  This reclamation process
runs concurrently with the main program.  When Guile analyzes the heap
and determines that an object’s memory can be reclaimed, that memory is
put on a “free list” of objects that can be reclaimed.  Usually that’s
the end of it—the object is available for immediate re-use.  However
some objects can have “finalizers” associated with them—functions that
are called on reclaimable objects to effect any external cleanup
actions.

   Finalizers are tricky business and it is best to avoid them.  They
can be invoked at unexpected times, or not at all—for example, they are
not invoked on process exit.  They don’t help the garbage collector do
its job; in fact, they are a hindrance.  Furthermore, they perturb the
garbage collector’s internal accounting.  The GC decides to scan the
heap when it thinks that it is necessary, after some amount of
allocation.  Finalizable objects almost always represent an amount of
allocation that is invisible to the garbage collector.  The effect can
be that the actual resource usage of a system with finalizable objects
is higher than what the GC thinks it should be.

   All those caveats aside, some foreign object types will need
finalizers.  For example, if we had a foreign object type that wrapped
file descriptors—and we aren’t suggesting this, as Guile already has
ports —then you might define the type like this:

     static SCM file_type;

     static void
     finalize_file (SCM file)
     {
       int fd = scm_foreign_object_signed_ref (file, 0);
       if (fd >= 0)
         {
           scm_foreign_object_signed_set_x (file, 0, -1);
           close (fd);
         }
     }

     static void
     init_file_type (void)
     {
       SCM name, slots;
       scm_t_struct_finalize finalizer;

       name = scm_from_utf8_symbol ("file");
       slots = scm_list_1 (scm_from_utf8_symbol ("fd"));
       finalizer = finalize_file;

       image_type =
         scm_make_foreign_object_type (name, slots, finalizer);
     }

     static SCM
     make_file (int fd)
     {
       return scm_make_foreign_object_1 (file_type, (void *) fd);
     }

   Note that the finalizer may be invoked in ways and at times you might
not expect.  In a Guile built without threading support, finalizers are
invoked via “asyncs”, which interleaves them with running Scheme code;
*note* Asyncs::.  If the user’s Guile is built with support for threads,
the finalizer will probably be called by a dedicated finalization
thread, unless the user invokes ‘scm_run_finalizers ()’ explicitly.

   In either case, finalizers run concurrently with the main program,
and so they need to be async-safe and thread-safe.  If for some reason
this is impossible, perhaps because you are embedding Guile in some
application that is not itself thread-safe, you have a few options.  One
is to use guardians instead of finalizers, and arrange to pump the
guardians for finalizable objects.  *Note* Guardians::, for more
information.  The other option is to disable automatic finalization
entirely, and arrange to call ‘scm_run_finalizers ()’ at appropriate
points.  *Note* Foreign Objects::, for more on these interfaces.

   Finalizers are allowed to allocate memory, access GC-managed memory,
and in general can do anything any Guile user code can do.  This was not
the case in Guile 1.8, where finalizers were much more restricted.  In
particular, in Guile 2.0, finalizers can resuscitate objects.  We do not
recommend that users avail themselves of this possibility, however, as a
resuscitated object can re-expose other finalizable objects that have
been already finalized back to Scheme.  These objects will not be
finalized again, but they could cause use-after-free problems to code
that handles objects of that particular foreign object type.  To guard
against this possibility, robust finalization routines should clear
state from the foreign object, as in the above ‘free_file’ example.

   One final caveat.  Foreign object finalizers are associated with the
lifetime of a foreign object, not of its fields.  If you access a field
of a finalizable foreign object, and do not arrange to keep a reference
on the foreign object itself, it could be that the outer foreign object
gets finalized while you are working with its field.

   For example, consider a procedure to read some data from a file, from
our example above.

     SCM
     read_bytes (SCM file, SCM n)
     {
       int fd;
       SCM buf;
       size_t len, pos;

       scm_assert_foreign_object_type (file_type, file);

       fd = scm_foreign_object_signed_ref (file, 0);
       if (fd < 0)
         scm_wrong_type_arg_msg ("read-bytes", SCM_ARG1,
                                 file, "open file");

       len = scm_to_size_t (n);
       SCM buf = scm_c_make_bytevector (scm_to_size_t (n));

       pos = 0;
       while (pos < len)
         {
           char *bytes = SCM_BYTEVECTOR_CONTENTS (buf);
           ssize_t count = read (fd, bytes + pos, len - pos);
           if (count < 0)
             scm_syserror ("read-bytes");
           if (count == 0)
             break;
           pos += count;
         }

       scm_remember_upto_here_1 (file);

       return scm_values (scm_list_2 (buf, scm_from_size_t (pos)));
     }

   After the prelude, only the ‘fd’ value is used and the C compiler has
no reason to keep the ‘file’ object around.  If ‘scm_c_make_bytevector’
results in a garbage collection, ‘file’ might not be on the stack or
anywhere else and could be finalized, leaving ‘read’ to read a closed
(or, in a multi-threaded program, possibly re-used) file descriptor.
The use of ‘scm_remember_upto_here_1’ prevents this, by creating a
reference to ‘file’ after all data accesses.  *Note* Garbage Collection
Functions::.

   ‘scm_remember_upto_here_1’ is only needed on finalizable objects,
because garbage collection of other values is invisible to the program –
it happens when needed, and is not observable.  But if you can, save
yourself the headache and build your program in such a way that it
doesn’t need finalization.

5.5.5 Foreign Objects and Scheme
--------------------------------

It is also possible to create foreign objects and object types from
Scheme, and to access fields of foreign objects from Scheme.  For
example, the file example from the last section could be equivalently
expressed as:

     (define-module (my-file)
       #:use-module (system foreign-object)
       #:use-module ((oop goops) #:select (make))
       #:export (make-file))

     (define (finalize-file file)
       (let ((fd (struct-ref file 0)))
         (unless (< fd 0)
           (struct-set! file 0 -1)
           (close-fdes fd))))

     (define <file>
       (make-foreign-object-type '<file> '(fd)
                                 #:finalizer finalize-file))

     (define (make-file fd)
       (make <file> #:fd fd))

   Here we see that the result of ‘make-foreign-object-type’, which is
the equivalent of ‘scm_make_foreign_object_type’, is a struct vtable.
*Note* Vtables::, for more information.  To instantiate the foreign
object, which is really a Guile struct, we use ‘make’.  (We could have
used ‘make-struct/no-tail’, but as an implementation detail, finalizers
are attached in the ‘initialize’ method called by ‘make’).  To access
the fields, we use ‘struct-ref’ and ‘struct-set!’.  *Note* Structure
Basics::.

   There is a convenience syntax, ‘define-foreign-object-type’, that
defines a type along with a constructor, and getters for the fields.  An
appropriate invocation of ‘define-foreign-object-type’ for the file
object type could look like this:

     (use-modules (system foreign-object))

     (define-foreign-object-type <file>
       make-file
       (fd)
       #:finalizer finalize-file)

   This defines the ‘<file>’ type with one field, a ‘make-file’
constructor, and a getter for the ‘fd’ field, bound to ‘fd’.

   Foreign object types are not only vtables but are actually GOOPS
classes, as hinted at above.  *Note* GOOPS::, for more on Guile’s
object-oriented programming system.  Thus one can define print and
equality methods using GOOPS:

     (use-modules (oop goops))

     (define-method (write (file <file>) port)
       ;; Assuming existence of the `fd' getter
       (format port "#<<file> ~a>" (fd file)))

     (define-method (equal? (a <file>) (b <file>))
       (eqv? (fd a) (fd b)))

   One can even sub-class foreign types.

     (define-class <named-file> (<file>)
       (name #:init-keyword #:name #:init-value #f #:accessor name))

   The question arises of how to construct these values, given that
‘make-file’ returns a plain old ‘<file>’ object.  It turns out that you
can use the GOOPS construction interface, where every field of the
foreign object has an associated initialization keyword argument.

     (define* (my-open-file name #:optional (flags O_RDONLY))
       (make <named-file> #:fd (open-fdes name flags) #:name name))

     (define-method (write (file <named-file>) port)
       (format port "#<<file> ~s ~a>" (name file) (fd file)))

   *Note* Foreign Objects::, for full documentation on the Scheme
interface to foreign objects.  *Note* GOOPS::, for more on GOOPS.

   As a final note, you might wonder how this system supports
encapsulation of sensitive values.  First, we have to recognize that
some facilities are essentially unsafe and have global scope.  For
example, in C, the integrity and confidentiality of a part of a program
is at the mercy of every other part of that program – because any part
of the program can read and write anything in its address space.  At the
same time, principled access to structured data is organized in C on
lexical boundaries; if you don’t expose accessors for your object, you
trust other parts of the program not to work around that barrier.

   The situation is not dissimilar in Scheme.  Although Scheme’s unsafe
constructs are fewer in number than in C, they do exist.  The ‘(system
foreign)’ module can be used to violate confidentiality and integrity,
and shouldn’t be exposed to untrusted code.  Although ‘struct-ref’ and
‘struct-set!’ are less unsafe, they still have a cross-cutting
capability of drilling through abstractions.  Performing a ‘struct-set!’
on a foreign object slot could cause unsafe foreign code to crash.
Ultimately, structures in Scheme are capabilities for abstraction, and
not abstractions themselves.

   That leaves us with the lexical capabilities, like constructors and
accessors.  Here is where encapsulation lies: the practical degree to
which the innards of your foreign objects are exposed is the degree to
which their accessors are lexically available in user code.  If you want
to allow users to reference fields of your foreign object, provide them
with a getter.  Otherwise you should assume that the only access to your
object may come from your code, which has the relevant authority, or via
code with access to cross-cutting ‘struct-ref’ and such, which also has
the cross-cutting authority.


File: guile.info,  Node: Function Snarfing,  Next: Programming Overview,  Prev: Defining New Foreign Object Types,  Up: Programming in C

5.6 Function Snarfing
=====================

When writing C code for use with Guile, you typically define a set of C
functions, and then make some of them visible to the Scheme world by
calling ‘scm_c_define_gsubr’ or related functions.  If you have many
functions to publish, it can sometimes be annoying to keep the list of
calls to ‘scm_c_define_gsubr’ in sync with the list of function
definitions.

   Guile provides the ‘guile-snarf’ program to manage this problem.
Using this tool, you can keep all the information needed to define the
function alongside the function definition itself; ‘guile-snarf’ will
extract this information from your source code, and automatically
generate a file of calls to ‘scm_c_define_gsubr’ which you can
‘#include’ into an initialization function.

   The snarfing mechanism works for many kind of initialization actions,
not just for collecting calls to ‘scm_c_define_gsubr’.  For a full list
of what can be done, *Note* Snarfing Macros::.

   The ‘guile-snarf’ program is invoked like this:

     guile-snarf [-o OUTFILE] [CPP-ARGS ...]

   This command will extract initialization actions to OUTFILE.  When no
OUTFILE has been specified or when OUTFILE is ‘-’, standard output will
be used.  The C preprocessor is called with CPP-ARGS (which usually
include an input file) and the output is filtered to extract the
initialization actions.

   If there are errors during processing, OUTFILE is deleted and the
program exits with non-zero status.

   During snarfing, the pre-processor macro ‘SCM_MAGIC_SNARFER’ is
defined.  You could use this to avoid including snarfer output files
that don’t yet exist by writing code like this:

     #ifndef SCM_MAGIC_SNARFER
     #include "foo.x"
     #endif

   Here is how you might define the Scheme function ‘clear-image’,
implemented by the C function ‘clear_image’:

     #include <libguile.h>

     SCM_DEFINE (clear_image, "clear-image", 1, 0, 0,
                 (SCM image),
                 "Clear the image.")
     {
       /* C code to clear the image in image... */
     }

     void
     init_image_type ()
     {
     #include "image-type.x"
     }

   The ‘SCM_DEFINE’ declaration says that the C function ‘clear_image’
implements a Scheme function called ‘clear-image’, which takes one
required argument (of type ‘SCM’ and named ‘image’), no optional
arguments, and no rest argument.  The string ‘"Clear the image."’
provides a short help text for the function, it is called a “docstring”.

   ‘SCM_DEFINE’ macro also defines a static array of characters
initialized to the Scheme name of the function.  In this case,
‘s_clear_image’ is set to the C string, "clear-image".  You might want
to use this symbol when generating error messages.

   Assuming the text above lives in a file named ‘image-type.c’, you
will need to execute the following command to prepare this file for
compilation:

     guile-snarf -o image-type.x image-type.c

   This scans ‘image-type.c’ for ‘SCM_DEFINE’ declarations, and writes
to ‘image-type.x’ the output:

     scm_c_define_gsubr ("clear-image", 1, 0, 0, (SCM (*)() ) clear_image);

   When compiled normally, ‘SCM_DEFINE’ is a macro which expands to the
function header for ‘clear_image’.

   Note that the output file name matches the ‘#include’ from the input
file.  Also, you still need to provide all the same information you
would if you were using ‘scm_c_define_gsubr’ yourself, but you can place
the information near the function definition itself, so it is less
likely to become incorrect or out-of-date.

   If you have many files that ‘guile-snarf’ must process, you should
consider using a fragment like the following in your Makefile:

     snarfcppopts = $(DEFS) $(INCLUDES) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS)
     .SUFFIXES: .x
     .c.x:
      guile-snarf -o $@ $< $(snarfcppopts)

   This tells make to run ‘guile-snarf’ to produce each needed ‘.x’ file
from the corresponding ‘.c’ file.

   The program ‘guile-snarf’ passes its command-line arguments directly
to the C preprocessor, which it uses to extract the information it needs
from the source code.  this means you can pass normal compilation flags
to ‘guile-snarf’ to define preprocessor symbols, add header file
directories, and so on.

5.7 An Overview of Guile Programming
====================================

Guile is designed as an extension language interpreter that is
straightforward to integrate with applications written in C (and C++).
The big win here for the application developer is that Guile
integration, as the Guile web page says, “lowers your project’s
hacktivation energy.” Lowering the hacktivation energy means that you,
as the application developer, _and your users_, reap the benefits that
flow from being able to extend the application in a high level extension
language rather than in plain old C.

   In abstract terms, it’s difficult to explain what this really means
and what the integration process involves, so instead let’s begin by
jumping straight into an example of how you might integrate Guile into
an existing program, and what you could expect to gain by so doing.
With that example under our belts, we’ll then return to a more general
analysis of the arguments involved and the range of programming options
available.

File: guile.info,  Node: Dia Objective,  Next: Dia Steps,  Up: Extending Dia

### 5.7.1.1 Deciding Why You Want to Add Guile
..........................................

First off, you should understand why you want to add Guile to Dia at
all, and that means forming a picture of what Dia does and how it does
it.  So, what are the constituents of the Dia application?

   • Most importantly, the “application domain objects” — in other
     words, the concepts that differentiate Dia from another application
     such as a word processor or spreadsheet: shapes, templates,
     connectors, pages, plus the properties of all these things.

   • The code that manages the graphical face of the application,
     including the layout and display of the objects above.

   • The code that handles input events, which indicate that the
     application user is wanting to do something.

(In other words, a textbook example of the “model - view - controller”
paradigm.)

   Next question: how will Dia benefit once the Guile integration is
complete?  Several (positive!)  answers are possible here, and the
choice is obviously up to the application developers.  Still, one answer
is that the main benefit will be the ability to manipulate Dia’s
application domain objects from Scheme.

   Suppose that Dia made a set of procedures available in Scheme,
representing the most basic operations on objects such as shapes,
connectors, and so on.  Using Scheme, the application user could then
write code that builds upon these basic operations to create more
complex procedures.  For example, given basic procedures to enumerate
the objects on a page, to determine whether an object is a square, and
to change the fill pattern of a single shape, the user can write a
Scheme procedure to change the fill pattern of all squares on the
current page:

     (define (change-squares'-fill-pattern new-pattern)
       (for-each-shape current-page
         (lambda (shape)
           (if (square? shape)
               (change-fill-pattern shape new-pattern)))))

### 5.7.1.2 Four Steps Required to Add Guile
........................................

Assuming this objective, four steps are needed to achieve it.

   First, you need a way of representing your application-specific
objects — such as ‘shape’ in the previous example — when they are passed
into the Scheme world.  Unless your objects are so simple that they map
naturally into builtin Scheme data types like numbers and strings, you
will probably want to use Guile’s “foreign object” interface to create a
new Scheme data type for your objects.

   Second, you need to write code for the basic operations like
‘for-each-shape’ and ‘square?’ such that they access and manipulate your
existing data structures correctly, and then make these operations
available as “primitives” on the Scheme level.

   Third, you need to provide some mechanism within the Dia application
that a user can hook into to cause arbitrary Scheme code to be
evaluated.

   Finally, you need to restructure your top-level application C code a
little so that it initializes the Guile interpreter correctly and
declares your “foreign objects” and “primitives” to the Scheme world.

   The following subsections expand on these four points in turn.

### 5.7.1.3 How to Represent Dia Data in Scheme
...........................................

For all but the most trivial applications, you will probably want to
allow some representation of your domain objects to exist on the Scheme
level.  This is where foreign objects come in, and with them issues of
lifetime management and garbage collection.

   To get more concrete about this, let’s look again at the example we
gave earlier of how application users can use Guile to build
higher-level functions from the primitives that Dia itself provides.

     (define (change-squares'-fill-pattern new-pattern)
       (for-each-shape current-page
         (lambda (shape)
           (if (square? shape)
               (change-fill-pattern shape new-pattern)))))

   Consider what is stored here in the variable ‘shape’.  For each shape
on the current page, the ‘for-each-shape’ primitive calls ‘(lambda
(shape) ...)’ with an argument representing that shape.  Question is:
how is that argument represented on the Scheme level?  The issues are as
follows.

   • Whatever the representation, it has to be decodable again by the C
     code for the ‘square?’ and ‘change-fill-pattern’ primitives.  In
     other words, a primitive like ‘square?’ has somehow to be able to
     turn the value that it receives back into something that points to
     the underlying C structure describing a shape.

   • The representation must also cope with Scheme code holding on to
     the value for later use.  What happens if the Scheme code stores
     ‘shape’ in a global variable, but then that shape is deleted (in a
     way that the Scheme code is not aware of), and later on some other
     Scheme code uses that global variable again in a call to, say,
     ‘square?’?

   • The lifetime and memory allocation of objects that exist _only_ in
     the Scheme world is managed automatically by Guile’s garbage
     collector using one simple rule: when there are no remaining
     references to an object, the object is considered dead and so its
     memory is freed.  But for objects that exist in both C and Scheme,
     the picture is more complicated; in the case of Dia, where the
     ‘shape’ argument passes transiently in and out of the Scheme world,
     it would be quite wrong the *delete* the underlying C shape just
     because the Scheme code has finished evaluation.  How do we avoid
     this happening?

   One resolution of these issues is for the Scheme-level representation
of a shape to be a new, Scheme-specific C structure wrapped up as a
foreign object.  The foreign object is what is passed into and out of
Scheme code, and the Scheme-specific C structure inside the foreign
object points to Dia’s underlying C structure so that the code for
primitives like ‘square?’ can get at it.

   To cope with an underlying shape being deleted while Scheme code is
still holding onto a Scheme shape value, the underlying C structure
should have a new field that points to the Scheme-specific foreign
object.  When a shape is deleted, the relevant code chains through to
the Scheme-specific structure and sets its pointer back to the
underlying structure to NULL. Thus the foreign object value for the
shape continues to exist, but any primitive code that tries to use it
will detect that the underlying shape has been deleted because the
underlying structure pointer is NULL.

   So, to summarize the steps involved in this resolution of the problem
(and assuming that the underlying C structure for a shape is ‘struct
dia_shape’):

   • Define a new Scheme-specific structure that _points_ to the
     underlying C structure:

          struct dia_guile_shape
          {
            struct dia_shape * c_shape;   /* NULL => deleted */
          }

   • Add a field to ‘struct dia_shape’ that points to its ‘struct
     dia_guile_shape’ if it has one —

          struct dia_shape
          {
            ...
            struct dia_guile_shape * guile_shape;
          }

     — so that C code can set ‘guile_shape->c_shape’ to NULL when the
     underlying shape is deleted.

   • Wrap ‘struct dia_guile_shape’ as a foreign object type.

   • Whenever you need to represent a C shape onto the Scheme level,
     create a foreign object instance for it, and pass that.

   • In primitive code that receives a shape foreign object instance,
     check the ‘c_shape’ field when decoding it, to find out whether the
     underlying C shape is still there.

   As far as memory management is concerned, the foreign object values
and their Scheme-specific structures are under the control of the
garbage collector, whereas the underlying C structures are explicitly
managed in exactly the same way that Dia managed them before we thought
of adding Guile.

   When the garbage collector decides to free a shape foreign object
value, it calls the “finalizer” function that was specified when
defining the shape foreign object type.  To maintain the correctness of
the ‘guile_shape’ field in the underlying C structure, this function
should chain through to the underlying C structure (if it still exists)
and set its ‘guile_shape’ field to NULL.

### 5.7.1.4 Writing Guile Primitives for Dia
........................................

Once the details of object representation are decided, writing the
primitive function code that you need is usually straightforward.

   A primitive is simply a C function whose arguments and return value
are all of type ‘SCM’, and whose body does whatever you want it to do.
As an example, here is a possible implementation of the ‘square?’
primitive:

     static SCM square_p (SCM shape)
     {
       struct dia_guile_shape * guile_shape;

       /* Check that arg is really a shape object. */
       scm_assert_foreign_object_type (shape_type, shape);

       /* Access Scheme-specific shape structure. */
       guile_shape = scm_foreign_object_ref (shape, 0);

       /* Find out if underlying shape exists and is a
          square; return answer as a Scheme boolean. */
       return scm_from_bool (guile_shape->c_shape &&
                             (guile_shape->c_shape->type == DIA_SQUARE));
     }

   Notice how easy it is to chain through from the ‘SCM shape’ parameter
that ‘square_p’ receives — which is a foreign object — to the
Scheme-specific structure inside the foreign object, and thence to the
underlying C structure for the shape.

   In this code, ‘scm_assert_foreign_object_type’,
‘scm_foreign_object_ref’, and ‘scm_from_bool’ are from the standard
Guile API. We assume that ‘shape_type’ was given to us when we made the
shape foreign object type, using ‘scm_make_foreign_object_type’.  The
call to ‘scm_assert_foreign_object_type’ ensures that SHAPE is indeed a
shape.  This is needed to guard against Scheme code using the ‘square?’
procedure incorrectly, as in ‘(square? "hello")’; Scheme’s latent typing
means that usage errors like this must be caught at run time.

   Having written the C code for your primitives, you need to make them
available as Scheme procedures by calling the ‘scm_c_define_gsubr’
function.  ‘scm_c_define_gsubr’ (*note* Primitive Procedures::) takes
arguments that specify the Scheme-level name for the primitive and how
many required, optional and rest arguments it can accept.  The ‘square?’
primitive always requires exactly one argument, so the call to make it
available in Scheme reads like this:

     scm_c_define_gsubr ("square?", 1, 0, 0, square_p);

   For where to put this call, see the subsection after next on the
structure of Guile-enabled code (*note* Dia Structure::).

### 5.7.1.5 Providing a Hook for the Evaluation of Scheme Code
..........................................................

To make the Guile integration useful, you have to design some kind of
hook into your application that application users can use to cause their
Scheme code to be evaluated.

   Technically, this is straightforward; you just have to decide on a
mechanism that is appropriate for your application.  Think of Emacs, for
example: when you type ‘<ESC> :’, you get a prompt where you can type in
any Elisp code, which Emacs will then evaluate.  Or, again like Emacs,
you could provide a mechanism (such as an init file) to allow Scheme
code to be associated with a particular key sequence, and evaluate the
code when that key sequence is entered.

   In either case, once you have the Scheme code that you want to
evaluate, as a null terminated string, you can tell Guile to evaluate it
by calling the ‘scm_c_eval_string’ function.


File: guile.info,  Node: Dia Structure,  Next: Dia Advanced,  Prev: Dia Hook,  Up: Extending Dia

### 5.7.1.6 Top-level Structure of Guile-enabled Dia
................................................

Let’s assume that the pre-Guile Dia code looks structurally like this:

   • ‘main ()’

        • do lots of initialization and setup stuff
        • enter Gtk main loop

   When you add Guile to a program, one (rather technical) requirement
is that Guile’s garbage collector needs to know where the bottom of the
C stack is.  The easiest way to ensure this is to use ‘scm_boot_guile’
like this:

   • ‘main ()’

        • do lots of initialization and setup stuff
        • ‘scm_boot_guile (argc, argv, inner_main, NULL)’

   • ‘inner_main ()’

        • define all foreign object types
        • export primitives to Scheme using ‘scm_c_define_gsubr’
        • enter Gtk main loop

   In other words, you move the guts of what was previously in your
‘main’ function into a new function called ‘inner_main’, and then add a
‘scm_boot_guile’ call, with ‘inner_main’ as a parameter, to the end of
‘main’.

   Assuming that you are using foreign objects and have written
primitive code as described in the preceding subsections, you also need
to insert calls to declare your new foreign objects and export the
primitives to Scheme.  These declarations must happen _inside_ the
dynamic scope of the ‘scm_boot_guile’ call, but also _before_ any code
is run that could possibly use them — the beginning of ‘inner_main’ is
an ideal place for this.

### 5.7.1.7 Going Further with Dia and Guile
........................................

The steps described so far implement an initial Guile integration that
already gives a lot of additional power to Dia application users.  But
there are further steps that you could take, and it’s interesting to
consider a few of these.

   In general, you could progressively move more of Dia’s source code
from C into Scheme.  This might make the code more maintainable and
extensible, and it could open the door to new programming paradigms that
are tricky to effect in C but straightforward in Scheme.

   A specific example of this is that you could use the guile-gtk
package, which provides Scheme-level procedures for most of the Gtk+
library, to move the code that lays out and displays Dia objects from C
to Scheme.

   As you follow this path, it naturally becomes less useful to maintain
a distinction between Dia’s original non-Guile-related source code, and
its later code implementing foreign objects and primitives for the
Scheme world.

   For example, suppose that the original source code had a
‘dia_change_fill_pattern’ function:

     void dia_change_fill_pattern (struct dia_shape * shape,
                                   struct dia_pattern * pattern)
     {
       /* real pattern change work */
     }

   During initial Guile integration, you add a ‘change_fill_pattern’
primitive for Scheme purposes, which accesses the underlying structures
from its foreign object values and uses ‘dia_change_fill_pattern’ to do
the real work:

     SCM change_fill_pattern (SCM shape, SCM pattern)
     {
       struct dia_shape * d_shape;
       struct dia_pattern * d_pattern;

       ...

       dia_change_fill_pattern (d_shape, d_pattern);

       return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
     }

   At this point, it makes sense to keep ‘dia_change_fill_pattern’ and
‘change_fill_pattern’ separate, because ‘dia_change_fill_pattern’ can
also be called without going through Scheme at all, say because the user
clicks a button which causes a C-registered Gtk+ callback to be called.

   But, if the code for creating buttons and registering their callbacks
is moved into Scheme (using guile-gtk), it may become true that
‘dia_change_fill_pattern’ can no longer be called other than through
Scheme.  In which case, it makes sense to abolish it and move its
contents directly into ‘change_fill_pattern’, like this:

     SCM change_fill_pattern (SCM shape, SCM pattern)
     {
       struct dia_shape * d_shape;
       struct dia_pattern * d_pattern;

       ...

       /* real pattern change work */

       return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
     }

   So further Guile integration progressively _reduces_ the amount of
functional C code that you have to maintain over the long term.

   A similar argument applies to data representation.  In the discussion
of foreign objects earlier, issues arose because of the different memory
management and lifetime models that normally apply to data structures in
C and in Scheme.  However, with further Guile integration, you can
resolve this issue in a more radical way by allowing all your data
structures to be under the control of the garbage collector, and kept
alive by references from the Scheme world.  Instead of maintaining an
array or linked list of shapes in C, you would instead maintain a list
in Scheme.

   Rather like the coalescing of ‘dia_change_fill_pattern’ and
‘change_fill_pattern’, the practical upshot of such a change is that you
would no longer have to keep the ‘dia_shape’ and ‘dia_guile_shape’
structures separate, and so wouldn’t need to worry about the pointers
between them.  Instead, you could change the foreign object definition
to wrap the ‘dia_shape’ structure directly, and send ‘dia_guile_shape’
off to the scrap yard.  Cut out the middle man!

   Finally, we come to the holy grail of Guile’s free software /
extension language approach.  Once you have a Scheme representation for
interesting Dia data types like shapes, and a handy bunch of primitives
for manipulating them, it suddenly becomes clear that you have a bundle
of functionality that could have far-ranging use beyond Dia itself.  In
other words, the data types and primitives could now become a library,
and Dia becomes just one of the many possible applications using that
library — albeit, at this early stage, a rather important one!

   In this model, Guile becomes just the glue that binds everything
together.  Imagine an application that usefully combined functionality
from Dia, Gnumeric and GnuCash — it’s tricky right now, because no such
application yet exists; but it’ll happen some day ...

5.7.2 Why Scheme is More Hackable Than C
----------------------------------------

Underlying Guile’s value proposition is the assumption that programming
in a high level language, specifically Guile’s implementation of Scheme,
is necessarily better in some way than programming in C. What do we mean
by this claim, and how can we be so sure?

   One class of advantages applies not only to Scheme, but more
generally to any interpretable, high level, scripting language, such as
Emacs Lisp, Python, Ruby, or TeX’s macro language.  Common features of
all such languages, when compared to C, are that:

   • They lend themselves to rapid and experimental development cycles,
     owing usually to a combination of their interpretability and the
     integrated development environment in which they are used.

   • They free developers from some of the low level bookkeeping tasks
     associated with C programming, notably memory management.

   • They provide high level features such as container objects and
     exception handling that make common programming tasks easier.

   In the case of Scheme, particular features that make programming
easier — and more fun!  — are its powerful mechanisms for abstracting
parts of programs (closures — *note* About Closure::) and for iteration
(*note* while do::).

   The evidence in support of this argument is empirical: the huge
amount of code that has been written in extension languages for
applications that support this mechanism.  Most notable are extensions
written in Emacs Lisp for GNU Emacs, in TeX’s macro language for TeX,
and in Script-Fu for the Gimp, but there is increasingly now a
significant code eco-system for Guile-based applications as well, such
as Lilypond and GnuCash.  It is close to inconceivable that similar
amounts of functionality could have been added to these applications
just by writing new code in their base implementation languages.

5.7.3 Example: Using Guile for an Application Testbed
-----------------------------------------------------

As an example of what this means in practice, imagine writing a testbed
for an application that is tested by submitting various requests (via a
C interface) and validating the output received.  Suppose further that
the application keeps an idea of its current state, and that the
“correct” output for a given request may depend on the current
application state.  A complete “white box”(1) test plan for this
application would aim to submit all possible requests in each
distinguishable state, and validate the output for all request/state
combinations.

   To write all this test code in C would be very tedious.  Suppose
instead that the testbed code adds a single new C function, to submit an
arbitrary request and return the response, and then uses Guile to export
this function as a Scheme procedure.  The rest of the testbed can then
be written in Scheme, and so benefits from all the advantages of
programming in Scheme that were described in the previous section.

   (In this particular example, there is an additional benefit of
writing most of the testbed in Scheme.  A common problem for white box
testing is that mistakes and mistaken assumptions in the application
under test can easily be reproduced in the testbed code.  It is more
difficult to copy mistakes like this when the testbed is written in a
different language from the application.)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) A “white box” test plan is one that incorporates knowledge of the
internal design of the application under test.

5.7.4 A Choice of Programming Options
-------------------------------------

The preceding arguments and example point to a model of Guile
programming that is applicable in many cases.  According to this model,
Guile programming involves a balance between C and Scheme programming,
with the aim being to extract the greatest possible Scheme level benefit
from the least amount of C level work.

   The C level work required in this model usually consists of packaging
and exporting functions and application objects such that they can be
seen and manipulated on the Scheme level.  To help with this, Guile’s C
language interface includes utility features that aim to make this kind
of integration very easy for the application developer.

   This model, though, is really just one of a range of possible
programming options.  If all of the functionality that you need is
available from Scheme, you could choose instead to write your whole
application in Scheme (or one of the other high level languages that
Guile supports through translation), and simply use Guile as an
interpreter for Scheme.  (In the future, we hope that Guile will also be
able to compile Scheme code, so lessening the performance gap between C
and Scheme code.)  Or, at the other end of the C–Scheme scale, you could
write the majority of your application in C, and only call out to Guile
occasionally for specific actions such as reading a configuration file
or executing a user-specified extension.  The choices boil down to two
basic questions:

   • Which parts of the application do you write in C, and which in
     Scheme (or another high level translated language)?

   • How do you design the interface between the C and Scheme parts of
     your application?

   These are of course design questions, and the right design for any
given application will always depend upon the particular requirements
that you are trying to meet.  In the context of Guile, however, there
are some generally applicable considerations that can help you when
designing your answers.

File: guile.info,  Node: Available Functionality,  Next: Basic Constraints,  Up: Programming Options

### 5.7.4.1 What Functionality is Already Available?
................................................

Suppose, for the sake of argument, that you would prefer to write your
whole application in Scheme.  Then the API available to you consists of:

   • standard Scheme

   • plus the extensions to standard Scheme provided by Guile in its
     core distribution

   • plus any additional functionality that you or others have packaged
     so that it can be loaded as a Guile Scheme module.

   A module in the last category can either be a pure Scheme module — in
other words a collection of utility procedures coded in Scheme — or a
module that provides a Scheme interface to an extension library coded in
C — in other words a nice package where someone else has done the work
of wrapping up some useful C code for you.  The set of available modules
is growing quickly and already includes such useful examples as ‘(gtk
gtk)’, which makes Gtk+ drawing functions available in Scheme, and
‘(database postgres)’, which provides SQL access to a Postgres database.

   Given the growing collection of pre-existing modules, it is quite
feasible that your application could be implemented by combining a
selection of these modules together with new application code written in
Scheme.

   If this approach is not enough, because the functionality that your
application needs is not already available in this form, and it is
impossible to write the new functionality in Scheme, you will need to
write some C code.  If the required function is already available in C
(e.g. in a library), all you need is a little glue to connect it to the
world of Guile.  If not, you need both to write the basic code and to
plumb it into Guile.

   In either case, two general considerations are important.  Firstly,
what is the interface by which the functionality is presented to the
Scheme world?  Does the interface consist only of function calls (for
example, a simple drawing interface), or does it need to include
“objects” of some kind that can be passed between C and Scheme and
manipulated by both worlds.  Secondly, how does the lifetime and memory
management of objects in the C code relate to the garbage collection
governed approach of Scheme objects?  In the case where the basic C code
is not already written, most of the difficulties of memory management
can be avoided by using Guile’s C interface features from the start.

existing C code to the Guile world, see *note* Defining New Foreign
Object Types::, *note* Primitive Procedures::, and *note* Foreign Function
Interface::.

5.7.5 How About Application Users?
----------------------------------

So far we have considered what Guile programming means for an
application developer.  But what if you are instead _using_ an existing
Guile-based application, and want to know what your options are for
programming and extending this application?

   The answer to this question varies from one application to another,
because the options available depend inevitably on whether the
application developer has provided any hooks for you to hang your own
code on and, if there are such hooks, what they allow you to do.(1)  For
example...

   • If the application permits you to load and execute any Guile code,
     the world is your oyster.  You can extend the application in any
     way that you choose.

   • A more cautious application might allow you to load and execute
     Guile code, but only in a “safe” environment, where the interface
     available is restricted by the application from the standard Guile
     API.

   • Or a really fearful application might not provide a hook to really
     execute user code at all, but just use Scheme syntax as a
     convenient way for users to specify application data or
     configuration options.

   In the last two cases, what you can do is, by definition, restricted
by the application, and you should refer to the application’s own manual
to find out your options.

   The most well known example of the first case is Emacs, with its
extension language Emacs Lisp: as well as being a text editor, Emacs
supports the loading and execution of arbitrary Emacs Lisp code.  The
result of such openness has been dramatic: Emacs now benefits from
user-contributed Emacs Lisp libraries that extend the basic editing
function to do everything from reading news to psychoanalysis and
playing adventure games.  The only limitation is that extensions are
restricted to the functionality provided by Emacs’s built-in set of
primitive operations.  For example, you can interact and display data by
manipulating the contents of an Emacs buffer, but you can’t pop-up and
draw a window with a layout that is totally different to the Emacs
standard.

   This situation with a Guile application that supports the loading of
arbitrary user code is similar, except perhaps even more so, because
Guile also supports the loading of extension libraries written in C.
This last point enables user code to add new primitive operations to
Guile, and so to bypass the limitation present in Emacs Lisp.

   At this point, the distinction between an application developer and
an application user becomes rather blurred.  Instead of seeing yourself
as a user extending an application, you could equally well say that you
are developing a new application of your own using some of the primitive
functionality provided by the original application.  As such, all the
discussions of the preceding sections of this chapter are relevant to
how you can proceed with developing your extension.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Of course, in the world of free software, you always have the
freedom to modify the application’s source code to your own
requirements.  Here we are concerned with the extension options that the
application has provided for without your needing to modify its source
code.

5.8.1 Autoconf Background
-------------------------

As explained in the ‘GNU Autoconf Manual’, any package needs
configuration at build-time (*note* Introduction: (autoconf)Top.).  If
your package uses Guile (or uses a package that in turn uses Guile), you
probably need to know what specific Guile features are available and
details about them.

   The way to do this is to write feature tests and arrange for their
execution by the ‘configure’ script, typically by adding the tests to
‘configure.ac’, and running ‘autoconf’ to create ‘configure’.  Users of
your package then run ‘configure’ in the normal way.

   Macros are a way to make common feature tests easy to express.
Autoconf provides a wide range of macros (*note* (autoconf)Existing
Tests::), and Guile installation provides Guile-specific tests in the
areas of: program detection, compilation flags reporting, and Scheme
module checks.

5.8.2 Autoconf Macros
---------------------

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, Guile supports parallel
installation, and uses ‘pkg-config’ to let the user choose which version
of Guile they are interested in.  ‘pkg-config’ has its own set of
Autoconf macros that are probably installed on most every development
system.  The most useful of these macros is ‘PKG_CHECK_MODULES’.

     PKG_CHECK_MODULES([GUILE], [guile-3.0])

   This example looks for Guile and sets the ‘GUILE_CFLAGS’ and
‘GUILE_LIBS’ variables accordingly, or prints an error and exits if
Guile was not found.

   Guile comes with additional Autoconf macros providing more
information, installed as ‘PREFIX/share/aclocal/guile.m4’.  Their names
all begin with ‘GUILE_’.

 -- Autoconf Macro: GUILE_PKG [VERSIONS]

     This macro runs the ‘pkg-config’ tool to find development files for
     an available version of Guile.

     By default, this macro will search for the latest stable version of
     Guile (e.g.  3.0), falling back to the previous stable version
     (e.g.  2.2) if it is available.  If no guile-VERSION.pc file is
     found, an error is signalled.  The found version is stored in
     GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION.

     If ‘GUILE_PROGS’ was already invoked, this macro ensures that the
     development files have the same effective version as the Guile
     program.

     GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION is marked for substitution, as by
     ‘AC_SUBST’.

 -- Autoconf Macro: GUILE_FLAGS

     This macro runs the ‘pkg-config’ tool to find out how to compile
     and link programs against Guile.  It sets four variables:
     GUILE_CFLAGS, GUILE_LDFLAGS, GUILE_LIBS, and GUILE_LTLIBS.

     GUILE_CFLAGS: flags to pass to a C or C++ compiler to build code
     that uses Guile header files.  This is almost always just one or
     more ‘-I’ flags.

     GUILE_LDFLAGS: flags to pass to the compiler to link a program
     against Guile.  This includes ‘-lguile-VERSION’ for the Guile
     library itself, and may also include one or more ‘-L’ flag to tell
     the compiler where to find the libraries.  But it does not include
     flags that influence the program’s runtime search path for
     libraries, and will therefore lead to a program that fails to
     start, unless all necessary libraries are installed in a standard
     location such as ‘/usr/lib’.

     GUILE_LIBS and GUILE_LTLIBS: flags to pass to the compiler or to
     libtool, respectively, to link a program against Guile.  It
     includes flags that augment the program’s runtime search path for
     libraries, so that shared libraries will be found at the location
     where they were during linking, even in non-standard locations.
     GUILE_LIBS is to be used when linking the program directly with the
     compiler, whereas GUILE_LTLIBS is to be used when linking the
     program is done through libtool.

     The variables are marked for substitution, as by ‘AC_SUBST’.

 -- Autoconf Macro: GUILE_SITE_DIR

     This looks for Guile’s "site" directories.  The variable GUILE_SITE
     will be set to Guile’s "site" directory for Scheme source files
     (usually something like PREFIX/share/guile/site).
     GUILE_SITE_CCACHE will be set to the directory for compiled Scheme
     files also known as ‘.go’ files (usually something like
     PREFIX/lib/guile/GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION/site-ccache).
     GUILE_EXTENSION will be set to the directory for compiled C
     extensions (usually something like
     PREFIX/lib/guile/GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION/extensions).  The latter
     two are set to blank if the particular version of Guile does not
     support them.  Note that this macro will run the macros ‘GUILE_PKG’
     and ‘GUILE_PROGS’ if they have not already been run.

     The variables are marked for substitution, as by ‘AC_SUBST’.

 -- Autoconf Macro: GUILE_PROGS [VERSION]

     This macro looks for programs ‘guile’ and ‘guild’, setting
     variables GUILE and GUILD to their paths, respectively.  The macro
     will attempt to find ‘guile’ with the suffix of ‘-X.Y’, followed by
     looking for it with the suffix ‘X.Y’, and then fall back to looking
     for ‘guile’ with no suffix.  If ‘guile’ is still not found, signal
     an error.  The suffix, if any, that was required to find ‘guile’
     will be used for ‘guild’ as well.

     By default, this macro will search for the latest stable version of
     Guile (e.g.  3.0).  x.y or x.y.z versions can be specified.  If an
     older version is found, the macro will signal an error.

     The effective version of the found ‘guile’ is set to
     GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION.  This macro ensures that the effective
     version is compatible with the result of a previous invocation of
     ‘GUILE_FLAGS’, if any.

     As a legacy interface, it also looks for ‘guile-config’ and
     ‘guile-tools’, setting GUILE_CONFIG and GUILE_TOOLS.

     The variables are marked for substitution, as by ‘AC_SUBST’.

 -- Autoconf Macro: GUILE_CHECK_RETVAL var check

     VAR is a shell variable name to be set to the return value.  CHECK
     is a Guile Scheme expression, evaluated with "$GUILE -c", and
     returning either 0 or non-#f to indicate the check passed.  Non-0
     number or #f indicates failure.  Avoid using the character "#"
     since that confuses autoconf.

 -- Autoconf Macro: GUILE_MODULE_CHECK var module featuretest
          description

     VAR is a shell variable name to be set to "yes" or "no".  MODULE is
     a list of symbols, like: (ice-9 common-list).  FEATURETEST is an
     expression acceptable to GUILE_CHECK, q.v.  DESCRIPTION is a
     present-tense verb phrase (passed to AC_MSG_CHECKING).

 -- Autoconf Macro: GUILE_MODULE_AVAILABLE var module

     VAR is a shell variable name to be set to "yes" or "no".  MODULE is
     a list of symbols, like: (ice-9 common-list).

 -- Autoconf Macro: GUILE_MODULE_REQUIRED symlist

     SYMLIST is a list of symbols, WITHOUT surrounding parens, like:
     ice-9 common-list.

 -- Autoconf Macro: GUILE_MODULE_EXPORTS var module modvar

     VAR is a shell variable to be set to "yes" or "no".  MODULE is a
     list of symbols, like: (ice-9 common-list).  MODVAR is the Guile
     Scheme variable to check.

 -- Autoconf Macro: GUILE_MODULE_REQUIRED_EXPORT module modvar

     MODULE is a list of symbols, like: (ice-9 common-list).  MODVAR is
     the Guile Scheme variable to check.

5.8.3 Using Autoconf Macros
---------------------------

Using the autoconf macros is straightforward: Add the macro "calls"
(actually instantiations) to ‘configure.ac’, run ‘aclocal’, and finally,
run ‘autoconf’.  If your system doesn’t have guile.m4 installed, place
the desired macro definitions (‘AC_DEFUN’ forms) in ‘acinclude.m4’, and
‘aclocal’ will do the right thing.

   Some of the macros can be used inside normal shell constructs: ‘if
foo ; then GUILE_BAZ ; fi’, but this is not guaranteed.  It’s probably a
good idea to instantiate macros at top-level.

   We now include two examples, one simple and one complicated.

   The first example is for a package that uses libguile, and thus needs
to know how to compile and link against it.  So we use
‘PKG_CHECK_MODULES’ to set the vars ‘GUILE_CFLAGS’ and ‘GUILE_LIBS’,
which are automatically substituted in the Makefile.

     In configure.ac:

       PKG_CHECK_MODULES([GUILE], [guile-3.0])

     In Makefile.in:

       GUILE_CFLAGS  = @GUILE_CFLAGS@
       GUILE_LIBS = @GUILE_LIBS@

       myprog.o: myprog.c
               $(CC) -o $ $(GUILE_CFLAGS) $<
       myprog: myprog.o
               $(CC) -o $ $< $(GUILE_LIBS)

   The second example is for a package of Guile Scheme modules that uses
an external program and other Guile Scheme modules (some might call this
a "pure scheme" package).  So we use the ‘GUILE_SITE_DIR’ macro, a
regular ‘AC_PATH_PROG’ macro, and the ‘GUILE_MODULE_AVAILABLE’ macro.

     In configure.ac:

       GUILE_SITE_DIR

       probably_wont_work=""

       # pgtype pgtable
       GUILE_MODULE_AVAILABLE(have_guile_pg, (database postgres))
       test $have_guile_pg = no &&
           probably_wont_work="(my pgtype) (my pgtable) $probably_wont_work"

       # gpgutils
       AC_PATH_PROG(GNUPG,gpg)
       test x"$GNUPG" = x &&
           probably_wont_work="(my gpgutils) $probably_wont_work"

       if test ! "$probably_wont_work" = "" ; then
           p="         ***"
           echo
           echo "$p"
           echo "$p NOTE:"
           echo "$p The following modules probably won't work:"
           echo "$p   $probably_wont_work"
           echo "$p They can be installed anyway, and will work if their"
           echo "$p dependencies are installed later.  Please see README."
           echo "$p"
           echo
       fi

     In Makefile.in:

       instdir = @GUILE_SITE@/my

       install:
             $(INSTALL) my/*.scm $(instdir)

6.1 Overview of the Guile API
=============================

Guile’s application programming interface (“API”) makes functionality
available that an application developer can use in either C or Scheme
programming.  The interface consists of “elements” that may be macros,
functions or variables in C, and procedures, variables, syntax or other
types of object in Scheme.

   Many elements are available to both Scheme and C, in a form that is
appropriate.  For example, the ‘assq’ Scheme procedure is also available
as ‘scm_assq’ to C code.  These elements are documented only once,
addressing both the Scheme and C aspects of them.

   The Scheme name of an element is related to its C name in a regular
way.  Also, a C function takes its parameters in a systematic way.

   Normally, the name of a C function can be derived given its Scheme
name, using some simple textual transformations:

   • Replace ‘-’ (hyphen) with ‘_’ (underscore).

   • Replace ‘?’ (question mark) with ‘_p’.

   • Replace ‘!’ (exclamation point) with ‘_x’.

   • Replace internal ‘->’ with ‘_to_’.

   • Replace ‘<=’ (less than or equal) with ‘_leq’.

   • Replace ‘>=’ (greater than or equal) with ‘_geq’.

   • Replace ‘<’ (less than) with ‘_less’.

   • Replace ‘>’ (greater than) with ‘_gr’.

   • Prefix with ‘scm_’.

   A C function always takes a fixed number of arguments of type ‘SCM’,
even when the corresponding Scheme function takes a variable number.

   For some Scheme functions, some last arguments are optional; the
corresponding C function must always be invoked with all optional
arguments specified.  To get the effect as if an argument has not been
specified, pass ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’ as its value.  You can not do this for
an argument in the middle; when one argument is ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’ all the
ones following it must be ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’ as well.

   Some Scheme functions take an arbitrary number of _rest_ arguments;
the corresponding C function must be invoked with a list of all these
arguments.  This list is always the last argument of the C function.

   These two variants can also be combined.

   The type of the return value of a C function that corresponds to a
Scheme function is always ‘SCM’.  In the descriptions below, types are
therefore often omitted but for the return value and for the arguments.

6.2 Deprecation
===============

From time to time functions and other features of Guile become obsolete.
Guile’s “deprecation” is a mechanism that can help you cope with this.

   When you use a feature that is deprecated, you will likely get a
warning message at run-time.  Also, if you have a new enough toolchain,
using a deprecated function from ‘libguile’ will cause a link-time
warning.

   The primary source for information about just what interfaces are
deprecated in a given release is the file ‘NEWS’.  That file also
documents what you should use instead of the obsoleted things.

   The file ‘README’ contains instructions on how to control the
inclusion or removal of the deprecated features from the public API of
Guile, and how to control the deprecation warning messages.

   The idea behind this mechanism is that normally all deprecated
interfaces are available, but you get feedback when compiling and
running code that uses them, so that you can migrate to the newer APIs
at your leisure.


File: guile.info,  Node: The SCM Type,  Next: Initialization,  Prev: Deprecation,  Up: API Reference

6.3 The SCM Type
================

Guile represents all Scheme values with the single C type ‘SCM’.  For an
introduction to this topic, *Note* Dynamic Types::.

 -- C Type: SCM
     ‘SCM’ is the user level abstract C type that is used to represent
     all of Guile’s Scheme objects, no matter what the Scheme object
     type is.  No C operation except assignment is guaranteed to work
     with variables of type ‘SCM’, so you should only use macros and
     functions to work with ‘SCM’ values.  Values are converted between
     C data types and the ‘SCM’ type with utility functions and macros.

 -- C Type: scm_t_bits
     ‘scm_t_bits’ is an unsigned integral data type that is guaranteed
     to be large enough to hold all information that is required to
     represent any Scheme object.  While this data type is mostly used
     to implement Guile’s internals, the use of this type is also
     necessary to write certain kinds of extensions to Guile.

 -- C Type: scm_t_signed_bits
     This is a signed integral type of the same size as ‘scm_t_bits’.

 -- C Macro: scm_t_bits SCM_UNPACK (SCM X)
     Transforms the ‘SCM’ value X into its representation as an integral
     type.  Only after applying ‘SCM_UNPACK’ it is possible to access
     the bits and contents of the ‘SCM’ value.

 -- C Macro: SCM SCM_PACK (scm_t_bits X)
     Takes a valid integral representation of a Scheme object and
     transforms it into its representation as a ‘SCM’ value.

6.4 Initializing Guile
======================

Each thread that wants to use functions from the Guile API needs to put
itself into guile mode with either ‘scm_with_guile’ or ‘scm_init_guile’.
The global state of Guile is initialized automatically when the first
thread enters guile mode.

   When a thread wants to block outside of a Guile API function, it
should leave guile mode temporarily with ‘scm_without_guile’, *Note*
Blocking::.

   Threads that are created by ‘call-with-new-thread’ or
‘scm_spawn_thread’ start out in guile mode so you don’t need to
initialize them.

 -- C Function: void * scm_with_guile (void *(*func)(void *), void
          *data)
     Call FUNC, passing it DATA and return what FUNC returns.  While
     FUNC is running, the current thread is in guile mode and can thus
     use the Guile API.

     When ‘scm_with_guile’ is called from guile mode, the thread remains
     in guile mode when ‘scm_with_guile’ returns.

     Otherwise, it puts the current thread into guile mode and, if
     needed, gives it a Scheme representation that is contained in the
     list returned by ‘all-threads’, for example.  This Scheme
     representation is not removed when ‘scm_with_guile’ returns so that
     a given thread is always represented by the same Scheme value
     during its lifetime, if at all.

     When this is the first thread that enters guile mode, the global
     state of Guile is initialized before calling ‘func’.

     The function FUNC is called via ‘scm_with_continuation_barrier’;
     thus, ‘scm_with_guile’ returns exactly once.

     When ‘scm_with_guile’ returns, the thread is no longer in guile
     mode (except when ‘scm_with_guile’ was called from guile mode, see
     above).  Thus, only ‘func’ can store ‘SCM’ variables on the stack
     and be sure that they are protected from the garbage collector.
     See ‘scm_init_guile’ for another approach at initializing Guile
     that does not have this restriction.

     It is OK to call ‘scm_with_guile’ while a thread has temporarily
     left guile mode via ‘scm_without_guile’.  It will then simply
     temporarily enter guile mode again.

 -- C Function: void scm_init_guile ()
     Arrange things so that all of the code in the current thread
     executes as if from within a call to ‘scm_with_guile’.  That is,
     all functions called by the current thread can assume that ‘SCM’
     values on their stack frames are protected from the garbage
     collector (except when the thread has explicitly left guile mode,
     of course).

     When ‘scm_init_guile’ is called from a thread that already has been
     in guile mode once, nothing happens.  This behavior matters when
     you call ‘scm_init_guile’ while the thread has only temporarily
     left guile mode: in that case the thread will not be in guile mode
     after ‘scm_init_guile’ returns.  Thus, you should not use
     ‘scm_init_guile’ in such a scenario.

     When a uncaught throw happens in a thread that has been put into
     guile mode via ‘scm_init_guile’, a short message is printed to the
     current error port and the thread is exited via ‘scm_pthread_exit
     (NULL)’.  No restrictions are placed on continuations.

     The function ‘scm_init_guile’ might not be available on all
     platforms since it requires some stack-bounds-finding magic that
     might not have been ported to all platforms that Guile runs on.
     Thus, if you can, it is better to use ‘scm_with_guile’ or its
     variation ‘scm_boot_guile’ instead of this function.

 -- C Function: void scm_boot_guile (int ARGC, char **ARGV, void
          (*MAIN_FUNC) (void *DATA, int ARGC, char **ARGV), void *DATA)
     Enter guile mode as with ‘scm_with_guile’ and call MAIN_FUNC,
     passing it DATA, ARGC, and ARGV as indicated.  When MAIN_FUNC
     returns, ‘scm_boot_guile’ calls ‘exit (0)’; ‘scm_boot_guile’ never
     returns.  If you want some other exit value, have MAIN_FUNC call
     ‘exit’ itself.  If you don’t want to exit at all, use
     ‘scm_with_guile’ instead of ‘scm_boot_guile’.

     The function ‘scm_boot_guile’ arranges for the Scheme
     ‘command-line’ function to return the strings given by ARGC and
     ARGV.  If MAIN_FUNC modifies ARGC or ARGV, it should call
     ‘scm_set_program_arguments’ with the final list, so Scheme code
     will know which arguments have been processed (*note* Runtime
     Environment::).

 -- C Function: void scm_shell (int ARGC, char **ARGV)
     Process command-line arguments in the manner of the ‘guile’
     executable.  This includes loading the normal Guile initialization
     files, interacting with the user or running any scripts or
     expressions specified by ‘-s’ or ‘-e’ options, and then exiting.
     *Note* Invoking Guile::, for more details.

     Since this function does not return, you must do all
     application-specific initialization before calling this function.


File: guile.info,  Node: Snarfing Macros,  Next: Data Types,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: API Reference

6.5 Snarfing Macros
===================

The following macros do two different things: when compiled normally,
they expand in one way; when processed during snarfing, they cause the
‘guile-snarf’ program to pick up some initialization code, *Note*
Function Snarfing::.

   The descriptions below use the term ‘normally’ to refer to the case
when the code is compiled normally, and ‘while snarfing’ when the code
is processed by ‘guile-snarf’.

 -- C Macro: SCM_SNARF_INIT (code)

     Normally, ‘SCM_SNARF_INIT’ expands to nothing; while snarfing, it
     causes CODE to be included in the initialization action file,
     followed by a semicolon.

     This is the fundamental macro for snarfing initialization actions.
     The more specialized macros below use it internally.

 -- C Macro: SCM_DEFINE (c_name, scheme_name, req, opt, var, arglist,
          docstring)

     Normally, this macro expands into

          static const char s_C_NAME[] = SCHEME_NAME;
          SCM
          C_NAME ARGLIST

     While snarfing, it causes

          scm_c_define_gsubr (s_C_NAME, REQ, OPT, VAR,
                              C_NAME);

     to be added to the initialization actions.  Thus, you can use it to
     declare a C function named C_NAME that will be made available to
     Scheme with the name SCHEME_NAME.

     Note that the ARGLIST argument must have parentheses around it.

 -- C Macro: SCM_SYMBOL (c_name, scheme_name)
 -- C Macro: SCM_GLOBAL_SYMBOL (c_name, scheme_name)
     Normally, these macros expand into

          static SCM C_NAME

     or

          SCM C_NAME

     respectively.  While snarfing, they both expand into the
     initialization code

          C_NAME = scm_permanent_object (scm_from_locale_symbol (SCHEME_NAME));

     Thus, you can use them declare a static or global variable of type
     ‘SCM’ that will be initialized to the symbol named SCHEME_NAME.

 -- C Macro: SCM_KEYWORD (c_name, scheme_name)
 -- C Macro: SCM_GLOBAL_KEYWORD (c_name, scheme_name)
     Normally, these macros expand into

          static SCM C_NAME

     or

          SCM C_NAME

     respectively.  While snarfing, they both expand into the
     initialization code

          C_NAME = scm_permanent_object (scm_c_make_keyword (SCHEME_NAME));

     Thus, you can use them declare a static or global variable of type
     ‘SCM’ that will be initialized to the keyword named SCHEME_NAME.

 -- C Macro: SCM_VARIABLE (c_name, scheme_name)
 -- C Macro: SCM_GLOBAL_VARIABLE (c_name, scheme_name)
     These macros are equivalent to ‘SCM_VARIABLE_INIT’ and
     ‘SCM_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_INIT’, respectively, with a VALUE of
     ‘SCM_BOOL_F’.

 -- C Macro: SCM_VARIABLE_INIT (c_name, scheme_name, value)
 -- C Macro: SCM_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_INIT (c_name, scheme_name, value)

     Normally, these macros expand into

          static SCM C_NAME

     or

          SCM C_NAME

     respectively.  While snarfing, they both expand into the
     initialization code

          C_NAME = scm_permanent_object (scm_c_define (SCHEME_NAME, VALUE));

     Thus, you can use them declare a static or global C variable of
     type ‘SCM’ that will be initialized to the object representing the
     Scheme variable named SCHEME_NAME in the current module.  The
     variable will be defined when it doesn’t already exist.  It is
     always set to VALUE.

6.6.1 Booleans
--------------

The two boolean values are ‘#t’ for true and ‘#f’ for false.  They can
also be written as ‘#true’ and ‘#false’, as per R7RS.

   Boolean values are returned by predicate procedures, such as the
general equality predicates ‘eq?’, ‘eqv?’ and ‘equal?’ (*note*
Equality::) and numerical and string comparison operators like
‘string=?’ (*note* String Comparison::) and ‘<=’ (*note* Comparison::).

     (<= 3 8)
     ⇒ #t

     (<= 3 -3)
     ⇒ #f

     (equal? "house" "houses")
     ⇒ #f

     (eq? #f #f)
     ⇒
     #t

   In test condition contexts like ‘if’ and ‘cond’ (*note*
Conditionals::), where a group of subexpressions will be evaluated only
if a CONDITION expression evaluates to “true”, “true” means any value at
all except ‘#f’.

     (if #t "yes" "no")
     ⇒ "yes"

     (if 0 "yes" "no")
     ⇒ "yes"

     (if #f "yes" "no")
     ⇒ "no"

   A result of this asymmetry is that typical Scheme source code more
often uses ‘#f’ explicitly than ‘#t’: ‘#f’ is necessary to represent an
‘if’ or ‘cond’ false value, whereas ‘#t’ is not necessary to represent
an ‘if’ or ‘cond’ true value.

   It is important to note that ‘#f’ is *not* equivalent to any other
Scheme value.  In particular, ‘#f’ is not the same as the number 0 (like
in C and C++), and not the same as the “empty list” (like in some Lisp
dialects).

   In C, the two Scheme boolean values are available as the two
constants ‘SCM_BOOL_T’ for ‘#t’ and ‘SCM_BOOL_F’ for ‘#f’.  Care must be
taken with the false value ‘SCM_BOOL_F’: it is not false when used in C
conditionals.  In order to test for it, use ‘scm_is_false’ or
‘scm_is_true’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: not x
 -- C Function: scm_not (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if X is ‘#f’, else return ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: boolean? obj
 -- C Function: scm_boolean_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is either ‘#t’ or ‘#f’, else return ‘#f’.

 -- C Macro: SCM SCM_BOOL_T
     The ‘SCM’ representation of the Scheme object ‘#t’.

 -- C Macro: SCM SCM_BOOL_F
     The ‘SCM’ representation of the Scheme object ‘#f’.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_true (SCM obj)
     Return ‘0’ if OBJ is ‘#f’, else return ‘1’.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_false (SCM obj)
     Return ‘1’ if OBJ is ‘#f’, else return ‘0’.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_bool (SCM obj)
     Return ‘1’ if OBJ is either ‘#t’ or ‘#f’, else return ‘0’.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_bool (int val)
     Return ‘#f’ if VAL is ‘0’, else return ‘#t’.

 -- C Function: int scm_to_bool (SCM val)
     Return ‘1’ if VAL is ‘SCM_BOOL_T’, return ‘0’ when VAL is
     ‘SCM_BOOL_F’, else signal a ‘wrong type’ error.

     You should probably use ‘scm_is_true’ instead of this function when
     you just want to test a ‘SCM’ value for trueness.

### 6.6.2.1 Scheme’s Numerical “Tower”
..................................

Scheme’s numerical “tower” consists of the following categories of
numbers:

“integers”
     Whole numbers, positive or negative; e.g. –5, 0, 18.

“rationals”
     The set of numbers that can be expressed as P/Q where P and Q are
     integers; e.g. 9/16 works, but pi (an irrational number) doesn’t.
     These include integers (N/1).

“real numbers”
     The set of numbers that describes all possible positions along a
     one-dimensional line.  This includes rationals as well as
     irrational numbers.

“complex numbers”
     The set of numbers that describes all possible positions in a two
     dimensional space.  This includes real as well as imaginary numbers
     (A+Bi, where A is the “real part”, B is the “imaginary part”, and i
     is the square root of −1.)

   It is called a tower because each category “sits on” the one that
follows it, in the sense that every integer is also a rational, every
rational is also real, and every real number is also a complex number
(but with zero imaginary part).

   In addition to the classification into integers, rationals, reals and
complex numbers, Scheme also distinguishes between whether a number is
represented exactly or not.  For example, the result of 2*sin(pi/4) is
exactly 2^(1/2), but Guile can represent neither pi/4 nor 2^(1/2)
exactly.  Instead, it stores an inexact approximation, using the C type
‘double’.

   Guile can represent exact rationals of any magnitude, inexact
rationals that fit into a C ‘double’, and inexact complex numbers with
‘double’ real and imaginary parts.

   The ‘number?’ predicate may be applied to any Scheme value to
discover whether the value is any of the supported numerical types.

 -- Scheme Procedure: number? obj
 -- C Function: scm_number_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is any kind of number, else ‘#f’.

   For example:

     (number? 3)
     ⇒ #t

     (number? "hello there!")
     ⇒ #f

     (define pi 3.141592654)
     (number? pi)
     ⇒ #t

 -- C Function: int scm_is_number (SCM obj)
     This is equivalent to ‘scm_is_true (scm_number_p (obj))’.

   The next few subsections document each of Guile’s numerical data
types in detail.

### 6.6.2.2 Integers
................

Integers are whole numbers, that is numbers with no fractional part,
such as 2, 83, and −3789.

   Integers in Guile can be arbitrarily big, as shown by the following
example.

     (define (factorial n)
       (let loop ((n n) (product 1))
         (if (= n 0)
             product
             (loop (- n 1) (* product n)))))

     (factorial 3)
     ⇒ 6

     (factorial 20)
     ⇒ 2432902008176640000

     (- (factorial 45))
     ⇒ -119622220865480194561963161495657715064383733760000000000

   Readers whose background is in programming languages where integers
are limited by the need to fit into just 4 or 8 bytes of memory may find
this surprising, or suspect that Guile’s representation of integers is
inefficient.  In fact, Guile achieves a near optimal balance of
convenience and efficiency by using the host computer’s native
representation of integers where possible, and a more general
representation where the required number does not fit in the native
form.  Conversion between these two representations is automatic and
completely invisible to the Scheme level programmer.

   C has a host of different integer types, and Guile offers a host of
functions to convert between them and the ‘SCM’ representation.  For
example, a C ‘int’ can be handled with ‘scm_to_int’ and ‘scm_from_int’.
Guile also defines a few C integer types of its own, to help with
differences between systems.

   C integer types that are not covered can be handled with the generic
‘scm_to_signed_integer’ and ‘scm_from_signed_integer’ for signed types,
or with ‘scm_to_unsigned_integer’ and ‘scm_from_unsigned_integer’ for
unsigned types.

   Scheme integers can be exact and inexact.  For example, a number
written as ‘3.0’ with an explicit decimal-point is inexact, but it is
also an integer.  The functions ‘integer?’ and ‘scm_is_integer’ report
true for such a number, but the functions ‘exact-integer?’,
‘scm_is_exact_integer’, ‘scm_is_signed_integer’, and
‘scm_is_unsigned_integer’ only allow exact integers and thus report
false.  Likewise, the conversion functions like ‘scm_to_signed_integer’
only accept exact integers.

   The motivation for this behavior is that the inexactness of a number
should not be lost silently.  If you want to allow inexact integers, you
can explicitly insert a call to ‘inexact->exact’ or to its C equivalent
‘scm_inexact_to_exact’.  (Only inexact integers will be converted by
this call into exact integers; inexact non-integers will become exact
fractions.)

 -- Scheme Procedure: integer? x
 -- C Function: scm_integer_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if X is an exact or inexact integer number, else return
     ‘#f’.

          (integer? 487)
          ⇒ #t

          (integer? 3.0)
          ⇒ #t

          (integer? -3.4)
          ⇒ #f

          (integer? +inf.0)
          ⇒ #f

 -- C Function: int scm_is_integer (SCM x)
     This is equivalent to ‘scm_is_true (scm_integer_p (x))’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: exact-integer? x
 -- C Function: scm_exact_integer_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if X is an exact integer number, else return ‘#f’.

          (exact-integer? 37)
          ⇒ #t

          (exact-integer? 3.0)
          ⇒ #f

 -- C Function: int scm_is_exact_integer (SCM x)
     This is equivalent to ‘scm_is_true (scm_exact_integer_p (x))’.

 -- C Type: scm_t_int8
 -- C Type: scm_t_uint8
 -- C Type: scm_t_int16
 -- C Type: scm_t_uint16
 -- C Type: scm_t_int32
 -- C Type: scm_t_uint32
 -- C Type: scm_t_int64
 -- C Type: scm_t_uint64
 -- C Type: scm_t_intmax
 -- C Type: scm_t_uintmax
     The C types are equivalent to the corresponding ISO C types but are
     defined on all platforms, with the exception of ‘scm_t_int64’ and
     ‘scm_t_uint64’, which are only defined when a 64-bit type is
     available.  For example, ‘scm_t_int8’ is equivalent to ‘int8_t’.

     You can regard these definitions as a stop-gap measure until all
     platforms provide these types.  If you know that all the platforms
     that you are interested in already provide these types, it is
     better to use them directly instead of the types provided by Guile.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_signed_integer (SCM x, scm_t_intmax min,
          scm_t_intmax max)
 -- C Function: int scm_is_unsigned_integer (SCM x, scm_t_uintmax min,
          scm_t_uintmax max)
     Return ‘1’ when X represents an exact integer that is between MIN
     and MAX, inclusive.

     These functions can be used to check whether a ‘SCM’ value will fit
     into a given range, such as the range of a given C integer type.
     If you just want to convert a ‘SCM’ value to a given C integer
     type, use one of the conversion functions directly.

 -- C Function: scm_t_intmax scm_to_signed_integer (SCM x, scm_t_intmax
          min, scm_t_intmax max)
 -- C Function: scm_t_uintmax scm_to_unsigned_integer (SCM x,
          scm_t_uintmax min, scm_t_uintmax max)
     When X represents an exact integer that is between MIN and MAX
     inclusive, return that integer.  Else signal an error, either a
     ‘wrong-type’ error when X is not an exact integer, or an
     ‘out-of-range’ error when it doesn’t fit the given range.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_signed_integer (scm_t_intmax x)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_unsigned_integer (scm_t_uintmax x)
     Return the ‘SCM’ value that represents the integer X.  This
     function will always succeed and will always return an exact
     number.

 -- C Function: char scm_to_char (SCM x)
 -- C Function: signed char scm_to_schar (SCM x)
 -- C Function: unsigned char scm_to_uchar (SCM x)
 -- C Function: short scm_to_short (SCM x)
 -- C Function: unsigned short scm_to_ushort (SCM x)

 -- C Function: unsigned long scm_to_ulong (SCM x)
 -- C Function: long long scm_to_long_long (SCM x)
 -- C Function: unsigned long long scm_to_ulong_long (SCM x)
 -- C Function: size_t scm_to_size_t (SCM x)
 -- C Function: ssize_t scm_to_ssize_t (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_uintptr scm_to_uintptr_t (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_ptrdiff scm_to_ptrdiff_t (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_int8 scm_to_int8 (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_uint8 scm_to_uint8 (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_int16 scm_to_int16 (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_uint16 scm_to_uint16 (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_int32 scm_to_int32 (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_uint32 scm_to_uint32 (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_int64 scm_to_int64 (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_uint64 scm_to_uint64 (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_intmax scm_to_intmax (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_uintmax scm_to_uintmax (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_intptr scm_to_intptr_t (SCM x)
 -- C Function: scm_t_uintptr scm_to_uintptr_t (SCM x)
     When X represents an exact integer that fits into the indicated C
     type, return that integer.  Else signal an error, either a
     ‘wrong-type’ error when X is not an exact integer, or an
     ‘out-of-range’ error when it doesn’t fit the given range.

     The functions ‘scm_to_long_long’, ‘scm_to_ulong_long’,
     ‘scm_to_int64’, and ‘scm_to_uint64’ are only available when the
     corresponding types are.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_char (char x)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_schar (signed char x)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_uchar (unsigned char x)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_short (short x)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_ushort (unsigned short x)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_int (int x)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_uint (unsigned int x)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_long (long x)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_ulong (unsigned long x)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_long_long (long long x)

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_intptr_t (scm_t_intptr x)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_uintptr_t (scm_t_uintptr x)
     Return the ‘SCM’ value that represents the integer X.  These
     functions will always succeed and will always return an exact
     number.

 -- C Function: void scm_to_mpz (SCM val, mpz_t rop)
     Assign VAL to the multiple precision integer ROP.  VAL must be an
     exact integer, otherwise an error will be signalled.  ROP must have
     been initialized with ‘mpz_init’ before this function is called.
     When ROP is no longer needed the occupied space must be freed with
     ‘mpz_clear’.  *Note* (gmp)Initializing Integers::, for details.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_mpz (mpz_t val)
     Return the ‘SCM’ value that represents VAL.



### 6.6.2.3 Real and Rational Numbers
.................................

Mathematically, the real numbers are the set of numbers that describe
all possible points along a continuous, infinite, one-dimensional line.
The rational numbers are the set of all numbers that can be written as
fractions P/Q, where P and Q are integers.  All rational numbers are
also real, but there are real numbers that are not rational, for example
the square root of 2, and pi.

   Guile can represent both exact and inexact rational numbers, but it
cannot represent precise finite irrational numbers.  Exact rationals are
represented by storing the numerator and denominator as two exact
integers.  Inexact rationals are stored as floating point numbers using
the C type ‘double’.

   Exact rationals are written as a fraction of integers.  There must be
no whitespace around the slash:

     1/2
     -22/7

   Even though the actual encoding of inexact rationals is in binary, it
may be helpful to think of it as a decimal number with a limited number
of significant figures and a decimal point somewhere, since this
corresponds to the standard notation for non-whole numbers.  For
example:

     0.34
     -0.00000142857931198
     -5648394822220000000000.0
     4.0

   The limited precision of Guile’s encoding means that any finite
“real” number in Guile can be written in a rational form, by multiplying
and then dividing by sufficient powers of 10 (or in fact, 2).  For
example, ‘-0.00000142857931198’ is the same as −142857931198 divided by
100000000000000000.  In Guile’s current incarnation, therefore, the
‘rational?’ and ‘real?’ predicates are equivalent for finite numbers.

   Dividing by an exact zero leads to a error message, as one might
expect.  However, dividing by an inexact zero does not produce an error.
Instead, the result of the division is either plus or minus infinity,
depending on the sign of the divided number and the sign of the zero
divisor (some platforms support signed zeroes ‘-0.0’ and ‘+0.0’; ‘0.0’
is the same as ‘+0.0’).

   Dividing zero by an inexact zero yields a NaN (‘not a number’) value,
although they are actually considered numbers by Scheme.  Attempts to
compare a NaN value with any number (including itself) using ‘=’, ‘<’,
‘>’, ‘<=’ or ‘>=’ always returns ‘#f’.  Although a NaN value is not ‘=’
to itself, it is both ‘eqv?’ and ‘equal?’ to itself and other NaN
values.  However, the preferred way to test for them is by using ‘nan?’.

   The real NaN values and infinities are written ‘+nan.0’, ‘+inf.0’ and
‘-inf.0’.  This syntax is also recognized by ‘read’ as an extension to
the usual Scheme syntax.  These special values are considered by Scheme
to be inexact real numbers but not rational.  Note that non-real complex
numbers may also contain infinities or NaN values in their real or
imaginary parts.  To test a real number to see if it is infinite, a NaN
value, or neither, use ‘inf?’, ‘nan?’, or ‘finite?’, respectively.
Every real number in Scheme belongs to precisely one of those three
classes.

   On platforms that follow IEEE 754 for their floating point
arithmetic, the ‘+inf.0’, ‘-inf.0’, and ‘+nan.0’ values are implemented
using the corresponding IEEE 754 values.  They behave in arithmetic
operations like IEEE 754 describes it, i.e., ‘(= +nan.0 +nan.0)’ ⇒ ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: real? obj
 -- C Function: scm_real_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a real number, else ‘#f’.  Note that the sets
     of integer and rational values form subsets of the set of real
     numbers, so the predicate will also be fulfilled if OBJ is an
     integer number or a rational number.

 -- Scheme Procedure: rational? x
 -- C Function: scm_rational_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if X is a rational number, ‘#f’ otherwise.  Note that
     the set of integer values forms a subset of the set of rational
     numbers, i.e. the predicate will also be fulfilled if X is an
     integer number.

 -- Scheme Procedure: rationalize x eps
 -- C Function: scm_rationalize (x, eps)
     Returns the _simplest_ rational number differing from X by no more
     than EPS.

     As required by R5RS, ‘rationalize’ only returns an exact result
     when both its arguments are exact.  Thus, you might need to use
     ‘inexact->exact’ on the arguments.

          (rationalize (inexact->exact 1.2) 1/100)
          ⇒ 6/5

 -- Scheme Procedure: inf? x
 -- C Function: scm_inf_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if the real number X is ‘+inf.0’ or ‘-inf.0’.
     Otherwise return ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: nan? x
 -- C Function: scm_nan_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if the real number X is ‘+nan.0’, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: finite? x
 -- C Function: scm_finite_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if the real number X is neither infinite nor a NaN,
     ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: nan
 -- C Function: scm_nan ()
     Return ‘+nan.0’, a NaN value.

 -- Scheme Procedure: inf
 -- C Function: scm_inf ()
     Return ‘+inf.0’, positive infinity.

 -- Scheme Procedure: numerator x
 -- C Function: scm_numerator (x)
     Return the numerator of the rational number X.

 -- Scheme Procedure: denominator x
 -- C Function: scm_denominator (x)
     Return the denominator of the rational number X.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_real (SCM val)
 -- C Function: int scm_is_rational (SCM val)
     Equivalent to ‘scm_is_true (scm_real_p (val))’ and ‘scm_is_true
     (scm_rational_p (val))’, respectively.

 -- C Function: double scm_to_double (SCM val)
     Returns the number closest to VAL that is representable as a
     ‘double’.  Returns infinity for a VAL that is too large in
     magnitude.  The argument VAL must be a real number.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_double (double val)
     Return the ‘SCM’ value that represents VAL.  The returned value is
     inexact according to the predicate ‘inexact?’, but it will be
     exactly equal to VAL.

### 6.6.2.4 Complex Numbers
.......................

Complex numbers are the set of numbers that describe all possible points
in a two-dimensional space.  The two coordinates of a particular point
in this space are known as the “real” and “imaginary” parts of the
complex number that describes that point.

   In Guile, complex numbers are written in rectangular form as the sum
of their real and imaginary parts, using the symbol ‘i’ to indicate the
imaginary part.

     3+4i
     ⇒
     3.0+4.0i

     (* 3-8i 2.3+0.3i)
     ⇒
     9.3-17.5i

Polar form can also be used, with an ‘@’ between magnitude and angle,

     1@3.141592 ⇒ -1.0      (approx)
     -1@1.57079 ⇒ 0.0-1.0i  (approx)

   Guile represents a complex number as a pair of inexact reals, so the
real and imaginary parts of a complex number have the same properties of
inexactness and limited precision as single inexact real numbers.

   Note that each part of a complex number may contain any inexact real
value, including the special values ‘+nan.0’, ‘+inf.0’ and ‘-inf.0’, as
well as either of the signed zeroes ‘0.0’ or ‘-0.0’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: complex? z
 -- C Function: scm_complex_p (z)
     Return ‘#t’ if Z is a complex number, ‘#f’ otherwise.  Note that
     the sets of real, rational and integer values form subsets of the
     set of complex numbers, i.e. the predicate will also be fulfilled
     if Z is a real, rational or integer number.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_complex (SCM val)
     Equivalent to ‘scm_is_true (scm_complex_p (val))’.

### 6.6.2.5 Exact and Inexact Numbers
.................................

R5RS requires that, with few exceptions, a calculation involving inexact
numbers always produces an inexact result.  To meet this requirement,
Guile distinguishes between an exact integer value such as ‘5’ and the
corresponding inexact integer value which, to the limited precision
available, has no fractional part, and is printed as ‘5.0’.  Guile will
only convert the latter value to the former when forced to do so by an
invocation of the ‘inexact->exact’ procedure.

   The only exception to the above requirement is when the values of the
inexact numbers do not affect the result.  For example ‘(expt n 0)’ is
‘1’ for any value of ‘n’, therefore ‘(expt 5.0 0)’ is permitted to
return an exact ‘1’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: exact? z
 -- C Function: scm_exact_p (z)
     Return ‘#t’ if the number Z is exact, ‘#f’ otherwise.

          (exact? 2)
          ⇒ #t

          (exact? 0.5)
          ⇒ #f

          (exact? (/ 2))
          ⇒ #t

 -- C Function: int scm_is_exact (SCM z)
     Return a ‘1’ if the number Z is exact, and ‘0’ otherwise.  This is
     equivalent to ‘scm_is_true (scm_exact_p (z))’.

     An alternate approch to testing the exactness of a number is to use
     ‘scm_is_signed_integer’ or ‘scm_is_unsigned_integer’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: inexact? z
 -- C Function: scm_inexact_p (z)
     Return ‘#t’ if the number Z is inexact, ‘#f’ else.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_inexact (SCM z)
     Return a ‘1’ if the number Z is inexact, and ‘0’ otherwise.  This
     is equivalent to ‘scm_is_true (scm_inexact_p (z))’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: inexact->exact z
 -- C Function: scm_inexact_to_exact (z)
     Return an exact number that is numerically closest to Z, when there
     is one.  For inexact rationals, Guile returns the exact rational
     that is numerically equal to the inexact rational.  Inexact complex
     numbers with a non-zero imaginary part can not be made exact.

          (inexact->exact 0.5)
          ⇒ 1/2

     The following happens because 12/10 is not exactly representable as
     a ‘double’ (on most platforms).  However, when reading a decimal
     number that has been marked exact with the “#e” prefix, Guile is
     able to represent it correctly.

          (inexact->exact 1.2)
          ⇒ 5404319552844595/4503599627370496

          #e1.2
          ⇒ 6/5

 -- Scheme Procedure: exact->inexact z
 -- C Function: scm_exact_to_inexact (z)
     Convert the number Z to its inexact representation.

### 6.6.2.6 Read Syntax for Numerical Data
......................................

The read syntax for integers is a string of digits, optionally preceded
by a minus or plus character, a code indicating the base in which the
integer is encoded, and a code indicating whether the number is exact or
inexact.  The supported base codes are:

‘#b’
‘#B’
     the integer is written in binary (base 2)

‘#o’
‘#O’
     the integer is written in octal (base 8)

‘#d’
‘#D’
     the integer is written in decimal (base 10)

‘#x’
‘#X’
     the integer is written in hexadecimal (base 16)

   If the base code is omitted, the integer is assumed to be decimal.
The following examples show how these base codes are used.

     -13
     ⇒ -13

     #d-13
     ⇒ -13

     #x-13
     ⇒ -19

     #b+1101
     ⇒ 13

     #o377
     ⇒ 255

   The codes for indicating exactness (which can, incidentally, be
applied to all numerical values) are:

‘#e’
‘#E’
     the number is exact

‘#i’
‘#I’
     the number is inexact.

   If the exactness indicator is omitted, the number is exact unless it
contains a radix point.  Since Guile can not represent exact complex
numbers, an error is signalled when asking for them.

     (exact? 1.2)
     ⇒ #f

     (exact? #e1.2)
     ⇒ #t

     (exact? #e+1i)
     ERROR: Wrong type argument

   Guile also understands the syntax ‘+inf.0’ and ‘-inf.0’ for plus and
minus infinity, respectively.  The value must be written exactly as
shown, that is, they always must have a sign and exactly one zero digit
after the decimal point.  It also understands ‘+nan.0’ and ‘-nan.0’ for
the special ‘not-a-number’ value.  The sign is ignored for
‘not-a-number’ and the value is always printed as ‘+nan.0’.

 -- C Function: scm_gcd (x, y)
     Return the greatest common divisor of all arguments.  If called

### 6.6.2.8 Comparison Predicates
.............................

The C comparison functions below always takes two arguments, while the
Scheme functions can take an arbitrary number.  Also keep in mind that
the C functions return one of the Scheme boolean values ‘SCM_BOOL_T’ or
‘SCM_BOOL_F’ which are both true as far as C is concerned.  Thus, always
write ‘scm_is_true (scm_num_eq_p (x, y))’ when testing the two Scheme
numbers ‘x’ and ‘y’ for equality, for example.

 -- Scheme Procedure: =
 -- C Function: scm_num_eq_p (x, y)
     Return ‘#t’ if all parameters are numerically equal.

 -- Scheme Procedure: <
 -- C Function: scm_less_p (x, y)
     Return ‘#t’ if the list of parameters is monotonically increasing.

 -- Scheme Procedure: >

     Return ‘#t’ if the list of parameters is monotonically decreasing.

 -- Scheme Procedure: <=
 -- C Function: scm_leq_p (x, y)
     Return ‘#t’ if the list of parameters is monotonically
     non-decreasing.

### 6.6.2.9 Converting Numbers To and From Strings
..............................................

The following procedures read and write numbers according to their
external representation as defined by R5RS (*note* R5RS Lexical
Structure: (r5rs)Lexical structure.).  *Note* the ‘(ice-9 i18n)’ module:
Number Input and Output, for locale-dependent number parsing.

 -- Scheme Procedure: number->string n [radix]
 -- C Function: scm_number_to_string (n, radix)
     Return a string holding the external representation of the number N
     in the given RADIX.  If N is inexact, a radix of 10 will be used.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string->number string [radix]
 -- C Function: scm_string_to_number (string, radix)
     Return a number of the maximally precise representation expressed
     by the given STRING.  RADIX must be an exact integer, either 2, 8,
     10, or 16.  If supplied, RADIX is a default radix that may be
     overridden by an explicit radix prefix in STRING (e.g. "#o177").
     If RADIX is not supplied, then the default radix is 10.  If string
     is not a syntactically valid notation for a number, then
     ‘string->number’ returns ‘#f’.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_locale_stringn_to_number (const char *string,
          size_t len, unsigned radix)
     As per ‘string->number’ above, but taking a C string, as pointer
     and length.  The string characters should be in the current locale
     encoding (‘locale’ in the name refers only to that, there’s no
     locale-dependent parsing).

     Return the angle of the complex number Z.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_make_rectangular (double re, double im)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_make_polar (double x, double y)

### 6.6.2.11 Arithmetic Functions
.............................

The C arithmetic functions below always takes two arguments, while the
Scheme functions can take an arbitrary number.  When you need to invoke
them with just one argument, for example to compute the equivalent of
‘(- x)’, pass ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’ as the second one: ‘scm_difference (x,
SCM_UNDEFINED)’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: + z1 ...
 -- C Function: scm_sum (z1, z2)
     Return the sum of all parameter values.  Return 0 if called without
     any parameters.

 -- Scheme Procedure: - z1 z2 ...
 -- C Function: scm_difference (z1, z2)
     If called with one argument Z1, -Z1 is returned.  Otherwise the sum
     of all but the first argument are subtracted from the first
     argument.

 -- Scheme Procedure: * z1 ...
 -- C Function: scm_product (z1, z2)
     Return the product of all arguments.  If called without arguments,
     1 is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: / z1 z2 ...
 -- C Function: scm_divide (z1, z2)
     Divide the first argument by the product of the remaining
     arguments.  If called with one argument Z1, 1/Z1 is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: 1+ z
 -- C Function: scm_oneplus (z)
     Return Z + 1.

 -- Scheme Procedure: 1- z
 -- C function: scm_oneminus (z)
     Return Z - 1.

 -- Scheme Procedure: abs x
 -- C Function: scm_abs (x)
     Return the absolute value of X.

     X must be a number with zero imaginary part.  To calculate the
     magnitude of a complex number, use ‘magnitude’ instead.

 -- Scheme Procedure: max x1 x2 ...
 -- C Function: scm_max (x1, x2)
     Return the maximum of all parameter values.

 -- Scheme Procedure: min x1 x2 ...
 -- C Function: scm_min (x1, x2)
     Return the minimum of all parameter values.

 -- Scheme Procedure: truncate x
 -- C Function: scm_truncate_number (x)
     Round the inexact number X towards zero.

 -- Scheme Procedure: round x
 -- C Function: scm_round_number (x)
     Round the inexact number X to the nearest integer.  When exactly
     halfway between two integers, round to the even one.

 -- Scheme Procedure: floor x
 -- C Function: scm_floor (x)
     Round the number X towards minus infinity.

 -- Scheme Procedure: ceiling x
 -- C Function: scm_ceiling (x)
     Round the number X towards infinity.

 -- C Function: double scm_c_truncate (double x)
 -- C Function: double scm_c_round (double x)
     Like ‘scm_truncate_number’ or ‘scm_round_number’, respectively, but
     these functions take and return ‘double’ values.

 -- Scheme Procedure: euclidean/ X Y
 -- Scheme Procedure: euclidean-quotient X Y
 -- Scheme Procedure: euclidean-remainder X Y
 -- C Function: void scm_euclidean_divide (SCM X, SCM Y, SCM *Q, SCM *R)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_euclidean_quotient (SCM X, SCM Y)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_euclidean_remainder (SCM X, SCM Y)
     These procedures accept two real numbers X and Y, where the divisor
     Y must be non-zero.  ‘euclidean-quotient’ returns the integer Q and
     ‘euclidean-remainder’ returns the real number R such that X = Q*Y +
     R and 0 <= R < |Y|.  ‘euclidean/’ returns both Q and R, and is more
     efficient than computing each separately.  Note that when Y > 0,
     ‘euclidean-quotient’ returns floor(X/Y), otherwise it returns
     ceiling(X/Y).

     Note that these operators are equivalent to the R6RS operators
     ‘div’, ‘mod’, and ‘div-and-mod’.

 -- C Function: void scm_floor_divide (SCM X, SCM Y, SCM *Q, SCM *R)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_floor_quotient (X, Y)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_floor_remainder (X, Y)
     These procedures accept two real numbers X and Y, where the divisor
     Y must be non-zero.  ‘floor-quotient’ returns the integer Q and
     ‘floor-remainder’ returns the real number R such that Q =
     floor(X/Y) and X = Q*Y + R.  ‘floor/’ returns both Q and R, and is
     more efficient than computing each separately.  Note that R, if
     non-zero, will have the same sign as Y.

     When X and Y are integers, ‘floor-remainder’ is equivalent to the
     R5RS integer-only operator ‘modulo’.

          (floor-quotient 123 10) ⇒ 12
          (floor-remainder 123 10) ⇒ 3

 -- C Function: void scm_ceiling_divide (SCM X, SCM Y, SCM *Q, SCM *R)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_ceiling_quotient (X, Y)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_ceiling_remainder (X, Y)
     These procedures accept two real numbers X and Y, where the divisor
     Y must be non-zero.  ‘ceiling-quotient’ returns the integer Q and
     ‘ceiling-remainder’ returns the real number R such that Q =
     ceiling(X/Y) and X = Q*Y + R.  ‘ceiling/’ returns both Q and R, and
     is more efficient than computing each separately.  Note that R, if
     non-zero, will have the opposite sign of Y.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_truncate_quotient (X, Y)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_truncate_remainder (X, Y)
     These procedures accept two real numbers X and Y, where the divisor
     Y must be non-zero.  ‘truncate-quotient’ returns the integer Q and
     ‘truncate-remainder’ returns the real number R such that Q is X/Y
     rounded toward zero, and X = Q*Y + R.  ‘truncate/’ returns both Q
     and R, and is more efficient than computing each separately.  Note
     that R, if non-zero, will have the same sign as X.

     When X and Y are integers, these operators are equivalent to the
     R5RS integer-only operators ‘quotient’ and ‘remainder’.

          (truncate/ 16/3 -10/7) ⇒ -3 and 22/21

 -- Scheme Procedure: centered/ X Y
 -- Scheme Procedure: centered-quotient X Y
 -- Scheme Procedure: centered-remainder X Y
 -- C Function: void scm_centered_divide (SCM X, SCM Y, SCM *Q, SCM *R)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_centered_quotient (SCM X, SCM Y)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_centered_remainder (SCM X, SCM Y)
     These procedures accept two real numbers X and Y, where the divisor
     Y must be non-zero.  ‘centered-quotient’ returns the integer Q and
     ‘centered-remainder’ returns the real number R such that X = Q*Y +
     R and -|Y/2| <= R < |Y/2|.  ‘centered/’ returns both Q and R, and
     is more efficient than computing each separately.

     Note that ‘centered-quotient’ returns X/Y rounded to the nearest
     integer.  When X/Y lies exactly half-way between two integers, the
     tie is broken according to the sign of Y.  If Y > 0, ties are
     rounded toward positive infinity, otherwise they are rounded toward
     negative infinity.  This is a consequence of the requirement that
     -|Y/2| <= R < |Y/2|.

     Note that these operators are equivalent to the R6RS operators
     ‘div0’, ‘mod0’, and ‘div0-and-mod0’.

          (centered-quotient 123 10) ⇒ 12
          (centered-remainder 123 10) ⇒ 3

 -- Scheme Procedure: round/ X Y
 -- Scheme Procedure: round-quotient X Y
 -- Scheme Procedure: round-remainder X Y
 -- C Function: void scm_round_divide (SCM X, SCM Y, SCM *Q, SCM *R)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_round_quotient (X, Y)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_round_remainder (X, Y)
     These procedures accept two real numbers X and Y, where the divisor
     Y must be non-zero.  ‘round-quotient’ returns the integer Q and
     ‘round-remainder’ returns the real number R such that X = Q*Y + R
     and Q is X/Y rounded to the nearest integer, with ties going to the
     nearest even integer.  ‘round/’ returns both Q and R, and is more
     efficient than computing each separately.

     Note that ‘round/’ and ‘centered/’ are almost equivalent, but their
     behavior differs when X/Y lies exactly half-way between two
     integers.  In this case, ‘round/’ chooses the nearest even integer,
     whereas ‘centered/’ chooses in such a way to satisfy the constraint
     -|Y/2| <= R < |Y/2|, which is stronger than the corresponding
     constraint for ‘round/’, -|Y/2| <= R <= |Y/2|.  In particular, when
     X and Y are integers, the number of possible remainders returned by
     ‘centered/’ is |Y|, whereas the number of possible remainders
     returned by ‘round/’ is |Y|+1 when Y is even.

          (round-quotient 123 10) ⇒ 12
          (round-remainder 123 10) ⇒ 3
          (round/ 123 10) ⇒ 12 and 3

### 6.6.2.13 Bitwise Operations
...........................

For the following bitwise functions, negative numbers are treated as
infinite precision twos-complements.  For instance -6 is bits ...111010,
with infinitely many ones on the left.  It can be seen that adding 6
(binary 110) to such a bit pattern gives all zeros.

 -- Scheme Procedure: logand n1 n2 ...
 -- C Function: scm_logand (n1, n2)
     Return the bitwise AND of the integer arguments.

          (logand) ⇒ -1
          (logand 7) ⇒ 7
          (logand #b111 #b011 #b001) ⇒ 1

 -- Scheme Procedure: logior n1 n2 ...
 -- C Function: scm_logior (n1, n2)

 -- Scheme Procedure: logxor n1 n2 ...
 -- C Function: scm_loxor (n1, n2)
     Return the bitwise XOR of the integer arguments.  A bit is set in
     the result if it is set in an odd number of arguments.

          (logxor) ⇒ 0
          (logxor 7) ⇒ 7
          (logxor #b000 #b001 #b011) ⇒ 2
          (logxor #b000 #b001 #b011 #b011) ⇒ 1

 -- Scheme Procedure: lognot n

     argument, ie. each 0 bit is changed to 1 and each 1 bit to 0.

          (number->string (lognot #b10000000) 2)
             ⇒ "-10000001"
          (number->string (lognot #b0) 2)
             ⇒ "-1"

 -- Scheme Procedure: logtest j k
 -- C Function: scm_logtest (j, k)
     Test whether J and K have any 1 bits in common.  This is equivalent
     to ‘(not (zero? (logand j k)))’, but without actually calculating
     the ‘logand’, just testing for non-zero.

          (logtest #b0100 #b1011) ⇒ #f
          (logtest #b0100 #b0111) ⇒ #t

 -- Scheme Procedure: logbit? index j

 -- Scheme Procedure: ash n count
 -- C Function: scm_ash (n, count)
     Return floor(n * 2^{count}).  N and COUNT must be exact integers.

     With N viewed as an infinite-precision twos-complement integer,
     ‘ash’ means a left shift introducing zero bits when COUNT is
     positive, or a right shift dropping bits when COUNT is negative.
     This is an “arithmetic” shift.

          (number->string (ash #b1 3) 2)     ⇒ "1000"
          (number->string (ash #b1010 -1) 2) ⇒ "101"

          ;; -23 is bits ...11101001, -6 is bits ...111010
          (ash -23 -2) ⇒ -6

 -- Scheme Procedure: round-ash n count
 -- C Function: scm_round_ash (n, count)
     Return round(n * 2^count).  N and COUNT must be exact integers.

     With N viewed as an infinite-precision twos-complement integer,
     ‘round-ash’ means a left shift introducing zero bits when COUNT is
     positive, or a right shift rounding to the nearest integer (with
     ties going to the nearest even integer) when COUNT is negative.
     This is a rounded “arithmetic” shift.

          (number->string (round-ash #b1 3) 2)     ⇒ \"1000\"
          (number->string (round-ash #b1010 -1) 2) ⇒ \"101\"

          (number->string (round-ash #b1110 -2) 2) ⇒ \"100\"

 -- Scheme Procedure: logcount n
 -- C Function: scm_logcount (n)
     Return the number of bits in integer N.  If N is positive, the
     1-bits in its binary representation are counted.  If negative, the
     0-bits in its two’s-complement binary representation are counted.
     If zero, 0 is returned.

          (logcount #b10101010)
             ⇒ 4
          (logcount 0)
             ⇒ 0
          (logcount -2)
             ⇒ 1

 -- Scheme Procedure: integer-length n
 -- C Function: scm_integer_length (n)
     Return the number of bits necessary to represent N.

     For positive N this is how many bits to the most significant one
     bit.  For negative N it’s how many bits to the most significant
     zero bit in twos complement form.

          (integer-length #b10101010) ⇒ 8
          (integer-length #b1111)     ⇒ 4
          (integer-length 0)          ⇒ 0
          (integer-length -1)         ⇒ 0
          (integer-length -256)       ⇒ 8
          (integer-length -257)       ⇒ 9

 -- Scheme Procedure: integer-expt n k
 -- C Function: scm_integer_expt (n, k)
     Return N raised to the power K.  K must be an exact integer, N can
     be any number.

     Negative K is supported, and results in 1/n^abs(k) in the usual
     way.  N^0 is 1, as usual, and that includes 0^0 is 1.

          (integer-expt 2 5)   ⇒ 32
          (integer-expt -3 3)  ⇒ -27
          (integer-expt 5 -3)  ⇒ 1/125

 -- Scheme Procedure: bit-extract n start end
 -- C Function: scm_bit_extract (n, start, end)
     Return the integer composed of the START (inclusive) through END
     (exclusive) bits of N.  The STARTth bit becomes the 0-th bit in the

          (number->string (bit-extract #b1101101010 0 4) 2)
             ⇒ "1010"

### 6.6.2.14 Random Number Generation
.................................

Pseudo-random numbers are generated from a random state object, which
can be created with ‘seed->random-state’ or ‘datum->random-state’.  An
external representation (i.e. one which can written with ‘write’ and
read with ‘read’) of a random state object can be obtained via
‘random-state->datum’.  The STATE parameter to the various functions
below is optional, it defaults to the state object in the
‘*random-state*’ variable.

 -- Scheme Procedure: copy-random-state [state]
 -- C Function: scm_copy_random_state (state)
     Return a copy of the random state STATE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: random n [state]
 -- C Function: scm_random (n, state)
     Return a number in [0, N).

     Accepts a positive integer or real n and returns a number of the
     same type between zero (inclusive) and N (exclusive).  The values
     returned have a uniform distribution.

 -- Scheme Procedure: random:exp [state]
 -- C Function: scm_random_exp (state)
     Return an inexact real in an exponential distribution with mean 1.
     For an exponential distribution with mean U use ‘(* U
     (random:exp))’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: random:hollow-sphere! vect [state]
 -- C Function: scm_random_hollow_sphere_x (vect, state)
     Fills VECT with inexact real random numbers the sum of whose
     squares is equal to 1.0.  Thinking of VECT as coordinates in space
     of dimension N = ‘(vector-length VECT)’, the coordinates are
     uniformly distributed over the surface of the unit n-sphere.

 -- Scheme Procedure: random:normal [state]
 -- C Function: scm_random_normal (state)
     Return an inexact real in a normal distribution.  The distribution
     used has mean 0 and standard deviation 1.  For a normal
     distribution with mean M and standard deviation D use ‘(+ M (* D
     (random:normal)))’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: random:normal-vector! vect [state]
 -- C Function: scm_random_normal_vector_x (vect, state)
     Fills VECT with inexact real random numbers that are independent
     and standard normally distributed (i.e., with mean 0 and variance
     1).

 -- Scheme Procedure: random:solid-sphere! vect [state]
 -- C Function: scm_random_solid_sphere_x (vect, state)
     Fills VECT with inexact real random numbers the sum of whose
     squares is less than 1.0.  Thinking of VECT as coordinates in space
     of dimension N = ‘(vector-length VECT)’, the coordinates are
     uniformly distributed within the unit N-sphere.

 -- Scheme Procedure: random:uniform [state]
 -- C Function: scm_random_uniform (state)
     Return a uniformly distributed inexact real random number in [0,1).

 -- Scheme Procedure: seed->random-state seed
 -- C Function: scm_seed_to_random_state (seed)
     Return a new random state using SEED.

 -- Scheme Procedure: datum->random-state datum
 -- C Function: scm_datum_to_random_state (datum)
     Return a new random state from DATUM, which should have been
     obtained by ‘random-state->datum’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: random-state->datum state
 -- C Function: scm_random_state_to_datum (state)
     Return a datum representation of STATE that may be written out and
     read back with the Scheme reader.

 -- Scheme Procedure: random-state-from-platform
 -- C Function: scm_random_state_from_platform ()
     Construct a new random state seeded from a platform-specific source
     of entropy, appropriate for use in non-security-critical
     applications.  Currently ‘/dev/urandom’ is tried first, or else the
     seed is based on the time, date, process ID, an address from a
     freshly allocated heap cell, an address from the local stack frame,
     and a high-resolution timer if available.

 -- Variable: *random-state*
     The global random state used by the above functions when the STATE
     parameter is not given.

   Note that the initial value of ‘*random-state*’ is the same every
time Guile starts up.  Therefore, if you don’t pass a STATE parameter to
the above procedures, and you don’t set ‘*random-state*’ to
‘(seed->random-state your-seed)’, where ‘your-seed’ is something that
_isn’t_ the same every time, you’ll get the same sequence of “random”
numbers on every run.

   For example, unless the relevant source code has changed, ‘(map
random (cdr (iota 30)))’, if the first use of random numbers since Guile
started up, will always give:

     (map random (cdr (iota 19)))
     ⇒
     (0 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 6 7 10 0 5 3 12 5 5 12)

   To seed the random state in a sensible way for non-security-critical
applications, do this during initialization of your program:

     (set! *random-state* (random-state-from-platform))


File: guile.info,  Node: Characters,  Next: Character Sets,  Prev: Numbers,  Up: Data Types

6.6.3 Characters
----------------

In Scheme, there is a data type to describe a single character.

   Defining what exactly a character _is_ can be more complicated than
it seems.  Guile follows the advice of R6RS and uses The Unicode
Standard to help define what a character is.  So, for Guile, a character
is anything in the Unicode Character Database.

   The Unicode Character Database is basically a table of characters
indexed using integers called ’code points’.  Valid code points are in
the ranges 0 to ‘#xD7FF’ inclusive or ‘#xE000’ to ‘#x10FFFF’ inclusive,
which is about 1.1 million code points.

   Any code point that has been assigned to a character or that has
otherwise been given a meaning by Unicode is called a ’designated code
point’.  Most of the designated code points, about 200,000 of them,
indicate characters, accents or other combining marks that modify other
characters, symbols, whitespace, and control characters.  Some are not
characters but indicators that suggest how to format or display
neighboring characters.

   If a code point is not a designated code point – if it has not been
assigned to a character by The Unicode Standard – it is a ’reserved code
point’, meaning that they are reserved for future use.  Most of the code
points, about 800,000, are ’reserved code points’.

   By convention, a Unicode code point is written as “U+XXXX” where
“XXXX” is a hexadecimal number.  Please note that this convenient
notation is not valid code.  Guile does not interpret “U+XXXX” as a
character.

   In Scheme, a character literal is written as ‘#\NAME’ where NAME is
the name of the character that you want.  Printable characters have
their usual single character name; for example, ‘#\a’ is a lower case
‘a’.

   Some of the code points are ’combining characters’ that are not meant
to be printed by themselves but are instead meant to modify the
appearance of the previous character.  For combining characters, an
alternate form of the character literal is ‘#\’ followed by U+25CC (a
small, dotted circle), followed by the combining character.  This allows
the combining character to be drawn on the circle, not on the backslash
of ‘#\’.

   Many of the non-printing characters, such as whitespace characters
and control characters, also have names.

   The most commonly used non-printing characters have long character
names, described in the table below.

Character       Codepoint
Name
‘#\nul’         U+0000
‘#\alarm’       U+0007
‘#\backspace’   U+0008
‘#\tab’         U+0009
‘#\linefeed’    U+000A
‘#\newline’     U+000A
‘#\vtab’        U+000B
‘#\page’        U+000C
‘#\return’      U+000D
‘#\esc’         U+001B
‘#\space’       U+0020
‘#\delete’      U+007F

   There are also short names for all of the “C0 control characters”
(those with code points below 32).  The following table lists the short
name for each character.

0 = ‘#\nul’        1 = ‘#\soh’        2 = ‘#\stx’        3 = ‘#\etx’

   The short name for the “delete” character (code point U+007F) is
‘#\del’.

   The R7RS name for the “escape” character (code point U+001B) is
‘#\escape’.

   There are also a few alternative names left over for compatibility
with previous versions of Guile.

Alternate       Standard
‘#\nl’          ‘#\newline’
‘#\np’          ‘#\page’
‘#\null’        ‘#\nul’

   Characters may also be written using their code point values.  They
can be written with as an octal number, such as ‘#\10’ for ‘#\bs’ or
‘#\177’ for ‘#\del’.

   If one prefers hex to octal, there is an additional syntax for
character escapes: ‘#\xHHHH’ – the letter ’x’ followed by a hexadecimal
number of one to eight digits.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char? x
 -- C Function: scm_char_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if X is a character, else ‘#f’.

   Fundamentally, the character comparison operations below are numeric
comparisons of the character’s code points.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char=? x y
     Return ‘#t’ if code point of X is equal to the code point of Y,
     else ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char<? x y
     Return ‘#t’ if the code point of X is less than the code point of
     Y, else ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char<=? x y
     Return ‘#t’ if the code point of X is less than or equal to the
     code point of Y, else ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char>? x y
     Return ‘#t’ if the code point of X is greater than the code point
     of Y, else ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char>=? x y
     Return ‘#t’ if the code point of X is greater than or equal to the
     code point of Y, else ‘#f’.

   Case-insensitive character comparisons use _Unicode case folding_.
In case folding comparisons, if a character is lowercase and has an
uppercase form that can be expressed as a single character, it is
converted to uppercase before comparison.  All other characters undergo
no conversion before the comparison occurs.  This includes the German
sharp S (Eszett) which is not uppercased before conversion because its
uppercase form has two characters.  Unicode case folding is language
independent: it uses rules that are generally true, but, it cannot cover
all cases for all languages.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-ci=? x y
     Return ‘#t’ if the case-folded code point of X is the same as the
     case-folded code point of Y, else ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-ci<? x y
     Return ‘#t’ if the case-folded code point of X is less than the
     case-folded code point of Y, else ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-ci<=? x y
     Return ‘#t’ if the case-folded code point of X is less than or
     equal to the case-folded code point of Y, else ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-ci>? x y
     Return ‘#t’ if the case-folded code point of X is greater than the
     case-folded code point of Y, else ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-ci>=? x y
     Return ‘#t’ if the case-folded code point of X is greater than or
     equal to the case-folded code point of Y, else ‘#f’.

     Return ‘#t’ if CHR is uppercase, else ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-lower-case? chr
 -- C Function: scm_char_lower_case_p (chr)
     Return ‘#t’ if CHR is lowercase, else ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-is-both? chr
 -- C Function: scm_char_is_both_p (chr)
     Return ‘#t’ if CHR is either uppercase or lowercase, else ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-general-category chr
 -- C Function: scm_char_general_category (chr)
     Return a symbol giving the two-letter name of the Unicode general
     category assigned to CHR or ‘#f’ if no named category is assigned.
     The following table provides a list of category names along with
     their meanings.

     Return the code point of CHR.

 -- Scheme Procedure: integer->char n
 -- C Function: scm_integer_to_char (n)
     Return the character that has code point N.  The integer N must be
     a valid code point.  Valid code points are in the ranges 0 to
     ‘#xD7FF’ inclusive or ‘#xE000’ to ‘#x10FFFF’ inclusive.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-upcase chr

 -- C Function: scm_char_downcase (chr)
     Return the lowercase character version of CHR.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-titlecase chr
 -- C Function: scm_char_titlecase (chr)
     Return the titlecase character version of CHR if one exists;
     otherwise return the uppercase version.

     For most characters these will be the same, but the Unicode
     Standard includes certain digraph compatibility characters, such as
     ‘U+01F3’ “dz”, for which the uppercase and titlecase characters are
     different (‘U+01F1’ “DZ” and ‘U+01F2’ “Dz” in this case,
     respectively).

 -- C Function: scm_t_wchar scm_c_upcase (scm_t_wchar C)
 -- C Function: scm_t_wchar scm_c_downcase (scm_t_wchar C)
 -- C Function: scm_t_wchar scm_c_titlecase (scm_t_wchar C)

     These C functions take an integer representation of a Unicode
     codepoint and return the codepoint corresponding to its uppercase,
     lowercase, and titlecase forms respectively.  The type
     ‘scm_t_wchar’ is a signed, 32-bit integer.

   Characters also have “formal names”, which are defined by Unicode.
These names can be accessed in Guile from the ‘(ice-9 unicode)’ module:

     (use-modules (ice-9 unicode))

 -- Scheme Procedure: char->formal-name chr
     Return the formal all-upper-case Unicode name of CH, as a string,
     or ‘#f’ if the character has no name.

 -- Scheme Procedure: formal-name->char name
     Return the character whose formal all-upper-case Unicode name is
     NAME, or ‘#f’ if no such character is known.

6.6.4 Character Sets
--------------------

The features described in this section correspond directly to SRFI-14.

   The data type “charset” implements sets of characters (*note*
Characters::).  Because the internal representation of character sets is
not visible to the user, a lot of procedures for handling them are
provided.

   Character sets can be created, extended, tested for the membership of
a characters and be compared to other character sets.

* Menu:

* Character Set Predicates/Comparison::
* Iterating Over Character Sets::  Enumerate charset elements.
* Creating Character Sets::        Making new charsets.
* Querying Character Sets::        Test charsets for membership etc.
* Character-Set Algebra::          Calculating new charsets.
* Standard Character Sets::        Variables containing predefined charsets.

### 6.6.4.1 Character Set Predicates/Comparison
...........................................

Use these procedures for testing whether an object is a character set,
or whether several character sets are equal or subsets of each other.

     Return ‘#t’ if every character set CHAR_SETi is a subset of
     character set CHAR_SETi+1.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-set-hash cs [bound]
 -- C Function: scm_char_set_hash (cs, bound)
     Compute a hash value for the character set CS.  If BOUND is given
     and non-zero, it restricts the returned value to the range 0 ...
     BOUND - 1.

### 6.6.4.2 Iterating Over Character Sets
.....................................

Character set cursors are a means for iterating over the members of a
character sets.  After creating a character set cursor with
‘char-set-cursor’, a cursor can be dereferenced with ‘char-set-ref’,
advanced to the next member with ‘char-set-cursor-next’.  Whether a
cursor has passed past the last element of the set can be checked with
‘end-of-char-set?’.

   Additionally, mapping and (un-)folding procedures for character sets
are provided.

 -- C Function: scm_char_set_cursor (cs)
     Return a cursor into the character set CS.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-set-ref cs cursor
 -- C Function: scm_char_set_ref (cs, cursor)

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-set-cursor-next cs cursor
 -- C Function: scm_char_set_cursor_next (cs, cursor)
     Advance the character set cursor CURSOR to the next character in

 -- C Function: scm_char_set_unfold (p, f, g, seed, base_cs)
     This is a fundamental constructor for character sets.
        • G is used to generate a series of “seed” values from the
          initial seed: SEED, (G SEED), (G^2 SEED), (G^3 SEED), ...
        • P tells us when to stop – when it returns true when applied to
          one of the seed values.
        • F maps each seed value to a character.  These characters are
          added to the base character set BASE_CS to form the result;
          BASE_CS defaults to the empty set.

 -- C Function: scm_char_set_unfold_x (p, f, g, seed, base_cs)
     This is a fundamental constructor for character sets.
        • G is used to generate a series of “seed” values from the
          initial seed: SEED, (G SEED), (G^2 SEED), (G^3 SEED), ...
        • P tells us when to stop – when it returns true when applied to
          one of the seed values.
        • F maps each seed value to a character.  These characters are
          added to the base character set BASE_CS to form the result;
          BASE_CS defaults to the empty set.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-set-for-each proc cs
 -- C Function: scm_char_set_for_each (proc, cs)
     Apply PROC to every character in the character set CS.  The return
     value is not specified.

          contains
     ‘ranges’
          A list of lists where each sublist is a range of code points
          and their associated characters
     The return value of this function cannot be relied upon to be

Character sets can be manipulated with the common set algebra operation,
such as union, complement, intersection etc.  All of these procedures
provide side-effecting variants, which modify their character set
argument(s).

### 6.6.4.6 Standard Character Sets
...............................

In order to make the use of the character set data type and procedures
useful, several predefined character set variables exist.

   These character sets are locale independent and are not recomputed
upon a ‘setlocale’ call.  They contain characters from the whole range
of Unicode code points.  For instance, ‘char-set:letter’ contains about
100,000 characters.

 -- Scheme Variable: char-set:lower-case
 -- C Variable: scm_char_set_lower_case
     All lower-case characters.

 -- Scheme Variable: char-set:upper-case
 -- C Variable: scm_char_set_upper_case
     All upper-case characters.

 -- Scheme Variable: char-set:title-case
 -- C Variable: scm_char_set_title_case
     All single characters that function as if they were an upper-case
     letter followed by a lower-case letter.

 -- Scheme Variable: char-set:letter
 -- C Variable: scm_char_set_letter
     All letters.  This includes ‘char-set:lower-case’,
     ‘char-set:upper-case’, ‘char-set:title-case’, and many letters that
     have no case at all.  For example, Chinese and Japanese characters
     typically have no concept of case.

 -- Scheme Variable: char-set:digit
 -- C Variable: scm_char_set_digit
     All digits.

 -- Scheme Variable: char-set:letter+digit
 -- C Variable: scm_char_set_letter_and_digit
     The union of ‘char-set:letter’ and ‘char-set:digit’.

 -- Scheme Variable: char-set:graphic
 -- C Variable: scm_char_set_graphic
     All characters which would put ink on the paper.

 -- Scheme Variable: char-set:printing
 -- C Variable: scm_char_set_printing
     The union of ‘char-set:graphic’ and ‘char-set:whitespace’.

 -- Scheme Variable: char-set:whitespace
 -- C Variable: scm_char_set_whitespace
     All whitespace characters.

 -- Scheme Variable: char-set:blank
 -- C Variable: scm_char_set_blank
     All horizontal whitespace characters, which notably includes
     ‘#\space’ and ‘#\tab’.

 -- Scheme Variable: char-set:iso-control
 -- C Variable: scm_char_set_iso_control
     The ISO control characters are the C0 control characters (U+0000 to

6.6.5 Strings
-------------

Strings are fixed-length sequences of characters.  They can be created
by calling constructor procedures, but they can also literally get
entered at the REPL or in Scheme source files.

   Strings always carry the information about how many characters they
are composed of with them, so there is no special end-of-string
character, like in C. That means that Scheme strings can contain any
character, even the ‘#\nul’ character ‘\0’.

   To use strings efficiently, you need to know a bit about how Guile
implements them.  In Guile, a string consists of two parts, a head and
the actual memory where the characters are stored.  When a string (or a
substring of it) is copied, only a new head gets created, the memory is
usually not copied.  The two heads start out pointing to the same
memory.

   When one of these two strings is modified, as with ‘string-set!’,
their common memory does get copied so that each string has its own
memory and modifying one does not accidentally modify the other as well.
Thus, Guile’s strings are ‘copy on write’; the actual copying of their
memory is delayed until one string is written to.

   This implementation makes functions like ‘substring’ very efficient
in the common case that no modifications are done to the involved
strings.

   If you do know that your strings are getting modified right away, you
can use ‘substring/copy’ instead of ‘substring’.  This function performs
the copy immediately at the time of creation.  This is more efficient,
especially in a multi-threaded program.  Also, ‘substring/copy’ can
avoid the problem that a short substring holds on to the memory of a
very large original string that could otherwise be recycled.

   If you want to avoid the copy altogether, so that modifications of
one string show up in the other, you can use ‘substring/shared’.  The
strings created by this procedure are called “mutation sharing
substrings” since the substring and the original string share
modifications to each other.

   If you want to prevent modifications, use ‘substring/read-only’.

   Guile provides all procedures of SRFI-13 and a few more.

### 6.6.5.1 String Read Syntax
..........................

The read syntax for strings is an arbitrarily long sequence of
characters enclosed in double quotes (").

   Backslash is an escape character and can be used to insert the
following special characters.  \" and \\ are R5RS standard, \| is R7RS
standard, the next seven are R6RS standard — notice they follow C syntax
— and the remaining four are Guile extensions.

\\
     Backslash character.

\"
     Double quote character (an unescaped " is otherwise the end of the
     string).

\|
     Vertical bar character.

\a
     Bell character (ASCII 7).

\f
     Formfeed character (ASCII 12).

\n
     Newline character (ASCII 10).

\r
     Carriage return character (ASCII 13).

\t
     Tab character (ASCII 9).

\v
     Vertical tab character (ASCII 11).

\b
     Backspace character (ASCII 8).

\0
     NUL character (ASCII 0).

\(
     Open parenthesis.  This is intended for use at the beginning of
     lines in multiline strings to avoid confusing Emacs lisp modes.

\ followed by newline (ASCII 10)
     Nothing.  This way if \ is the last character in a line, the string
     will continue with the first character from the next line, without
     a line break.

     If the ‘hungry-eol-escapes’ reader option is enabled, which is not
     the case by default, leading whitespace on the next line is
     discarded.

          "foo\
            bar"
          ⇒ "foo  bar"
          (read-enable 'hungry-eol-escapes)
          "foo\
            bar"
          ⇒ "foobar"
\xHH
     Character code given by two hexadecimal digits.  For example \x7f
     for an ASCII DEL (127).

\uHHHH
     Character code given by four hexadecimal digits.  For example
     \u0100 for a capital A with macron (U+0100).

\UHHHHHH
     Character code given by six hexadecimal digits.  For example
     \U010402.

The following are examples of string literals:

     "foo"
     "bar plonk"
     "Hello World"
     "\"Hi\", he said."

   The three escape sequences ‘\xHH’, ‘\uHHHH’ and ‘\UHHHHHH’ were
chosen to not break compatibility with code written for previous
versions of Guile.  The R6RS specification suggests a different,
incompatible syntax for hex escapes: ‘\xHHHH;’ – a character code
followed by one to eight hexadecimal digits terminated with a semicolon.
If this escape format is desired instead, it can be enabled with the
reader option ‘r6rs-hex-escapes’.

     (read-enable 'r6rs-hex-escapes)

   For more on reader options, *Note* Scheme Read::.

### 6.6.5.2 String Predicates
.........................

The following procedures can be used to check whether a given string
fulfills some specified property.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string? obj
 -- C Function: scm_string_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a string, else ‘#f’.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_string (SCM obj)
     Returns ‘1’ if OBJ is a string, ‘0’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-null? str
 -- C Function: scm_string_null_p (str)
     Return ‘#t’ if STR’s length is zero, and ‘#f’ otherwise.
          (string-null? "")  ⇒ #t
          y                    ⇒ "foo"
          (string-null? y)     ⇒ #f

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-any char_pred s [start [end]]
 -- C Function: scm_string_any (char_pred, s, start, end)
     Check if CHAR_PRED is true for any character in string S.

     CHAR_PRED can be a character to check for any equal to that, or a
     character set (*note* Character Sets::) to check for any in that
     set, or a predicate procedure to call.

     For a procedure, calls ‘(CHAR_PRED c)’ are made successively on the
     characters from START to END.  If CHAR_PRED returns true (ie.
     non-‘#f’), ‘string-any’ stops and that return value is the return
     from ‘string-any’.  The call on the last character (ie. at END-1),
     if that point is reached, is a tail call.

     If there are no characters in S (ie. START equals END) then the
     return is ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-every char_pred s [start [end]]
 -- C Function: scm_string_every (char_pred, s, start, end)
     Check if CHAR_PRED is true for every character in string S.

     CHAR_PRED can be a character to check for every character equal to
     that, or a character set (*note* Character Sets::) to check for
     every character being in that set, or a predicate procedure to
     call.

     For a procedure, calls ‘(CHAR_PRED c)’ are made successively on the
     characters from START to END.  If CHAR_PRED returns ‘#f’,
     ‘string-every’ stops and returns ‘#f’.  The call on the last
     character (ie. at END-1), if that point is reached, is a tail call
     and the return from that call is the return from ‘string-every’.

     If there are no characters in S (ie. START equals END) then the
     return is ‘#t’.

### 6.6.5.3 String Constructors
...........................

The string constructor procedures create new string objects, possibly
initializing them with some specified character data.  See also *Note*
String Selection::, for ways to create strings from existing strings.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string char...
     Return a newly allocated string made from the given character
     arguments.

          (string #\x #\y #\z) ⇒ "xyz"
          (string)             ⇒ ""

 -- Scheme Procedure: list->string lst
 -- C Function: scm_string (lst)
     Return a newly allocated string made from a list of characters.

          (list->string '(#\a #\b #\c)) ⇒ "abc"

 -- Scheme Procedure: reverse-list->string lst
 -- C Function: scm_reverse_list_to_string (lst)
     Return a newly allocated string made from a list of characters, in
     reverse order.

          (reverse-list->string '(#\a #\B #\c)) ⇒ "cBa"

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-string k [chr]
 -- C Function: scm_make_string (k, chr)
     Return a newly allocated string of length K.  If CHR is given, then
     all elements of the string are initialized to CHR, otherwise the
     contents of the string are unspecified.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_make_string (size_t len, SCM chr)
     Like ‘scm_make_string’, but expects the length as a ‘size_t’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-tabulate proc len
 -- C Function: scm_string_tabulate (proc, len)
     PROC is an integer->char procedure.  Construct a string of size LEN
     by applying PROC to each index to produce the corresponding string
     element.  The order in which PROC is applied to the indices is not
     specified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-join ls [delimiter [grammar]]
 -- C Function: scm_string_join (ls, delimiter, grammar)
     Append the string in the string list LS, using the string DELIMITER
     as a delimiter between the elements of LS.  DELIMITER defaults to
     ‘ ’, that is, strings in LS are appended with the space character
     in between them.  GRAMMAR is a symbol which specifies how the
     delimiter is placed between the strings, and defaults to the symbol
     ‘infix’.

     ‘infix’
          Insert the separator between list elements.  An empty string
          will produce an empty list.
     ‘strict-infix’
          Like ‘infix’, but will raise an error if given the empty list.
     ‘suffix’
          Insert the separator after every list element.
     ‘prefix’
          Insert the separator before each list element.

### 6.6.5.4 List/String conversion
..............................

When processing strings, it is often convenient to first convert them
into a list representation by using the procedure ‘string->list’, work
with the resulting list, and then convert it back into a string.  These
procedures are useful for similar tasks.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string->list str [start [end]]
 -- C Function: scm_substring_to_list (str, start, end)
 -- C Function: scm_string_to_list (str)
     Convert the string STR into a list of characters.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-split str char_pred
 -- C Function: scm_string_split (str, char_pred)
     Split the string STR into a list of substrings delimited by
     appearances of characters that

        • equal CHAR_PRED, if it is a character,

        • satisfy the predicate CHAR_PRED, if it is a procedure,

        • are in the set CHAR_PRED, if it is a character set.

     Note that an empty substring between separator characters will
     result in an empty string in the result list.

          (string-split "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" #\:)
          ⇒
          ("root" "x" "0" "0" "root" "/root" "/bin/bash")

          (string-split "::" #\:)
          ⇒
          ("" "" "")

          (string-split "" #\:)
          ⇒
          ("")

### 6.6.5.5 String Selection
........................

Portions of strings can be extracted by these procedures.  ‘string-ref’
delivers individual characters whereas ‘substring’ can be used to
extract substrings from longer strings.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-length string
 -- C Function: scm_string_length (string)
     Return the number of characters in STRING.

 -- C Function: size_t scm_c_string_length (SCM str)
     Return the number of characters in STR as a ‘size_t’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-ref str k
 -- C Function: scm_string_ref (str, k)
     Return character K of STR using zero-origin indexing.  K must be a
     valid index of STR.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_string_ref (SCM str, size_t k)
     Return character K of STR using zero-origin indexing.  K must be a
     valid index of STR.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-copy str [start [end]]
 -- C Function: scm_substring_copy (str, start, end)
 -- C Function: scm_string_copy (str)
     Return a copy of the given string STR.

     The returned string shares storage with STR initially, but it is
     copied as soon as one of the two strings is modified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: substring str start [end]
 -- C Function: scm_substring (str, start, end)
     Return a new string formed from the characters of STR beginning
     with index START (inclusive) and ending with index END (exclusive).
     STR must be a string, START and END must be exact integers
     satisfying:

     0 <= START <= END <= ‘(string-length STR)’.

     The returned string shares storage with STR initially, but it is
     copied as soon as one of the two strings is modified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: substring/shared str start [end]
 -- C Function: scm_substring_shared (str, start, end)
     Like ‘substring’, but the strings continue to share their storage
     even if they are modified.  Thus, modifications to STR show up in
     the new string, and vice versa.

 -- Scheme Procedure: substring/copy str start [end]
 -- C Function: scm_substring_copy (str, start, end)
     Like ‘substring’, but the storage for the new string is copied
     immediately.

 -- Scheme Procedure: substring/read-only str start [end]
 -- C Function: scm_substring_read_only (str, start, end)
     Like ‘substring’, but the resulting string can not be modified.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_substring (SCM str, size_t start, size_t end)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_substring_shared (SCM str, size_t start,
          size_t end)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_substring_copy (SCM str, size_t start, size_t
          end)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_substring_read_only (SCM str, size_t start,
          size_t end)
     Like ‘scm_substring’, etc.  but the bounds are given as a ‘size_t’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-take s n
 -- C Function: scm_string_take (s, n)
     Return the N first characters of S.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-drop s n
 -- C Function: scm_string_drop (s, n)
     Return all but the first N characters of S.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-take-right s n
 -- C Function: scm_string_take_right (s, n)
     Return the N last characters of S.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-drop-right s n
 -- C Function: scm_string_drop_right (s, n)
     Return all but the last N characters of S.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-pad s len [chr [start [end]]]
 -- Scheme Procedure: string-pad-right s len [chr [start [end]]]
 -- C Function: scm_string_pad (s, len, chr, start, end)
 -- C Function: scm_string_pad_right (s, len, chr, start, end)
     Take characters START to END from the string S and either pad with
     CHR or truncate them to give LEN characters.

     ‘string-pad’ pads or truncates on the left, so for example

          (string-pad "x" 3)     ⇒ "  x"
          (string-pad "abcde" 3) ⇒ "cde"

     ‘string-pad-right’ pads or truncates on the right, so for example

          (string-pad-right "x" 3)     ⇒ "x  "
          (string-pad-right "abcde" 3) ⇒ "abc"

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-trim s [char_pred [start [end]]]
 -- Scheme Procedure: string-trim-right s [char_pred [start [end]]]
 -- Scheme Procedure: string-trim-both s [char_pred [start [end]]]
 -- C Function: scm_string_trim (s, char_pred, start, end)
 -- C Function: scm_string_trim_right (s, char_pred, start, end)
 -- C Function: scm_string_trim_both (s, char_pred, start, end)
     Trim occurrences of CHAR_PRED from the ends of S.

     ‘string-trim’ trims CHAR_PRED characters from the left (start) of
     the string, ‘string-trim-right’ trims them from the right (end) of
     the string, ‘string-trim-both’ trims from both ends.

     CHAR_PRED can be a character, a character set, or a predicate
     procedure to call on each character.  If CHAR_PRED is not given the
     default is whitespace as per ‘char-set:whitespace’ (*note* Standard
     Character Sets::).

          (string-trim " x ")              ⇒ "x "
          (string-trim-right "banana" #\a) ⇒ "banan"
          (string-trim-both ".,xy:;" char-set:punctuation)
                            ⇒ "xy"
          (string-trim-both "xyzzy" (lambda (c)
                                       (or (eqv? c #\x)
                                           (eqv? c #\y))))
                            ⇒ "zz"

### 6.6.5.6 String Modification
...........................

These procedures are for modifying strings in-place.  This means that
the result of the operation is not a new string; instead, the original
string’s memory representation is modified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-set! str k chr
 -- C Function: scm_string_set_x (str, k, chr)
     Store CHR in element K of STR and return an unspecified value.  K
     must be a valid index of STR.

 -- C Function: void scm_c_string_set_x (SCM str, size_t k, SCM chr)
     Like ‘scm_string_set_x’, but the index is given as a ‘size_t’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-fill! str chr [start [end]]
 -- C Function: scm_substring_fill_x (str, chr, start, end)
 -- C Function: scm_string_fill_x (str, chr)
     Stores CHR in every element of the given STR and returns an
     unspecified value.

 -- Scheme Procedure: substring-fill! str start end fill
 -- C Function: scm_substring_fill_x (str, start, end, fill)
     Change every character in STR between START and END to FILL.

          (define y (string-copy "abcdefg"))
          (substring-fill! y 1 3 #\r)
          y
          ⇒ "arrdefg"

 -- Scheme Procedure: substring-move! str1 start1 end1 str2 start2
 -- C Function: scm_substring_move_x (str1, start1, end1, str2, start2)
     Copy the substring of STR1 bounded by START1 and END1 into STR2
     beginning at position START2.  STR1 and STR2 can be the same
     string.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-copy! target tstart s [start [end]]
 -- C Function: scm_string_copy_x (target, tstart, s, start, end)
     Copy the sequence of characters from index range [START, END) in
     string S to string TARGET, beginning at index TSTART.  The
     characters are copied left-to-right or right-to-left as needed –
     the copy is guaranteed to work, even if TARGET and S are the same
     string.  It is an error if the copy operation runs off the end of
     the target string.

### 6.6.5.7 String Comparison
.........................

The procedures in this section are similar to the character ordering
predicates (*note* Characters::), but are defined on character sequences.

   The first set is specified in R5RS and has names that end in ‘?’.
The second set is specified in SRFI-13 and the names have not ending
‘?’.

   The predicates ending in ‘-ci’ ignore the character case when
comparing strings.  For now, case-insensitive comparison is done using
the R5RS rules, where every lower-case character that has a single
character upper-case form is converted to uppercase before comparison.
See *Note* the ‘(ice-9 i18n)’ module: Text Collation, for
locale-dependent string comparison.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string=? s1 s2 s3 ...
     Lexicographic equality predicate; return ‘#t’ if all strings are
     the same length and contain the same characters in the same
     positions, otherwise return ‘#f’.

     The procedure ‘string-ci=?’ treats upper and lower case letters as
     though they were the same character, but ‘string=?’ treats upper
     and lower case as distinct characters.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string<? s1 s2 s3 ...
     Lexicographic ordering predicate; return ‘#t’ if, for every pair of
     consecutive string arguments STR_I and STR_I+1, STR_I is
     lexicographically less than STR_I+1.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string<=? s1 s2 s3 ...
     Lexicographic ordering predicate; return ‘#t’ if, for every pair of
     consecutive string arguments STR_I and STR_I+1, STR_I is
     lexicographically less than or equal to STR_I+1.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string>? s1 s2 s3 ...
     Lexicographic ordering predicate; return ‘#t’ if, for every pair of
     consecutive string arguments STR_I and STR_I+1, STR_I is
     lexicographically greater than STR_I+1.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string>=? s1 s2 s3 ...
     Lexicographic ordering predicate; return ‘#t’ if, for every pair of
     consecutive string arguments STR_I and STR_I+1, STR_I is
     lexicographically greater than or equal to STR_I+1.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-ci=? s1 s2 s3 ...
     Case-insensitive string equality predicate; return ‘#t’ if all
     strings are the same length and their component characters match
     (ignoring case) at each position; otherwise return ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-ci<? s1 s2 s3 ...
     Case insensitive lexicographic ordering predicate; return ‘#t’ if,
     for every pair of consecutive string arguments STR_I and STR_I+1,
     STR_I is lexicographically less than STR_I+1 regardless of case.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-ci<=? s1 s2 s3 ...
     Case insensitive lexicographic ordering predicate; return ‘#t’ if,
     for every pair of consecutive string arguments STR_I and STR_I+1,
     STR_I is lexicographically less than or equal to STR_I+1 regardless
     of case.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-ci>? s1 s2 s3 ...
     Case insensitive lexicographic ordering predicate; return ‘#t’ if,
     for every pair of consecutive string arguments STR_I and STR_I+1,
     STR_I is lexicographically greater than STR_I+1 regardless of case.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-ci>=? s1 s2 s3 ...

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-hash-ci s [bound [start [end]]]

     Compute a hash value for S.  The optional argument BOUND is a

     function.  A positive value restricts the return value to the range
     [0,bound).

   Because the same visual appearance of an abstract Unicode character
can be obtained via multiple sequences of Unicode characters, even the
case-insensitive string comparison functions described above may return
‘#f’ when presented with strings containing different representations of
the same character.  For example, the Unicode character “LATIN SMALL
LETTER S WITH DOT BELOW AND DOT ABOVE” can be represented with a single
character (U+1E69) or by the character “LATIN SMALL LETTER S” (U+0073)
followed by the combining marks “COMBINING DOT BELOW” (U+0323) and
“COMBINING DOT ABOVE” (U+0307).

   For this reason, it is often desirable to ensure that the strings to
be compared are using a mutually consistent representation for every
character.  The Unicode standard defines two methods of normalizing the
contents of strings: Decomposition, which breaks composite characters
into a set of constituent characters with an ordering defined by the
Unicode Standard; and composition, which performs the converse.

   There are two decomposition operations.  “Canonical decomposition”
produces character sequences that share the same visual appearance as
the original characters, while “compatibility decomposition” produces
ones whose visual appearances may differ from the originals but which
represent the same abstract character.

   These operations are encapsulated in the following set of
normalization forms:

“NFD”
     Characters are decomposed to their canonical forms.

“NFKD”
     Characters are decomposed to their compatibility forms.

“NFC”
     Characters are decomposed to their canonical forms, then composed.

“NFKC”
     Characters are decomposed to their compatibility forms, then
     composed.

   The functions below put their arguments into one of the forms
described above.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-normalize-nfd s

 -- C Function: scm_xsubstring (s, from, to, start, end)
     This is the _extended substring_ procedure that implements
     replicated copying of a substring of some string.

     S is a string, START and END are optional arguments that demarcate
     a substring of S, defaulting to 0 and the length of S.  Replicate
     this substring up and down index space, in both the positive and
     negative directions.  ‘xsubstring’ returns the substring of this

 -- C Function: scm_string_replace (s1, s2, start1, end1, start2, end2)
     Return the string S1, but with the characters START1 ... END1
     replaced by the characters START2 ... END2 from S2.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-tokenize s [token_set [start [end]]]
 -- C Function: scm_string_tokenize (s, token_set, start, end)
     Split the string S into a list of substrings, where each substring
     is a maximal non-empty contiguous sequence of characters from the
     character set TOKEN_SET, which defaults to ‘char-set:graphic’.  If
     START or END indices are provided, they restrict ‘string-tokenize’
     to operating on the indicated substring of S.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-filter char_pred s [start [end]]
 -- C Function: scm_string_filter (char_pred, s, start, end)
     Filter the string S, retaining only those characters which satisfy
     CHAR_PRED.

     If CHAR_PRED is a procedure, it is applied to each character as a
     predicate, if it is a character, it is tested for equality and if
     it is a character set, it is tested for membership.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-delete char_pred s [start [end]]
 -- C Function: scm_string_delete (char_pred, s, start, end)
     Delete characters satisfying CHAR_PRED from S.

     If CHAR_PRED is a procedure, it is applied to each character as a
     predicate, if it is a character, it is tested for equality and if
     it is a character set, it is tested for membership.

   The following additional functions are available in the module
‘(ice-9 string-fun)’.  They can be used with:

     (use-modules (ice-9 string-fun))

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-replace-substring str substring replacement
     Return a new string where every instance of SUBSTRING in string STR
     has been replaced by REPLACEMENT.  For example:

          (string-replace-substring "a ring of strings" "ring" "rut")
          ⇒ "a rut of struts"

### 6.6.5.13 Representing Strings as Bytes
......................................

Out in the cold world outside of Guile, not all strings are treated in
the same way.  Out there there are only bytes, and there are many ways
of representing a strings (sequences of characters) as binary data
(sequences of bytes).

   As a user, usually you don’t have to think about this very much.
When you type on your keyboard, your system encodes your keystrokes as
bytes according to the locale that you have configured on your computer.
Guile uses the locale to decode those bytes back into characters –
hopefully the same characters that you typed in.

   All is not so clear when dealing with a system with multiple users,
such as a web server.  Your web server might get a request from one user
for data encoded in the ISO-8859-1 character set, and then another
request from a different user for UTF-8 data.

   Guile provides an “iconv” module for converting between strings and
sequences of bytes.  *Note* Bytevectors::, for more on how Guile
represents raw byte sequences.  This module gets its name from the
common UNIX command of the same name.

   Note that often it is sufficient to just read and write strings from
ports instead of using these functions.  To do this, specify the port
encoding using ‘set-port-encoding!’.  *Note* Ports::, for more on ports
and character encodings.

   Unlike the rest of the procedures in this section, you have to load
the ‘iconv’ module before having access to these procedures:

     (use-modules (ice-9 iconv))

 -- Scheme Procedure: string->bytevector string encoding
          [conversion-strategy]
     Encode STRING as a sequence of bytes.

     The string will be encoded in the character set specified by the
     ENCODING string.  If the string has characters that cannot be
     represented in the encoding, by default this procedure raises an
     ‘encoding-error’.  Pass a CONVERSION-STRATEGY argument to specify
     other behaviors.

     The return value is a bytevector.  *Note* Bytevectors::, for more on
     bytevectors.  *Note* Ports::, for more on character encodings and
     conversion strategies.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector->string bytevector encoding
          [conversion-strategy]
     Decode BYTEVECTOR into a string.

     The bytes will be decoded from the character set by the ENCODING
     string.  If the bytes do not form a valid encoding, by default this
     procedure raises an ‘decoding-error’.  As with
     ‘string->bytevector’, pass the optional CONVERSION-STRATEGY
     argument to modify this behavior.  *Note* Ports::, for more on
     character encodings and conversion strategies.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-output-encoded-string encoding proc
          [conversion-strategy]
     Like ‘call-with-output-string’, but instead of returning a string,
     returns a encoding of the string according to ENCODING, as a
     bytevector.  This procedure can be more efficient than collecting a
     string and then converting it via ‘string->bytevector’.

### 6.6.5.14 Conversion to/from C
.............................

When creating a Scheme string from a C string or when converting a
Scheme string to a C string, the concept of character encoding becomes
important.

   In C, a string is just a sequence of bytes, and the character
encoding describes the relation between these bytes and the actual
characters that make up the string.  For Scheme strings, character
encoding is not an issue (most of the time), since in Scheme you usually
treat strings as character sequences, not byte sequences.

   Converting to C and converting from C each have their own challenges.

   When converting from C to Scheme, it is important that the sequence
of bytes in the C string be valid with respect to its encoding.  ASCII
strings, for example, can’t have any bytes greater than 127.  An ASCII
byte greater than 127 is considered _ill-formed_ and cannot be converted
into a Scheme character.

   Problems can occur in the reverse operation as well.  Not all
character encodings can hold all possible Scheme characters.  Some
encodings, like ASCII for example, can only describe a small subset of
all possible characters.  So, when converting to C, one must first
decide what to do with Scheme characters that can’t be represented in
the C string.

   Converting a Scheme string to a C string will often allocate fresh
memory to hold the result.  You must take care that this memory is
properly freed eventually.  In many cases, this can be achieved by using
‘scm_dynwind_free’ inside an appropriate dynwind context, *Note* Dynamic
Wind::.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_locale_string (const char *str)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_locale_stringn (const char *str, size_t
          len)
     Creates a new Scheme string that has the same contents as STR when
     interpreted in the character encoding of the current locale.

     For ‘scm_from_locale_string’, STR must be null-terminated.

     For ‘scm_from_locale_stringn’, LEN specifies the length of STR in
     bytes, and STR does not need to be null-terminated.  If LEN is
     ‘(size_t)-1’, then STR does need to be null-terminated and the real
     length will be found with ‘strlen’.

     If the C string is ill-formed, an error will be raised.

     Note that these functions should _not_ be used to convert C string
     constants, because there is no guarantee that the current locale
     will match that of the execution character set, used for string and
     character constants.  Most modern C compilers use UTF-8 by default,
     so to convert C string constants we recommend
     ‘scm_from_utf8_string’.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_take_locale_string (char *str)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_take_locale_stringn (char *str, size_t len)
     Like ‘scm_from_locale_string’ and ‘scm_from_locale_stringn’,
     respectively, but also frees STR with ‘free’ eventually.  Thus, you
     can use this function when you would free STR anyway immediately
     after creating the Scheme string.  In certain cases, Guile can then
     use STR directly as its internal representation.

 -- C Function: char * scm_to_locale_string (SCM str)
 -- C Function: char * scm_to_locale_stringn (SCM str, size_t *lenp)
     Returns a C string with the same contents as STR in the character
     encoding of the current locale.  The C string must be freed with
     ‘free’ eventually, maybe by using ‘scm_dynwind_free’, *Note* Dynamic
     Wind::.

     For ‘scm_to_locale_string’, the returned string is null-terminated
     and an error is signalled when STR contains ‘#\nul’ characters.

     For ‘scm_to_locale_stringn’ and LENP not ‘NULL’, STR might contain
     ‘#\nul’ characters and the length of the returned string in bytes
     is stored in ‘*LENP’.  The returned string will not be
     null-terminated in this case.  If LENP is ‘NULL’,
     ‘scm_to_locale_stringn’ behaves like ‘scm_to_locale_string’.

     If a character in STR cannot be represented in the character
     encoding of the current locale, the default port conversion
     strategy is used.  *Note* Ports::, for more on conversion
     strategies.

     If the conversion strategy is ‘error’, an error will be raised.  If
     it is ‘substitute’, a replacement character, such as a question
     mark, will be inserted in its place.  If it is ‘escape’, a hex
     escape will be inserted in its place.

 -- C Function: size_t scm_to_locale_stringbuf (SCM str, char *buf,
          size_t max_len)
     Puts STR as a C string in the current locale encoding into the
     memory pointed to by BUF.  The buffer at BUF has room for MAX_LEN
     bytes and ‘scm_to_local_stringbuf’ will never store more than that.
     No terminating ‘'\0'’ will be stored.

     The return value of ‘scm_to_locale_stringbuf’ is the number of
     bytes that are needed for all of STR, regardless of whether BUF was
     large enough to hold them.  Thus, when the return value is larger
     than MAX_LEN, only MAX_LEN bytes have been stored and you probably
     need to try again with a larger buffer.

   For most situations, string conversion should occur using the current
locale, such as with the functions above.  But there may be cases where
one wants to convert strings from a character encoding other than the
locale’s character encoding.  For these cases, the lower-level functions
‘scm_to_stringn’ and ‘scm_from_stringn’ are provided.  These functions
should seldom be necessary if one is properly using locales.

 -- C Type: scm_t_string_failed_conversion_handler
     This is an enumerated type that can take one of three values:
     ‘SCM_FAILED_CONVERSION_ERROR’,
     ‘SCM_FAILED_CONVERSION_QUESTION_MARK’, and
     ‘SCM_FAILED_CONVERSION_ESCAPE_SEQUENCE’.  They are used to indicate
     a strategy for handling characters that cannot be converted to or
     from a given character encoding.  ‘SCM_FAILED_CONVERSION_ERROR’
     indicates that a conversion should throw an error if some
     characters cannot be converted.
     ‘SCM_FAILED_CONVERSION_QUESTION_MARK’ indicates that a conversion
     should replace unconvertable characters with the question mark
     character.  And, ‘SCM_FAILED_CONVERSION_ESCAPE_SEQUENCE’ requests
     that a conversion should replace an unconvertable character with an
     escape sequence.

     While all three strategies apply when converting Scheme strings to
     C, only ‘SCM_FAILED_CONVERSION_ERROR’ and
     ‘SCM_FAILED_CONVERSION_QUESTION_MARK’ can be used when converting C
     strings to Scheme.

 -- C Function: char *scm_to_stringn (SCM str, size_t *lenp, const char
          *encoding, scm_t_string_failed_conversion_handler handler)
     This function returns a newly allocated C string from the Guile
     string STR.  The length of the returned string in bytes will be
     returned in LENP.  The character encoding of the C string is passed
     as the ASCII, null-terminated C string ENCODING.  The HANDLER
     parameter gives a strategy for dealing with characters that cannot
     be converted into ENCODING.

     If LENP is ‘NULL’, this function will return a null-terminated C
     string.  It will throw an error if the string contains a null
     character.

     The Scheme interface to this function is ‘string->bytevector’, from
     the ‘ice-9 iconv’ module.  *Note* Representing Strings as Bytes::.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_stringn (const char *str, size_t len, const
          char *encoding, scm_t_string_failed_conversion_handler
          handler)
     This function returns a scheme string from the C string STR.  The
     length in bytes of the C string is input as LEN.  The encoding of
     the C string is passed as the ASCII, null-terminated C string
     ‘encoding’.  The HANDLER parameters suggests a strategy for dealing
     with unconvertable characters.

     The Scheme interface to this function is ‘bytevector->string’.
     *Note* Representing Strings as Bytes::.

   The following conversion functions are provided as a convenience for
the most commonly used encodings.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_latin1_string (const char *str)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_utf8_string (const char *str)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_utf32_string (const scm_t_wchar *str)
     Return a scheme string from the null-terminated C string STR, which
     is ISO-8859-1-, UTF-8-, or UTF-32-encoded.  These functions should
     be used to convert hard-coded C string constants into Scheme
     strings.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_latin1_stringn (const char *str, size_t
          len)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_utf8_stringn (const char *str, size_t len)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_utf32_stringn (const scm_t_wchar *str,
          size_t len)
     Return a scheme string from C string STR, which is ISO-8859-1-,
     UTF-8-, or UTF-32-encoded, of length LEN.  LEN is the number of
     bytes pointed to by STR for ‘scm_from_latin1_stringn’ and
     ‘scm_from_utf8_stringn’; it is the number of elements (code points)
     in STR in the case of ‘scm_from_utf32_stringn’.

 -- C function: char *scm_to_latin1_stringn (SCM str, size_t *lenp)
 -- C function: char *scm_to_utf8_stringn (SCM str, size_t *lenp)
 -- C function: scm_t_wchar *scm_to_utf32_stringn (SCM str, size_t
          *lenp)
     Return a newly allocated, ISO-8859-1-, UTF-8-, or UTF-32-encoded C
     string from Scheme string STR.  An error is thrown when STR cannot
     be converted to the specified encoding.  If LENP is ‘NULL’, the
     returned C string will be null terminated, and an error will be
     thrown if the C string would otherwise contain null characters.  If
     LENP is not ‘NULL’, the string is not null terminated, and the
     length of the returned string is returned in LENP.  The length
     returned is the number of bytes for ‘scm_to_latin1_stringn’ and
     ‘scm_to_utf8_stringn’; it is the number of elements (code points)
     for ‘scm_to_utf32_stringn’.

   It is not often the case, but sometimes when you are dealing with the
implementation details of a port, you need to encode and decode strings
according to the encoding and conversion strategy of the port.  There
are some convenience functions for that purpose as well.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_port_string (const char *str, SCM port)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_port_stringn (const char *str, size_t len,
          SCM port)
 -- C Function: char* scm_to_port_string (SCM str, SCM port)
 -- C Function: char* scm_to_port_stringn (SCM str, size_t *lenp, SCM
          port)
     Like ‘scm_from_stringn’ and friends, except they take their
     encoding and conversion strategy from a given port object.

### 6.6.5.15 String Internals
.........................

Guile stores each string in memory as a contiguous array of Unicode code
points along with an associated set of attributes.  If all of the code
points of a string have an integer range between 0 and 255 inclusive,
the code point array is stored as one byte per code point: it is stored
as an ISO-8859-1 (aka Latin-1) string.  If any of the code points of the
string has an integer value greater that 255, the code point array is
stored as four bytes per code point: it is stored as a UTF-32 string.

   Conversion between the one-byte-per-code-point and
four-bytes-per-code-point representations happens automatically as
necessary.

   No API is provided to set the internal representation of strings;
however, there are pair of procedures available to query it.  These are
debugging procedures.  Using them in production code is discouraged,
since the details of Guile’s internal representation of strings may
change from release to release.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-bytes-per-char str
 -- C Function: scm_string_bytes_per_char (str)
     Return the number of bytes used to encode a Unicode code point in
     string STR.  The result is one or four.

 -- Scheme Procedure: %string-dump str
 -- C Function: scm_sys_string_dump (str)
     Returns an association list containing debugging information for
     STR.  The association list has the following entries.

     ‘string’
          The string itself.

     ‘start’
          The start index of the string into its stringbuf

     ‘length’
          The length of the string

     ‘shared’
          If this string is a substring, it returns its parent string.
          Otherwise, it returns ‘#f’

     ‘read-only’
          ‘#t’ if the string is read-only

     ‘stringbuf-chars’
          A new string containing this string’s stringbuf’s characters

     ‘stringbuf-length’
          The number of characters in this stringbuf

     ‘stringbuf-shared’
          ‘#t’ if this stringbuf is shared

     ‘stringbuf-wide’
          ‘#t’ if this stringbuf’s characters are stored in a 32-bit
          buffer, or ‘#f’ if they are stored in an 8-bit buffer

6.6.6 Symbols
-------------

Symbols in Scheme are widely used in three ways: as items of discrete
data, as lookup keys for alists and hash tables, and to denote variable
references.

   A “symbol” is similar to a string in that it is defined by a sequence
of characters.  The sequence of characters is known as the symbol’s
“name”.  In the usual case — that is, where the symbol’s name doesn’t
include any characters that could be confused with other elements of
Scheme syntax — a symbol is written in a Scheme program by writing the
sequence of characters that make up the name, _without_ any quotation
marks or other special syntax.  For example, the symbol whose name is
“multiply-by-2” is written, simply:

     multiply-by-2

   Notice how this differs from a _string_ with contents
“multiply-by-2”, which is written with double quotation marks, like
this:

     "multiply-by-2"

   Looking beyond how they are written, symbols are different from
strings in two important respects.

   The first important difference is uniqueness.  If the same-looking
string is read twice from two different places in a program, the result
is two _different_ string objects whose contents just happen to be the
same.  If, on the other hand, the same-looking symbol is read twice from
two different places in a program, the result is the _same_ symbol
object both times.

   Given two read symbols, you can use ‘eq?’ to test whether they are
the same (that is, have the same name).  ‘eq?’ is the most efficient
comparison operator in Scheme, and comparing two symbols like this is as
fast as comparing, for example, two numbers.  Given two strings, on the
other hand, you must use ‘equal?’ or ‘string=?’, which are much slower
comparison operators, to determine whether the strings have the same
contents.

     (define sym1 (quote hello))
     (define sym2 (quote hello))
     (eq? sym1 sym2) ⇒ #t

     (define str1 "hello")
     (define str2 "hello")
     (eq? str1 str2) ⇒ #f
     (equal? str1 str2) ⇒ #t

   The second important difference is that symbols, unlike strings, are
not self-evaluating.  This is why we need the ‘(quote ...)’s in the
example above: ‘(quote hello)’ evaluates to the symbol named "hello"
itself, whereas an unquoted ‘hello’ is _read_ as the symbol named
"hello" and evaluated as a variable reference ... about which more below
(*note* Symbol Variables::).

### 6.6.6.1 Symbols as Discrete Data
................................

Numbers and symbols are similar to the extent that they both lend
themselves to ‘eq?’ comparison.  But symbols are more descriptive than
numbers, because a symbol’s name can be used directly to describe the
concept for which that symbol stands.

   For example, imagine that you need to represent some colours in a
computer program.  Using numbers, you would have to choose arbitrarily
some mapping between numbers and colours, and then take care to use that
mapping consistently:

     ;; 1=red, 2=green, 3=purple

     (if (eq? (colour-of vehicle) 1)
         ...)

You can make the mapping more explicit and the code more readable by
defining constants:

     (define red 1)
     (define green 2)
     (define purple 3)

     (if (eq? (colour-of vehicle) red)
         ...)

But the simplest and clearest approach is not to use numbers at all, but
symbols whose names specify the colours that they refer to:

     (if (eq? (colour-of vehicle) 'red)
         ...)

   The descriptive advantages of symbols over numbers increase as the
set of concepts that you want to describe grows.  Suppose that a car
object can have other properties as well, such as whether it has or
uses:

   • automatic or manual transmission
   • leaded or unleaded fuel
   • power steering (or not).

Then a car’s combined property set could be naturally represented and
manipulated as a list of symbols:

     (properties-of vehicle1)
     ⇒
     (red manual unleaded power-steering)

     (if (memq 'power-steering (properties-of vehicle1))
         (display "Unfit people can drive this vehicle.\n")
         (display "You'll need strong arms to drive this vehicle!\n"))
     ⊣
     Unfit people can drive this vehicle.

   Remember, the fundamental property of symbols that we are relying on
here is that an occurrence of ‘'red’ in one part of a program is an
_indistinguishable_ symbol from an occurrence of ‘'red’ in another part
of a program; this means that symbols can usefully be compared using
‘eq?’.  At the same time, symbols have naturally descriptive names.
This combination of efficiency and descriptive power makes them ideal
for use as discrete data.

### 6.6.6.2 Symbols as Lookup Keys
..............................

Given their efficiency and descriptive power, it is natural to use
symbols as the keys in an association list or hash table.

   To illustrate this, consider a more structured representation of the
car properties example from the preceding subsection.  Rather than
mixing all the properties up together in a flat list, we could use an
association list like this:

     (define car1-properties '((colour . red)
                               (transmission . manual)
                               (fuel . unleaded)
                               (steering . power-assisted)))

   Notice how this structure is more explicit and extensible than the
flat list.  For example it makes clear that ‘manual’ refers to the
transmission rather than, say, the windows or the locking of the car.
It also allows further properties to use the same symbols among their
possible values without becoming ambiguous:

     (define car1-properties '((colour . red)
                               (transmission . manual)
                               (fuel . unleaded)
                               (steering . power-assisted)
                               (seat-colour . red)
                               (locking . manual)))

   With a representation like this, it is easy to use the efficient
‘assq-XXX’ family of procedures (*note* Association Lists::) to extract
or change individual pieces of information:

     (assq-ref car1-properties 'fuel) ⇒ unleaded
     (assq-ref car1-properties 'transmission) ⇒ manual

     (assq-set! car1-properties 'seat-colour 'black)
     ⇒
     ((colour . red)
      (transmission . manual)
      (fuel . unleaded)
      (steering . power-assisted)
      (seat-colour . black)
      (locking . manual)))

   Hash tables also have keys, and exactly the same arguments apply to
the use of symbols in hash tables as in association lists.  The hash
value that Guile uses to decide where to add a symbol-keyed entry to a
hash table can be obtained by calling the ‘symbol-hash’ procedure:

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-hash symbol
 -- C Function: scm_symbol_hash (symbol)
     Return a hash value for SYMBOL.

   See *note* Hash Tables:: for information about hash tables in general,
and for why you might choose to use a hash table rather than an
association list.

### 6.6.6.3 Symbols as Denoting Variables
.....................................

When an unquoted symbol in a Scheme program is evaluated, it is
interpreted as a variable reference, and the result of the evaluation is
the appropriate variable’s value.

   For example, when the expression ‘(string-length "abcd")’ is read and
evaluated, the sequence of characters ‘string-length’ is read as the
symbol whose name is "string-length".  This symbol is associated with a
variable whose value is the procedure that implements string length
calculation.  Therefore evaluation of the ‘string-length’ symbol results
in that procedure.

   The details of the connection between an unquoted symbol and the
variable to which it refers are explained elsewhere.  See *note* Binding
Constructs::, for how associations between symbols and variables are
created, and *note* Modules::, for how those associations are affected by
Guile’s module system.

### 6.6.6.4 Operations Related to Symbols
.....................................

Given any Scheme value, you can determine whether it is a symbol using
the ‘symbol?’ primitive:

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol? obj
 -- C Function: scm_symbol_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a symbol, otherwise return ‘#f’.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_symbol (SCM val)
     Equivalent to ‘scm_is_true (scm_symbol_p (val))’.

   Once you know that you have a symbol, you can obtain its name as a
string by calling ‘symbol->string’.  Note that Guile differs by default
from R5RS on the details of ‘symbol->string’ as regards
case-sensitivity:

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol->string s
 -- C Function: scm_symbol_to_string (s)
     Return the name of symbol S as a string.  By default, Guile reads
     symbols case-sensitively, so the string returned will have the same
     case variation as the sequence of characters that caused S to be
     created.

     If Guile is set to read symbols case-insensitively (as specified by
     R5RS), and S comes into being as part of a literal expression
     (*note* (r5rs)Literal expressions::) or by a call to the ‘read’ or
     ‘string-ci->symbol’ procedures, Guile converts any alphabetic
     characters in the symbol’s name to lower case before creating the
     symbol object, so the string returned here will be in lower case.

     If S was created by ‘string->symbol’, the case of characters in the
     string returned will be the same as that in the string that was
     passed to ‘string->symbol’, regardless of Guile’s case-sensitivity
     setting at the time S was created.

     It is an error to apply mutation procedures like ‘string-set!’ to
     strings returned by this procedure.

   Most symbols are created by writing them literally in code.  However
it is also possible to create symbols programmatically using the
following procedures:

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol char...
     Return a newly allocated symbol made from the given character
     arguments.

          (symbol #\x #\y #\z) ⇒ xyz

 -- Scheme Procedure: list->symbol lst
     Return a newly allocated symbol made from a list of characters.

          (list->symbol '(#\a #\b #\c)) ⇒ abc

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-append arg ...
     Return a newly allocated symbol whose characters form the
     concatenation of the given symbols, ARG ....

          (let ((h 'hello))
            (symbol-append h 'world))
          ⇒ helloworld

 -- Scheme Procedure: string->symbol string
 -- C Function: scm_string_to_symbol (string)
     Return the symbol whose name is STRING.  This procedure can create
     symbols with names containing special characters or letters in the
     non-standard case, but it is usually a bad idea to create such
     symbols because in some implementations of Scheme they cannot be
     read as themselves.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-ci->symbol str
 -- C Function: scm_string_ci_to_symbol (str)
     Return the symbol whose name is STR.  If Guile is currently reading
     symbols case-insensitively, STR is converted to lowercase before
     the returned symbol is looked up or created.

   The following examples illustrate Guile’s detailed behaviour as
regards the case-sensitivity of symbols:

     (read-enable 'case-insensitive)   ; R5RS compliant behaviour

     (symbol->string 'flying-fish)    ⇒ "flying-fish"
     (symbol->string 'Martin)         ⇒ "martin"
     (symbol->string
        (string->symbol "Malvina"))   ⇒ "Malvina"

     (eq? 'mISSISSIppi 'mississippi)  ⇒ #t
     (string->symbol "mISSISSIppi")   ⇒ mISSISSIppi
     (eq? 'bitBlt (string->symbol "bitBlt")) ⇒ #f
     (eq? 'LolliPop
       (string->symbol (symbol->string 'LolliPop))) ⇒ #t
     (string=? "K. Harper, M.D."
       (symbol->string
         (string->symbol "K. Harper, M.D."))) ⇒ #t

     (read-disable 'case-insensitive)   ; Guile default behaviour

     (symbol->string 'flying-fish)    ⇒ "flying-fish"
     (symbol->string 'Martin)         ⇒ "Martin"
     (symbol->string
        (string->symbol "Malvina"))   ⇒ "Malvina"

     (eq? 'mISSISSIppi 'mississippi)  ⇒ #f
     (string->symbol "mISSISSIppi")   ⇒ mISSISSIppi
     (eq? 'bitBlt (string->symbol "bitBlt")) ⇒ #t
     (eq? 'LolliPop
       (string->symbol (symbol->string 'LolliPop))) ⇒ #t
     (string=? "K. Harper, M.D."
       (symbol->string
         (string->symbol "K. Harper, M.D."))) ⇒ #t

   From C, there are lower level functions that construct a Scheme
symbol from a C string in the current locale encoding.

   When you want to do more from C, you should convert between symbols
and strings using ‘scm_symbol_to_string’ and ‘scm_string_to_symbol’ and
work with the strings.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_latin1_symbol (const char *name)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_utf8_symbol (const char *name)
     Construct and return a Scheme symbol whose name is specified by the
     null-terminated C string NAME.  These are appropriate when the C
     string is hard-coded in the source code.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_locale_symbol (const char *name)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_locale_symboln (const char *name, size_t
          len)
     Construct and return a Scheme symbol whose name is specified by
     NAME.  For ‘scm_from_locale_symbol’, NAME must be null terminated;
     for ‘scm_from_locale_symboln’ the length of NAME is specified
     explicitly by LEN.

     Note that these functions should _not_ be used when NAME is a C
     string constant, because there is no guarantee that the current
     locale will match that of the execution character set, used for
     string and character constants.  Most modern C compilers use UTF-8
     by default, so in such cases we recommend ‘scm_from_utf8_symbol’.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_take_locale_symbol (char *str)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_take_locale_symboln (char *str, size_t len)
     Like ‘scm_from_locale_symbol’ and ‘scm_from_locale_symboln’,
     respectively, but also frees STR with ‘free’ eventually.  Thus, you
     can use this function when you would free STR anyway immediately
     after creating the Scheme string.  In certain cases, Guile can then
     use STR directly as its internal representation.

   The size of a symbol can also be obtained from C:

 -- C Function: size_t scm_c_symbol_length (SCM sym)
     Return the number of characters in SYM.

   Finally, some applications, especially those that generate new Scheme
code dynamically, need to generate symbols for use in the generated
code.  The ‘gensym’ primitive meets this need:

 -- Scheme Procedure: gensym [prefix]
 -- C Function: scm_gensym (prefix)
     Create a new symbol with a name constructed from a prefix and a
     counter value.  The string PREFIX can be specified as an optional
     argument.  Default prefix is ‘ g’.  The counter is increased by 1
     at each call.  There is no provision for resetting the counter.

   The symbols generated by ‘gensym’ are _likely_ to be unique, since
their names begin with a space and it is only otherwise possible to
generate such symbols if a programmer goes out of their way to do so.
Uniqueness can be guaranteed by instead using uninterned symbols (*note*
Symbol Uninterned::), though they can’t be usefully written out and read
back in.

### 6.6.6.5 Extended Read Syntax for Symbols
........................................

The read syntax for a symbol is a sequence of letters, digits, and
“extended alphabetic characters”, beginning with a character that cannot
begin a number.  In addition, the special cases of ‘+’, ‘-’, and ‘...’
are read as symbols even though numbers can begin with ‘+’, ‘-’ or ‘.’.

   Extended alphabetic characters may be used within identifiers as if
they were letters.  The set of extended alphabetic characters is:

     ! $ % & * + - . / : < = > ? @ ^ _ ~

   In addition to the standard read syntax defined above (which is taken
from R5RS (*note* (r5rs)Formal syntax::)), Guile provides an extended
symbol read syntax that allows the inclusion of unusual characters such
as space characters, newlines and parentheses.  If (for whatever reason)
you need to write a symbol containing characters not mentioned above,
you can do so as follows.

   • Begin the symbol with the characters ‘#{’,

   • write the characters of the symbol and

   • finish the symbol with the characters ‘}#’.

   Here are a few examples of this form of read syntax.  The first
symbol needs to use extended syntax because it contains a space
character, the second because it contains a line break, and the last
because it looks like a number.

     #{foo bar}#

     #{what
     ever}#

     #{4242}#

   Although Guile provides this extended read syntax for symbols,
widespread usage of it is discouraged because it is not portable and not
very readable.

   Alternatively, if you enable the ‘r7rs-symbols’ read option (see
*note* Scheme Read::), you can write arbitrary symbols using the same
notation used for strings, except delimited by vertical bars instead of
double quotes.

     |foo bar|
     |\x3BB; is a greek lambda|
     |\| is a vertical bar|

   Note that there’s also an ‘r7rs-symbols’ print option (*note* Scheme
Write::).  To enable the use of this notation, evaluate one or both of
the following expressions:

     (read-enable  'r7rs-symbols)
     (print-enable 'r7rs-symbols)


File: guile.info,  Node: Symbol Uninterned,  Prev: Symbol Read Syntax,  Up: Symbols

### 6.6.6.6 Uninterned Symbols
..........................

What makes symbols useful is that they are automatically kept unique.
There are no two symbols that are distinct objects but have the same
name.  But of course, there is no rule without exception.  In addition
to the normal symbols that have been discussed up to now, you can also
create special “uninterned” symbols that behave slightly differently.

   To understand what is different about them and why they might be
useful, we look at how normal symbols are actually kept unique.

   Whenever Guile wants to find the symbol with a specific name, for
example during ‘read’ or when executing ‘string->symbol’, it first looks
into a table of all existing symbols to find out whether a symbol with
the given name already exists.  When this is the case, Guile just
returns that symbol.  When not, a new symbol with the name is created
and entered into the table so that it can be found later.

   Sometimes you might want to create a symbol that is guaranteed
‘fresh’, i.e. a symbol that did not exist previously.  You might also
want to somehow guarantee that no one else will ever unintentionally
stumble across your symbol in the future.  These properties of a symbol
are often needed when generating code during macro expansion.  When
introducing new temporary variables, you want to guarantee that they
don’t conflict with variables in other people’s code.

   The simplest way to arrange for this is to create a new symbol but
not enter it into the global table of all symbols.  That way, no one
will ever get access to your symbol by chance.  Symbols that are not in
the table are called “uninterned”.  Of course, symbols that _are_ in the
table are called “interned”.

   You create new uninterned symbols with the function ‘make-symbol’.
You can test whether a symbol is interned or not with
‘symbol-interned?’.

   Uninterned symbols break the rule that the name of a symbol uniquely
identifies the symbol object.  Because of this, they can not be written
out and read back in like interned symbols.  Currently, Guile has no
support for reading uninterned symbols.  Note that the function ‘gensym’
does not return uninterned symbols for this reason.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-symbol name
 -- C Function: scm_make_symbol (name)
     Return a new uninterned symbol with the name NAME.  The returned
     symbol is guaranteed to be unique and future calls to
     ‘string->symbol’ will not return it.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-interned? symbol
 -- C Function: scm_symbol_interned_p (symbol)
     Return ‘#t’ if SYMBOL is interned, otherwise return ‘#f’.

   For example:

     (define foo-1 (string->symbol "foo"))
     (define foo-2 (string->symbol "foo"))
     (define foo-3 (make-symbol "foo"))
     (define foo-4 (make-symbol "foo"))

     (eq? foo-1 foo-2)
     ⇒ #t
     ; Two interned symbols with the same name are the same object,

     (eq? foo-1 foo-3)
     ⇒ #f
     ; but a call to make-symbol with the same name returns a
     ; distinct object.

     (eq? foo-3 foo-4)
     ⇒ #f
     ; A call to make-symbol always returns a new object, even for
     ; the same name.

     foo-3
     ⇒ #<uninterned-symbol foo 8085290>
     ; Uninterned symbols print differently from interned symbols,

     (symbol? foo-3)
     ⇒ #t
     ; but they are still symbols,

     (symbol-interned? foo-3)
     ⇒ #f
     ; just not interned.

6.6.7 Keywords
--------------

Keywords are self-evaluating objects with a convenient read syntax that
makes them easy to type.

   Guile’s keyword support conforms to R5RS, and adds a (switchable)
read syntax extension to permit keywords to begin with ‘:’ as well as
‘#:’, or to end with ‘:’.

* Keyword Procedures::          Procedures for dealing with keywords.


File: guile.info,  Node: Why Use Keywords?,  Next: Coding With Keywords,  Up: Keywords

### 6.6.7.1 Why Use Keywords?
.........................

Keywords are useful in contexts where a program or procedure wants to be
able to accept a large number of optional arguments without making its
interface unmanageable.

   To illustrate this, consider a hypothetical ‘make-window’ procedure,
which creates a new window on the screen for drawing into using some
graphical toolkit.  There are many parameters that the caller might like
to specify, but which could also be sensibly defaulted, for example:

   • color depth – Default: the color depth for the screen

   • background color – Default: white

   • width – Default: 600

   • height – Default: 400

   If ‘make-window’ did not use keywords, the caller would have to pass
in a value for each possible argument, remembering the correct argument
order and using a special value to indicate the default value for that
argument:

     (make-window 'default              ;; Color depth
                  'default              ;; Background color
                  800                   ;; Width
                  100                   ;; Height
                  ...)                  ;; More make-window arguments

   With keywords, on the other hand, defaulted arguments are omitted,
and non-default arguments are clearly tagged by the appropriate keyword.
As a result, the invocation becomes much clearer:

     (make-window #:width 800 #:height 100)

   On the other hand, for a simpler procedure with few arguments, the
use of keywords would be a hindrance rather than a help.  The primitive
procedure ‘cons’, for example, would not be improved if it had to be
invoked as

     (cons #:car x #:cdr y)

   So the decision whether to use keywords or not is purely pragmatic:
use them if they will clarify the procedure invocation at point of call.

### 6.6.7.2 Coding With Keywords
............................

If a procedure wants to support keywords, it should take a rest argument
and then use whatever means is convenient to extract keywords and their
corresponding arguments from the contents of that rest argument.

   The following example illustrates the principle: the code for
‘make-window’ uses a helper procedure called ‘get-keyword-value’ to
extract individual keyword arguments from the rest argument.

     (define (get-keyword-value args keyword default)
       (let ((kv (memq keyword args)))
         (if (and kv (>= (length kv) 2))
             (cadr kv)
             default)))

     (define (make-window . args)
       (let ((depth  (get-keyword-value args #:depth  screen-depth))
             (bg     (get-keyword-value args #:bg     "white"))
             (width  (get-keyword-value args #:width  800))
             (height (get-keyword-value args #:height 100))
             ...)
         ...))

   But you don’t need to write ‘get-keyword-value’.  The ‘(ice-9
optargs)’ module provides a set of powerful macros that you can use to
implement keyword-supporting procedures like this:

     (use-modules (ice-9 optargs))

     (define (make-window . args)
       (let-keywords args #f ((depth  screen-depth)
                              (bg     "white")
                              (width  800)
                              (height 100))
         ...))

Or, even more economically, like this:

     (use-modules (ice-9 optargs))

     (define* (make-window #:key (depth  screen-depth)
                                 (bg     "white")
                                 (width  800)
                                 (height 100))
       ...)

   For further details on ‘let-keywords’, ‘define*’ and other facilities
provided by the ‘(ice-9 optargs)’ module, see *note* Optional
Arguments::.

   To handle keyword arguments from procedures implemented in C, use
‘scm_c_bind_keyword_arguments’ (*note* Keyword Procedures::).


File: guile.info,  Node: Keyword Read Syntax,  Next: Keyword Procedures,  Prev: Coding With Keywords,  Up: Keywords

### 6.6.7.3 Keyword Read Syntax
...........................

Guile, by default, only recognizes a keyword syntax that is compatible
with R5RS. A token of the form ‘#:NAME’, where ‘NAME’ has the same
syntax as a Scheme symbol (*note* Symbol Read Syntax::), is the external
representation of the keyword named ‘NAME’.  Keyword objects print using
this syntax as well, so values containing keyword objects can be read
back into Guile.  When used in an expression, keywords are self-quoting
objects.

   If the ‘keywords’ read option is set to ‘'prefix’, Guile also
recognizes the alternative read syntax ‘:NAME’.  Otherwise, tokens of
the form ‘:NAME’ are read as symbols, as required by R5RS.

   If the ‘keywords’ read option is set to ‘'postfix’, Guile recognizes
the SRFI-88 read syntax ‘NAME:’ (*note* SRFI-88::).  Otherwise, tokens of
this form are read as symbols.

   To enable and disable the alternative non-R5RS keyword syntax, you
use the ‘read-set!’ procedure documented *note* Scheme Read::.  Note that
the ‘prefix’ and ‘postfix’ syntax are mutually exclusive.

     (read-set! keywords 'prefix)

     #:type
     ⇒
     #:type

     :type
     ⇒
     #:type

     (read-set! keywords 'postfix)

File: guile.info,  Node: Keyword Procedures,  Prev: Keyword Read Syntax,  Up: Keywords

### 6.6.7.4 Keyword Procedures
..........................

 -- Scheme Procedure: keyword? obj
 -- C Function: scm_keyword_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if the argument OBJ is a keyword, else ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: keyword->symbol keyword
 -- C Function: scm_keyword_to_symbol (keyword)
     Return the symbol with the same name as KEYWORD.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol->keyword symbol
 -- C Function: scm_symbol_to_keyword (symbol)
     Return the keyword with the same name as SYMBOL.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_keyword (SCM obj)
     Equivalent to ‘scm_is_true (scm_keyword_p (OBJ))’.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_locale_keyword (const char *name)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_locale_keywordn (const char *name, size_t
          len)
     Equivalent to ‘scm_symbol_to_keyword (scm_from_locale_symbol
     (NAME))’ and ‘scm_symbol_to_keyword (scm_from_locale_symboln (NAME,
     LEN))’, respectively.

     Note that these functions should _not_ be used when NAME is a C
     string constant, because there is no guarantee that the current
     locale will match that of the execution character set, used for
     string and character constants.  Most modern C compilers use UTF-8
     by default, so in such cases we recommend ‘scm_from_utf8_keyword’.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_latin1_keyword (const char *name)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_utf8_keyword (const char *name)
     Equivalent to ‘scm_symbol_to_keyword (scm_from_latin1_symbol
     (NAME))’ and ‘scm_symbol_to_keyword (scm_from_utf8_symbol (NAME))’,
     respectively.

 -- C Function: void scm_c_bind_keyword_arguments (const char *subr, SCM
          rest, scm_t_keyword_arguments_flags flags, SCM keyword1, SCM
          *argp1, ..., SCM keywordN, SCM *argpN, SCM_UNDEFINED)

     Extract the specified keyword arguments from REST, which is not
     modified.  If the keyword argument KEYWORD1 is present in REST with
     an associated value, that value is stored in the variable pointed
     to by ARGP1, otherwise the variable is left unchanged.  Similarly
     for the other keywords and argument pointers up to KEYWORDN and
     ARGPN.  The argument list to ‘scm_c_bind_keyword_arguments’ must be
     terminated by ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’.

     Note that since the variables pointed to by ARGP1 through ARGPN are
     left unchanged if the associated keyword argument is not present,
     they should be initialized to their default values before calling
     ‘scm_c_bind_keyword_arguments’.  Alternatively, you can initialize
     them to ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’ before the call, and then use ‘SCM_UNBNDP’
     after the call to see which ones were provided.

     If an unrecognized keyword argument is present in REST and FLAGS
     does not contain ‘SCM_ALLOW_OTHER_KEYS’, or if non-keyword
     arguments are present and FLAGS does not contain
     ‘SCM_ALLOW_NON_KEYWORD_ARGUMENTS’, an exception is raised.  SUBR
     should be the name of the procedure receiving the keyword
     arguments, for purposes of error reporting.

     For example:

          SCM k_delimiter;
          SCM k_grammar;
          SCM sym_infix;

          SCM my_string_join (SCM strings, SCM rest)
          {
            SCM delimiter = SCM_UNDEFINED;
            SCM grammar   = sym_infix;

            scm_c_bind_keyword_arguments ("my-string-join", rest, 0,
                                          k_delimiter, &delimiter,
                                          k_grammar, &grammar,
                                          SCM_UNDEFINED);

            if (SCM_UNBNDP (delimiter))
              delimiter = scm_from_utf8_string (" ");

            return scm_string_join (strings, delimiter, grammar);
          }

          void my_init ()

6.6.8 Pairs
-----------

Pairs are used to combine two Scheme objects into one compound object.
Hence the name: A pair stores a pair of objects.

   The data type “pair” is extremely important in Scheme, just like in
any other Lisp dialect.  The reason is that pairs are not only used to
make two values available as one object, but that pairs are used for
constructing lists of values.  Because lists are so important in Scheme,
they are described in a section of their own (*note* Lists::).

   Pairs can literally get entered in source code or at the REPL, in the
so-called “dotted list” syntax.  This syntax consists of an opening
parentheses, the first element of the pair, a dot, the second element
and a closing parentheses.  The following example shows how a pair
consisting of the two numbers 1 and 2, and a pair containing the symbols
‘foo’ and ‘bar’ can be entered.  It is very important to write the
whitespace before and after the dot, because otherwise the Scheme parser
would not be able to figure out where to split the tokens.

     (1 . 2)
     (foo . bar)

   But beware, if you want to try out these examples, you have to
“quote” the expressions.  More information about quotation is available
in the section *note* Expression Syntax::.  The correct way to try these
examples is as follows.

     '(1 . 2)
     ⇒
     (1 . 2)
     '(foo . bar)
     ⇒
     (foo . bar)

   A new pair is made by calling the procedure ‘cons’ with two
arguments.  Then the argument values are stored into a newly allocated
pair, and the pair is returned.  The name ‘cons’ stands for "construct".
Use the procedure ‘pair?’ to test whether a given Scheme object is a
pair or not.

 -- Scheme Procedure: cons x y
 -- C Function: scm_cons (x, y)
     Return a newly allocated pair whose car is X and whose cdr is Y.
     The pair is guaranteed to be different (in the sense of ‘eq?’) from
     every previously existing object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pair? x
 -- C Function: scm_pair_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if X is a pair; otherwise return ‘#f’.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_pair (SCM x)
     Return 1 when X is a pair; otherwise return 0.

   The two parts of a pair are traditionally called “car” and “cdr”.
They can be retrieved with procedures of the same name (‘car’ and
‘cdr’), and can be modified with the procedures ‘set-car!’ and
‘set-cdr!’.

   Since a very common operation in Scheme programs is to access the car
of a car of a pair, or the car of the cdr of a pair, etc., the
procedures called ‘caar’, ‘cadr’ and so on are also predefined.
However, using these procedures is often detrimental to readability, and
error-prone.  Thus, accessing the contents of a list is usually better
achieved using pattern matching techniques (*note* Pattern Matching::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: car pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cdr pair
 -- C Function: scm_car (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cdr (pair)
     Return the car or the cdr of PAIR, respectively.

 -- C Macro: SCM SCM_CAR (SCM pair)
 -- C Macro: SCM SCM_CDR (SCM pair)
     These two macros are the fastest way to access the car or cdr of a
     pair; they can be thought of as compiling into a single memory
     reference.

     These macros do no checking at all.  The argument PAIR must be a
     valid pair.

 -- Scheme Procedure: cddr pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cdar pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cadr pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: caar pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cdddr pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cddar pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cdadr pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cdaar pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: caddr pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cadar pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: caadr pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: caaar pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cddddr pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cdddar pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cddadr pair

 -- Scheme Procedure: caddar pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cadadr pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: cadaar pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: caaddr pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: caadar pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: caaadr pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: caaaar pair
 -- C Function: scm_cddr (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cdar (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cadr (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_caar (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cdddr (pair)

 -- C Function: scm_cadar (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_caadr (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_caaar (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cddddr (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cdddar (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cddadr (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cddaar (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cdaddr (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cdadar (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cdaadr (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cdaaar (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cadddr (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_caddar (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cadadr (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_cadaar (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_caaddr (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_caadar (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_caaadr (pair)
 -- C Function: scm_caaaar (pair)
     These procedures are compositions of ‘car’ and ‘cdr’, where for
     example ‘caddr’ could be defined by

          (define caddr (lambda (x) (car (cdr (cdr x)))))

     ‘cadr’, ‘caddr’ and ‘cadddr’ pick out the second, third or fourth
     elements of a list, respectively.  SRFI-1 provides the same under
     the names ‘second’, ‘third’ and ‘fourth’ (*note* SRFI-1
     Selectors::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-car! pair value
 -- C Function: scm_set_car_x (pair, value)
     Stores VALUE in the car field of PAIR.  The value returned by
     ‘set-car!’ is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-cdr! pair value
 -- C Function: scm_set_cdr_x (pair, value)
     Stores VALUE in the cdr field of PAIR.  The value returned by
     ‘set-cdr!’ is unspecified.

6.6.9 Lists
-----------

A very important data type in Scheme—as well as in all other Lisp
dialects—is the data type “list”.(1)

   This is the short definition of what a list is:

   • Either the empty list ‘()’,

   • or a pair which has a list in its cdr.

* Menu:

* List Syntax::                 Writing literal lists.
* List Predicates::             Testing lists.
* List Constructors::           Creating new lists.
* List Selection::              Selecting from lists, getting their length.
* Append/Reverse::              Appending and reversing lists.
* List Modification::           Modifying existing lists.
* List Searching::              Searching for list elements
* List Mapping::                Applying procedures to lists.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Strictly speaking, Scheme does not have a real datatype “list”.
Lists are made up of “chained pairs”, and only exist by definition—a
list is a chain of pairs which looks like a list.


File: guile.info,  Node: List Syntax,  Next: List Predicates,  Up: Lists

### 6.6.9.1 List Read Syntax
........................

The syntax for lists is an opening parentheses, then all the elements of
the list (separated by whitespace) and finally a closing
parentheses.(1).

     (1 2 3)            ; a list of the numbers 1, 2 and 3
     ("foo" bar 3.1415) ; a string, a symbol and a real number
     ()                 ; the empty list

   The last example needs a bit more explanation.  A list with no
elements, called the “empty list”, is special in some ways.  It is used
for terminating lists by storing it into the cdr of the last pair that
makes up a list.  An example will clear that up:

     (car '(1))
     ⇒
     1
     (cdr '(1))
     ⇒
     ()

   This example also shows that lists have to be quoted when written
(*note* Expression Syntax::), because they would otherwise be mistakingly
taken as procedure applications (*note* Simple Invocation::).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that there is no separation character between the list
elements, like a comma or a semicolon.

### 6.6.9.2 List Predicates
.......................

Often it is useful to test whether a given Scheme object is a list or
not.  List-processing procedures could use this information to test
whether their input is valid, or they could do different things
depending on the datatype of their arguments.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list? x
 -- C Function: scm_list_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if X is a proper list, else ‘#f’.

   The predicate ‘null?’ is often used in list-processing code to tell
whether a given list has run out of elements.  That is, a loop somehow
deals with the elements of a list until the list satisfies ‘null?’.
Then, the algorithm terminates.

 -- Scheme Procedure: null? x
 -- C Function: scm_null_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if X is the empty list, else ‘#f’.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_null (SCM x)
     Return 1 when X is the empty list; otherwise return 0.


File: guile.info,  Node: List Constructors,  Next: List Selection,  Prev: List Predicates,  Up: Lists

### 6.6.9.3 List Constructors
.........................

This section describes the procedures for constructing new lists.
‘list’ simply returns a list where the elements are the arguments,
‘cons*’ is similar, but the last argument is stored in the cdr of the
last pair of the list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list elem ...
 -- C Function: scm_list_1 (elem1)
 -- C Function: scm_list_2 (elem1, elem2)
 -- C Function: scm_list_3 (elem1, elem2, elem3)
 -- C Function: scm_list_4 (elem1, elem2, elem3, elem4)
 -- C Function: scm_list_5 (elem1, elem2, elem3, elem4, elem5)
 -- C Function: scm_list_n (elem1, ..., elemN, SCM_UNDEFINED)
     Return a new list containing elements ELEM ....

     ‘scm_list_n’ takes a variable number of arguments, terminated by
     the special ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’.  That final ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’ is not
     included in the list.  None of ELEM ... can themselves be
     ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’, or ‘scm_list_n’ will terminate at that point.

 -- Scheme Procedure: cons* arg1 arg2 ...
     Like ‘list’, but the last arg provides the tail of the constructed
     list, returning ‘(cons ARG1 (cons ARG2 (cons ... ARGN)))’.
     Requires at least one argument.  If given one argument, that
     argument is returned as result.  This function is called ‘list*’ in
     some other Schemes and in Common LISP.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-copy lst
 -- C Function: scm_list_copy (lst)
     Return a (newly-created) copy of LST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-list n [init]
     Create a list containing of N elements, where each element is
     initialized to INIT.  INIT defaults to the empty list ‘()’ if not
     given.

   Note that ‘list-copy’ only makes a copy of the pairs which make up
the spine of the lists.  The list elements are not copied, which means
that modifying the elements of the new list also modifies the elements
of the old list.  On the other hand, applying procedures like ‘set-cdr!’
or ‘delv!’ to the new list will not alter the old list.  If you also
need to copy the list elements (making a deep copy), use the procedure
‘copy-tree’ from ‘(ice-9 copy-tree)’ (*note* Copying::).


File: guile.info,  Node: List Selection,  Next: Append/Reverse,  Prev: List Constructors,  Up: Lists

### 6.6.9.4 List Selection
......................

These procedures are used to get some information about a list, or to
retrieve one or more elements of a list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: length lst
 -- C Function: scm_length (lst)
     Return the number of elements in list LST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: last-pair lst
 -- C Function: scm_last_pair (lst)
     Return the last pair in LST, signalling an error if LST is
     circular.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-ref list k
 -- C Function: scm_list_ref (list, k)
     Return the Kth element from LIST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-tail lst k
 -- Scheme Procedure: list-cdr-ref lst k
 -- C Function: scm_list_tail (lst, k)
     Return the "tail" of LST beginning with its Kth element.  The first
     element of the list is considered to be element 0.

     ‘list-tail’ and ‘list-cdr-ref’ are identical.  It may help to think
     of ‘list-cdr-ref’ as accessing the Kth cdr of the list, or
     returning the results of cdring K times down LST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-head lst k
 -- C Function: scm_list_head (lst, k)
     Copy the first K elements from LST into a new list, and return it.


File: guile.info,  Node: Append/Reverse,  Next: List Modification,  Prev: List Selection,  Up: Lists

### 6.6.9.5 Append and Reverse
..........................

‘append’ and ‘append!’ are used to concatenate two or more lists in
order to form a new list.  ‘reverse’ and ‘reverse!’ return lists with
the same elements as their arguments, but in reverse order.  The
procedure variants with an ‘!’ directly modify the pairs which form the
list, whereas the other procedures create new pairs.  This is why you
should be careful when using the side-effecting variants.

 -- Scheme Procedure: append lst ... obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: append
 -- Scheme Procedure: append! lst ... obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: append!
 -- C Function: scm_append (lstlst)
 -- C Function: scm_append_x (lstlst)
     Return a list comprising all the elements of lists LST ... OBJ.  If
     called with no arguments, return the empty list.

          (append '(x) '(y))          ⇒  (x y)
          (append '(a) '(b c d))      ⇒  (a b c d)
          (append '(a (b)) '((c)))    ⇒  (a (b) (c))

     The last argument OBJ may actually be any object; an improper list
     results if the last argument is not a proper list.

          (append '(a b) '(c . d))    ⇒  (a b c . d)
          (append '() 'a)             ⇒  a

     ‘append’ doesn’t modify the given lists, but the return may share
     structure with the final OBJ.  ‘append!’ is permitted, but not
     required, to modify the given lists to form its return.

     For ‘scm_append’ and ‘scm_append_x’, LSTLST is a list of the list
     operands LST ... OBJ.  That LSTLST itself is not modified or used
     in the return.

 -- Scheme Procedure: reverse lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: reverse! lst [newtail]
 -- C Function: scm_reverse (lst)
 -- C Function: scm_reverse_x (lst, newtail)
     Return a list comprising the elements of LST, in reverse order.

     ‘reverse’ constructs a new list.  ‘reverse!’ is permitted, but not
     required, to modify LST in constructing its return.

     For ‘reverse!’, the optional NEWTAIL is appended to the result.
     NEWTAIL isn’t reversed, it simply becomes the list tail.  For
     ‘scm_reverse_x’, the NEWTAIL parameter is mandatory, but can be
     ‘SCM_EOL’ if no further tail is required.


File: guile.info,  Node: List Modification,  Next: List Searching,  Prev: Append/Reverse,  Up: Lists

### 6.6.9.6 List Modification
.........................

The following procedures modify an existing list, either by changing
elements of the list, or by changing the list structure itself.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-set! list k val
 -- C Function: scm_list_set_x (list, k, val)
     Set the Kth element of LIST to VAL.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-cdr-set! list k val
 -- C Function: scm_list_cdr_set_x (list, k, val)
     Set the Kth cdr of LIST to VAL.

 -- Scheme Procedure: delq item lst
 -- C Function: scm_delq (item, lst)
     Return a newly-created copy of LST with elements ‘eq?’ to ITEM
     removed.  This procedure mirrors ‘memq’: ‘delq’ compares elements
     of LST against ITEM with ‘eq?’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: delv item lst
 -- C Function: scm_delv (item, lst)
     Return a newly-created copy of LST with elements ‘eqv?’ to ITEM
     removed.  This procedure mirrors ‘memv’: ‘delv’ compares elements
     of LST against ITEM with ‘eqv?’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: delete item lst
 -- C Function: scm_delete (item, lst)
     Return a newly-created copy of LST with elements ‘equal?’ to ITEM
     removed.  This procedure mirrors ‘member’: ‘delete’ compares
     elements of LST against ITEM with ‘equal?’.

     See also SRFI-1 which has an extended ‘delete’ (*note* SRFI-1
     Deleting::), and also an ‘lset-difference’ which can delete
     multiple ITEMs in one call (*note* SRFI-1 Set Operations::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: delq! item lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: delv! item lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: delete! item lst
 -- C Function: scm_delq_x (item, lst)
 -- C Function: scm_delv_x (item, lst)
 -- C Function: scm_delete_x (item, lst)
     These procedures are destructive versions of ‘delq’, ‘delv’ and
     ‘delete’: they modify the pointers in the existing LST rather than
     creating a new list.  Caveat evaluator: Like other destructive list
     functions, these functions cannot modify the binding of LST, and so
     cannot be used to delete the first element of LST destructively.

 -- Scheme Procedure: delq1! item lst
 -- C Function: scm_delq1_x (item, lst)
     Like ‘delq!’, but only deletes the first occurrence of ITEM from
     LST.  Tests for equality using ‘eq?’.  See also ‘delv1!’ and
     ‘delete1!’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: delv1! item lst
 -- C Function: scm_delv1_x (item, lst)
     Like ‘delv!’, but only deletes the first occurrence of ITEM from
     LST.  Tests for equality using ‘eqv?’.  See also ‘delq1!’ and
     ‘delete1!’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: delete1! item lst
 -- C Function: scm_delete1_x (item, lst)
     Like ‘delete!’, but only deletes the first occurrence of ITEM from
     LST.  Tests for equality using ‘equal?’.  See also ‘delq1!’ and
     ‘delv1!’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: filter pred lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: filter! pred lst
     Return a list containing all elements from LST which satisfy the
     predicate PRED.  The elements in the result list have the same
     order as in LST.  The order in which PRED is applied to the list
     elements is not specified.

     ‘filter’ does not change LST, but the result may share a tail with
     it.  ‘filter!’ may modify LST to construct its return.

### 6.6.9.7 List Searching
......................

The following procedures search lists for particular elements.  They use
different comparison predicates for comparing list elements with the
object to be searched.  When they fail, they return ‘#f’, otherwise they
return the sublist whose car is equal to the search object, where
equality depends on the equality predicate used.

 -- Scheme Procedure: memq x lst
 -- C Function: scm_memq (x, lst)
     Return the first sublist of LST whose car is ‘eq?’ to X where the
     sublists of LST are the non-empty lists returned by ‘(list-tail LST
     K)’ for K less than the length of LST.  If X does not occur in LST,
     then ‘#f’ (not the empty list) is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: memv x lst
 -- C Function: scm_memv (x, lst)
     Return the first sublist of LST whose car is ‘eqv?’ to X where the
     sublists of LST are the non-empty lists returned by ‘(list-tail LST
     K)’ for K less than the length of LST.  If X does not occur in LST,
     then ‘#f’ (not the empty list) is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: member x lst
 -- C Function: scm_member (x, lst)
     Return the first sublist of LST whose car is ‘equal?’ to X where
     the sublists of LST are the non-empty lists returned by ‘(list-tail
     LST K)’ for K less than the length of LST.  If X does not occur in
     LST, then ‘#f’ (not the empty list) is returned.

     See also SRFI-1 which has an extended ‘member’ function (*note*
     SRFI-1 Searching::).

### 6.6.9.8 List Mapping
....................

List processing is very convenient in Scheme because the process of
iterating over the elements of a list can be highly abstracted.  The
procedures in this section are the most basic iterating procedures for
lists.  They take a procedure and one or more lists as arguments, and
apply the procedure to each element of the list.  They differ in their
return value.

 -- Scheme Procedure: map proc arg1 arg2 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: map-in-order proc arg1 arg2 ...
 -- C Function: scm_map (proc, arg1, args)
     Apply PROC to each element of the list ARG1 (if only two arguments
     are given), or to the corresponding elements of the argument lists
     (if more than two arguments are given).  The result(s) of the
     procedure applications are saved and returned in a list.  For
     ‘map’, the order of procedure applications is not specified,
     ‘map-in-order’ applies the procedure from left to right to the list
     elements.

 -- Scheme Procedure: for-each proc arg1 arg2 ...
     Like ‘map’, but the procedure is always applied from left to right,
     and the result(s) of the procedure applications are thrown away.
     The return value is not specified.

   See also SRFI-1 which extends these functions to take lists of
unequal lengths (*note* SRFI-1 Fold and Map::).

6.6.10 Vectors
--------------

Vectors are sequences of Scheme objects.  Unlike lists, the length of a
vector, once the vector is created, cannot be changed.  The advantage of
vectors over lists is that the time required to access one element of a
vector given its “position” (synonymous with “index”), a zero-origin
number, is constant, whereas lists have an access time linear to the
position of the accessed element in the list.

   Vectors can contain any kind of Scheme object; it is even possible to
have different types of objects in the same vector.  For vectors
containing vectors, you may wish to use *note* Arrays:: instead.  Note,
too, that vectors are a special case of one dimensional non-uniform
arrays and that array procedures operate happily on vectors.

   Also see *note* SRFI-43::, *note* R6RS Support::, or *note* R7RS
Support::, for more comprehensive vector libraries.

### 6.6.10.1 Read Syntax for Vectors
................................

Vectors can literally be entered in source code, just like strings,
characters or some of the other data types.  The read syntax for vectors
is as follows: A sharp sign (‘#’), followed by an opening parentheses,
all elements of the vector in their respective read syntax, and finally
a closing parentheses.  Like strings, vectors do not have to be quoted.

   The following are examples of the read syntax for vectors; where the
first vector only contains numbers and the second three different object
types: a string, a symbol and a number in hexadecimal notation.

     #(1 2 3)
     #("Hello" foo #xdeadbeef)


File: guile.info,  Node: Vector Creation,  Next: Vector Accessors,  Prev: Vector Syntax,  Up: Vectors

### 6.6.10.2 Dynamic Vector Creation and Validation
...............................................

Instead of creating a vector implicitly by using the read syntax just
described, you can create a vector dynamically by calling one of the
‘vector’ and ‘list->vector’ primitives with the list of Scheme values
that you want to place into a vector.  The size of the vector thus
created is determined implicitly by the number of arguments given.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector arg ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: list->vector l
 -- C Function: scm_vector (l)
     Return a newly allocated vector composed of the given arguments.
     Analogous to ‘list’.

          (vector 'a 'b 'c) ⇒ #(a b c)

   The inverse operation is ‘vector->list’:

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector->list v
 -- C Function: scm_vector_to_list (v)
     Return a newly allocated list composed of the elements of V.

          (vector->list #(dah dah didah)) ⇒  (dah dah didah)
          (list->vector '(dididit dah)) ⇒  #(dididit dah)

   To allocate a vector with an explicitly specified size, use
‘make-vector’.  With this primitive you can also specify an initial
value for the vector elements (the same value for all elements, that
is):

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-vector len [fill]
 -- C Function: scm_make_vector (len, fill)
     Return a newly allocated vector of LEN elements.  If a second
     argument is given, then each position is initialized to FILL.
     Otherwise the initial contents of each position is unspecified.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_make_vector (size_t k, SCM fill)
     Like ‘scm_make_vector’, but the length is given as a ‘size_t’.

   To check whether an arbitrary Scheme value _is_ a vector, use the
‘vector?’ primitive:

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector? obj
 -- C Function: scm_vector_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a vector, otherwise return ‘#f’.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_vector (SCM obj)

### 6.6.10.3 Accessing and Modifying Vector Contents
................................................

‘vector-length’ and ‘vector-ref’ return information about a given
vector, respectively its size and the elements that are contained in the
vector.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-length vector
 -- C Function: scm_vector_length (vector)
     Return the number of elements in VECTOR as an exact integer.

 -- C Function: size_t scm_c_vector_length (SCM vec)
     Return the number of elements in VEC as a ‘size_t’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-ref vec k
 -- C Function: scm_vector_ref (vec, k)
     Return the contents of position K of VEC.  K must be a valid index
     of VEC.
          (vector-ref #(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21) 5) ⇒ 8
          (vector-ref #(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21)
              (let ((i (round (* 2 (acos -1)))))
                (if (inexact? i)
                  (inexact->exact i)
                     i))) ⇒ 13

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_vector_ref (SCM vec, size_t k)
     Return the contents of position K (a ‘size_t’) of VEC.

   A vector created by one of the dynamic vector constructor procedures
(*note* Vector Creation::) can be modified using the following
procedures.

   _NOTE:_ According to R5RS, it is an error to use any of these
procedures on a literally read vector, because such vectors should be
considered as constants.  Currently, however, Guile does not detect this
error.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-set! vec k obj
 -- C Function: scm_vector_set_x (vec, k, obj)
     Store OBJ in position K of VEC.  K must be a valid index of VEC.
     The value returned by ‘vector-set!’ is unspecified.
          (let ((vec (vector 0 '(2 2 2 2) "Anna")))
            (vector-set! vec 1 '("Sue" "Sue"))
            vec) ⇒  #(0 ("Sue" "Sue") "Anna")

 -- C Function: void scm_c_vector_set_x (SCM vec, size_t k, SCM obj)
     Store OBJ in position K (a ‘size_t’) of VEC.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-fill! vec fill [start [end]]
 -- C Function: scm_vector_fill_x (vec, fill)
     Store FILL in every position of VEC in the range [START ...  END).
     START defaults to 0 and END defaults to the length of VEC.

     The value returned by ‘vector-fill!’ is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-copy vec [start [end]]
 -- C Function: scm_vector_copy (vec)
     Returns a freshly allocated vector containing the elements of VEC
     in the range [START ...  END).  START defaults to 0 and END
     defaults to the length of VEC.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-copy! dst at src [start [end]]
     Copy the block of elements from vector SRC in the range [START ...
     END) into vector DST, starting at position AT.  AT and START
     default to 0 and END defaults to the length of SRC.

     It is an error for DST to have a length less than AT + (END -
     START).

     The order in which elements are copied is unspecified, except that
     if the source and destination overlap, copying takes place as if
     the source is first copied into a temporary vector and then into
     the destination.

     The value returned by ‘vector-copy!’ is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-move-left! vec1 start1 end1 vec2 start2
 -- C Function: scm_vector_move_left_x (vec1, start1, end1, vec2,
          start2)
     Copy elements from VEC1, positions START1 to END1, to VEC2 starting
     at position START2.  START1 and START2 are inclusive indices; END1
     is exclusive.

     ‘vector-move-left!’ copies elements in leftmost order.  Therefore,
     in the case where VEC1 and VEC2 refer to the same vector,
     ‘vector-move-left!’ is usually appropriate when START1 is greater
     than START2.

     The value returned by ‘vector-move-left!’ is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-move-right! vec1 start1 end1 vec2 start2
 -- C Function: scm_vector_move_right_x (vec1, start1, end1, vec2,
          start2)
     Copy elements from VEC1, positions START1 to END1, to VEC2 starting
     at position START2.  START1 and START2 are inclusive indices; END1
     is exclusive.

     ‘vector-move-right!’ copies elements in rightmost order.
     Therefore, in the case where VEC1 and VEC2 refer to the same
     vector, ‘vector-move-right!’ is usually appropriate when START1 is
     less than START2.

     The value returned by ‘vector-move-right!’ is unspecified.

### 6.6.10.4 Vector Accessing from C
................................

A vector can be read and modified from C with the functions *note*
‘scm_c_vector_ref’: x-scm_c_vector_ref. and *note* ‘scm_c_vector_set_x’:
x-scm_c_vector_set_x.  In addition to these functions, there are two
other ways to access vectors from C that might be more efficient in
certain situations: you can use the unsafe _vector macros_; or you can
use the general framework for accessing all kinds of arrays (*note*
Accessing Arrays from C::), which is more verbose, but can deal
efficiently with all kinds of vectors (and arrays).  For arrays of rank
1 whose backing store is a vector, you can use the ‘scm_vector_elements’
and ‘scm_vector_writable_elements’ functions as shortcuts.

 -- C Macro: size_t SCM_SIMPLE_VECTOR_LENGTH (SCM vec)
     Evaluates to the length of the vector VEC.  No type checking is
     done.

 -- C Macro: SCM SCM_SIMPLE_VECTOR_REF (SCM vec, size_t idx)
     Evaluates to the element at position IDX in the vector VEC.  No
     type or range checking is done.

 -- C Macro: void SCM_SIMPLE_VECTOR_SET (SCM vec, size_t idx, SCM val)
     Sets the element at position IDX in the vector VEC to VAL.  No type
     or range checking is done.

 -- C Function: const SCM * scm_vector_elements (SCM array,
          scm_t_array_handle *handle, size_t *lenp, ssize_t *incp)
     Acquire a *note* handle: Accessing Arrays from C. for ARRAY and
     return a read-only pointer to its elements.  ARRAY must be either a
     vector, or an array of rank 1 whose backing store is a vector;
     otherwise an error is signaled.  The handle must eventually be
     released with *note* ‘scm_array_handle_release’:
     x-scm_array_handle_release.

     The variables pointed to by LENP and INCP are filled with the
     number of elements of the array and the increment (number of
     elements) between successive elements, respectively.  Successive
     elements of ARRAY need not be contiguous in their underlying “root
     vector” returned here; hence the increment is not necessarily equal
     to 1 and may well be negative too (*note* Shared Arrays::).

     The following example shows the typical way to use this function.
     It creates a list of all elements of ARRAY (in reverse order).

          scm_t_array_handle handle;
          size_t i, len;
          ssize_t inc;
          const SCM *elt;
          SCM list;

          elt = scm_vector_elements (array, &handle, &len, &inc);
          list = SCM_EOL;
          for (i = 0; i < len; i++, elt += inc)
            list = scm_cons (*elt, list);
          scm_array_handle_release (&handle);

 -- C Function: SCM * scm_vector_writable_elements (SCM array,
          scm_t_array_handle *handle, size_t *lenp, ssize_t *incp)
     Like ‘scm_vector_elements’ but the pointer can be used to modify
     the array.

     The following example shows the typical way to use this function.
     It fills an array with ‘#t’.

          scm_t_array_handle handle;
          size_t i, len;
          ssize_t inc;
          SCM *elt;

          elt = scm_vector_writable_elements (array, &handle, &len, &inc);
          for (i = 0; i < len; i++, elt += inc)
            *elt = SCM_BOOL_T;
          scm_array_handle_release (&handle);

### 6.6.10.5 Uniform Numeric Vectors
................................

A uniform numeric vector is a vector whose elements are all of a single
numeric type.  Guile offers uniform numeric vectors for signed and
unsigned 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit integers, two sizes of
floating point values, and complex floating-point numbers of these two
sizes.  *Note* SRFI-4::, for more information.

   For many purposes, bytevectors work just as well as uniform vectors,
and have the advantage that they integrate well with binary input and
output.  *Note* Bytevectors::, for more information on bytevectors.

6.6.11 Bit Vectors
------------------

Bit vectors are zero-origin, one-dimensional arrays of booleans.  They
are displayed as a sequence of ‘0’s and ‘1’s prefixed by ‘#*’, e.g.,

     (make-bitvector 8 #f) ⇒
     #*00000000

   Bit vectors are the special case of one dimensional bit arrays, and
can thus be used with the array procedures, *Note* Arrays::.

 -- C Function: scm_bitvector_copy (bitvector, start, end)
     Returns a freshly allocated bitvector containing the elements of
     BITVECTOR in the range [START ...  END).  START defaults to 0 and
     END defaults to the length of BITVECTOR.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bitvector-count bitvector
     Return a count of how many entries in BITVECTOR are set.

          (bitvector-count #*000111000)  ⇒ 3

 -- Scheme Procedure: bitvector-count-bits bitvector bits
     Return a count of how many entries in BITVECTOR are set, with the
     bitvector BITS selecting the entries to consider.  BITVECTOR must
     be at least as long as BITS.

     For example,

          (bitvector-count-bits #*01110111 #*11001101) ⇒ 3

 -- Scheme Procedure: bitvector-position bitvector bool start
 -- C Function: scm_bitvector_position (bitvector, bool, start)
     Return the index of the first occurrence of BOOL in BITVECTOR,
     starting from START.  If there is no BOOL entry between START and
     the end of BITVECTOR, then return ‘#f’.  For example,

          (bitvector-position #*000101 #t 0)  ⇒ 3
          (bitvector-position #*0001111 #f 3) ⇒ #f

 -- Scheme Procedure: bitvector-set-bits! bitvector bits
     Set entries of BITVECTOR to ‘#t’, with BITS selecting the bits to
     set.  The return value is unspecified.  BITVECTOR must be at least
     as long as BITS.

          (define bv (bitvector-copy #*11000010))
          (bitvector-set-bits! bv #*10010001)
          bv
          ⇒ #*11010011

 -- Scheme Procedure: bitvector-clear-bits! bitvector bits
     Set entries of BITVECTOR to ‘#f’, with BITS selecting the bits to
     clear.  The return value is unspecified.  BITVECTOR must be at
     least as long as BITS.

          (define bv (bitvector-copy #*11000010))
          (bitvector-clear-bits! bv #*10010001)
          bv
          ⇒ #*01000010

          scm_t_array_handle *handle, size_t *offp, size_t *lenp,
          ssize_t *incp)
     Like ‘scm_vector_elements’ (*note* Vector Accessing from C::), but
     for bitvectors.  The variable pointed to by OFFP is set to the
     value returned by ‘scm_array_handle_bit_elements_offset’.  See
     ‘scm_array_handle_bit_elements’ for how to use the returned pointer
     and the offset.

6.6.12 Bytevectors
------------------

A “bytevector” is a raw byte string.  The ‘(rnrs bytevectors)’ module
provides the programming interface specified by the Revised^6 Report on
the Algorithmic Language Scheme (R6RS) (http://www.r6rs.org/).  It
contains procedures to manipulate bytevectors and interpret their
contents in a number of ways: as signed or unsigned integer of various
sizes and endianness, as IEEE-754 floating point numbers, or as strings.
It is a useful tool to encode and decode binary data.  The *note* R7RS:
R7RS Support. offers its own set of bytevector procedures (*note*
Bytevector Procedures in R7RS::).

   The R6RS (Section 4.3.4) specifies an external representation for
bytevectors, whereby the octets (integers in the range 0–255) contained
in the bytevector are represented as a list prefixed by ‘#vu8’:

     #vu8(1 53 204)

   denotes a 3-byte bytevector containing the octets 1, 53, and 204.
Like string literals, booleans, etc., bytevectors are “self-quoting”,
i.e., they do not need to be quoted:

     #vu8(1 53 204)
     ⇒ #vu8(1 53 204)

   Bytevectors can be used with the binary input/output primitives
(*note* Binary I/O::).

* Bytevector Manipulation::     Creating, copying, manipulating bytevectors.

File: guile.info,  Node: Bytevector Endianness,  Next: Bytevector Manipulation,  Up: Bytevectors

### 6.6.12.1 Endianness
...................

Some of the following procedures take an ENDIANNESS parameter.  The
“endianness” is defined as the order of bytes in multi-byte numbers:
numbers encoded in “big endian” have their most significant bytes
written first, whereas numbers encoded in “little endian” have their
least significant bytes first(1).

   Little-endian is the native endianness of the IA32 architecture and
its derivatives, while big-endian is native to SPARC and PowerPC, among
others.  The ‘native-endianness’ procedure returns the native endianness
of the machine it runs on.

 -- Scheme Procedure: native-endianness
 -- C Function: scm_native_endianness ()
     Return a value denoting the native endianness of the host machine.

 -- Scheme Macro: endianness symbol
     Return an object denoting the endianness specified by SYMBOL.  If
     SYMBOL is neither ‘big’ nor ‘little’ then an error is raised at
     expand-time.

 -- C Variable: scm_endianness_big
 -- C Variable: scm_endianness_little
     The objects denoting big- and little-endianness, respectively.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Big-endian and little-endian are the most common “endiannesses”,
but others do exist.  For instance, the GNU MP library allows “word
order” to be specified independently of “byte order” (*note* (gmp)Integer
Import and Export::).

### 6.6.12.2 Manipulating Bytevectors
.................................

Bytevectors can be created, copied, and analyzed with the following
procedures and C functions.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-bytevector len [fill]
 -- C Function: scm_make_bytevector (len, fill)
 -- C Function: scm_c_make_bytevector (size_t len)
     Return a new bytevector of LEN bytes.  Optionally, if FILL is
     given, fill it with FILL; FILL must be in the range [-128,255].

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector? obj
 -- C Function: scm_bytevector_p (obj)
     Return true if OBJ is a bytevector.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_bytevector (SCM obj)
     Equivalent to ‘scm_is_true (scm_bytevector_p (obj))’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-length bv
 -- C Function: scm_bytevector_length (bv)
     Return the length in bytes of bytevector BV.

 -- C Function: size_t scm_c_bytevector_length (SCM bv)
     Likewise, return the length in bytes of bytevector BV.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector=? bv1 bv2
 -- C Function: scm_bytevector_eq_p (bv1, bv2)
     Return ‘#t’ if BV1 equals BV2—i.e., if they have the same length
     and contents.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-fill! bv fill [start [end]]
 -- C Function: scm_bytevector_fill_x (bv, fill)
     Fill positions [START ...  END) of bytevector BV with byte FILL.
     START defaults to 0 and END defaults to the length of BV.(1)

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-copy! source source-start target
          target-start len
 -- C Function: scm_bytevector_copy_x (source, source_start, target,
          target_start, len)
     Copy LEN bytes from SOURCE into TARGET, starting reading from
     SOURCE-START (an index index within SOURCE) and writing at
     TARGET-START.

     It is permitted for the SOURCE and TARGET regions to overlap.  In
     that case, copying takes place as if the source is first copied
     into a temporary bytevector and then into the destination.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-copy bv
 -- C Function: scm_bytevector_copy (bv)
     Return a newly allocated copy of BV.

 -- C Function: scm_t_uint8 scm_c_bytevector_ref (SCM bv, size_t index)
     Return the byte at INDEX in bytevector BV.

 -- C Function: void scm_c_bytevector_set_x (SCM bv, size_t index,
          scm_t_uint8 value)
     Set the byte at INDEX in BV to VALUE.

   Low-level C macros are available.  They do not perform any
type-checking; as such they should be used with care.

 -- C Macro: size_t SCM_BYTEVECTOR_LENGTH (bv)
     Return the length in bytes of bytevector BV.

 -- C Macro: signed char * SCM_BYTEVECTOR_CONTENTS (bv)
     Return a pointer to the contents of bytevector BV.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) R6RS only defines ‘(bytevector-fill! bv fill)’.  Arguments START
and END are a Guile extension (cf.  *note* ‘vector-fill!’:
x-vector-fill!, *note* ‘string-fill!’: x-string-fill!.).

### 6.6.12.3 Interpreting Bytevector Contents as Integers
.....................................................

The contents of a bytevector can be interpreted as a sequence of
integers of any given size, sign, and endianness.

     (let ((bv (make-bytevector 4)))
       (bytevector-u8-set! bv 0 #x12)
       (bytevector-u8-set! bv 1 #x34)
       (bytevector-u8-set! bv 2 #x56)
       (bytevector-u8-set! bv 3 #x78)

       (map (lambda (number)
              (number->string number 16))
            (list (bytevector-u8-ref bv 0)
                  (bytevector-u16-ref bv 0 (endianness big))
                  (bytevector-u32-ref bv 0 (endianness little)))))

     ⇒ ("12" "1234" "78563412")

   The most generic procedures to interpret bytevector contents as
integers are described below.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-uint-ref bv index endianness size
 -- C Function: scm_bytevector_uint_ref (bv, index, endianness, size)
     Return the SIZE-byte long unsigned integer at index INDEX in BV,
     decoded according to ENDIANNESS.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-sint-ref bv index endianness size
 -- C Function: scm_bytevector_sint_ref (bv, index, endianness, size)
     Return the SIZE-byte long signed integer at index INDEX in BV,
     decoded according to ENDIANNESS.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-uint-set! bv index value endianness
          size
 -- C Function: scm_bytevector_uint_set_x (bv, index, value, endianness,
          size)
     Set the SIZE-byte long unsigned integer at INDEX to VALUE, encoded
     according to ENDIANNESS.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-sint-set! bv index value endianness
          size
 -- C Function: scm_bytevector_sint_set_x (bv, index, value, endianness,
          size)
     Set the SIZE-byte long signed integer at INDEX to VALUE, encoded
     according to ENDIANNESS.

   The following procedures are similar to the ones above, but
specialized to a given integer size:

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-u8-ref bv index

............................................................

Bytevector contents can also be interpreted as Unicode strings encoded
in one of the most commonly available encoding formats.  *Note*
Representing Strings as Bytes::, for a more generic interface.

     (utf8->string (u8-list->bytevector '(99 97 102 101)))

### 6.6.12.7 Accessing Bytevectors with the Array API
.................................................

As an extension to the R6RS, Guile allows bytevectors to be manipulated
with the “array” procedures (*note* Arrays::).  When using these APIs,
bytes are accessed one at a time as 8-bit unsigned integers:

     (define bv #vu8(0 1 2 3))

     (array? bv)
     ⇒ #t

     (array-rank bv)
     ⇒ 1

     (array-ref bv 2)
     ⇒ 2

     ;; Note the different argument order on array-set!.
     (array-set! bv 77 2)
     (array-ref bv 2)
     ⇒ 77

### 6.6.12.9 Bytevector Procedures in R7RS
......................................

The *note* R7RS: R7RS Support. (Section 6.9) defines a set of bytevector
manipulation procedures, accessible with

     (use-modules (scheme base))

   Of these, *note* ‘make-bytevector’: x-make-bytevector, *note*
‘bytevector?’: x-bytevector?, *note* ‘bytevector-length’:
x-bytevector-length, *note* ‘bytevector-u8-ref’: x-bytevector-u8-ref. and
*note* ‘bytevector-u8-set!’: x-bytevector-u8-set!. have the same
definition as in R6RS. The procedures listed below either have a
different definition in R7RS and R6RS, or are not defined in R6RS.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector arg ...
     Return a newly allocated bytevector composed of the given
     arguments.  Analogous to ‘list’.

          (bytevector 2 3 4) ⇒ #vu8(2 3 4)

     See also *note* ‘u8-list->bytevector’: x-u8-list->bytevector.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-copy bv [start [end]]
     Returns a newly allocated bytevector containing the elements of BV
     in the range [START ...  END).  START defaults to 0 and END
     defaults to the length of BV.

          (define bv #vu8(0 1 2 3 4 5))
          (bytevector-copy bv) ⇒ #vu8(0 1 2 3 4 5)
          (bytevector-copy bv 2) ⇒ #vu8(2 3 4 5)
          (bytevector-copy bv 2 4) ⇒ #vu8(2 3)

     See also *note* the R6RS version: x-r6:bytevector-copy.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-copy! dst at src [start [end]]
     Copy the block of elements from bytevector SRC in the range [START
     ...  END) into bytevector DST, starting at position AT.  START
     defaults to 0 and END defaults to the length of SRC.  It is an
     error for DST to have a length less than AT + (END - START).

     See also *note* the R6RS version: x-r6:bytevector-copy!.  With

          (use-modules ((rnrs bytevectors) #:prefix r6:)
                       ((scheme base) #:prefix r7:))

     the following calls are equivalent:

          (r6:bytevector-copy! source source-start target target-start len)
          (r7:bytevector-copy! target target-start source source-start (+ source-start len))

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-append arg ...
     Return a newly allocated bytevector whose characters form the
     concatenation of the given bytevectors ARG ...

          (bytevector-append #vu8(0 1 2) #vu8(3 4 5))
          ⇒ #vu8(0 1 2 3 4 5)

### 6.6.12.10 Bytevector Slices
...........................

As an extension to the R6RS specification, the ‘(rnrs bytevectors gnu)’
module provides the ‘bytevector-slice’ procedure, which returns a
bytevector aliasing part of an existing bytevector.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-slice BV OFFSET [SIZE]
 -- C Function: scm_bytevector_slice (BV, OFFSET, SIZE)
     Return the slice of BV starting at OFFSET and counting SIZE bytes.
     When SIZE is omitted, the slice covers all of BV starting from
     OFFSET.  The returned slice shares storage with BV: changes to the
     slice are visible in BV and vice-versa.

     When BV is actually a SRFI-4 uniform vector, its element type is
     preserved unless OFFSET and SIZE are not aligned on its element
     type size.

   Here is an example showing how to use it:

     (use-modules (rnrs bytevectors)
                  (rnrs bytevectors gnu))

     (define bv (u8-list->bytevector (iota 10)))
     (define slice (bytevector-slice bv 2 3))

     slice
     ⇒ #vu8(2 3 4)

     (bytevector-u8-set! slice 0 77)
     slice
     ⇒ #vu8(77 3 4)

     bv
     ⇒ #vu8(0 1 77 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)

6.6.13 Arrays
-------------

“Arrays” are a collection of cells organized into an arbitrary number of
dimensions.  Each cell can be accessed in constant time by supplying an
index for each dimension.

   In the current implementation, an array uses a vector of some kind
for the actual storage of its elements.  Any kind of vector will do, so
you can have arrays of uniform numeric values, arrays of characters,
arrays of bits, and of course, arrays of arbitrary Scheme values.  For
example, arrays with an underlying ‘c64vector’ might be nice for digital
signal processing, while arrays made from a ‘u8vector’ might be used to
hold gray-scale images.

   The number of dimensions of an array is called its “rank”.  Thus, a
matrix is an array of rank 2, while a vector has rank 1.  When accessing
an array element, you have to specify one exact integer for each
dimension.  These integers are called the “indices” of the element.  An
array specifies the allowed range of indices for each dimension via an
inclusive lower and upper bound.  These bounds can well be negative, but
the upper bound must be greater than or equal to the lower bound minus
one.  When all lower bounds of an array are zero, it is called a
“zero-origin” array.

   Arrays can be of rank 0, which could be interpreted as a scalar.
Thus, a zero-rank array can store exactly one object and the list of
indices of this element is the empty list.

   Arrays contain zero elements when one of their dimensions has a zero
length.  These empty arrays maintain information about their shape: a
matrix with zero columns and 3 rows is different from a matrix with 3
columns and zero rows, which again is different from a vector of length
zero.

   The array procedures are all polymorphic, treating strings, uniform
numeric vectors, bytevectors, bit vectors and ordinary vectors as one
dimensional arrays.

File: guile.info,  Node: Array Syntax,  Next: Array Procedures,  Up: Arrays

### 6.6.13.1 Array Syntax
.....................

An array is displayed as ‘#’ followed by its rank, followed by a tag
that describes the underlying vector, optionally followed by information
about its shape, and finally followed by the cells, organized into
dimensions using parentheses.

   In more words, the array tag is of the form

       #<rank><vectag><@lower><:len><@lower><:len>...

   where ‘<rank>’ is a positive integer in decimal giving the rank of
the array.  It is omitted when the rank is 1 and the array is non-shared
and has zero-origin (see below).  For shared arrays and for a non-zero
origin, the rank is always printed even when it is 1 to distinguish them
from ordinary vectors.

   The ‘<vectag>’ part is the tag for a uniform numeric vector, like
‘u8’, ‘s16’, etc, ‘b’ for bitvectors, or ‘a’ for strings.  It is empty
for ordinary vectors.

   The ‘<@lower>’ part is a ‘@’ character followed by a signed integer
in decimal giving the lower bound of a dimension.  There is one
‘<@lower>’ for each dimension.  When all lower bounds are zero, all
‘<@lower>’ parts are omitted.

   The ‘<:len>’ part is a ‘:’ character followed by an unsigned integer
in decimal giving the length of a dimension.  Like for the lower bounds,
there is one ‘<:len>’ for each dimension, and the ‘<:len>’ part always
follows the ‘<@lower>’ part for a dimension.  Lengths are only then
printed when they can’t be deduced from the nested lists of elements of
the array literal, which can happen when at least one length is zero.

   As a special case, an array of rank 0 is printed as
‘#0<vectag>(<scalar>)’, where ‘<scalar>’ is the result of printing the
single element of the array.

   Thus,

‘#(1 2 3)’
     is an ordinary array of rank 1 with lower bound 0 in dimension 0.
     (I.e., a regular vector.)

‘#@2(1 2 3)’
     is an ordinary array of rank 1 with lower bound 2 in dimension 0.

‘#2((1 2 3) (4 5 6))’
     is a non-uniform array of rank 2; a 2x3 matrix with index ranges
     0..1 and 0..2.

‘#u8(0 1 2)’
     is a uniform u8 array of rank 1.

‘#2u32@2@3((1 2) (2 3))’
     is a uniform u32 array of rank 2 with index ranges 2..3 and 3..4.

‘#2()’
     is a two-dimensional array with index ranges 0..-1 and 0..-1, i.e.
     both dimensions have length zero.

‘#2:0:2()’
     is a two-dimensional array with index ranges 0..-1 and 0..1, i.e.
     the first dimension has length zero, but the second has length 2.

‘#0(12)’
     is a rank-zero array with contents 12.

   In addition, bytevectors are also arrays, but use a different syntax
(*note* Bytevectors::):

‘#vu8(1 2 3)’
     is a 3-byte long bytevector, with contents 1, 2, 3.

### 6.6.13.2 Array Procedures
.........................

When an array is created, the range of each dimension must be specified,
e.g., to create a 2x3 array with a zero-based index:

     (make-array 'ho 2 3) ⇒ #2((ho ho ho) (ho ho ho))

   The range of each dimension can also be given explicitly, e.g.,
another way to create the same array:

     (make-array 'ho '(0 1) '(0 2)) ⇒ #2((ho ho ho) (ho ho ho))

   The following procedures can be used with arrays (or vectors).  An
argument shown as IDX... means one parameter for each dimension in the
array.  A IDXLIST argument means a list of such values, one for each
dimension.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array? obj
 -- C Function: scm_array_p (obj, unused)
     Return ‘#t’ if the OBJ is an array, and ‘#f’ if not.

     The second argument to scm_array_p is there for historical reasons,
     but it is not used.  You should always pass ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’ as its
     value.

 -- Scheme Procedure: typed-array? obj type
 -- C Function: scm_typed_array_p (obj, type)
     Return ‘#t’ if the OBJ is an array of type TYPE, and ‘#f’ if not.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_array (SCM obj)
     Return ‘1’ if the OBJ is an array and ‘0’ if not.

 -- C Function: int scm_is_typed_array (SCM obj, SCM type)
     Return ‘0’ if the OBJ is an array of type TYPE, and ‘1’ if not.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-array fill bound ...
 -- C Function: scm_make_array (fill, bounds)
     Equivalent to ‘(make-typed-array #t FILL BOUND ...)’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-typed-array type fill bound ...
 -- C Function: scm_make_typed_array (type, fill, bounds)
     Create and return an array that has as many dimensions as there are
     BOUNDs and (maybe) fill it with FILL.

     The underlying storage vector is created according to TYPE, which
     must be a symbol whose name is the ‘vectag’ of the array as
     explained above, or ‘#t’ for ordinary, non-specialized arrays.

     For example, using the symbol ‘f64’ for TYPE will create an array
     that uses a ‘f64vector’ for storing its elements, and ‘a’ will use
     a string.

     When FILL is not the special _unspecified_ value, the new array is
     filled with FILL.  Otherwise, the initial contents of the array is
     unspecified.  The special _unspecified_ value is stored in the
     variable ‘*unspecified*’ so that for example ‘(make-typed-array
     'u32 *unspecified* 4)’ creates a uninitialized ‘u32’ vector of
     length 4.

     Each BOUND may be a positive non-zero integer N, in which case the
     index for that dimension can range from 0 through N-1; or an
     explicit index range specifier in the form ‘(LOWER UPPER)’, where
     both LOWER and UPPER are integers, possibly less than zero, and
     possibly the same number (however, LOWER cannot be greater than
     UPPER).

 -- Scheme Procedure: list->array dimspec list
     Equivalent to ‘(list->typed-array #t DIMSPEC LIST)’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list->typed-array type dimspec list
 -- C Function: scm_list_to_typed_array (type, dimspec, list)
     Return an array of the type indicated by TYPE with elements the
     same as those of LIST.

     The argument DIMSPEC determines the number of dimensions of the
     array and their lower bounds.  When DIMSPEC is an exact integer, it
     gives the number of dimensions directly and all lower bounds are
     zero.  When it is a list of exact integers, then each element is
     the lower index bound of a dimension, and there will be as many
     dimensions as elements in the list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-type array
 -- C Function: scm_array_type (array)
     Return the type of ARRAY.  This is the ‘vectag’ used for printing
     ARRAY (or ‘#t’ for ordinary arrays) and can be used with
     ‘make-typed-array’ to create an array of the same kind as ARRAY.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-ref array idx ...
 -- C Function: scm_array_ref (array, idxlist)
     Return the element at ‘(idx ...)’ in ARRAY.

          (define a (make-array 999 '(1 2) '(3 4)))
          (array-ref a 2 4) ⇒ 999

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-in-bounds? array idx ...
 -- C Function: scm_array_in_bounds_p (array, idxlist)
     Return ‘#t’ if the given indices would be acceptable to
     ‘array-ref’.

          (define a (make-array #f '(1 2) '(3 4)))
          (array-in-bounds? a 2 3) ⇒ #t
          (array-in-bounds? a 0 0) ⇒ #f

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-set! array obj idx ...
 -- C Function: scm_array_set_x (array, obj, idxlist)
     Set the element at ‘(idx ...)’ in ARRAY to OBJ.  The return value
     is unspecified.

          (define a (make-array #f '(0 1) '(0 1)))
          (array-set! a #t 1 1)
          a ⇒ #2((#f #f) (#f #t))

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-shape array
 -- Scheme Procedure: array-dimensions array
 -- C Function: scm_array_dimensions (array)
     Return a list of the bounds for each dimension of ARRAY.

     ‘array-shape’ gives ‘(LOWER UPPER)’ for each dimension.
     ‘array-dimensions’ instead returns just UPPER+1 for dimensions with
     a 0 lower bound.  Both are suitable as input to ‘make-array’.

     For example,

          (define a (make-array 'foo '(-1 3) 5))
          (array-shape a)      ⇒ ((-1 3) (0 4))
          (array-dimensions a) ⇒ ((-1 3) 5)

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-length array
 -- C Function: scm_array_length (array)
 -- C Function: size_t scm_c_array_length (array)
     Return the length of an array: its first dimension.  It is an error
     to ask for the length of an array of rank 0.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-rank array
 -- C Function: scm_array_rank (array)
     Return the rank of ARRAY.

 -- C Function: size_t scm_c_array_rank (SCM array)
     Return the rank of ARRAY as a ‘size_t’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array->list array
 -- C Function: scm_array_to_list (array)
     Return a list consisting of all the elements, in order, of ARRAY.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-copy! src dst
 -- Scheme Procedure: array-copy-in-order! src dst
 -- C Function: scm_array_copy_x (src, dst)
     Copy every element from vector or array SRC to the corresponding
     element of DST.  DST must have the same rank as SRC, and be at
     least as large in each dimension.  The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-fill! array fill
 -- C Function: scm_array_fill_x (array, fill)
     Store FILL in every element of ARRAY.  The value returned is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-equal? array ...
     Return ‘#t’ if all arguments are arrays with the same shape, the
     same type, and have corresponding elements which are either
     ‘equal?’ or ‘array-equal?’.  This function differs from ‘equal?’
     (*note* Equality::) in that all arguments must be arrays.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-map! dst proc src ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: array-map-in-order! dst proc src ...
 -- C Function: scm_array_map_x (dst, proc, srclist)
     Set each element of the DST array to values obtained from calls to
     PROC.  The list of SRC arguments may be empty.  The value returned
     is unspecified.

     Each call is ‘(PROC ELEM ...)’, where each ELEM is from the
     corresponding SRC array, at the DST index.  ‘array-map-in-order!’
     makes the calls in row-major order, ‘array-map!’ makes them in an
     unspecified order.

     The SRC arrays must have the same number of dimensions as DST, and
     must have a range for each dimension which covers the range in DST.
     This ensures all DST indices are valid in each SRC.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-for-each proc src1 src2 ...
 -- C Function: scm_array_for_each (proc, src1, srclist)
     Apply PROC to each tuple of elements of SRC1 SRC2 ..., in row-major
     order.  The value returned is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-index-map! dst proc
 -- C Function: scm_array_index_map_x (dst, proc)
     Set each element of the DST array to values returned by calls to
     PROC.  The value returned is unspecified.

     Each call is ‘(PROC I1 ... IN)’, where I1...IN is the destination
     index, one parameter for each dimension.  The order in which the
     calls are made is unspecified.

     For example, to create a 4x4 matrix representing a cyclic group,

              / 0 1 2 3 \
              | 1 2 3 0 |
              | 2 3 0 1 |
              \ 3 0 1 2 /

          (define a (make-array #f 4 4))
          (array-index-map! a (lambda (i j)
                                (modulo (+ i j) 4)))

   An additional array function is available in the module ‘(ice-9
arrays)’.  It can be used with:

     (use-modules (ice-9 arrays))

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-copy src
     Return a new array with the same elements, type and shape as SRC.
     However, the array increments may not be the same as those of SRC.
     In the current implementation, the returned array will be in
     row-major order, but that might change in the future.  Use
     ‘array-copy!’ on an array of known order if that is a concern.

### 6.6.13.3 Shared Arrays
......................

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-shared-array oldarray mapfunc bound ...
 -- C Function: scm_make_shared_array (oldarray, mapfunc, boundlist)
     Return a new array which shares the storage of OLDARRAY.  Changes
     made through either affect the same underlying storage.  The BOUND
     ... arguments are the shape of the new array, the same as
     ‘make-array’ (*note* Array Procedures::).

     MAPFUNC translates coordinates from the new array to the OLDARRAY.
     It’s called as ‘(MAPFUNC newidx1 ...)’ with one parameter for each
     dimension of the new array, and should return a list of indices for
     OLDARRAY, one for each dimension of OLDARRAY.

     MAPFUNC must be affine linear, meaning that each OLDARRAY index
     must be formed by adding integer multiples (possibly negative) of
     some or all of NEWIDX1 etc, plus a possible integer offset.  The
     multiples and offset must be the same in each call.


     One good use for a shared array is to restrict the range of some
     dimensions, so as to apply say ‘array-for-each’ or ‘array-fill!’ to
     only part of an array.  The plain ‘list’ function can be used for
     MAPFUNC in this case, making no changes to the index values.  For
     example,

          (make-shared-array #2((a b c) (d e f) (g h i)) list 3 2)
          ⇒ #2((a b) (d e) (g h))

     The new array can have fewer dimensions than OLDARRAY, for example
     to take a column from an array.

          (make-shared-array #2((a b c) (d e f) (g h i))
                             (lambda (i) (list i 2))
                             '(0 2))
          ⇒ #1(c f i)

     A diagonal can be taken by using the single new array index for
     both row and column in the old array.  For example,

          (make-shared-array #2((a b c) (d e f) (g h i))
                             (lambda (i) (list i i))
                             '(0 2))
          ⇒ #1(a e i)

     Dimensions can be increased by for instance considering portions of
     a one dimensional array as rows in a two dimensional array.
     (‘array-contents’ below can do the opposite, flattening an array.)

          (make-shared-array #1(a b c d e f g h i j k l)
                             (lambda (i j) (list (+ (* i 3) j)))
                             4 3)
          ⇒ #2((a b c) (d e f) (g h i) (j k l))

     By negating an index the order that elements appear can be
     reversed.  The following just reverses the column order,

          (make-shared-array #2((a b c) (d e f) (g h i))
                             (lambda (i j) (list i (- 2 j)))
                             3 3)
          ⇒ #2((c b a) (f e d) (i h g))

     A fixed offset on indexes allows for instance a change from a 0
     based to a 1 based array,

          (define x #2((a b c) (d e f) (g h i)))
          (define y (make-shared-array x
                                       (lambda (i j) (list (1- i) (1- j)))
                                       '(1 3) '(1 3)))
          (array-ref x 0 0) ⇒ a
          (array-ref y 1 1) ⇒ a

     A multiple on an index allows every Nth element of an array to be
     taken.  The following is every third element,

          (make-shared-array #1(a b c d e f g h i j k l)
                             (lambda (i) (list (* i 3)))
                             4)
          ⇒ #1(a d g j)

     The above examples can be combined to make weird and wonderful
     selections from an array, but it’s important to note that because
     MAPFUNC must be affine linear, arbitrary permutations are not
     possible.

     In the current implementation, MAPFUNC is not called for every
     access to the new array but only on some sample points to establish
     a base and stride for new array indices in OLDARRAY data.  A few
     sample points are enough because MAPFUNC is linear.

 -- Scheme Procedure: shared-array-increments array
 -- C Function: scm_shared_array_increments (array)
     For each dimension, return the distance between elements in the
     root vector.

 -- Scheme Procedure: shared-array-offset array
 -- C Function: scm_shared_array_offset (array)
     Return the root vector index of the first element in the array.

 -- Scheme Procedure: shared-array-root array
 -- C Function: scm_shared_array_root (array)
     Return the root vector of a shared array.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-contents array [strict]
 -- C Function: scm_array_contents (array, strict)
     If ARRAY may be “unrolled” into a one dimensional shared array
     without changing their order (last subscript changing fastest),
     then ‘array-contents’ returns that shared array, otherwise it
     returns ‘#f’.  All arrays made by ‘make-array’ and
     ‘make-typed-array’ may be unrolled, some arrays made by
     ‘make-shared-array’ may not be.

     If the optional argument STRICT is provided, a shared array will be
     returned only if its elements are stored internally contiguous in
     memory.

 -- Scheme Procedure: transpose-array array dim1 dim2 ...
 -- C Function: scm_transpose_array (array, dimlist)
     Return an array sharing contents with ARRAY, but with dimensions
     arranged in a different order.  There must be one DIM argument for
     each dimension of ARRAY.  DIM1, DIM2, ... should be integers
     between 0 and the rank of the array to be returned.  Each integer
     in that range must appear at least once in the argument list.

     The values of DIM1, DIM2, ... correspond to dimensions in the array
     to be returned, and their positions in the argument list to
     dimensions of ARRAY.  Several DIMs may have the same value, in
     which case the returned array will have smaller rank than ARRAY.

          (transpose-array '#2((a b) (c d)) 1 0) ⇒ #2((a c) (b d))
          (transpose-array '#2((a b) (c d)) 0 0) ⇒ #1(a d)
          (transpose-array '#3(((a b c) (d e f)) ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))) 1 1 0) ⇒

### 6.6.13.4 Arrays as arrays of arrays
...................................

One can see an array of rank n (an n-array) as an array of lower rank
where the elements are themselves arrays (‘cells’).

   We speak of the first n-k dimensions of the array as the n-k-‘frame’
of the array, while the last k dimensions are the dimensions of the
k-‘cells’.  For example, a 3-array can be seen as a 2-array of vectors
(1-arrays) or as a 1-array of matrices (2-arrays).  In each case, the
vectors or matrices are the 1-cells or 2-cells of the array.  This
terminology originates in the J language.

   The more vague concept of a ‘slice’ refers to a subset of the array
where some indices are fixed and others are left free.  As a Guile data
object, a cell is the same as a ‘prefix slice’ (the first n-k indices
into the original array are fixed), except that a 0-cell is not a shared
array of the original array, but a 0-slice (where all the indices into
the original array are fixed) is.

   Before version 2.0, Guile had a feature called ‘enclosed arrays’ to
create special ‘array of arrays’ objects.  The functions in this section
do not need special types; instead, the frame rank is stated in each
function call, either implicitly or explicitly.

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-cell-ref array idx ...
 -- C Function: scm_array_cell_ref (array, idxlist)
     If the length of IDXLIST equals the rank n of ARRAY, return the
     element at ‘(idx ...)’, just like ‘(array-ref array idx ...)’.  If,
     however, the length k of IDXLIST is smaller than n, then return the
     (n-k)-cell of ARRAY given by IDXLIST, as a shared array.

     For example:

          (array-cell-ref #2((a b) (c d)) 0) ⇒ #(a b)
          (array-cell-ref #2((a b) (c d)) 1) ⇒ #(c d)
          (array-cell-ref #2((a b) (c d)) 1 1) ⇒ d
          (array-cell-ref #2((a b) (c d))) ⇒ #2((a b) (c d))

     ‘(apply array-cell-ref array indices)’ is equivalent to

          (let ((len (length indices)))
            (if (= (array-rank a) len)
              (apply array-ref a indices)
              (apply make-shared-array a
                     (lambda t (append indices t))
                     (drop (array-dimensions a) len))))

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-slice array idx ...
 -- C Function: scm_array_slice (array, idxlist)
     Like ‘(array-cell-ref array idx ...)’, but return a 0-rank shared
     array into ARRAY if the length of IDXLIST matches the rank of
     ARRAY.  This can be useful when using ARRAY as a place to write to.

     Compare:

          (array-cell-ref #2((a b) (c d)) 1 1) ⇒ d
          (array-slice #2((a b) (c d)) 1 1) ⇒ #0(d)
          (define a (make-array 'a 2 2))
          (array-fill! (array-slice a 1 1) 'b)
          a ⇒ #2((a a) (a b)).
          (array-fill! (array-cell-ref a 1 1) 'b) ⇒ error: not an array

     ‘(apply array-slice array indices)’ is equivalent to

          (apply make-shared-array a
            (lambda t (append indices t))
            (drop (array-dimensions a) (length indices)))

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-cell-set! array x idx ...
 -- C Function: scm_array_cell_set_x (array, x, idxlist)
     If the length of IDXLIST equals the rank n of ARRAY, set the
     element at ‘(idx ...)’ of ARRAY to X, just like ‘(array-set! array
     x idx ...)’.  If, however, the length k of IDXLIST is smaller than
     n, then copy the (n-k)-rank array X into the (n-k)-cell of ARRAY
     given by IDXLIST.  In this case, the last (n-k) dimensions of ARRAY
     and the dimensions of X must match exactly.

     This function returns the modified ARRAY.

     For example:

          (array-cell-set! (make-array 'a 2 2) b 1 1)
            ⇒ #2((a a) (a b))
          (array-cell-set! (make-array 'a 2 2) #(x y) 1)
            ⇒ #2((a a) (x y))

     Note that ‘array-cell-set!’ will expect elements, not arrays, when
     the destination has rank 0.  Use ‘array-slice’ for the opposite
     behavior.

          (array-cell-set! (make-array 'a 2 2) #0(b) 1 1)
            ⇒ #2((a a) (a #0(b)))
          (let ((a (make-array 'a 2 2)))
            (array-copy! #0(b) (array-slice a 1 1)) a)
            ⇒ #2((a a) (a b))

     ‘(apply array-cell-set! array x indices)’ is equivalent to

          (let ((len (length indices)))
            (if (= (array-rank array) len)
              (apply array-set! array x indices)
              (array-copy! x (apply array-cell-ref array indices)))
            array)

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-slice-for-each frame-rank op x ...
 -- C Function: scm_array_slice_for_each (array, frame_rank, op, xlist)
     Each X must be an array of rank ≥ FRAME-RANK, and the first
     FRAME-RANK dimensions of each X must all be the same.
     ARRAY-SLICE-FOR-EACH calls OP with each set of (rank(X) -
     FRAME-RANK)-cells from X, in unspecified order.

     ARRAY-SLICE-FOR-EACH allows you to loop over cells of any rank
     without having to carry an index list or construct shared arrays
     manually.  The slices passed to OP are always shared arrays of X,
     even if they are of rank 0, so it is possible to write to them.

     This function returns an unspecified value.

     For example, to sort the rows of rank-2 array ‘a’:

          (array-slice-for-each 1 (lambda (x) (sort! x <)) a)

     As another example, let ‘a’ be a rank-2 array where each row is a
     2-element vector (x,y).  Let’s compute the arguments of these
     vectors and store them in rank-1 array ‘b’.
          (array-slice-for-each 1
            (lambda (a b)
              (array-set! b (atan (array-ref a 1) (array-ref a 0))))
            a b)

     ‘(apply array-slice-for-each frame-rank op x)’ is equivalent to

          (let ((frame (take (array-dimensions (car x)) frank)))
            (unless (every (lambda (x)
                             (equal? frame (take (array-dimensions x) frank)))
                           (cdr x))
              (error))
            (array-index-map!
              (apply make-shared-array (make-array #t) (const '()) frame)
              (lambda i (apply op (map (lambda (x) (apply array-slice x i)) x)))))

 -- Scheme Procedure: array-slice-for-each-in-order frame-rank op x ...
 -- C Function: scm_array_slice_for_each_in_order (array, frame_rank,
          op, xlist)
     Same as ‘array-slice-for-each’, but the arguments are traversed
     sequentially and in row-major order.

### 6.6.13.5 Accessing Arrays from C
................................

For interworking with external C code, Guile provides an API to allow C
code to access the elements of a Scheme array.  In particular, for
uniform numeric arrays, the API exposes the underlying uniform data as a
C array of numbers of the relevant type.

   While pointers to the elements of an array are in use, the array
itself must be protected so that the pointer remains valid.  Such a
protected array is said to be “reserved”.  A reserved array can be read
but modifications to it that would cause the pointer to its elements to
become invalid are prevented.  When you attempt such a modification, an
error is signalled.

   (This is similar to locking the array while it is in use, but without
the danger of a deadlock.  In a multi-threaded program, you will need
additional synchronization to avoid modifying reserved arrays.)

   You must take care to always unreserve an array after reserving it,
even in the presence of non-local exits.  If a non-local exit can happen
between these two calls, you should install a dynwind context that
releases the array when it is left (*note* Dynamic Wind::).

   In addition, array reserving and unreserving must be properly paired.
For instance, when reserving two or more arrays in a certain order, you
need to unreserve them in the opposite order.

   Once you have reserved an array and have retrieved the pointer to its
elements, you must figure out the layout of the elements in memory.
Guile allows slices to be taken out of arrays without actually making a
copy, such as making an alias for the diagonal of a matrix that can be
treated as a vector.  Arrays that result from such an operation are not
stored contiguously in memory and when working with their elements
directly, you need to take this into account.

   The layout of array elements in memory can be defined via a _mapping
function_ that computes a scalar position from a vector of indices.  The
scalar position then is the offset of the element with the given indices
from the start of the storage block of the array.

   In Guile, this mapping function is restricted to be “affine”: all
mapping functions of Guile arrays can be written as ‘p = b + c[0]*i[0] +
c[1]*i[1] + ... + c[n-1]*i[n-1]’ where ‘i[k]’ is the kth index and ‘n’
is the rank of the array.  For example, a matrix of size 3x3 would have
‘b == 0’, ‘c[0] == 3’ and ‘c[1] == 1’.  When you transpose this matrix
(with ‘transpose-array’, say), you will get an array whose mapping
function has ‘b == 0’, ‘c[0] == 1’ and ‘c[1] == 3’.

   The function ‘scm_array_handle_dims’ gives you (indirect) access to
the coefficients ‘c[k]’.

   Note that there are no functions for accessing the elements of a
character array yet.  Once the string implementation of Guile has been
changed to use Unicode, we will provide them.

 -- C Type: scm_t_array_handle
     This is a structure type that holds all information necessary to
     manage the reservation of arrays as explained above.  Structures of
     this type must be allocated on the stack and must only be accessed
     by the functions listed below.

 -- C Function: void scm_array_get_handle (SCM array, scm_t_array_handle
          *handle)
     Reserve ARRAY, which must be an array, and prepare HANDLE to be
     used with the functions below.  You must eventually call
     ‘scm_array_handle_release’ on HANDLE, and do this in a properly
     nested fashion, as explained above.  The structure pointed to by
     HANDLE does not need to be initialized before calling this
     function.

 -- C Function: void scm_array_handle_release (scm_t_array_handle
          *handle)
     End the array reservation represented by HANDLE.  After a call to
     this function, HANDLE might be used for another reservation.

 -- C Function: size_t scm_array_handle_rank (scm_t_array_handle
          *handle)
     Return the rank of the array represented by HANDLE.

 -- C Type: scm_t_array_dim
     This structure type holds information about the layout of one
     dimension of an array.  It includes the following fields:

     ‘ssize_t lbnd’
     ‘ssize_t ubnd’
          The lower and upper bounds (both inclusive) of the permissible
          index range for the given dimension.  Both values can be
          negative, but LBND is always less than or equal to UBND.

     ‘ssize_t inc’
          The distance from one element of this dimension to the next.
          Note, too, that this can be negative.

 -- C Function: const scm_t_array_dim * scm_array_handle_dims
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
     Return a pointer to a C vector of information about the dimensions
     of the array represented by HANDLE.  This pointer is valid as long
     as the array remains reserved.  As explained above, the
     ‘scm_t_array_dim’ structures returned by this function can be used
     calculate the position of an element in the storage block of the
     array from its indices.

     This position can then be used as an index into the C array pointer
     returned by the various ‘scm_array_handle_<foo>_elements’
     functions, or with ‘scm_array_handle_ref’ and
     ‘scm_array_handle_set’.

     Here is how one can compute the position POS of an element given
     its indices in the vector INDICES:

          ssize_t indices[RANK];
          scm_t_array_dim *dims;
          ssize_t pos;
          size_t i;

          pos = 0;
          for (i = 0; i < RANK; i++)
            {
              if (indices[i] < dims[i].lbnd || indices[i] > dims[i].ubnd)
                out_of_range ();
              pos += (indices[i] - dims[i].lbnd) * dims[i].inc;
            }

 -- C Function: ssize_t scm_array_handle_pos (scm_t_array_handle
          *handle, SCM indices)
     Compute the position corresponding to INDICES, a list of indices.
     The position is computed as described above for
     ‘scm_array_handle_dims’.  The number of the indices and their range
     is checked and an appropriate error is signalled for invalid
     indices.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_array_handle_ref (scm_t_array_handle *handle,
          ssize_t pos)
     Return the element at position POS in the storage block of the
     array represented by HANDLE.  Any kind of array is acceptable.  No
     range checking is done on POS.

 -- C Function: void scm_array_handle_set (scm_t_array_handle *handle,
          ssize_t pos, SCM val)
     Set the element at position POS in the storage block of the array
     represented by HANDLE to VAL.  Any kind of array is acceptable.  No
     range checking is done on POS.  An error is signalled when the
     array can not store VAL.

 -- C Function: const SCM * scm_array_handle_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
     Return a pointer to the elements of a ordinary array of general
     Scheme values (i.e., a non-uniform array) for reading.  This
     pointer is valid as long as the array remains reserved.

 -- C Function: SCM * scm_array_handle_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
     Like ‘scm_array_handle_elements’, but the pointer is good for
     reading and writing.

 -- C Function: const void * scm_array_handle_uniform_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
     Return a pointer to the elements of a uniform numeric array for
     reading.  This pointer is valid as long as the array remains
     reserved.  The size of each element is given by
     ‘scm_array_handle_uniform_element_size’.

 -- C Function: void * scm_array_handle_uniform_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
     Like ‘scm_array_handle_uniform_elements’, but the pointer is good
     reading and writing.

 -- C Function: size_t scm_array_handle_uniform_element_size
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
     Return the size of one element of the uniform numeric array
     represented by HANDLE.

 -- C Function: const scm_t_uint8 * scm_array_handle_u8_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: const scm_t_int8 * scm_array_handle_s8_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)

          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: const scm_t_uint32 * scm_array_handle_u32_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: const scm_t_int32 * scm_array_handle_s32_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: const scm_t_uint64 * scm_array_handle_u64_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: const scm_t_int64 * scm_array_handle_s64_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: const float * scm_array_handle_f32_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: const double * scm_array_handle_f64_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: const float * scm_array_handle_c32_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: const double * scm_array_handle_c64_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
     Return a pointer to the elements of a uniform numeric array of the
     indicated kind for reading.  This pointer is valid as long as the
     array remains reserved.

     The pointers for ‘c32’ and ‘c64’ uniform numeric arrays point to
     pairs of floating point numbers.  The even index holds the real
     part, the odd index the imaginary part of the complex number.

 -- C Function: scm_t_uint8 * scm_array_handle_u8_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: scm_t_int8 * scm_array_handle_s8_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: scm_t_uint16 * scm_array_handle_u16_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: scm_t_int16 * scm_array_handle_s16_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: scm_t_uint32 * scm_array_handle_u32_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: scm_t_int32 * scm_array_handle_s32_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: scm_t_uint64 * scm_array_handle_u64_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: scm_t_int64 * scm_array_handle_s64_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: float * scm_array_handle_f32_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)

          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: float * scm_array_handle_c32_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
 -- C Function: double * scm_array_handle_c64_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
     Like ‘scm_array_handle_<kind>_elements’, but the pointer is good
     for reading and writing.

 -- C Function: const scm_t_uint32 * scm_array_handle_bit_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
     Return a pointer to the words that store the bits of the
     represented array, which must be a bit array.

     Unlike other arrays, bit arrays have an additional offset that must
     be figured into index calculations.  That offset is returned by
     ‘scm_array_handle_bit_elements_offset’.

     To find a certain bit you first need to calculate its position as
     explained above for ‘scm_array_handle_dims’ and then add the
     offset.  This gives the absolute position of the bit, which is
     always a non-negative integer.

     Each word of the bit array storage block contains exactly 32 bits,
     with the least significant bit in that word having the lowest
     absolute position number.  The next word contains the next 32 bits.

     Thus, the following code can be used to access a bit whose position
     according to ‘scm_array_handle_dims’ is given in POS:

          SCM bit_array;
          scm_t_array_handle handle;
          scm_t_uint32 *bits;
          ssize_t pos;
          size_t abs_pos;
          size_t word_pos, mask;

          scm_array_get_handle (&bit_array, &handle);
          bits = scm_array_handle_bit_elements (&handle);

          pos = ...
          abs_pos = pos + scm_array_handle_bit_elements_offset (&handle);
          word_pos = abs_pos / 32;
          mask = 1L << (abs_pos % 32);

          if (bits[word_pos] & mask)
            /* bit is set. */

          scm_array_handle_release (&handle);

 -- C Function: scm_t_uint32 * scm_array_handle_bit_writable_elements
          (scm_t_array_handle *handle)
     Like ‘scm_array_handle_bit_elements’ but the pointer is good for
     reading and writing.  You must take care not to modify bits outside
     of the allowed index range of the array, even for contiguous
     arrays.

6.6.14 VLists
-------------

The ‘(ice-9 vlist)’ module provides an implementation of the “VList”
data structure designed by Phil Bagwell in 2002.  VLists are immutable
lists, which can contain any Scheme object.  They improve on standard
Scheme linked lists in several areas:

   • Random access has typically constant-time complexity.

   • Computing the length of a VList has time complexity logarithmic in
     the number of elements.

   • VLists use less storage space than standard lists.

   • VList elements are stored in contiguous regions, which improves
     memory locality and leads to more efficient use of hardware caches.

   The idea behind VLists is to store vlist elements in increasingly
large contiguous blocks (implemented as vectors here).  These blocks are
linked to one another using a pointer to the next block and an offset
within that block.  The size of these blocks form a geometric series
with ratio ‘block-growth-factor’ (2 by default).

   The VList structure also serves as the basis for the “VList-based
hash lists” or “vhashes”, an immutable dictionary type (*note*
VHashes::).

   However, the current implementation in ‘(ice-9 vlist)’ has several
noteworthy shortcomings:

   • It is _not_ thread-safe.  Although operations on vlists are all
     “referentially transparent” (i.e., purely functional), adding
     elements to a vlist with ‘vlist-cons’ mutates part of its internal
     structure, which makes it non-thread-safe.  This could be fixed,
     but it would slow down ‘vlist-cons’.

   • ‘vlist-cons’ always allocates at least as much memory as ‘cons’.
     Again, Phil Bagwell describes how to fix it, but that would require
     tuning the garbage collector in a way that may not be generally
     beneficial.

   • ‘vlist-cons’ is a Scheme procedure compiled to bytecode, and it
     does not compete with the straightforward C implementation of
     ‘cons’, and with the fact that the VM has a special ‘cons’
     instruction.

   We hope to address these in the future.

   The programming interface exported by ‘(ice-9 vlist)’ is defined
below.  Most of it is the same as SRFI-1 with an added ‘vlist-’ prefix
to function names.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist? obj
     Return true if OBJ is a VList.

 -- Scheme Variable: vlist-null
     The empty VList.  Note that it’s possible to create an empty VList
     not ‘eq?’ to ‘vlist-null’; thus, callers should always use
     ‘vlist-null?’ when testing whether a VList is empty.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-null? vlist
     Return true if VLIST is empty.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-cons item vlist
     Return a new vlist with ITEM as its head and VLIST as its tail.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-head vlist
     Return the head of VLIST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-tail vlist
     Return the tail of VLIST.

 -- Scheme Variable: block-growth-factor
     A fluid that defines the growth factor of VList blocks, 2 by
     default.

   The functions below provide the usual set of higher-level list
operations.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-fold proc init vlist
 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-fold-right proc init vlist
     Fold over VLIST, calling PROC for each element, as for SRFI-1
     ‘fold’ and ‘fold-right’ (*note* ‘fold’: SRFI-1.).

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-ref vlist index
     Return the element at index INDEX in VLIST.  This is typically a
     constant-time operation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-length vlist
     Return the length of VLIST.  This is typically logarithmic in the
     number of elements in VLIST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-reverse vlist
     Return a new VLIST whose content are those of VLIST in reverse
     order.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-map proc vlist
     Map PROC over the elements of VLIST and return a new vlist.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-for-each proc vlist
     Call PROC on each element of VLIST.  The result is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-drop vlist count
     Return a new vlist that does not contain the COUNT first elements
     of VLIST.  This is typically a constant-time operation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-take vlist count
     Return a new vlist that contains only the COUNT first elements of
     VLIST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-filter pred vlist
     Return a new vlist containing all the elements from VLIST that
     satisfy PRED.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-delete x vlist [equal?]
     Return a new vlist corresponding to VLIST without the elements
     EQUAL? to X.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-unfold p f g seed [tail-gen]
 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-unfold-right p f g seed [tail]
     Return a new vlist, as for SRFI-1 ‘unfold’ and ‘unfold-right’
     (*note* ‘unfold’: SRFI-1.).

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist-append vlist ...
     Append the given vlists and return the resulting vlist.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list->vlist lst
     Return a new vlist whose contents correspond to LST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vlist->list vlist
     Return a new list whose contents match those of VLIST.

6.6.15 Record Overview
----------------------

“Records”, also called “structures”, are Scheme’s primary mechanism to
define new disjoint types.  A “record type” defines a list of “fields”
that instances of the type consist of.  This is like C’s ‘struct’.

   Historically, Guile has offered several different ways to define
record types and to create records, offering different features, and
making different trade-offs.  Over the years, each “standard” has also
come with its own new record interface, leading to a maze of record
APIs.

   At the highest level is SRFI-9, a high-level record interface
implemented by most Scheme implementations (*note* SRFI-9 Records::).  It
defines a simple and efficient syntactic abstraction of record types and
their associated type predicate, fields, and field accessors.  SRFI-9 is
suitable for most uses, and this is the recommended way to create record
types in Guile.  Similar high-level record APIs include SRFI-35 (*note*
SRFI-35::) and R6RS records (*note* rnrs records syntactic::).

   Then comes Guile’s historical “records” API (*note* Records::).
Record types defined this way are first-class objects.  Introspection
facilities are available, allowing users to query the list of fields or
the value of a specific field at run-time, without prior knowledge of
the type.

   Finally, the common denominator of these interfaces is Guile’s
“structure” API (*note* Structures::).  Guile’s structures are the
low-level building block for all other record APIs.  Application writers
will normally not need to use it.

   Records created with these APIs may all be pattern-matched using
Guile’s standard pattern matcher (*note* Pattern Matching::).


File: guile.info,  Node: SRFI-9 Records,  Next: Records,  Prev: Record Overview,  Up: Data Types

6.6.16 SRFI-9 Records
---------------------

SRFI-9 standardizes a syntax for defining new record types and creating
predicate, constructor, and field getter and setter functions.  In Guile
this is the recommended option to create new record types (*note* Record
Overview::).  It can be used with:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-9))

 -- Scheme Syntax: define-record-type type
          (constructor fieldname ...)
          predicate
          (fieldname accessor [modifier]) ...

     Create a new record type, and make various ‘define’s for using it.
     This syntax can only occur at the top-level, not nested within some
     other form.

     TYPE is bound to the record type, which is as per the return from
     the core ‘make-record-type’.  TYPE also provides the name for the
     record, as per ‘record-type-name’.

     CONSTRUCTOR is bound to a function to be called as ‘(CONSTRUCTOR
     fieldval ...)’ to create a new record of this type.  The arguments
     are initial values for the fields, one argument for each field, in
     the order they appear in the ‘define-record-type’ form.

     The FIELDNAMEs provide the names for the record fields, as per the
     core ‘record-type-fields’ etc, and are referred to in the
     subsequent accessor/modifier forms.

     PREDICATE is bound to a function to be called as ‘(PREDICATE obj)’.
     It returns ‘#t’ or ‘#f’ according to whether OBJ is a record of
     this type.

     Each ACCESSOR is bound to a function to be called ‘(ACCESSOR
     record)’ to retrieve the respective field from a RECORD.  Similarly
     each MODIFIER is bound to a function to be called ‘(MODIFIER record
     val)’ to set the respective field in a RECORD.

An example will illustrate typical usage,

     (define-record-type <employee>
       (make-employee name age salary)
       employee?
       (name    employee-name)
       (age     employee-age    set-employee-age!)
       (salary  employee-salary set-employee-salary!))

   This creates a new employee data type, with name, age and salary
fields.  Accessor functions are created for each field, but no modifier
function for the name (the intention in this example being that it’s
established only when an employee object is created).  These can all
then be used as for example,

     <employee> ⇒ #<record-type <employee>>

     (define fred (make-employee "Fred" 45 20000.00))

     (employee? fred)        ⇒ #t
     (employee-age fred)     ⇒ 45
     (set-employee-salary! fred 25000.00)  ;; pay rise

   The functions created by ‘define-record-type’ are ordinary top-level
‘define’s.  They can be redefined or ‘set!’ as desired, exported from a
module, etc.

### Non-toplevel Record Definitions
...............................

The SRFI-9 specification explicitly disallows record definitions in a
non-toplevel context, such as inside ‘lambda’ body or inside a LET
block.  However, Guile’s implementation does not enforce that
restriction.

### Custom Printers
...............

You may use ‘set-record-type-printer!’ to customize the default printing
behavior of records.  This is a Guile extension and is not part of
SRFI-9.  It is located in the (srfi srfi-9 gnu) module.

 -- Scheme Syntax: set-record-type-printer! type proc
     Where TYPE corresponds to the first argument of
     ‘define-record-type’, and PROC is a procedure accepting two
     arguments, the record to print, and an output port.

This example prints the employee’s name in brackets, for instance
‘[Fred]’.

     (set-record-type-printer! <employee>
       (lambda (record port)
         (write-char #\[ port)
         (display (employee-name record) port)
         (write-char #\] port)))

### Functional “Setters”
....................

When writing code in a functional style, it is desirable to never alter
the contents of records.  For such code, a simple way to return new
record instances based on existing ones is highly desirable.

   The ‘(srfi srfi-9 gnu)’ module extends SRFI-9 with facilities to
return new record instances based on existing ones, only with one or
more field values changed—“functional setters”.  First, the
‘define-immutable-record-type’ works like ‘define-record-type’, except
that fields are immutable and setters are defined as functional setters.

 -- Scheme Syntax: define-immutable-record-type type
          (constructor fieldname ...)
          predicate
          (fieldname accessor [modifier]) ...
     Define TYPE as a new record type, like ‘define-record-type’.
     However, the record type is made _immutable_ (records may not be
     mutated, even with ‘struct-set!’), and any MODIFIER is defined to
     be a functional setter—a procedure that returns a new record
     instance with the specified field changed, and leaves the original
     unchanged (see example below.)

In addition, the generic ‘set-field’ and ‘set-fields’ macros may be
applied to any SRFI-9 record.

 -- Scheme Syntax: set-field record (field sub-fields ...) value
     Return a new record of RECORD’s type whose fields are equal to the
     corresponding fields of RECORD except for the one specified by
     FIELD.

     FIELD must be the name of the getter corresponding to the field of
     RECORD being “set”.  Subsequent SUB-FIELDS must be record getters
     designating sub-fields within that field value to be set (see
     example below.)

 -- Scheme Syntax: set-fields record ((field sub-fields ...) value) ...
     Like ‘set-field’, but can be used to set more than one field at a
     time.  This expands to code that is more efficient than a series of
     single ‘set-field’ calls.

   To illustrate the use of functional setters, let’s assume these two
record type definitions:

     (define-record-type <address>
       (address street city country)
       address?
       (street  address-street)
       (city    address-city)
       (country address-country))

     (define-immutable-record-type <person>
       (person age email address)
       person?
       (age     person-age set-person-age)
       (email   person-email set-person-email)
       (address person-address set-person-address))

First, note that the ‘<person>’ record type definition introduces named
functional setters.  These may be used like this:

     (define fsf-address
       (address "Franklin Street" "Boston" "USA"))

     (define rms
       (person 30 "rms@gnu.org" fsf-address))

     (and (equal? (set-person-age rms 60)
                  (person 60 "rms@gnu.org" fsf-address))
          (= (person-age rms) 30))
     ⇒ #t

Here, the original ‘<person>’ record, to which RMS is bound, is left
unchanged.

   Now, suppose we want to change both the street and age of RMS.  This
can be achieved using ‘set-fields’:

     (set-fields rms
       ((person-age) 60)
       ((person-address address-street) "Temple Place"))
     ⇒ #<<person> age: 60 email: "rms@gnu.org"
       address: #<<address> street: "Temple Place" city: "Boston" country: "USA">>

Notice how the above changed two fields of RMS, including the ‘street’
field of its ‘address’ field, in a concise way.  Also note that
‘set-fields’ works equally well for types defined with just
‘define-record-type’.

A “record type” is a first class object representing a user-defined data
type.  A “record” is an instance of a record type.

   Note that in many ways, this interface is too low-level for every-day
use.  Most uses of records are better served by SRFI-9 records.  *Note*
SRFI-9 Records::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a record of any type and ‘#f’ otherwise.

     Note that ‘record?’ may be true of any Scheme value; there is no
     promise that records are disjoint with other Scheme types.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-record-type type-name field-names [print]
          [#:parent=#f] [#:uid=#f] [#:extensible?=#f] [#:opaque?=#f]
          [#:allow-duplicate-field-names?=#t]
     Create and return a new “record-type descriptor”.

     TYPE-NAME is a string naming the type.  Currently it’s only used in
     the printed representation of records, and in diagnostics.
     FIELD-NAMES is a list of elements of the form ‘(immutable NAME)’,
     ‘(mutable NAME)’, or NAME, where NAME are symbols naming the fields
     of a record of the type.  Duplicates are not allowed among these
     symbols, unless ALLOW-DUPLICATE-FIELD-NAMES? is true.

          (make-record-type "employee" '(name age salary))

     The optional PRINT argument is a function used by ‘display’,
     ‘write’, etc, for printing a record of the new type.  It’s called
     as ‘(PRINT record port)’ and should look at RECORD and write to
     PORT.

     Pass the ‘#:parent’ keyword to derive a record type from a
     supertype.  A derived record type has the fields from its parent
     type, followed by fields declared in the ‘make-record-type’ call.
     Record predicates and field accessors for instance of a parent type
     will also work on any instance of a subtype.

     Allowing record subtyping has a small amount of overhead.  To avoid
     this overhead, prevent extensibility by passing ‘#:extensible? #f’.
     By default, record types in Guile are not extensible.

     Generally speaking, calling ‘make-record-type’ returns a fresh
     record type; it _generates_ new record types.  However sometimes
     you only want to define a record type if one hasn’t been defined
     already.  For a _nongenerative_ record type definition, pass a
     symbol as the ‘#:uid’ keyword parameter.  If a record with the
     given UID was already defined, it will be returned instead.  The
     type name, fields, parent (if any), and so on for the
     previously-defined type must be compatible.

     R6RS defines a notion of “opaque” record types.  Given an instance
     of an opaque record type, one cannot obtain a run-time
     representation of the record type.  *Note* rnrs records
     procedural::, for full details.  The ‘#:opaque?’ flag is used by
     Guile’s R6RS layer to record this information.  The default is
     determined by whether the parent type, if any, was opaque.

     Fields are mutable by default, meaning that ‘record-modifier’ will
     return a procedure that can update a record in place.  Specifying a
     field using the form ‘(immutable NAME)’ instead marks a field as
     immutable.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-constructor rtd
     Return a procedure for constructing new members of the type
     represented by RTD.  The result will be a procedure accepting
     exactly as many arguments as there are fields in the record type.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-predicate rtd
     Return a procedure for testing membership in the type represented
     by RTD.  The returned procedure accepts exactly one argument and
     returns a true value if the argument is a member of the indicated
     record type; it returns a false value otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-accessor rtd field-name
     Return a procedure for reading the value of a particular field of a
     member of the type represented by RTD.  The returned procedure
     accepts exactly one argument which must be a record of the
     appropriate type; it returns the current value of the field named
     by the symbol FIELD-NAME in that record.

     If FIELD-NAME is a symbol, it must be a member of the list of
     field-names in the call to ‘make-record-type’ that created the type
     represented by RTD.  If multiple fields in RTD have the same name,
     ‘record-accessor’ returns the first one.

     If FIELD-NAME is an integer, it should be an index into
     ‘(record-type-fields RTD)’.  This allows accessing fields with
     duplicate names.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-modifier rtd field-name
     Return a procedure for writing the value of a particular field of a
     member of the type represented by RTD.  The returned procedure
     accepts exactly two arguments: first, a record of the appropriate
     type, and second, an arbitrary Scheme value; it modifies the field
     named by the symbol FIELD-NAME in that record to contain the given
     value.  The returned value of the modifier procedure is
     unspecified.  The symbol FIELD-NAME is a field name or a field
     index, as in ‘record-modifier’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-type-descriptor record
     Return a record-type descriptor representing the type of the given
     record.  That is, for example, if the returned descriptor were
     passed to ‘record-predicate’, the resulting predicate would return
     a true value when passed the given record.  Note that it is not
     necessarily the case that the returned descriptor is the one that
     was passed to ‘record-constructor’ in the call that created the
     constructor procedure that created the given record.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-type-name rtd
     Return the type-name associated with the type represented by rtd.
     The returned value is ‘eqv?’ to the TYPE-NAME argument given in the
     call to ‘make-record-type’ that created the type represented by
     RTD.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-type-fields rtd
     Return a list of the symbols naming the fields in members of the
     type represented by RTD.  The returned value is ‘equal?’ to the
     field-names argument given in the call to ‘make-record-type’ that
     created the type represented by RTD.

6.6.18 Structures
-----------------

A “structure” is a first class data type which holds Scheme values or C
words in fields numbered 0 upwards.  A “vtable” is a structure that
represents a structure type, giving field types and permissions, and an
optional print function for ‘write’ etc.

   Structures are lower level than records (*note* Records::).  Usually,
when you need to represent structured data, you just want to use
records.  But sometimes you need to implement new kinds of structured
data abstractions, and for that purpose structures are useful.  Indeed,
records in Guile are implemented with structures.

### 6.6.18.1 Vtables
................

A vtable is a structure type, specifying its layout, and other
information.  A vtable is actually itself a structure, but there’s no
need to worry about that initially (*note* Vtable Contents::.)

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-vtable fields [print]
     Create a new vtable.

     FIELDS is a string describing the fields in the structures to be
     created.  Each field is represented by two characters, a type
     letter and a permissions letter, for example ‘"pw"’.  The types are
     as follows.

        • ‘p’ – a Scheme value.  “p” stands for “protected” meaning it’s
          protected against garbage collection.

        • ‘u’ – an arbitrary word of data (an ‘scm_t_bits’).  At the
          Scheme level it’s read and written as an unsigned integer.
          “u” stands for “unboxed”, as it’s stored as a raw value
          without additional type annotations.

     It used to be that the second letter for each field was a
     permission code, such as ‘w’ for writable or ‘r’ for read-only.
     However over time structs have become more of a raw low-level
     facility; access control is better implemented as a layer on top.
     After all, ‘struct-set!’ is a cross-cutting operator that can
     bypass abstractions made by higher-level record facilities; it’s
     not generally safe (in the sense of abstraction-preserving) to
     expose ‘struct-set!’ to “untrusted” code, even if the fields happen
     to be writable.  Additionally, permission checks added overhead to
     every structure access in a way that couldn’t be optimized out,
     hampering the ability of structs to act as a low-level building
     block.  For all of these reasons, all fields in Guile structs are
     now writable; attempting to make a read-only field will now issue a
     deprecation warning, and the field will be writable regardless.

          (make-vtable "pw")      ;; one scheme field
          (make-vtable "pwuwuw")  ;; one scheme and two unboxed fields

     The optional PRINT argument is a function called by ‘display’ and
     ‘write’ (etc) to give a printed representation of a structure
     created from this vtable.  It’s called ‘(PRINT struct port)’ and
     should look at STRUCT and write to PORT.  The default print merely
     gives a form like ‘#<struct ADDR:ADDR>’ with a pair of machine
     addresses.

     The following print function for example shows the two fields of
     its structure.

          (make-vtable "pwpw"
                       (lambda (struct port)
                         (format port "#<~a and ~a>"
                                 (struct-ref struct 0)
                                 (struct-ref struct 1))))

### 6.6.18.2 Structure Basics
.........................

This section describes the basic procedures for working with structures.
‘make-struct/no-tail’ creates a structure, and ‘struct-ref’ and
‘struct-set!’ access its fields.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-struct/no-tail vtable init ...
     Create a new structure, with layout per the given VTABLE (*note*
     Vtables::).

     The optional INIT... arguments are initial values for the fields of
     the structure.  This is the only way to put values in read-only
     fields.  If there are fewer INIT arguments than fields then the
     defaults are ‘#f’ for a Scheme field (type ‘p’) or 0 for an unboxed
     field (type ‘u’).

     The name is a bit strange, we admit.  The reason for it is that
     Guile used to have a ‘make-struct’ that took an additional
     argument; while we deprecate that old interface,
     ‘make-struct/no-tail’ is the new name for this functionality.

     For example,

          (define v (make-vtable "pwpwpw"))
          (define s (make-struct/no-tail v 123 "abc" 456))
          (struct-ref s 0) ⇒ 123
          (struct-ref s 1) ⇒ "abc"

 -- C Function: SCM scm_make_struct (SCM vtable, SCM tail_size, SCM
          init_list)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_make_struct (SCM vtable, SCM tail_size, SCM
          init, ...)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_make_structv (SCM vtable, SCM tail_size,
          size_t n_inits, scm_t_bits init[])
     There are a few ways to make structures from C. ‘scm_make_struct’
     takes a list, ‘scm_c_make_struct’ takes variable arguments
     terminated with SCM_UNDEFINED, and ‘scm_c_make_structv’ takes a
     packed array.

     For all of these, TAIL_SIZE should be zero (as a SCM value).

 -- Scheme Procedure: struct? obj
 -- C Function: scm_struct_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a structure, or ‘#f’ if not.

 -- Scheme Procedure: struct-ref struct n
 -- C Function: scm_struct_ref (struct, n)
     Return the contents of field number N in STRUCT.  The first field
     is number 0.

     An error is thrown if N is out of range.

 -- Scheme Procedure: struct-set! struct n value
 -- C Function: scm_struct_set_x (struct, n, value)
     Set field number N in STRUCT to VALUE.  The first field is number
     0.

     An error is thrown if N is out of range, or if the field cannot be
     written because it’s ‘r’ read-only.

   Unboxed fields (those with type ‘u’) need to be accessed with special
procedures.

 -- Scheme Procedure: struct-ref/unboxed struct n
 -- Scheme Procedure: struct-set!/unboxed struct n value
 -- C Function: scm_struct_ref_unboxed (struct, n)
 -- C Function: scm_struct_set_x_unboxed (struct, n, value)
     Like ‘struct-ref’ and ‘struct-set!’, except that these may only be
     used on unboxed fields.  ‘struct-ref/unboxed’ will always return a
     positive integer.  Likewise, ‘struct-set!/unboxed’ takes an
     unsigned integer as the VALUE argument, and will signal an error
     otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: struct-vtable struct
 -- C Function: scm_struct_vtable (struct)
     Return the vtable that describes STRUCT.

     The vtable is effectively the type of the structure.  See *note*
     Vtable Contents::, for more on vtables.

### 6.6.18.3 Vtable Contents
........................

A vtable is itself a structure.  It has a specific set of fields
describing various aspects of its “instances”: the structures created
from a vtable.  Some of the fields are internal to Guile, some of them
are part of the public interface, and there may be additional fields
added on by the user.

   Every vtable has a field for the layout of their instances, a field
for the procedure used to print its instances, and a field for the name
of the vtable itself.  Access to the layout and printer is exposed
directly via field indexes.  Access to the vtable name is exposed via
accessor procedures.

 -- Scheme Variable: vtable-index-layout
 -- C Macro: scm_vtable_index_layout
     The field number of the layout specification in a vtable.  The
     layout specification is a symbol like ‘pwpw’ formed from the fields
     string passed to ‘make-vtable’, or created by ‘make-struct-layout’
     (*note* Meta-Vtables::).

          (define v (make-vtable "pwpw" 0))
          (struct-ref v vtable-index-layout) ⇒ pwpw

     This field is read-only, since the layout of structures using a
     vtable cannot be changed.

 -- Scheme Variable: vtable-index-printer
 -- C Macro: scm_vtable_index_printer
     The field number of the printer function.  This field contains ‘#f’
     if the default print function should be used.

          (define (my-print-func struct port)
            ...)
          (define v (make-vtable "pwpw" my-print-func))
          (struct-ref v vtable-index-printer) ⇒ my-print-func

     This field is writable, allowing the print function to be changed
     dynamically.

 -- Scheme Procedure: struct-vtable-name vtable
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-struct-vtable-name! vtable name
 -- C Function: scm_struct_vtable_name (vtable)
 -- C Function: scm_set_struct_vtable_name_x (vtable, name)
     Get or set the name of VTABLE.  NAME is a symbol and is used in the
     default print function when printing structures created from
     VTABLE.

          (define v (make-vtable "pw"))
          (set-struct-vtable-name! v 'my-name)

          (define s (make-struct v 0))
          (display s) ⊣ #<my-name b7ab3ae0:b7ab3730>

### 6.6.18.4 Meta-Vtables
.....................

As a structure, a vtable also has a vtable, which is also a structure.
Structures, their vtables, the vtables of the vtables, and so on form a
tree of structures.  Making a new structure adds a leaf to the tree, and
if that structure is a vtable, it may be used to create other leaves.

   If you traverse up the tree of vtables, via calling ‘struct-vtable’,
eventually you reach a root which is the vtable of itself:

     scheme@(guile-user)> (current-module)
     $1 = #<directory (guile-user) 221b090>
     scheme@(guile-user)> (struct-vtable $1)
     $2 = #<record-type module>
     scheme@(guile-user)> (struct-vtable $2)
     $3 = #<<standard-vtable> 12c30a0>
     scheme@(guile-user)> (struct-vtable $3)
     $4 = #<<standard-vtable> 12c3fa0>
     scheme@(guile-user)> (struct-vtable $4)
     $5 = #<<standard-vtable> 12c3fa0>
     scheme@(guile-user)> <standard-vtable>
     $6 = #<<standard-vtable> 12c3fa0>

   In this example, we can say that ‘$1’ is an instance of ‘$2’, ‘$2’ is
an instance of ‘$3’, ‘$3’ is an instance of ‘$4’, and ‘$4’, strangely
enough, is an instance of itself.  The value bound to ‘$4’ in this
console session also bound to ‘<standard-vtable>’ in the default
environment.

 -- Scheme Variable: <standard-vtable>
     A meta-vtable, useful for making new vtables.

   All of these values are structures.  All but ‘$1’ are vtables.  As
‘$2’ is an instance of ‘$3’, and ‘$3’ is a vtable, we can say that ‘$3’
is a “meta-vtable”: a vtable that can create vtables.

   With this definition, we can specify more precisely what a vtable is:
a vtable is a structure made from a meta-vtable.  Making a structure
from a meta-vtable runs some special checks to ensure that the first
field of the structure is a valid layout.  Additionally, if these checks
see that the layout of the child vtable contains all the required fields
of a vtable, in the correct order, then the child vtable will also be a
meta-table, inheriting a magical bit from the parent.

 -- Scheme Procedure: struct-vtable? obj
 -- C Function: scm_struct_vtable_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a vtable structure: an instance of a
     meta-vtable.

   ‘<standard-vtable>’ is a root of the vtable tree.  (Normally there is
only one root in a given Guile process, but due to some legacy
interfaces there may be more than one.)

   The set of required fields of a vtable is the set of fields in the
‘<standard-vtable>’, and is bound to ‘standard-vtable-fields’ in the
default environment.  It is possible to create a meta-vtable that with
additional fields in its layout, which can be used to create vtables
with additional data:

     scheme@(guile-user)> (struct-ref $3 vtable-index-layout)
     $6 = pwuhuhpwphuhuhpwpwpw
     scheme@(guile-user)> (struct-ref $4 vtable-index-layout)
     $7 = pwuhuhpwphuhuh
     scheme@(guile-user)> standard-vtable-fields
     $8 = "pwuhuhpwphuhuh"
     scheme@(guile-user)> (struct-ref $2 vtable-offset-user)
     $9 = module

   In this continuation of our earlier example, ‘$2’ is a vtable that
has extra fields, because its vtable, ‘$3’, was made from a meta-vtable
with an extended layout.  ‘vtable-offset-user’ is a convenient
definition that indicates the number of fields in
‘standard-vtable-fields’.

 -- Scheme Variable: standard-vtable-fields
     A string containing the ordered set of fields that a vtable must
     have.

 -- Scheme Variable: vtable-offset-user
     The first index in a vtable that is available for a user.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-struct-layout fields
 -- C Function: scm_make_struct_layout (fields)
     Return a structure layout symbol, from a FIELDS string.  FIELDS is
     as described under ‘make-vtable’ (*note* Vtables::).  An invalid
     FIELDS string is an error.

   With these definitions, one can define ‘make-vtable’ in this way:

     (define* (make-vtable fields #:optional printer)
       (make-struct/no-tail <standard-vtable>
         (make-struct-layout fields)
         printer))

### 6.6.18.5 Vtable Example
.......................

Let us bring these points together with an example.  Consider a simple
object system with single inheritance.  Objects will be normal
structures, and classes will be vtables with three extra class fields:
the name of the class, the parent class, and the list of fields.

   So, first we need a meta-vtable that allocates instances with these
extra class fields.

     (define <class>
       (make-vtable
        (string-append standard-vtable-fields "pwpwpw")
        (lambda (x port)
          (format port "<<class> ~a>" (class-name x)))))

     (define (class? x)
       (and (struct? x)
            (eq? (struct-vtable x) <class>)))

   To make a structure with a specific meta-vtable, we will use
‘make-struct/no-tail’, passing it the computed instance layout and
printer, as with ‘make-vtable’, and additionally the extra three class
fields.

     (define (make-class name parent fields)
       (let* ((fields (compute-fields parent fields))
              (layout (compute-layout fields)))
         (make-struct/no-tail <class>
           layout
           (lambda (x port)
             (print-instance x port))
           name
           parent
           fields)))

   Instances will store their associated data in slots in the structure:
as many slots as there are fields.  The ‘compute-layout’ procedure below
can compute a layout, and ‘field-index’ returns the slot corresponding
to a field.

     (define-syntax-rule (define-accessor name n)
       (define (name obj)
         (struct-ref obj n)))

     ;; Accessors for classes
     (define-accessor class-name (+ vtable-offset-user 0))
     (define-accessor class-parent (+ vtable-offset-user 1))
     (define-accessor class-fields (+ vtable-offset-user 2))

     (define (compute-fields parent fields)
       (if parent
           (append (class-fields parent) fields)
           fields))

     (define (compute-layout fields)
       (make-struct-layout
        (string-concatenate (make-list (length fields) "pw"))))

     (define (field-index class field)
       (list-index (class-fields class) field))

     (define (print-instance x port)
       (format port "<~a" (class-name (struct-vtable x)))
       (for-each (lambda (field idx)
                   (format port " ~a: ~a" field (struct-ref x idx)))
                 (class-fields (struct-vtable x))
                 (iota (length (class-fields (struct-vtable x)))))
       (format port ">"))

   So, at this point we can actually make a few classes:

     (define-syntax-rule (define-class name parent field ...)
       (define name (make-class 'name parent '(field ...))))

     (define-class <surface> #f
       width height)

     (define-class <window> <surface>
       x y)

   And finally, make an instance:

     (make-struct/no-tail <window> 400 300 10 20)
     ⇒ <<window> width: 400 height: 300 x: 10 y: 20>

   And that’s that.  Note that there are many possible optimizations and
feature enhancements that can be made to this object system, and the
included GOOPS system does make most of them.  For more simple use
cases, the records facility is usually sufficient.  But sometimes you
need to make new kinds of data abstractions, and for that purpose,
structs are here.


File: guile.info,  Node: Dictionary Types,  Next: Association Lists,  Prev: Structures,  Up: Data Types

6.6.19 Dictionary Types
-----------------------

A “dictionary” object is a data structure used to index information in a
user-defined way.  In standard Scheme, the main aggregate data types are
lists and vectors.  Lists are not really indexed at all, and vectors are
indexed only by number (e.g. ‘(vector-ref foo 5)’).  Often you will find
it useful to index your data on some other type; for example, in a
library catalog you might want to look up a book by the name of its
author.  Dictionaries are used to help you organize information in such
a way.

   An “association list” (or “alist” for short) is a list of key-value
pairs.  Each pair represents a single quantity or object; the ‘car’ of
the pair is a key which is used to identify the object, and the ‘cdr’ is
the object’s value.

   A “hash table” also permits you to index objects with arbitrary keys,
but in a way that makes looking up any one object extremely fast.  A
well-designed hash system makes hash table lookups almost as fast as
conventional array or vector references.

   Alists are popular among Lisp programmers because they use only the
language’s primitive operations (lists, “car”, “cdr” and the equality
primitives).  No changes to the language core are necessary.  Therefore,
with Scheme’s built-in list manipulation facilities, it is very
convenient to handle data stored in an association list.  Also, alists
are highly portable and can be easily implemented on even the most
minimal Lisp systems.

   However, alists are inefficient, especially for storing large
quantities of data.  Because we want Guile to be useful for large
software systems as well as small ones, Guile provides a rich set of
tools for using either association lists or hash tables.

6.6.20 Association Lists
------------------------

An association list is a conventional data structure that is often used
to implement simple key-value databases.  It consists of a list of
entries in which each entry is a pair.  The “key” of each entry is the
‘car’ of the pair and the “value” of each entry is the ‘cdr’.

     ASSOCIATION LIST ::=  '( (KEY1 . VALUE1)
                              (KEY2 . VALUE2)
                              (KEY3 . VALUE3)
                              ...
                            )

Association lists are also known, for short, as “alists”.

   The structure of an association list is just one example of the
infinite number of possible structures that can be built using pairs and
lists.  As such, the keys and values in an association list can be
manipulated using the general list structure procedures ‘cons’, ‘car’,
‘cdr’, ‘set-car!’, ‘set-cdr!’ and so on.  However, because association
lists are so useful, Guile also provides specific procedures for
manipulating them.

### 6.6.20.1 Alist Key Equality
...........................

All of Guile’s dedicated association list procedures, apart from
‘acons’, come in three flavours, depending on the level of equality that
is required to decide whether an existing key in the association list is
the same as the key that the procedure call uses to identify the
required entry.

   • Procedures with “assq” in their name use ‘eq?’ to determine key
     equality.

   • Procedures with “assv” in their name use ‘eqv?’ to determine key
     equality.

   • Procedures with “assoc” in their name use ‘equal?’ to determine key
     equality.

   ‘acons’ is an exception because it is used to build association lists
which do not require their entries’ keys to be unique.


File: guile.info,  Node: Adding or Setting Alist Entries,  Next: Retrieving Alist Entries,  Prev: Alist Key Equality,  Up: Association Lists

### 6.6.20.2 Adding or Setting Alist Entries
........................................

‘acons’ adds a new entry to an association list and returns the combined
association list.  The combined alist is formed by consing the new entry
onto the head of the alist specified in the ‘acons’ procedure call.  So
the specified alist is not modified, but its contents become shared with
the tail of the combined alist that ‘acons’ returns.

   In the most common usage of ‘acons’, a variable holding the original
association list is updated with the combined alist:

     (set! address-list (acons name address address-list))

   In such cases, it doesn’t matter that the old and new values of
‘address-list’ share some of their contents, since the old value is
usually no longer independently accessible.

   Note that ‘acons’ adds the specified new entry regardless of whether
the alist may already contain entries with keys that are, in some sense,
the same as that of the new entry.  Thus ‘acons’ is ideal for building
alists where there is no concept of key uniqueness.

     (set! task-list (acons 3 "pay gas bill" '()))
     task-list
     ⇒
     ((3 . "pay gas bill"))

     (set! task-list (acons 3 "tidy bedroom" task-list))
     task-list
     ⇒
     ((3 . "tidy bedroom") (3 . "pay gas bill"))

   ‘assq-set!’, ‘assv-set!’ and ‘assoc-set!’ are used to add or replace
an entry in an association list where there _is_ a concept of key
uniqueness.  If the specified association list already contains an entry
whose key is the same as that specified in the procedure call, the
existing entry is replaced by the new one.  Otherwise, the new entry is
consed onto the head of the old association list to create the combined
alist.  In all cases, these procedures return the combined alist.

   ‘assq-set!’ and friends _may_ destructively modify the structure of
the old association list in such a way that an existing variable is
correctly updated without having to ‘set!’ it to the value returned:

     address-list
     ⇒
     (("mary" . "34 Elm Road") ("james" . "16 Bow Street"))

     (assoc-set! address-list "james" "1a London Road")
     ⇒
     (("mary" . "34 Elm Road") ("james" . "1a London Road"))

     address-list
     ⇒
     (("mary" . "34 Elm Road") ("james" . "1a London Road"))

   Or they may not:

     (assoc-set! address-list "bob" "11 Newington Avenue")
     ⇒
     (("bob" . "11 Newington Avenue") ("mary" . "34 Elm Road")
      ("james" . "1a London Road"))

     address-list
     ⇒
     (("mary" . "34 Elm Road") ("james" . "1a London Road"))

   The only safe way to update an association list variable when adding
or replacing an entry like this is to ‘set!’ the variable to the
returned value:

     (set! address-list
           (assoc-set! address-list "bob" "11 Newington Avenue"))
     address-list
     ⇒
     (("bob" . "11 Newington Avenue") ("mary" . "34 Elm Road")
      ("james" . "1a London Road"))

   Because of this slight inconvenience, you may find it more convenient
to use hash tables to store dictionary data.  If your application will
not be modifying the contents of an alist very often, this may not make
much difference to you.

   If you need to keep the old value of an association list in a form
independent from the list that results from modification by ‘acons’,
‘assq-set!’, ‘assv-set!’ or ‘assoc-set!’, use ‘list-copy’ to copy the
old association list before modifying it.

 -- Scheme Procedure: acons key value alist
 -- C Function: scm_acons (key, value, alist)
     Add a new key-value pair to ALIST.  A new pair is created whose car
     is KEY and whose cdr is VALUE, and the pair is consed onto ALIST,
     and the new list is returned.  This function is _not_ destructive;
     ALIST is not modified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: assq-set! alist key val
 -- Scheme Procedure: assv-set! alist key value
 -- Scheme Procedure: assoc-set! alist key value
 -- C Function: scm_assq_set_x (alist, key, val)
 -- C Function: scm_assv_set_x (alist, key, val)
 -- C Function: scm_assoc_set_x (alist, key, val)
     Reassociate KEY in ALIST with VALUE: find any existing ALIST entry
     for KEY and associate it with the new VALUE.  If ALIST does not
     contain an entry for KEY, add a new one.  Return the (possibly new)
     alist.

     These functions do not attempt to verify the structure of ALIST,
     and so may cause unusual results if passed an object that is not an
     association list.

### 6.6.20.3 Retrieving Alist Entries
.................................

‘assq’, ‘assv’ and ‘assoc’ find the entry in an alist for a given key,
and return the ‘(KEY . VALUE)’ pair.  ‘assq-ref’, ‘assv-ref’ and
‘assoc-ref’ do a similar lookup, but return just the VALUE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: assq key alist
 -- Scheme Procedure: assv key alist
 -- Scheme Procedure: assoc key alist
 -- C Function: scm_assq (key, alist)
 -- C Function: scm_assv (key, alist)
 -- C Function: scm_assoc (key, alist)
     Return the first entry in ALIST with the given KEY.  The return is
     the pair ‘(KEY . VALUE)’ from ALIST.  If there’s no matching entry
     the return is ‘#f’.

     ‘assq’ compares keys with ‘eq?’, ‘assv’ uses ‘eqv?’ and ‘assoc’
     uses ‘equal?’.  See also SRFI-1 which has an extended ‘assoc’
     (*note* SRFI-1 Association Lists::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: assq-ref alist key
 -- Scheme Procedure: assv-ref alist key
 -- Scheme Procedure: assoc-ref alist key
 -- C Function: scm_assq_ref (alist, key)
 -- C Function: scm_assv_ref (alist, key)
 -- C Function: scm_assoc_ref (alist, key)
     Return the value from the first entry in ALIST with the given KEY,
     or ‘#f’ if there’s no such entry.

     ‘assq-ref’ compares keys with ‘eq?’, ‘assv-ref’ uses ‘eqv?’ and
     ‘assoc-ref’ uses ‘equal?’.

     Notice these functions have the KEY argument last, like other
     ‘-ref’ functions, but this is opposite to what ‘assq’ etc above
     use.

     When the return is ‘#f’ it can be either KEY not found, or an entry
     which happens to have value ‘#f’ in the ‘cdr’.  Use ‘assq’ etc
     above if you need to differentiate these cases.


File: guile.info,  Node: Removing Alist Entries,  Next: Sloppy Alist Functions,  Prev: Retrieving Alist Entries,  Up: Association Lists

### 6.6.20.4 Removing Alist Entries
...............................

To remove the element from an association list whose key matches a
specified key, use ‘assq-remove!’, ‘assv-remove!’ or ‘assoc-remove!’
(depending, as usual, on the level of equality required between the key
that you specify and the keys in the association list).

   As with ‘assq-set!’ and friends, the specified alist may or may not
be modified destructively, and the only safe way to update a variable
containing the alist is to ‘set!’ it to the value that ‘assq-remove!’
and friends return.

     address-list
     ⇒
     (("bob" . "11 Newington Avenue") ("mary" . "34 Elm Road")
      ("james" . "1a London Road"))

     (set! address-list (assoc-remove! address-list "mary"))
     address-list
     ⇒
     (("bob" . "11 Newington Avenue") ("james" . "1a London Road"))

   Note that, when ‘assq/v/oc-remove!’ is used to modify an association
list that has been constructed only using the corresponding
‘assq/v/oc-set!’, there can be at most one matching entry in the alist,
so the question of multiple entries being removed in one go does not
arise.  If ‘assq/v/oc-remove!’ is applied to an association list that
has been constructed using ‘acons’, or an ‘assq/v/oc-set!’ with a
different level of equality, or any mixture of these, it removes only
the first matching entry from the alist, even if the alist might contain
further matching entries.  For example:

     (define address-list '())
     (set! address-list (assq-set! address-list "mary" "11 Elm Street"))
     (set! address-list (assq-set! address-list "mary" "57 Pine Drive"))
     address-list
     ⇒
     (("mary" . "57 Pine Drive") ("mary" . "11 Elm Street"))

     (set! address-list (assoc-remove! address-list "mary"))
     address-list
     ⇒
     (("mary" . "11 Elm Street"))

   In this example, the two instances of the string "mary" are not the
same when compared using ‘eq?’, so the two ‘assq-set!’ calls add two
distinct entries to ‘address-list’.  When compared using ‘equal?’, both
"mary"s in ‘address-list’ are the same as the "mary" in the
‘assoc-remove!’ call, but ‘assoc-remove!’ stops after removing the first
matching entry that it finds, and so one of the "mary" entries is left
in place.

 -- Scheme Procedure: assq-remove! alist key
 -- Scheme Procedure: assv-remove! alist key
 -- Scheme Procedure: assoc-remove! alist key
 -- C Function: scm_assq_remove_x (alist, key)
 -- C Function: scm_assv_remove_x (alist, key)
 -- C Function: scm_assoc_remove_x (alist, key)
     Delete the first entry in ALIST associated with KEY, and return the
     resulting alist.

### 6.6.20.5 Sloppy Alist Functions
...............................

‘sloppy-assq’, ‘sloppy-assv’ and ‘sloppy-assoc’ behave like the
corresponding non-‘sloppy-’ procedures, except that they return ‘#f’
when the specified association list is not well-formed, where the
non-‘sloppy-’ versions would signal an error.

   Specifically, there are two conditions for which the non-‘sloppy-’
procedures signal an error, which the ‘sloppy-’ procedures handle
instead by returning ‘#f’.  Firstly, if the specified alist as a whole
is not a proper list:

     (assoc "mary" '((1 . 2) ("key" . "door") . "open sesame"))
     ⇒
     ERROR: In procedure assoc in expression (assoc "mary" (quote #)):
     ERROR: Wrong type argument in position 2 (expecting
        association list): ((1 . 2) ("key" . "door") . "open sesame")

     (sloppy-assoc "mary" '((1 . 2) ("key" . "door") . "open sesame"))
     ⇒
     #f

Secondly, if one of the entries in the specified alist is not a pair:

     (assoc 2 '((1 . 1) 2 (3 . 9)))
     ⇒
     ERROR: In procedure assoc in expression (assoc 2 (quote #)):
     ERROR: Wrong type argument in position 2 (expecting
        association list): ((1 . 1) 2 (3 . 9))

     (sloppy-assoc 2 '((1 . 1) 2 (3 . 9)))
     ⇒
     #f

   Unless you are explicitly working with badly formed association
lists, it is much safer to use the non-‘sloppy-’ procedures, because
they help to highlight coding and data errors that the ‘sloppy-’
versions would silently cover up.

File: guile.info,  Node: VHashes,  Next: Hash Tables,  Prev: Association Lists,  Up: Data Types

6.6.21 VList-Based Hash Lists or “VHashes”
------------------------------------------

The ‘(ice-9 vlist)’ module provides an implementation of “VList-based
hash lists” (*note* VLists::).  VList-based hash lists, or “vhashes”, are
an immutable dictionary type similar to association lists that maps
“keys” to “values”.  However, unlike association lists, accessing a
value given its key is typically a constant-time operation.

   The VHash programming interface of ‘(ice-9 vlist)’ is mostly the same
as that of association lists found in SRFI-1, with procedure names
prefixed by ‘vhash-’ instead of ‘alist-’ (*note* SRFI-1 Association
Lists::).

   In addition, vhashes can be manipulated using VList operations:

     (vlist-head (vhash-consq 'a 1 vlist-null))
     ⇒ (a . 1)

     (define vh1 (vhash-consq 'b 2 (vhash-consq 'a 1 vlist-null)))
     (define vh2 (vhash-consq 'c 3 (vlist-tail vh1)))

     (vhash-assq 'a vh2)
     ⇒ (a . 1)
     (vhash-assq 'b vh2)
     ⇒ #f
     (vhash-assq 'c vh2)
     ⇒ (c . 3)
     (vlist->list vh2)
     ⇒ ((c . 3) (a . 1))

   However, keep in mind that procedures that construct new VLists
(‘vlist-map’, ‘vlist-filter’, etc.)  return raw VLists, not vhashes:

     (define vh (alist->vhash '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3)) hashq))
     (vhash-assq 'a vh)
     ⇒ (a . 1)

     (define vl
       ;; This will create a raw vlist.
       (vlist-filter (lambda (key+value) (odd? (cdr key+value))) vh))
     (vhash-assq 'a vl)
     ⇒ ERROR: Wrong type argument in position 2

     (vlist->list vl)
     ⇒ ((a . 1) (c . 3))

 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash? obj
     Return true if OBJ is a vhash.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-cons key value vhash [hash-proc]
 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-consq key value vhash
 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-consv key value vhash
     Return a new hash list based on VHASH where KEY is associated with
     VALUE, using HASH-PROC to compute the hash of KEY.  VHASH must be
     either ‘vlist-null’ or a vhash returned by a previous call to
     ‘vhash-cons’.  HASH-PROC defaults to ‘hash’ (*note* ‘hash’
     procedure: Hash Table Reference.).  With ‘vhash-consq’, the ‘hashq’
     hash function is used; with ‘vhash-consv’ the ‘hashv’ hash function
     is used.

     All ‘vhash-cons’ calls made to construct a vhash should use the
     same HASH-PROC.  Failing to do that, the result is undefined.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-assoc key vhash [equal? [hash-proc]]
 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-assq key vhash
 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-assv key vhash
     Return the first key/value pair from VHASH whose key is equal to
     KEY according to the EQUAL? equality predicate (which defaults to
     ‘equal?’), and using HASH-PROC (which defaults to ‘hash’) to
     compute the hash of KEY.  The second form uses ‘eq?’ as the
     equality predicate and ‘hashq’ as the hash function; the last form
     uses ‘eqv?’ and ‘hashv’.

     Note that it is important to consistently use the same hash
     function for HASH-PROC as was passed to ‘vhash-cons’.  Failing to
     do that, the result is unpredictable.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-delete key vhash [equal? [hash-proc]]
 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-delq key vhash
 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-delv key vhash
     Remove all associations from VHASH with KEY, comparing keys with
     EQUAL? (which defaults to ‘equal?’), and computing the hash of KEY
     using HASH-PROC (which defaults to ‘hash’).  The second form uses
     ‘eq?’ as the equality predicate and ‘hashq’ as the hash function;
     the last one uses ‘eqv?’ and ‘hashv’.

     Again the choice of HASH-PROC must be consistent with previous
     calls to ‘vhash-cons’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-fold proc init vhash
 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-fold-right proc init vhash
     Fold over the key/value elements of VHASH in the given direction,
     with each call to PROC having the form ‘(PROC key value result)’,
     where RESULT is the result of the previous call to PROC and INIT
     the value of RESULT for the first call to PROC.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-fold* proc init key vhash [equal? [hash]]
 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-foldq* proc init key vhash
 -- Scheme Procedure: vhash-foldv* proc init key vhash
     Fold over all the values associated with KEY in VHASH, with each
     call to PROC having the form ‘(proc value result)’, where RESULT is
     the result of the previous call to PROC and INIT the value of
     RESULT for the first call to PROC.

     Keys in VHASH are hashed using HASH are compared using EQUAL?.  The
     second form uses ‘eq?’ as the equality predicate and ‘hashq’ as the
     hash function; the third one uses ‘eqv?’ and ‘hashv’.

     Example:

          (define vh
            (alist->vhash '((a . 1) (a . 2) (z . 0) (a . 3))))

          (vhash-fold* cons '() 'a vh)
          ⇒ (3 2 1)

          (vhash-fold* cons '() 'z vh)
          ⇒ (0)

 -- Scheme Procedure: alist->vhash alist [hash-proc]
     Return the vhash corresponding to ALIST, an association list, using
     HASH-PROC to compute key hashes.  When omitted, HASH-PROC defaults
     to ‘hash’.

6.6.22 Hash Tables
------------------

Hash tables are dictionaries which offer similar functionality as
association lists: They provide a mapping from keys to values.  The
difference is that association lists need time linear in the size of
elements when searching for entries, whereas hash tables can normally
search in constant time.  The drawback is that hash tables require a
little bit more memory, and that you can not use the normal list
procedures (*note* Lists::) for working with them.

File: guile.info,  Node: Hash Table Examples,  Next: Hash Table Reference,  Up: Hash Tables

### 6.6.22.1 Hash Table Examples
............................

For demonstration purposes, this section gives a few usage examples of
some hash table procedures, together with some explanation what they do.

   First we start by creating a new hash table with 31 slots, and
populate it with two key/value pairs.

     (define h (make-hash-table 31))

     ;; This is an opaque object
     h
     ⇒
     #<hash-table 0/31>

     ;; Inserting into a hash table can be done with hashq-set!
     (hashq-set! h 'foo "bar")
     ⇒
     "bar"

     (hashq-set! h 'braz "zonk")
     ⇒
     "zonk"

     ;; Or with hash-create-handle!
     (hashq-create-handle! h 'frob #f)
     ⇒
     (frob . #f)

   You can get the value for a given key with the procedure ‘hashq-ref’,
but the problem with this procedure is that you cannot reliably
determine whether a key does exists in the table.  The reason is that
the procedure returns ‘#f’ if the key is not in the table, but it will
return the same value if the key is in the table and just happens to
have the value ‘#f’, as you can see in the following examples.

     (hashq-ref h 'foo)
     ⇒
     "bar"

     (hashq-ref h 'frob)
     ⇒
     #f

     (hashq-ref h 'not-there)
     ⇒
     #f

   It is often better is to use the procedure ‘hashq-get-handle’, which
makes a distinction between the two cases.  Just like ‘assq’, this
procedure returns a key/value-pair on success, and ‘#f’ if the key is
not found.

     (hashq-get-handle h 'foo)
     ⇒
     (foo . "bar")

     (hashq-get-handle h 'not-there)
     ⇒
     #f

   Interesting results can be computed by using ‘hash-fold’ to work
through each element.  This example will count the total number of
elements:

     (hash-fold (lambda (key value seed) (+ 1 seed)) 0 h)
     ⇒
     3

   The same thing can be done with the procedure ‘hash-count’, which can
also count the number of elements matching a particular predicate.  For
example, count the number of elements with string values:

     (hash-count (lambda (key value) (string? value)) h)
     ⇒
     2

   Counting all the elements is a simple task using ‘const’:

     (hash-count (const #t) h)
     ⇒
     3

### 6.6.22.2 Hash Table Reference
.............................

Like the association list functions, the hash table functions come in
several varieties, according to the equality test used for the keys.
Plain ‘hash-’ functions use ‘equal?’, ‘hashq-’ functions use ‘eq?’,
‘hashv-’ functions use ‘eqv?’, and the ‘hashx-’ functions use an
application supplied test.

   A single ‘make-hash-table’ creates a hash table suitable for use with
any set of functions, but it’s imperative that just one set is then used
consistently, or results will be unpredictable.

   Hash tables are implemented as a vector indexed by a hash value
formed from the key, with an association list of key/value pairs for
each bucket in case distinct keys hash together.  Direct access to the
pairs in those lists is provided by the ‘-handle-’ functions.

   When the number of entries in a hash table goes above a threshold,
the vector is made larger and the entries are rehashed, to prevent the
bucket lists from becoming too long and slowing down accesses.  When the
number of entries goes below a threshold, the vector is shrunk to save
space.

   For the ‘hashx-’ “extended” routines, an application supplies a HASH
function producing an integer index like ‘hashq’ etc below, and an ASSOC
alist search function like ‘assq’ etc (*note* Retrieving Alist
Entries::).  Here’s an example of such functions implementing
case-insensitive hashing of string keys,

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-1)
                  (srfi srfi-13))

     (define (my-hash str size)
       (remainder (string-hash-ci str) size))
     (define (my-assoc str alist)
       (find (lambda (pair) (string-ci=? str (car pair))) alist))

     (define my-table (make-hash-table))
     (hashx-set! my-hash my-assoc my-table "foo" 123)

     (hashx-ref my-hash my-assoc my-table "FOO")
     ⇒ 123

   In a ‘hashx-’ HASH function the aim is to spread keys across the
vector, so bucket lists don’t become long.  But the actual values are
arbitrary as long as they’re in the range 0 to SIZE-1.  Helpful
functions for forming a hash value, in addition to ‘hashq’ etc below,
include ‘symbol-hash’ (*note* Symbol Keys::), ‘string-hash’ and
‘string-hash-ci’ (*note* String Comparison::), and ‘char-set-hash’ (*note*
Character Set Predicates/Comparison::).


 -- Scheme Procedure: make-hash-table [size]
     Create a new hash table object, with an optional minimum vector
     SIZE.

     When SIZE is given, the table vector will still grow and shrink
     automatically, as described above, but with SIZE as a minimum.  If
     an application knows roughly how many entries the table will hold
     then it can use SIZE to avoid rehashing when initial entries are
     added.

 -- Scheme Procedure: alist->hash-table alist
 -- Scheme Procedure: alist->hashq-table alist
 -- Scheme Procedure: alist->hashv-table alist
 -- Scheme Procedure: alist->hashx-table hash assoc alist
     Convert ALIST into a hash table.  When keys are repeated in ALIST,
     the leftmost association takes precedence.

          (use-modules (ice-9 hash-table))
          (alist->hash-table '((foo . 1) (bar . 2)))

     When converting to an extended hash table, custom HASH and ASSOC
     procedures must be provided.

          (alist->hashx-table hash assoc '((foo . 1) (bar . 2)))

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-table? obj
 -- C Function: scm_hash_table_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a abstract hash table object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-clear! table
 -- C Function: scm_hash_clear_x (table)
     Remove all items from TABLE (without triggering a resize).

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-ref table key [dflt]
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashq-ref table key [dflt]
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashv-ref table key [dflt]
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashx-ref hash assoc table key [dflt]
 -- C Function: scm_hash_ref (table, key, dflt)
 -- C Function: scm_hashq_ref (table, key, dflt)
 -- C Function: scm_hashv_ref (table, key, dflt)
 -- C Function: scm_hashx_ref (hash, assoc, table, key, dflt)
     Lookup KEY in the given hash TABLE, and return the associated
     value.  If KEY is not found, return DFLT, or ‘#f’ if DFLT is not
     given.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-set! table key val
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashq-set! table key val
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashv-set! table key val
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashx-set! hash assoc table key val
 -- C Function: scm_hash_set_x (table, key, val)
 -- C Function: scm_hashq_set_x (table, key, val)
 -- C Function: scm_hashv_set_x (table, key, val)
 -- C Function: scm_hashx_set_x (hash, assoc, table, key, val)
     Associate VAL with KEY in the given hash TABLE.  If KEY is already
     present then it’s associated value is changed.  If it’s not present
     then a new entry is created.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-remove! table key
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashq-remove! table key
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashv-remove! table key
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashx-remove! hash assoc table key
 -- C Function: scm_hash_remove_x (table, key)
 -- C Function: scm_hashq_remove_x (table, key)
 -- C Function: scm_hashv_remove_x (table, key)
 -- C Function: scm_hashx_remove_x (hash, assoc, table, key)
     Remove any association for KEY in the given hash TABLE.  If KEY is
     not in TABLE then nothing is done.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash key size
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashq key size
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashv key size
 -- C Function: scm_hash (key, size)
 -- C Function: scm_hashq (key, size)
 -- C Function: scm_hashv (key, size)
     Return a hash value for KEY.  This is a number in the range 0 to
     SIZE-1, which is suitable for use in a hash table of the given
     SIZE.

     Note that ‘hashq’ and ‘hashv’ may use internal addresses of
     objects, so if an object is garbage collected and re-created it can
     have a different hash value, even when the two are notionally
     ‘eq?’.  For instance with symbols,

          (hashq 'something 123)   ⇒ 19
          (gc)
          (hashq 'something 123)   ⇒ 62

     In normal use this is not a problem, since an object entered into a
     hash table won’t be garbage collected until removed.  It’s only if
     hashing calculations are somehow separated from normal references
     that its lifetime needs to be considered.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-get-handle table key
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashq-get-handle table key
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashv-get-handle table key
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashx-get-handle hash assoc table key
 -- C Function: scm_hash_get_handle (table, key)
 -- C Function: scm_hashq_get_handle (table, key)
 -- C Function: scm_hashv_get_handle (table, key)
 -- C Function: scm_hashx_get_handle (hash, assoc, table, key)
     Return the ‘(KEY . VALUE)’ pair for KEY in the given hash TABLE, or
     ‘#f’ if KEY is not in TABLE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-create-handle! table key init
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashq-create-handle! table key init
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashv-create-handle! table key init
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashx-create-handle! hash assoc table key init
 -- C Function: scm_hash_create_handle_x (table, key, init)
 -- C Function: scm_hashq_create_handle_x (table, key, init)
 -- C Function: scm_hashv_create_handle_x (table, key, init)
 -- C Function: scm_hashx_create_handle_x (hash, assoc, table, key,
          init)
     Return the ‘(KEY . VALUE)’ pair for KEY in the given hash TABLE.
     If KEY is not in TABLE then create an entry for it with INIT as the
     value, and return that pair.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-map->list proc table
 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-for-each proc table
 -- C Function: scm_hash_map_to_list (proc, table)
 -- C Function: scm_hash_for_each (proc, table)
     Apply PROC to the entries in the given hash TABLE.  Each call is
     ‘(PROC KEY VALUE)’.  ‘hash-map->list’ returns a list of the results
     from these calls, ‘hash-for-each’ discards the results and returns
     an unspecified value.

     Calls are made over the table entries in an unspecified order, and
     for ‘hash-map->list’ the order of the values in the returned list
     is unspecified.  Results will be unpredictable if TABLE is modified
     while iterating.

     For example the following returns a new alist comprising all the
     entries from ‘mytable’, in no particular order.

          (hash-map->list cons mytable)

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-for-each-handle proc table
 -- C Function: scm_hash_for_each_handle (proc, table)
     Apply PROC to the entries in the given hash TABLE.  Each call is
     ‘(PROC HANDLE)’, where HANDLE is a ‘(KEY . VALUE)’ pair.  Return an
     unspecified value.

     ‘hash-for-each-handle’ differs from ‘hash-for-each’ only in the
     argument list of PROC.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-fold proc init table
 -- C Function: scm_hash_fold (proc, init, table)
     Accumulate a result by applying PROC to the elements of the given
     hash TABLE.  Each call is ‘(PROC KEY VALUE PRIOR-RESULT)’, where
     KEY and VALUE are from the TABLE and PRIOR-RESULT is the return
     from the previous PROC call.  For the first call, PRIOR-RESULT is
     the given INIT value.

     Calls are made over the table entries in an unspecified order.
     Results will be unpredictable if TABLE is modified while
     ‘hash-fold’ is running.

     For example, the following returns a count of how many keys in
     ‘mytable’ are strings.

          (hash-fold (lambda (key value prior)
                       (if (string? key) (1+ prior) prior))
                     0 mytable)

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-count pred table
 -- C Function: scm_hash_count (pred, table)
     Return the number of elements in the given hash TABLE that cause
     ‘(PRED KEY VALUE)’ to return true.  To quickly determine the total
     number of elements, use ‘(const #t)’ for PRED.

6.7.1 Lambda: Basic Procedure Creation
--------------------------------------

A ‘lambda’ expression evaluates to a procedure.  The environment which
is in effect when a ‘lambda’ expression is evaluated is enclosed in the
newly created procedure, this is referred to as a “closure” (*note* About
Closure::).

   When a procedure created by ‘lambda’ is called with some actual
arguments, the environment enclosed in the procedure is extended by
binding the variables named in the formal argument list to new locations
and storing the actual arguments into these locations.  Then the body of
the ‘lambda’ expression is evaluated sequentially.  The result of the
last expression in the procedure body is then the result of the
procedure invocation.

   The following examples will show how procedures can be created using
‘lambda’, and what you can do with these procedures.

     (lambda (x) (+ x x))       ⇒ a procedure
     ((lambda (x) (+ x x)) 4)   ⇒ 8

   The fact that the environment in effect when creating a procedure is
enclosed in the procedure is shown with this example:

     (define add4
       (let ((x 4))
         (lambda (y) (+ x y))))
     (add4 6)                   ⇒ 10

 -- syntax: lambda formals body
     FORMALS should be a formal argument list as described in the
     following table.

     ‘(VARIABLE1 ...)’
          The procedure takes a fixed number of arguments; when the
          procedure is called, the arguments will be stored into the
          newly created location for the formal variables.
     ‘VARIABLE’
          The procedure takes any number of arguments; when the
          procedure is called, the sequence of actual arguments will be
          converted into a list and stored into the newly created
          location for the formal variable.
     ‘(VARIABLE1 ... VARIABLEN . VARIABLEN+1)’
          If a space-delimited period precedes the last variable, then
          the procedure takes N or more variables where N is the number
          of formal arguments before the period.  There must be at least
          one argument before the period.  The first N actual arguments
          will be stored into the newly allocated locations for the
          first N formal arguments and the sequence of the remaining
          actual arguments is converted into a list and the stored into
          the location for the last formal argument.  If there are
          exactly N actual arguments, the empty list is stored into the
          location of the last formal argument.

     The list in VARIABLE or VARIABLEN+1 is always newly created and the
     procedure can modify it if desired.  This is the case even when the
     procedure is invoked via ‘apply’, the required part of the list
     argument there will be copied (*note* Procedures for On the Fly
     Evaluation: Fly Evaluation.).

     BODY is a sequence of Scheme expressions which are evaluated in
     order when the procedure is invoked.

6.7.2 Primitive Procedures
--------------------------

Procedures written in C can be registered for use from Scheme, provided
they take only arguments of type ‘SCM’ and return ‘SCM’ values.
‘scm_c_define_gsubr’ is likely to be the most useful mechanism,
combining the process of registration (‘scm_c_make_gsubr’) and
definition (‘scm_define’).

 -- Function: SCM scm_c_make_gsubr (const char *name, int req, int opt,
          int rst, fcn)
     Register a C procedure FCN as a “subr” — a primitive subroutine
     that can be called from Scheme.  It will be associated with the
     given NAME but no environment binding will be created.  The
     arguments REQ, OPT and RST specify the number of required, optional
     and “rest” arguments respectively.  The total number of these
     arguments should match the actual number of arguments to FCN, but
     may not exceed 10.  The number of rest arguments should be 0 or 1.
     ‘scm_c_make_gsubr’ returns a value of type ‘SCM’ which is a
     “handle” for the procedure.

 -- Function: SCM scm_c_define_gsubr (const char *name, int req, int
          opt, int rst, fcn)
     Register a C procedure FCN, as for ‘scm_c_make_gsubr’ above, and
     additionally create a top-level Scheme binding for the procedure in
     the “current environment” using ‘scm_define’.  ‘scm_c_define_gsubr’
     returns a handle for the procedure in the same way as
     ‘scm_c_make_gsubr’, which is usually not further required.


File: guile.info,  Node: Compiled Procedures,  Next: Optional Arguments,  Prev: Primitive Procedures,  Up: Procedures

6.7.3 Compiled Procedures
-------------------------

The evaluation strategy given in *note* Lambda:: describes how procedures
are “interpreted”.  Interpretation operates directly on expanded Scheme
source code, recursively calling the evaluator to obtain the value of
nested expressions.

   Most procedures are compiled, however.  This means that Guile has
done some pre-computation on the procedure, to determine what it will
need to do each time the procedure runs.  Compiled procedures run faster
than interpreted procedures.

   Loading files is the normal way that compiled procedures come to
being.  If Guile sees that a file is uncompiled, or that its compiled
file is out of date, it will attempt to compile the file when it is
loaded, and save the result to disk.  Procedures can be compiled at
runtime as well.  *Note* Read/Load/Eval/Compile::, for more information
on runtime compilation.

   Compiled procedures, also known as “programs”, respond to all
procedures that operate on procedures: you can pass a program to
‘procedure?’, ‘procedure-name’, and so on (*note* Procedure
Properties::).  In addition, there are a few more accessors for
low-level details on programs.

   Most people won’t need to use the routines described in this section,
but it’s good to have them documented.  You’ll have to include the
appropriate module first, though:

     (use-modules (system vm program))

 -- Scheme Procedure: program? obj
 -- C Function: scm_program_p (obj)
     Returns ‘#t’ if OBJ is a compiled procedure, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: program-code program
 -- C Function: scm_program_code (program)
     Returns the address of the program’s entry, as an integer.  This
     address is mostly useful to procedures in ‘(system vm debug)’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: program-num-free-variable program
 -- C Function: scm_program_num_free_variables (program)
     Return the number of free variables captured by this program.

 -- Scheme Procedure: program-free-variable-ref program n
 -- C Function: scm_program_free_variable-ref (program, n)
 -- Scheme Procedure: program-free-variable-set! program n val
 -- C Function: scm_program_free_variable_set_x (program, n, val)
     Accessors for a program’s free variables.  Some of the values
     captured are actually in variable “boxes”.  *Note* Variables and the
     VM::, for more information.

     Users must not modify the returned value unless they think they’re
     really clever.

 -- Scheme Procedure: program-bindings program
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-binding name boxed? index start end
 -- Scheme Procedure: binding:name binding
 -- Scheme Procedure: binding:boxed? binding
 -- Scheme Procedure: binding:index binding
 -- Scheme Procedure: binding:start binding
 -- Scheme Procedure: binding:end binding
     Bindings annotations for programs, along with their accessors.

     Bindings declare names and liveness extents for block-local
     variables.  The best way to see what these are is to play around
     with them at a REPL. *Note* VM Concepts::, for more information.

     Note that bindings information is stored in a program as part of
     its metadata thunk, so including it in the generated object code
     does not impose a runtime performance penalty.

 -- Scheme Procedure: program-sources program
 -- Scheme Procedure: source:addr source
 -- Scheme Procedure: source:line source
 -- Scheme Procedure: source:column source
 -- Scheme Procedure: source:file source
     Source location annotations for programs, along with their
     accessors.

     Source location information propagates through the compiler and
     ends up being serialized to the program’s metadata.  This
     information is keyed by the offset of the instruction pointer
     within the object code of the program.  Specifically, it is keyed
     on the ‘ip’ _just following_ an instruction, so that backtraces can
     find the source location of a call that is in progress.

 -- Scheme Procedure: program-arities program
 -- C Function: scm_program_arities (program)
 -- Scheme Procedure: program-arity program ip
 -- Scheme Procedure: arity:start arity
 -- Scheme Procedure: arity:end arity
 -- Scheme Procedure: arity:nreq arity
 -- Scheme Procedure: arity:nopt arity
 -- Scheme Procedure: arity:rest? arity
 -- Scheme Procedure: arity:kw arity
 -- Scheme Procedure: arity:allow-other-keys? arity
     Accessors for a representation of the “arity” of a program.

     The normal case is that a procedure has one arity.  For example,
     ‘(lambda (x) x)’, takes one required argument, and that’s it.  One
     could access that number of required arguments via ‘(arity:nreq
     (program-arities (lambda (x) x)))’.  Similarly, ‘arity:nopt’ gets
     the number of optional arguments, and ‘arity:rest?’ returns a true
     value if the procedure has a rest arg.

     ‘arity:kw’ returns a list of ‘(KW . IDX)’ pairs, if the procedure
     has keyword arguments.  The IDX refers to the IDXth local variable;
     *Note* Variables and the VM::, for more information.  Finally
     ‘arity:allow-other-keys?’ returns a true value if other keys are
     allowed.  *Note* Optional Arguments::, for more information.

     So what about ‘arity:start’ and ‘arity:end’, then?  They return the
     range of bytes in the program’s bytecode for which a given arity is
     valid.  You see, a procedure can actually have more than one arity.
     The question, “what is a procedure’s arity” only really makes sense
     at certain points in the program, delimited by these ‘arity:start’
     and ‘arity:end’ values.

 -- Scheme Procedure: program-arguments-alist program [ip]
     Return an association list describing the arguments that PROGRAM
     accepts, or ‘#f’ if the information cannot be obtained.

     The alist keys that are currently defined are ‘required’,
     ‘optional’, ‘keyword’, ‘allow-other-keys?’, and ‘rest’.  For
     example:

          (program-arguments-alist
           (lambda* (a b #:optional c #:key (d 1) #:rest e)
             #t)) ⇒
          ((required . (a b))
           (optional . (c))
           (keyword . ((#:d . 4)))
           (allow-other-keys? . #f)
           (rest . d))

 -- Scheme Procedure: program-lambda-list program [ip]
     Return a representation of the arguments of PROGRAM as a lambda
     list, or ‘#f’ if this information is not available.

     For example:

          (program-lambda-list
           (lambda* (a b #:optional c #:key (d 1) #:rest e)
             #t)) ⇒

6.7.4 Optional Arguments
------------------------

Scheme procedures, as defined in R5RS, can either handle a fixed number
of actual arguments, or a fixed number of actual arguments followed by
arbitrarily many additional arguments.  Writing procedures of variable
arity can be useful, but unfortunately, the syntactic means for handling
argument lists of varying length is a bit inconvenient.  It is possible
to give names to the fixed number of arguments, but the remaining
(optional) arguments can be only referenced as a list of values (*note*
Lambda::).

   For this reason, Guile provides an extension to ‘lambda’, ‘lambda*’,
which allows the user to define procedures with optional and keyword
arguments.  In addition, Guile’s virtual machine has low-level support
for optional and keyword argument dispatch.  Calls to procedures with
optional and keyword arguments can be made cheaply, without allocating a
rest list.

* Menu:

* lambda* and define*::         Creating advanced argument handling procedures.
* ice-9 optargs::               (ice-9 optargs) provides some utilities.


File: guile.info,  Node: lambda* and define*,  Next: ice-9 optargs,  Up: Optional Arguments

### 6.7.4.1 lambda* and define*.
............................

‘lambda*’ is like ‘lambda’, except with some extensions to allow
optional and keyword arguments.

 -- library syntax: lambda* ([var...]
          [#:optional vardef...]
          [#:key vardef... [#:allow-other-keys]]
          [#:rest var | . var])
          body1 body2 ...

     Create a procedure which takes optional and/or keyword arguments
     specified with ‘#:optional’ and ‘#:key’.  For example,

          (lambda* (a b #:optional c d . e) '())

     is a procedure with fixed arguments A and B, optional arguments C
     and D, and rest argument E.  If the optional arguments are omitted
     in a call, the variables for them are bound to ‘#f’.

     Likewise, ‘define*’ is syntactic sugar for defining procedures
     using ‘lambda*’.

     ‘lambda*’ can also make procedures with keyword arguments.  For
     example, a procedure defined like this:

          (define* (sir-yes-sir #:key action how-high)
            (list action how-high))

     can be called as ‘(sir-yes-sir #:action 'jump)’, ‘(sir-yes-sir
     #:how-high 13)’, ‘(sir-yes-sir #:action 'lay-down #:how-high 0)’,
     or just ‘(sir-yes-sir)’.  Whichever arguments are given as keywords
     are bound to values (and those not given are ‘#f’).

     Optional and keyword arguments can also have default values to take
     when not present in a call, by giving a two-element list of
     variable name and expression.  For example in

          (define* (frob foo #:optional (bar 42) #:key (baz 73))
            (list foo bar baz))

     FOO is a fixed argument, BAR is an optional argument with default
     value 42, and baz is a keyword argument with default value 73.
     Default value expressions are not evaluated unless they are needed,
     and until the procedure is called.

     Normally it’s an error if a call has keywords other than those
     specified by ‘#:key’, but adding ‘#:allow-other-keys’ to the
     definition (after the keyword argument declarations) will ignore
     unknown keywords.

     If a call has a keyword given twice, the last value is used.  For
     example,

          (define* (flips #:key (heads 0) (tails 0))
            (display (list heads tails)))

          (flips #:heads 37 #:tails 42 #:heads 99)
          ⊣ (99 42)

     ‘#:rest’ is a synonym for the dotted syntax rest argument.  The
     argument lists ‘(a . b)’ and ‘(a #:rest b)’ are equivalent in all
     respects.  This is provided for more similarity to DSSSL,
     MIT-Scheme and Kawa among others, as well as for refugees from
     other Lisp dialects.

     When ‘#:key’ is used together with a rest argument, the keyword
     parameters in a call all remain in the rest list.  This is the same
     as Common Lisp.  For example,

          ((lambda* (#:key (x 0) #:allow-other-keys #:rest r)
             (display r))
           #:x 123 #:y 456)
          ⊣ (#:x 123 #:y 456)

     ‘#:optional’ and ‘#:key’ establish their bindings successively,
     from left to right.  This means default expressions can refer back
     to prior parameters, for example

          (lambda* (start #:optional (end (+ 10 start)))
            (do ((i start (1+ i)))
                ((> i end))
              (display i)))

     The exception to this left-to-right scoping rule is the rest
     argument.  If there is a rest argument, it is bound after the
     optional arguments, but before the keyword arguments.

### 6.7.4.2 (ice-9 optargs)
.......................

Before Guile 2.0, ‘lambda*’ and ‘define*’ were implemented using macros
that processed rest list arguments.  This was not optimal, as calling
procedures with optional arguments had to allocate rest lists at every
procedure invocation.  Guile 2.0 improved this situation by bringing
optional and keyword arguments into Guile’s core.

   However there are occasions in which you have a list and want to
parse it for optional or keyword arguments.  Guile’s ‘(ice-9 optargs)’
provides some macros to help with that task.

   The syntax ‘let-optional’ and ‘let-optional*’ are for destructuring
rest argument lists and giving names to the various list elements.
‘let-optional’ binds all variables simultaneously, while ‘let-optional*’
binds them sequentially, consistent with ‘let’ and ‘let*’ (*note* Local
Bindings::).

 -- library syntax: let-optional rest-arg (binding ...) body1 body2 ...
 -- library syntax: let-optional* rest-arg (binding ...) body1 body2 ...
     These two macros give you an optional argument interface that is
     very “Schemey” and introduces no fancy syntax.  They are compatible
     with the scsh macros of the same name, but are slightly extended.
     Each of BINDING may be of one of the forms VAR or ‘(VAR
     DEFAULT-VALUE)’.  REST-ARG should be the rest-argument of the
     procedures these are used from.  The items in REST-ARG are
     sequentially bound to the variable names are given.  When REST-ARG
     runs out, the remaining vars are bound either to the default values
     or ‘#f’ if no default value was specified.  REST-ARG remains bound
     to whatever may have been left of REST-ARG.

     After binding the variables, the expressions BODY1 BODY2 ... are
     evaluated in order.

   Similarly, ‘let-keywords’ and ‘let-keywords*’ extract values from
keyword style argument lists, binding local variables to those values or
to defaults.

 -- library syntax: let-keywords args allow-other-keys? (binding ...)
          body1 body2 ...
 -- library syntax: let-keywords* args allow-other-keys? (binding ...)
          body1 body2 ...
     ARGS is evaluated and should give a list of the form ‘(#:keyword1
     value1 #:keyword2 value2 ...)’.  The BINDINGs are variables and
     default expressions, with the variables to be set (by name) from
     the keyword values.  The BODY1 BODY2 ... forms are then evaluated
     and the last is the result.  An example will make the syntax
     clearest,

          (define args '(#:xyzzy "hello" #:foo "world"))

          (let-keywords args #t
                ((foo  "default for foo")
                 (bar  (string-append "default" "for" "bar")))
            (display foo)
            (display ", ")
            (display bar))
          ⊣ world, defaultforbar

     The binding for ‘foo’ comes from the ‘#:foo’ keyword in ‘args’.
     But the binding for ‘bar’ is the default in the ‘let-keywords’,
     since there’s no ‘#:bar’ in the args.

     ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS? is evaluated and controls whether unknown
     keywords are allowed in the ARGS list.  When true other keys are
     ignored (such as ‘#:xyzzy’ in the example), when ‘#f’ an error is
     thrown for anything unknown.

   ‘(ice-9 optargs)’ also provides some more ‘define*’ sugar, which is
not so useful with modern Guile coding, but still supported:
‘define*-public’ is the ‘lambda*’ version of ‘define-public’;
‘defmacro*’ and ‘defmacro*-public’ exist for defining macros with the
improved argument list handling possibilities.  The ‘-public’ versions
not only define the procedures/macros, but also export them from the
current module.

 -- library syntax: define*-public formals body1 body2 ...
     Like a mix of ‘define*’ and ‘define-public’.

 -- library syntax: defmacro* name formals body1 body2 ...
 -- library syntax: defmacro*-public name formals body1 body2 ...
     These are just like ‘defmacro’ and ‘defmacro-public’ except that
     they take ‘lambda*’-style extended parameter lists, where
     ‘#:optional’, ‘#:key’, ‘#:allow-other-keys’ and ‘#:rest’ are
     allowed with the usual semantics.  Here is an example of a macro
     with an optional argument:

          (defmacro* transmogrify (a #:optional b)
            (a 1))

6.7.5 Case-lambda
-----------------

R5RS’s rest arguments are indeed useful and very general, but they often
aren’t the most appropriate or efficient means to get the job done.  For
example, ‘lambda*’ is a much better solution to the optional argument
problem than ‘lambda’ with rest arguments.

   Likewise, ‘case-lambda’ works well for when you want one procedure to
do double duty (or triple, or ...), without the penalty of consing a
rest list.

   For example:

     (define (make-accum n)
       (case-lambda
         (() n)
         ((m) (set! n (+ n m)) n)))

     (define a (make-accum 20))
     (a) ⇒ 20
     (a 10) ⇒ 30
     (a) ⇒ 30

   The value returned by a ‘case-lambda’ form is a procedure which
matches the number of actual arguments against the formals in the
various clauses, in order.  The first matching clause is selected, the
corresponding values from the actual parameter list are bound to the
variable names in the clauses and the body of the clause is evaluated.
If no clause matches, an error is signalled.

   The syntax of the ‘case-lambda’ form is defined in the following EBNF
grammar.  “Formals” means a formal argument list just like with ‘lambda’
(*note* Lambda::).

     <case-lambda>
        --> (case-lambda <case-lambda-clause>*)
        --> (case-lambda <docstring> <case-lambda-clause>*)
     <case-lambda-clause>
        --> (<formals> <definition-or-command>*)
     <formals>
        --> (<identifier>*)
          | (<identifier>* . <identifier>)
          | <identifier>

   Rest lists can be useful with ‘case-lambda’:

     (define plus
       (case-lambda
         "Return the sum of all arguments."
         (() 0)
         ((a) a)
         ((a b) (+ a b))
         ((a b . rest) (apply plus (+ a b) rest))))
     (plus 1 2 3) ⇒ 6

   Also, for completeness.  Guile defines ‘case-lambda*’ as well, which
is like ‘case-lambda’, except with ‘lambda*’ clauses.  A ‘case-lambda*’
clause matches if the arguments fill the required arguments, but are not
too many for the optional and/or rest arguments.

   Keyword arguments are possible with ‘case-lambda*’ as well, but they
do not contribute to the “matching” behavior, and their interactions
with required, optional, and rest arguments can be surprising.

   For the purposes of ‘case-lambda*’ (and of ‘case-lambda’, as a
special case), a clause “matches” if it has enough required arguments,
and not too many positional arguments.  The required arguments are any
arguments before the ‘#:optional’, ‘#:key’, and ‘#:rest’ arguments.
“Positional” arguments are the required arguments, together with the
optional arguments.

   In the absence of ‘#:key’ or ‘#:rest’ arguments, it’s easy to see how
there could be too many positional arguments: you pass 5 arguments to a
function that only takes 4 arguments, including optional arguments.  If
there is a ‘#:rest’ argument, there can never be too many positional
arguments: any application with enough required arguments for a clause
will match that clause, even if there are also ‘#:key’ arguments.

   Otherwise, for applications to a clause with ‘#:key’ arguments (and
without a ‘#:rest’ argument), a clause will match there only if there
are enough required arguments and if the next argument after binding
required and optional arguments, if any, is a keyword.  For efficiency
reasons, Guile is currently unable to include keyword arguments in the
matching algorithm.  Clauses match on positional arguments only, not by
comparing a given keyword to the available set of keyword arguments that
a function has.

   Some examples follow.

     (define f
       (case-lambda*
         ((a #:optional b) 'clause-1)
         ((a #:optional b #:key c) 'clause-2)
         ((a #:key d) 'clause-3)
         ((#:key e #:rest f) 'clause-4)))

     (f) ⇒ clause-4
     (f 1) ⇒ clause-1
     (f) ⇒ clause-4
     (f #:e 10) clause-1
     (f 1 #:foo) clause-1
     (f 1 #:c 2) clause-2
     (f #:a #:b #:c #:d #:e) clause-4

     ;; clause-2 will match anything that clause-3 would match.
     (f 1 #:d 2) ⇒ error: bad keyword args in clause 2

   Don’t forget that the clauses are matched in order, and the first
matching clause will be taken.  This can result in a keyword being bound
to a required argument, as in the case of ‘f #:e 10’.

6.7.6 Higher-Order Functions
----------------------------

As a functional programming language, Scheme allows the definition of
“higher-order functions”, i.e., functions that take functions as
arguments and/or return functions.  Utilities to derive procedures from
other procedures are provided and described below.

 -- Scheme Procedure: const value
     Return a procedure that accepts any number of arguments and returns
     VALUE.

          (procedure? (const 3))        ⇒ #t
          ((const 'hello))              ⇒ hello
          ((const 'hello) 'world)       ⇒ hello

 -- Scheme Procedure: negate proc
     Return a procedure with the same arity as PROC that returns the
     ‘not’ of PROC’s result.

          (procedure? (negate number?)) ⇒ #t
          ((negate odd?) 2)             ⇒ #t
          ((negate real?) 'dream)       ⇒ #t
          ((negate string-prefix?) "GNU" "GNU Guile")
                                        ⇒ #f
          (filter (negate number?) '(a 2 "b"))
                                        ⇒ (a "b")

 -- Scheme Procedure: compose proc1 proc2 ...
     Compose PROC1 with the procedures PROC2 ... such that the last PROC
     argument is applied first and PROC1 last, and return the resulting
     procedure.  The given procedures must have compatible arity.

          (procedure? (compose 1+ 1-)) ⇒ #t
          ((compose sqrt 1+ 1+) 2)     ⇒ 2.0
          ((compose 1+ sqrt) 3)        ⇒ 2.73205080756888
          (eq? (compose 1+) 1+)        ⇒ #t

          ((compose zip unzip2) '((1 2) (a b)))
                                       ⇒ ((1 2) (a b))

 -- Scheme Procedure: identity x
     Return X.

 -- Scheme Procedure: and=> value proc
     When VALUE is ‘#f’, return ‘#f’.  Otherwise, return ‘(PROC VALUE)’.

6.7.7 Procedure Properties and Meta-information
-----------------------------------------------

In addition to the information that is strictly necessary to run,
procedures may have other associated information.  For example, the name
of a procedure is information not for the procedure, but about the
procedure.  This meta-information can be accessed via the procedure
properties interface.

   The first group of procedures in this meta-interface are predicates
to test whether a Scheme object is a procedure, or a special procedure,
respectively.  ‘procedure?’ is the most general predicates, it returns
‘#t’ for any kind of procedure.

 -- Scheme Procedure: procedure? obj
 -- C Function: scm_procedure_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a procedure.

 -- Scheme Procedure: thunk? obj
 -- C Function: scm_thunk_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a procedure that can be called with zero
     arguments.

   Procedure properties are general properties associated with
procedures.  These can be the name of a procedure or other relevant
information, such as debug hints.

 -- Scheme Procedure: procedure-name proc
 -- C Function: scm_procedure_name (proc)
     Return the name of the procedure PROC

 -- Scheme Procedure: procedure-source proc
 -- C Function: scm_procedure_source (proc)
     Return the source of the procedure PROC.  Returns ‘#f’ if the
     source code is not available.

 -- Scheme Procedure: procedure-properties proc
 -- C Function: scm_procedure_properties (proc)
     Return the properties associated with PROC, as an association list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: procedure-property proc key
 -- C Function: scm_procedure_property (proc, key)
     Return the property of PROC with name KEY.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-procedure-properties! proc alist
 -- C Function: scm_set_procedure_properties_x (proc, alist)
     Set PROC’s property list to ALIST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-procedure-property! proc key value
 -- C Function: scm_set_procedure_property_x (proc, key, value)
     In PROC’s property list, set the property named KEY to VALUE.

   Documentation for a procedure can be accessed with the procedure
‘procedure-documentation’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: procedure-documentation proc
 -- C Function: scm_procedure_documentation (proc)
     Return the documentation string associated with ‘proc’.  By
     convention, if a procedure contains more than one expression and
     the first expression is a string constant, that string is assumed
     to contain documentation for that procedure.

6.7.8 Procedures with Setters
-----------------------------

A “procedure with setter” is a special kind of procedure which normally
behaves like any accessor procedure, that is a procedure which accesses
a data structure.  The difference is that this kind of procedure has a
so-called “setter” attached, which is a procedure for storing something
into a data structure.

   Procedures with setters are treated specially when the procedure
appears in the special form ‘set!’.  How it works is best shown by
example.

   Suppose we have a procedure called ‘foo-ref’, which accepts two
arguments, a value of type ‘foo’ and an integer.  The procedure returns
the value stored at the given index in the ‘foo’ object.  Let ‘f’ be a
variable containing such a ‘foo’ data structure.(1)

     (foo-ref f 0)       ⇒ bar
     (foo-ref f 1)       ⇒ braz

   Also suppose that a corresponding setter procedure called ‘foo-set!’
does exist.

     (foo-set! f 0 'bla)
     (foo-ref f 0)       ⇒ bla

   Now we could create a new procedure called ‘foo’, which is a
procedure with setter, by calling ‘make-procedure-with-setter’ with the
accessor and setter procedures ‘foo-ref’ and ‘foo-set!’.  Let us call
this new procedure ‘foo’.

     (define foo (make-procedure-with-setter foo-ref foo-set!))

   ‘foo’ can from now on be used to either read from the data structure
stored in ‘f’, or to write into the structure.

     (set! (foo f 0) 'dum)
     (foo f 0)          ⇒ dum

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-procedure-with-setter procedure setter
 -- C Function: scm_make_procedure_with_setter (procedure, setter)
     Create a new procedure which behaves like PROCEDURE, but with the
     associated setter SETTER.

 -- Scheme Procedure: procedure-with-setter? obj
 -- C Function: scm_procedure_with_setter_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a procedure with an associated setter
     procedure.

 -- Scheme Procedure: procedure proc
 -- C Function: scm_procedure (proc)
     Return the procedure of PROC, which must be an applicable struct.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setter proc
     Return the setter of PROC, which must be either a procedure with
     setter or an operator struct.

File: guile.info,  Node: Inlinable Procedures,  Prev: Procedures with Setters,  Up: Procedures

6.7.9 Inlinable Procedures
--------------------------

You can define an “inlinable procedure” by using ‘define-inlinable’
instead of ‘define’.  An inlinable procedure behaves the same as a
regular procedure, but direct calls will result in the procedure body
being inlined into the caller.

   Bear in mind that starting from version 2.0.3, Guile has a partial
evaluator that can inline the body of inner procedures when deemed
appropriate:

     scheme@(guile-user)> ,optimize (define (foo x)
                                      (define (bar) (+ x 3))
                                      (* (bar) 2))
     $1 = (define foo
            (lambda (#{x 94}#) (* (+ #{x 94}# 3) 2)))

The partial evaluator does not inline top-level bindings, though, so
this is a situation where you may find it interesting to use
‘define-inlinable’.

   Procedures defined with ‘define-inlinable’ are _always_ inlined, at
all direct call sites.  This eliminates function call overhead at the
expense of an increase in code size.  Additionally, the caller will not
transparently use the new definition if the inline procedure is
redefined.  It is not possible to trace an inlined procedures or install
a breakpoint in it (*note* Traps::).  For these reasons, you should not
make a procedure inlinable unless it demonstrably improves performance
in a crucial way.

   In general, only small procedures should be considered for inlining,
as making large procedures inlinable will probably result in an increase
in code size.  Additionally, the elimination of the call overhead rarely
matters for large procedures.

 -- Scheme Syntax: define-inlinable (name parameter ...) body1 body2 ...
     Define NAME as a procedure with parameters PARAMETERs and bodies
     BODY1, BODY2, ....

6.8 Macros
==========

At its best, programming in Lisp is an iterative process of building up
a language appropriate to the problem at hand, and then solving the
problem in that language.  Defining new procedures is part of that, but
Lisp also allows the user to extend its syntax, with its famous
“macros”.

   Macros are syntactic extensions which cause the expression that they
appear in to be transformed in some way _before_ being evaluated.  In
expressions that are intended for macro transformation, the identifier
that names the relevant macro must appear as the first element, like
this:

     (MACRO-NAME MACRO-ARGS ...)

   Macro expansion is a separate phase of evaluation, run before code is
interpreted or compiled.  A macro is a program that runs on programs,
translating an embedded language into core Scheme(1).

File: guile.info,  Node: Defining Macros,  Next: Syntax Rules,  Up: Macros

6.8.1 Defining Macros
---------------------

A macro is a binding between a keyword and a syntax transformer.  Since
it’s difficult to discuss ‘define-syntax’ without discussing the format
of transformers, consider the following example macro definition:

     (define-syntax when
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((when condition exp ...)
          (if condition
              (begin exp ...)))))

     (when #t
       (display "hey ho\n")
       (display "let's go\n"))
     ⊣ hey ho
     ⊣ let's go

   In this example, the ‘when’ binding is bound with ‘define-syntax’.
Syntax transformers are discussed in more depth in *note* Syntax Rules::
and *note* Syntax Case::.

 -- Syntax: define-syntax keyword transformer
     Bind KEYWORD to the syntax transformer obtained by evaluating
     TRANSFORMER.

     After a macro has been defined, further instances of KEYWORD in
     Scheme source code will invoke the syntax transformer defined by
     TRANSFORMER.

   One can also establish local syntactic bindings with ‘let-syntax’.

 -- Syntax: let-syntax ((keyword transformer) ...) exp1 exp2 ...
     Bind each KEYWORD to its corresponding TRANSFORMER while expanding
     EXP1 EXP2 ....

     A ‘let-syntax’ binding only exists at expansion-time.

          (let-syntax ((unless
                        (syntax-rules ()
                          ((unless condition exp ...)
                           (if (not condition)
                               (begin exp ...))))))
            (unless #t
              (primitive-exit 1))
            "rock rock rock")
          ⇒ "rock rock rock"

   A ‘define-syntax’ form is valid anywhere a definition may appear: at
the top-level, or locally.  Just as a local ‘define’ expands out to an
instance of ‘letrec’, a local ‘define-syntax’ expands out to
‘letrec-syntax’.

 -- Syntax: letrec-syntax ((keyword transformer) ...) exp1 exp2 ...
     Bind each KEYWORD to its corresponding TRANSFORMER while expanding
     EXP1 EXP2 ....

     In the spirit of ‘letrec’ versus ‘let’, an expansion produced by
     TRANSFORMER may reference a KEYWORD bound by the same
     LETREC-SYNTAX.

          (letrec-syntax ((my-or
                           (syntax-rules ()
                             ((my-or)
                              #t)
                             ((my-or exp)
                              exp)
                             ((my-or exp rest ...)
                              (let ((t exp))

6.8.2 Syntax-rules Macros
-------------------------

‘syntax-rules’ macros are simple, pattern-driven syntax transformers,
with a beauty worthy of Scheme.

 -- Syntax: syntax-rules literals (pattern template) ...
     Create a syntax transformer that will rewrite an expression using
     the rules embodied in the PATTERN and TEMPLATE clauses.

   A ‘syntax-rules’ macro consists of three parts: the literals (if
any), the patterns, and as many templates as there are patterns.

   When the syntax expander sees the invocation of a ‘syntax-rules’
macro, it matches the expression against the patterns, in order, and
rewrites the expression using the template from the first matching
pattern.  If no pattern matches, a syntax error is signalled.

### 6.8.2.1 Patterns
................

We have already seen some examples of patterns in the previous section:
‘(unless condition exp ...)’, ‘(my-or exp)’, and so on.  A pattern is
structured like the expression that it is to match.  It can have nested
structure as well, like ‘(let ((var val) ...) exp exp* ...)’.  Broadly
speaking, patterns are made of lists, improper lists, vectors,
identifiers, and datums.  Users can match a sequence of patterns using
the ellipsis (‘...’).

   Identifiers in a pattern are called “literals” if they are present in
the ‘syntax-rules’ literals list, and “pattern variables” otherwise.
When building up the macro output, the expander replaces instances of a
pattern variable in the template with the matched subexpression.

     (define-syntax kwote
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((kwote exp)
          (quote exp))))
     (kwote (foo . bar))
     ⇒ (foo . bar)

   An improper list of patterns matches as rest arguments do:

     (define-syntax let1
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((_ (var val) . exps)
          (let ((var val)) . exps))))

   However this definition of ‘let1’ probably isn’t what you want, as
the tail pattern EXPS will match non-lists, like ‘(let1 (foo 'bar) .
baz)’.  So often instead of using improper lists as patterns, ellipsized
patterns are better.  Instances of a pattern variable in the template
must be followed by an ellipsis.

     (define-syntax let1
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((_ (var val) exp ...)
          (let ((var val)) exp ...))))

   This ‘let1’ probably still doesn’t do what we want, because the body
matches sequences of zero expressions, like ‘(let1 (foo 'bar))’.  In
this case we need to assert we have at least one body expression.  A
common idiom for this is to name the ellipsized pattern variable with an
asterisk:

     (define-syntax let1
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((_ (var val) exp exp* ...)
          (let ((var val)) exp exp* ...))))

   A vector of patterns matches a vector whose contents match the
patterns, including ellipsizing and tail patterns.

     (define-syntax letv
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((_ #((var val) ...) exp exp* ...)
          (let ((var val) ...) exp exp* ...))))
     (letv #((foo 'bar)) foo)
     ⇒ bar

   Literals are used to match specific datums in an expression, like the
use of ‘=>’ and ‘else’ in ‘cond’ expressions.

     (define-syntax cond1
       (syntax-rules (=> else)
         ((cond1 test => fun)
          (let ((exp test))
            (if exp (fun exp) #f)))
         ((cond1 test exp exp* ...)
          (if test (begin exp exp* ...)))
         ((cond1 else exp exp* ...)
          (begin exp exp* ...))))

     (define (square x) (* x x))
     (cond1 10 => square)
     ⇒ 100
     (let ((=> #t))
       (cond1 10 => square))
     ⇒ #<procedure square (x)>

   A literal matches an input expression if the input expression is an
identifier with the same name as the literal, and both are unbound(1).

   Although literals can be unbound, usually they are bound to allow
them to be imported, exported, and renamed.  *Note* Modules::, for more
information on imports and exports.  In Guile there are a few standard
auxiliary syntax definitions, as specified by R6RS and R7RS:

 -- Scheme Syntax: else
 -- Scheme Syntax: =>
 -- Scheme Syntax: _
 -- Scheme Syntax: ...
     Auxiliary syntax definitions.

     These are defined as if with a macro that never matches, e.g.:

          (define-syntax else (syntax-rules ()))

   If a pattern is not a list, vector, or an identifier, it matches as a
literal, with ‘equal?’.

     (define-syntax define-matcher-macro
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((_ name lit)
          (define-syntax name
            (syntax-rules ()
             ((_ lit) #t)
             ((_ else) #f))))))

     (define-matcher-macro is-literal-foo? "foo")

     (is-literal-foo? "foo")
     ⇒ #t
     (is-literal-foo? "bar")
     ⇒ #f
     (let ((foo "foo"))
       (is-literal-foo? foo))
     ⇒ #f

   The last example indicates that matching happens at expansion-time,
not at run-time.

   Syntax-rules macros are always used as ‘(MACRO . ARGS)’, and the
MACRO will always be a symbol.  Correspondingly, a ‘syntax-rules’
pattern must be a list (proper or improper), and the first pattern in
that list must be an identifier.  Incidentally it can be any identifier
– it doesn’t have to actually be the name of the macro.  Thus the
following three are equivalent:

     (define-syntax when
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((when c e ...)
          (if c (begin e ...)))))

     (define-syntax when
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((_ c e ...)
          (if c (begin e ...)))))

     (define-syntax when
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((something-else-entirely c e ...)
          (if c (begin e ...)))))

   For clarity, use one of the first two variants.  Also note that since
the pattern variable will always match the macro itself (e.g., ‘cond1’),
it is actually left unbound in the template.

### 6.8.2.2 Hygiene
...............

‘syntax-rules’ macros have a magical property: they preserve referential
transparency.  When you read a macro definition, any free bindings in
that macro are resolved relative to the macro definition; and when you
read a macro instantiation, all free bindings in that expression are
resolved relative to the expression.

   This property is sometimes known as “hygiene”, and it does aid in
code cleanliness.  In your macro definitions, you can feel free to
introduce temporary variables, without worrying about inadvertently
introducing bindings into the macro expansion.

   Consider the definition of ‘my-or’ from the previous section:

     (define-syntax my-or
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((my-or)
          #t)
         ((my-or exp)
          exp)
         ((my-or exp rest ...)
          (let ((t exp))
            (if t
                t
                (my-or rest ...))))))

   A naive expansion of ‘(let ((t #t)) (my-or #f t))’ would yield:

     (let ((t #t))
       (let ((t #f))
         (if t t t)))
     ⇒ #f

Which clearly is not what we want.  Somehow the ‘t’ in the definition is
distinct from the ‘t’ at the site of use; and it is indeed this
distinction that is maintained by the syntax expander, when expanding
hygienic macros.

   This discussion is mostly relevant in the context of traditional Lisp
macros (*note* Defmacros::), which do not preserve referential
transparency.  Hygiene adds to the expressive power of Scheme.

### 6.8.2.3 Shorthands
..................

One often ends up writing simple one-clause ‘syntax-rules’ macros.
There is a convenient shorthand for this idiom, in the form of
‘define-syntax-rule’.

 -- Syntax: define-syntax-rule (keyword . pattern) [docstring] template
     Define KEYWORD as a new ‘syntax-rules’ macro with one clause.

   Cast into this form, our ‘when’ example is significantly shorter:

     (define-syntax-rule (when c e ...)
       (if c (begin e ...)))

### 6.8.2.4 Reporting Syntax Errors in Macros
.........................................

 -- Syntax: syntax-error message [arg ...]
     Report an error at macro-expansion time.  MESSAGE must be a string
     literal, and the optional ARG operands can be arbitrary expressions
     providing additional information.

   ‘syntax-error’ is intended to be used within ‘syntax-rules’
templates.  For example:

     (define-syntax simple-let
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((_ (head ... ((x . y) val) . tail)
             body1 body2 ...)
          (syntax-error
           "expected an identifier but got"
           (x . y)))
         ((_ ((name val) ...) body1 body2 ...)
          ((lambda (name ...) body1 body2 ...)
           val ...))))

### 6.8.2.5 Specifying a Custom Ellipsis Identifier
...............................................

When writing macros that generate macro definitions, it is convenient to
use a different ellipsis identifier at each level.  Guile allows the
desired ellipsis identifier to be specified as the first operand to
‘syntax-rules’, as specified by SRFI-46 and R7RS. For example:

     (define-syntax define-quotation-macros
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((_ (macro-name head-symbol) ...)
          (begin (define-syntax macro-name
                   (syntax-rules ::: ()
                     ((_ x :::)
                      (quote (head-symbol x :::)))))
                 ...))))
     (define-quotation-macros (quote-a a) (quote-b b) (quote-c c))
     (quote-a 1 2 3) ⇒ (a 1 2 3)

### 6.8.2.6 Further Information
...........................

For a formal definition of ‘syntax-rules’ and its pattern language, see
*Note* Macros: (r5rs)Macros.

   ‘syntax-rules’ macros are simple and clean, but do they have
limitations.  They do not lend themselves to expressive error messages:
patterns either match or they don’t.  Their ability to generate code is
limited to template-driven expansion; often one needs to define a number
of helper macros to get real work done.  Sometimes one wants to
introduce a binding into the lexical context of the generated code; this
is impossible with ‘syntax-rules’.  Relatedly, they cannot
programmatically generate identifiers.

   The solution to all of these problems is to use ‘syntax-case’ if you
need its features.  But if for some reason you’re stuck with
‘syntax-rules’, you might enjoy Joe Marshall’s ‘syntax-rules’ Primer for
the Merely Eccentric
(http://sites.google.com/site/evalapply/eccentric.txt).

6.8.3 Support for the ‘syntax-case’ System
------------------------------------------

‘syntax-case’ macros are procedural syntax transformers, with a power
worthy of Scheme.

 -- Syntax: syntax-case syntax literals (pattern [guard] exp) ...
     Match the syntax object SYNTAX against the given patterns, in
     order.  If a PATTERN matches, return the result of evaluating the
     associated EXP.

   Compare the following definitions of ‘when’:

     (define-syntax when
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((_ test e e* ...)
          (if test (begin e e* ...)))))

     (define-syntax when
       (lambda (x)
         (syntax-case x ()
           ((_ test e e* ...)
            #'(if test (begin e e* ...))))))

   Clearly, the ‘syntax-case’ definition is similar to its
‘syntax-rules’ counterpart, and equally clearly there are some
differences.  The ‘syntax-case’ definition is wrapped in a ‘lambda’, a
function of one argument; that argument is passed to the ‘syntax-case’
invocation; and the “return value” of the macro has a ‘#'’ prefix.

   All of these differences stem from the fact that ‘syntax-case’ does
not define a syntax transformer itself – instead, ‘syntax-case’
expressions provide a way to destructure a “syntax object”, and to
rebuild syntax objects as output.

   So the ‘lambda’ wrapper is simply a leaky implementation detail, that
syntax transformers are just functions that transform syntax to syntax.
This should not be surprising, given that we have already described
macros as “programs that write programs”.  ‘syntax-case’ is simply a way
to take apart and put together program text, and to be a valid syntax
transformer it needs to be wrapped in a procedure.

   Unlike traditional Lisp macros (*note* Defmacros::), ‘syntax-case’
macros transform syntax objects, not raw Scheme forms.  Recall the naive
expansion of ‘my-or’ given in the previous section:

     (let ((t #t))
       (my-or #f t))
     ;; naive expansion:
     (let ((t #t))
       (let ((t #f))
         (if t t t)))

   Raw Scheme forms simply don’t have enough information to distinguish
the first two ‘t’ instances in ‘(if t t t)’ from the third ‘t’.  So
instead of representing identifiers as symbols, the syntax expander
represents identifiers as annotated syntax objects, attaching such
information to those syntax objects as is needed to maintain referential
transparency.

 -- Syntax: syntax form
     Create a syntax object wrapping FORM within the current lexical
     context.

   Syntax objects are typically created internally to the process of
expansion, but it is possible to create them outside of syntax
expansion:

     (syntax (foo bar baz))
     ⇒ #<some representation of that syntax>

However it is more common, and useful, to create syntax objects when
building output from a ‘syntax-case’ expression.

     (define-syntax add1
       (lambda (x)
         (syntax-case x ()
           ((_ exp)
            (syntax (+ exp 1))))))

   It is not strictly necessary for a ‘syntax-case’ expression to return
a syntax object, because ‘syntax-case’ expressions can be used in helper
functions, or otherwise used outside of syntax expansion itself.
However a syntax transformer procedure must return a syntax object, so
most uses of ‘syntax-case’ do end up returning syntax objects.

   Here in this case, the form that built the return value was ‘(syntax
(+ exp 1))’.  The interesting thing about this is that within a ‘syntax’
expression, any appearance of a pattern variable is substituted into the
resulting syntax object, carrying with it all relevant metadata from the
source expression, such as lexical identity and source location.

   Indeed, a pattern variable may only be referenced from inside a
‘syntax’ form.  The syntax expander would raise an error when defining
‘add1’ if it found EXP referenced outside a ‘syntax’ form.

   Since ‘syntax’ appears frequently in macro-heavy code, it has a
special reader macro: ‘#'’.  ‘#'foo’ is transformed by the reader into
‘(syntax foo)’, just as ‘'foo’ is transformed into ‘(quote foo)’.

   The pattern language used by ‘syntax-case’ is conveniently the same
language used by ‘syntax-rules’.  Given this, Guile actually defines
‘syntax-rules’ in terms of ‘syntax-case’:

     (define-syntax syntax-rules
       (lambda (x)
         (syntax-case x ()
           ((_ (k ...) ((keyword . pattern) template) ...)
            #'(lambda (x)
                (syntax-case x (k ...)
                  ((dummy . pattern) #'template)
                  ...))))))

   And that’s that.

### 6.8.3.1 Why ‘syntax-case’?
..........................

The examples we have shown thus far could just as well have been
expressed with ‘syntax-rules’, and have just shown that ‘syntax-case’ is
more verbose, which is true.  But there is a difference: ‘syntax-case’
creates _procedural_ macros, giving the full power of Scheme to the
macro expander.  This has many practical applications.

   A common desire is to be able to match a form only if it is an
identifier.  This is impossible with ‘syntax-rules’, given the datum
matching forms.  But with ‘syntax-case’ it is easy:

 -- Scheme Procedure: identifier? syntax-object
     Returns ‘#t’ if SYNTAX-OBJECT is an identifier, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

     ;; relying on previous add1 definition
     (define-syntax add1!
       (lambda (x)
         (syntax-case x ()
           ((_ var) (identifier? #'var)
            #'(set! var (add1 var))))))

     (define foo 0)
     (add1! foo)
     foo ⇒ 1
     (add1! "not-an-identifier") ⇒ error

   With ‘syntax-rules’, the error for ‘(add1! "not-an-identifier")’
would be something like “invalid ‘set!’”.  With ‘syntax-case’, it will
say something like “invalid ‘add1!’”, because we attach the “guard
clause” to the pattern: ‘(identifier? #'var)’.  This becomes more
important with more complicated macros.  It is necessary to use
‘identifier?’, because to the expander, an identifier is more than a
bare symbol.

   Note that even in the guard clause, we reference the VAR pattern
variable within a ‘syntax’ form, via ‘#'var’.

   Another common desire is to introduce bindings into the lexical
context of the output expression.  One example would be in the so-called
“anaphoric macros”, like ‘aif’.  Anaphoric macros bind some expression
to a well-known identifier, often ‘it’, within their bodies.  For
example, in ‘(aif (foo) (bar it))’, ‘it’ would be bound to the result of
‘(foo)’.

   To begin with, we should mention a solution that doesn’t work:

     ;; doesn't work
     (define-syntax aif
       (lambda (x)
         (syntax-case x ()
           ((_ test then else)
            #'(let ((it test))
                (if it then else))))))

   The reason that this doesn’t work is that, by default, the expander
will preserve referential transparency; the THEN and ELSE expressions
won’t have access to the binding of ‘it’.

   But they can, if we explicitly introduce a binding via
‘datum->syntax’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: datum->syntax template-id datum [#:source=#f]
     Create a syntax object that wraps DATUM, within the lexical context
     corresponding to the identifier TEMPLATE-ID.  If TEMPLATE-ID is
     false, the datum will have no lexical context information.

     Syntax objects have an associated source location.  Internally this
     is represented as a 3-element vector of filename, line, and column.
     Usually this location ultimately is provided by ‘read-syntax’;
     *Note* Annotated Scheme Read::.

     If a syntax object is passed as SOURCE, the resulting syntax object
     will have the source location of SOURCE.  Otherwise if SOURCE is a
     3-element source location vector, that vector will be the source
     location of the resulting syntax object.  If SOURCE is a source
     properties alist, those will be parsed and set as the source
     location of the resulting syntax object.  Otherwise if SOURCE is
     false, the source properties are looked up from ‘(source-properties
     DATUM)’.  *Note* Source Properties::.

   For completeness, we should mention that it is possible to strip the
metadata from a syntax object, returning a raw Scheme datum:

 -- Scheme Procedure: syntax->datum syntax-object
     Strip the metadata from SYNTAX-OBJECT, returning its contents as a
     raw Scheme datum.

   In this case we want to introduce ‘it’ in the context of the whole
expression, so we can create a syntax object as ‘(datum->syntax x 'it)’,
where ‘x’ is the whole expression, as passed to the transformer
procedure.

   Here’s another solution that doesn’t work:

     ;; doesn't work either
     (define-syntax aif
       (lambda (x)
         (syntax-case x ()
           ((_ test then else)
            (let ((it (datum->syntax x 'it)))
              #'(let ((it test))
                  (if it then else)))))))

   The reason that this one doesn’t work is that there are really two
environments at work here – the environment of pattern variables, as
bound by ‘syntax-case’, and the environment of lexical variables, as
bound by normal Scheme.  The outer let form establishes a binding in the
environment of lexical variables, but the inner let form is inside a
syntax form, where only pattern variables will be substituted.  Here we
need to introduce a piece of the lexical environment into the pattern
variable environment, and we can do so using ‘syntax-case’ itself:

     ;; works, but is obtuse
     (define-syntax aif
       (lambda (x)
         (syntax-case x ()
           ((_ test then else)
            ;; invoking syntax-case on the generated
            ;; syntax object to expose it to `syntax'
            (syntax-case (datum->syntax x 'it) ()
              (it
                #'(let ((it test))
                    (if it then else))))))))

     (aif (getuid) (display it) (display "none")) (newline)
     ⊣ 500

   However there are easier ways to write this.  ‘with-syntax’ is often
convenient:

 -- Syntax: with-syntax ((pat val) ...) exp ...
     Bind patterns PAT from their corresponding values VAL, within the
     lexical context of EXP ....

          ;; better
          (define-syntax aif
            (lambda (x)
              (syntax-case x ()
                ((_ test then else)
                 (with-syntax ((it (datum->syntax x 'it)))
                   #'(let ((it test))
                       (if it then else)))))))

   As you might imagine, ‘with-syntax’ is defined in terms of
‘syntax-case’.  But even that might be off-putting to you if you are an
old Lisp macro hacker, used to building macro output with ‘quasiquote’.
The issue is that ‘with-syntax’ creates a separation between the point
of definition of a value and its point of substitution.

   So for cases in which a ‘quasiquote’ style makes more sense,
‘syntax-case’ also defines ‘quasisyntax’, and the related ‘unsyntax’ and
‘unsyntax-splicing’, abbreviated by the reader as ‘#`’, ‘#,’, and ‘#,@’,
respectively.

   For example, to define a macro that inserts a compile-time timestamp
into a source file, one may write:

     (define-syntax display-compile-timestamp
       (lambda (x)
         (syntax-case x ()
           ((_)
            #`(begin
               (display "The compile timestamp was: ")
               (display #,(current-time))
               (newline))))))

   Readers interested in further information on ‘syntax-case’ macros
should see R. Kent Dybvig’s excellent ‘The Scheme Programming Language’,
either edition 3 or 4, in the chapter on syntax.  Dybvig was the primary
author of the ‘syntax-case’ system.  The book itself is available online
at <http://scheme.com/tspl4/>.

### 6.8.3.2 Custom Ellipsis Identifiers for syntax-case Macros
..........................................................

When writing procedural macros that generate macro definitions, it is
convenient to use a different ellipsis identifier at each level.  Guile
supports this for procedural macros using the ‘with-ellipsis’ special
form:

 -- Syntax: with-ellipsis ellipsis body ...
     ELLIPSIS must be an identifier.  Evaluate BODY in a special lexical
     environment such that all macro patterns and templates within BODY
     will use ELLIPSIS as the ellipsis identifier instead of the usual
     three dots (‘...’).

   For example:

     (quote-a 1 2 3) ⇒ (a 1 2 3)

   Note that ‘with-ellipsis’ does not affect the ellipsis identifier of
the generated code, unless ‘with-ellipsis’ is included around the
generated code.

### 6.8.3.3 Syntax objects can be data too
......................................

Generally speaking, you want the macro expander to pick apart all syntax
objects in a source term.  The source and scope annotations attached to
the syntax object are of interest to how the macro expander computes the
result, but no syntax object itself should appear in the expanded
term—usually.  Sometimes, though, a macro will want a syntax object to
appear in the expanded output.  Normally you would just use ‘quote’ to
introduce the syntax object as a value, but the expander strips syntax
objects from subexpression of ‘quote’.  For this rare use case, Guile
has ‘quote-syntax’, which does not strip its subexpression.

 -- Syntax: quote-syntax form
     Expand to the syntax object ‘form’, as a constant literal.  Like
     ‘quote’, but without calling ‘syntax->datum’.

6.8.4 Syntax Transformer Helpers
--------------------------------

As noted in the previous section, Guile’s syntax expander operates on
syntax objects.  Procedural macros consume and produce syntax objects.
This section describes some of the auxiliary helpers that procedural
macros can use to compare, generate, and query objects of this data
type.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bound-identifier=? a b
     Return ‘#t’ if the syntax objects A and B refer to the same
     lexically-bound identifier, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: free-identifier=? a b
     Return ‘#t’ if the syntax objects A and B refer to the same free
     identifier, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: generate-temporaries ls
     Return a list of temporary identifiers as long as LS is long.

 -- Scheme Procedure: syntax-source x
     Return the source properties that correspond to the syntax object
     X.  *Note* Source Properties::, for more information.

   Guile also offers some more experimental interfaces in a separate
module.  As was the case with the Large Hadron Collider, it is unclear
to our senior macrologists whether adding these interfaces will result
in awesomeness or in the destruction of Guile via the creation of a
singularity.  We will preserve their functionality through the 2.0
series, but we reserve the right to modify them in a future stable
series, to a more than usual degree.

     (use-modules (system syntax))

 -- Scheme Procedure: syntax-module id
     Return the name of the module whose source contains the identifier
     ID.

 -- Scheme Procedure: syntax-sourcev stx
     Like ‘syntax-source’, but returns its result in a more compact
     ‘#(FILENAME LINE COLUMN)’ format.  This format is used as the
     internal representation of source locations for syntax objects.

 -- Scheme Procedure: syntax-local-binding id
          [#:resolve-syntax-parameters?=#t]
     Resolve the identifer ID, a syntax object, within the current
     lexical environment, and return two values, the binding type and a
     binding value.  The binding type is a symbol, which may be one of
     the following:

     ‘lexical’
          A lexically-bound variable.  The value is a unique token (in
          the sense of ‘eq?’) identifying this binding.
     ‘macro’
          A syntax transformer, either local or global.  The value is
          the transformer procedure.
     ‘syntax-parameter’
          A syntax parameter (*note* Syntax Parameters::).  By default,
          ‘syntax-local-binding’ will resolve syntax parameters, so that
          this value will not be returned.  Pass
          ‘#:resolve-syntax-parameters? #f’ to indicate that you are
          interested in syntax parameters.  The value is the default
          transformer procedure, as in ‘macro’.
     ‘pattern-variable’
          A pattern variable, bound via ‘syntax-case’.  The value is an
          opaque object, internal to the expander.
     ‘ellipsis’
          An internal binding, bound via ‘with-ellipsis’.  The value is
          the (anti-marked) local ellipsis identifier.
     ‘displaced-lexical’
          A lexical variable that has gone out of scope.  This can
          happen if a badly-written procedural macro saves a syntax
          object, then attempts to introduce it in a context in which it
          is unbound.  The value is ‘#f’.
     ‘global’
          A global binding.  The value is a pair, whose head is the
          symbol, and whose tail is the name of the module in which to
          resolve the symbol.
     ‘other’
          Some other binding, like ‘lambda’ or other core bindings.  The
          value is ‘#f’.

     This is a very low-level procedure, with limited uses.  One case in
     which it is useful is to build abstractions that associate
     auxiliary information with macros:

          (define aux-property (make-object-property))
          (define-syntax-rule (with-aux aux value)
            (let ((trans value))
              (set! (aux-property trans) aux)
              trans))
          (define-syntax retrieve-aux
            (lambda (x)
              (syntax-case x ()
                ((x id)
                 (call-with-values (lambda () (syntax-local-binding #'id))
                   (lambda (type val)
                     (with-syntax ((aux (datum->syntax #'here
                                                       (and (eq? type 'macro)
                                                            (aux-property val)))))
                       #''aux)))))))
          (define-syntax foo
            (with-aux 'bar
              (syntax-rules () ((_) 'foo))))
          (foo)
          ⇒ foo
          (retrieve-aux foo)
          ⇒ bar

     ‘syntax-local-binding’ must be called within the dynamic extent of
     a syntax transformer; to call it otherwise will signal an error.

 -- Scheme Procedure: syntax-locally-bound-identifiers id
     Return a list of identifiers that were visible lexically when the
     identifier ID was created, in order from outermost to innermost.

     This procedure is intended to be used in specialized procedural
     macros, to provide a macro with the set of bound identifiers that
     the macro can reference.

     As a technical implementation detail, the identifiers returned by
     ‘syntax-locally-bound-identifiers’ will be anti-marked, like the
     syntax object that is given as input to a macro.  This is to signal
     to the macro expander that these bindings were present in the
     original source, and do not need to be hygienically renamed, as
     would be the case with other introduced identifiers.  See the
     discussion of hygiene in section 12.1 of the R6RS, for more
     information on marks.

          (define (local-lexicals id)
            (filter (lambda (x)
                      (eq? (syntax-local-binding x) 'lexical))
                    (syntax-locally-bound-identifiers id)))
          (define-syntax lexicals
            (lambda (x)
              (syntax-case x ()
                ((lexicals) #'(lexicals lexicals))
                ((lexicals scope)
                 (with-syntax (((id ...) (local-lexicals #'scope)))
                   #'(list (cons 'id id) ...))))))

          (let* ((x 10) (x 20)) (lexicals))
          ⇒ ((x . 10) (x . 20))

6.8.5 Lisp-style Macro Definitions
----------------------------------

The traditional way to define macros in Lisp is very similar to
procedure definitions.  The key differences are that the macro
definition body should return a list that describes the transformed
expression, and that the definition is marked as a macro definition
(rather than a procedure definition) by the use of a different
definition keyword: in Lisp, ‘defmacro’ rather than ‘defun’, and in
Scheme, ‘define-macro’ rather than ‘define’.

   Guile supports this style of macro definition using both ‘defmacro’
and ‘define-macro’.  The only difference between them is how the macro
name and arguments are grouped together in the definition:

     (defmacro NAME (ARGS ...) BODY ...)

is the same as

     (define-macro (NAME ARGS ...) BODY ...)

The difference is analogous to the corresponding difference between
Lisp’s ‘defun’ and Scheme’s ‘define’.

   Having read the previous section on ‘syntax-case’, it’s probably
clear that Guile actually implements defmacros in terms of
‘syntax-case’, applying the transformer on the expression between
invocations of ‘syntax->datum’ and ‘datum->syntax’.  This realization
leads us to the problem with defmacros, that they do not preserve
referential transparency.  One can be careful to not introduce bindings
into expanded code, via liberal use of ‘gensym’, but there is no getting
around the lack of referential transparency for free bindings in the
macro itself.

   Even a macro as simple as our ‘when’ from before is difficult to get
right:

     (define-macro (when cond exp . rest)
       `(if ,cond
            (begin ,exp . ,rest)))

     (when #f (display "Launching missiles!\n"))
     ⇒ #f

     (let ((if list))
       (when #f (display "Launching missiles!\n")))
     ⊣ Launching missiles!
     ⇒ (#f #<unspecified>)

   Guile’s perspective is that defmacros have had a good run, but that
modern macros should be written with ‘syntax-rules’ or ‘syntax-case’.
There are still many uses of defmacros within Guile itself, but we will
be phasing them out over time.  Of course we won’t take away ‘defmacro’
or ‘define-macro’ themselves, as there is lots of code out there that
uses them.


File: guile.info,  Node: Identifier Macros,  Next: Syntax Parameters,  Prev: Defmacros,  Up: Macros

6.8.6 Identifier Macros
-----------------------

When the syntax expander sees a form in which the first element is a
macro, the whole form gets passed to the macro’s syntax transformer.
One may visualize this as:

     (define-syntax foo foo-transformer)
     (foo ARG...)
     ;; expands via
     (foo-transformer #'(foo ARG...))

   If, on the other hand, a macro is referenced in some other part of a
form, the syntax transformer is invoked with only the macro reference,
not the whole form.

     (define-syntax foo foo-transformer)
     foo
     ;; expands via
     (foo-transformer #'foo)

   This allows bare identifier references to be replaced
programmatically via a macro.  ‘syntax-rules’ provides some syntax to
effect this transformation more easily.

 -- Syntax: identifier-syntax exp
     Returns a macro transformer that will replace occurrences of the
     macro with EXP.

   For example, if you are importing external code written in terms of
‘fx+’, the fixnum addition operator, but Guile doesn’t have ‘fx+’, you
may use the following to replace ‘fx+’ with ‘+’:

     (define-syntax fx+ (identifier-syntax +))

   There is also special support for recognizing identifiers on the
left-hand side of a ‘set!’ expression, as in the following:

     (define-syntax foo foo-transformer)
     (set! foo VAL)
     ;; expands via
     (foo-transformer #'(set! foo VAL))
     ;; if foo-transformer is a "variable transformer"

   As the example notes, the transformer procedure must be explicitly
marked as being a “variable transformer”, as most macros aren’t written
to discriminate on the form in the operator position.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-variable-transformer transformer
     Mark the TRANSFORMER procedure as being a “variable transformer”.
     In practice this means that, when bound to a syntactic keyword, it
     may detect references to that keyword on the left-hand-side of a
     ‘set!’.

          (define bar 10)
          (define-syntax bar-alias
            (make-variable-transformer
             (lambda (x)
               (syntax-case x (set!)
                 ((set! var val) #'(set! bar val))
                 ((var arg ...) #'(bar arg ...))
                 (var (identifier? #'var) #'bar)))))

          bar-alias ⇒ 10
          (set! bar-alias 20)
          bar ⇒ 20
          (set! bar 30)
          bar-alias ⇒ 30

   There is an extension to identifier-syntax which allows it to handle
the ‘set!’ case as well:

 -- Syntax: identifier-syntax (var exp1) ((set! var val) exp2)
     Create a variable transformer.  The first clause is used for
     references to the variable in operator or operand position, and the
     second for appearances of the variable on the left-hand-side of an
     assignment.

     For example, the previous ‘bar-alias’ example could be expressed
     more succinctly like this:

          (define-syntax bar-alias
            (identifier-syntax
              (var bar)
              ((set! var val) (set! bar val))))

     As before, the templates in ‘identifier-syntax’ forms do not need
     wrapping in ‘#'’ syntax forms.


File: guile.info,  Node: Syntax Parameters,  Next: Eval When,  Prev: Identifier Macros,  Up: Macros

6.8.7 Syntax Parameters
-----------------------

Syntax parameters(1) are a mechanism for rebinding a macro definition
within the dynamic extent of a macro expansion.  This provides a
convenient solution to one of the most common types of unhygienic macro:
those that introduce a unhygienic binding each time the macro is used.
Examples include a ‘lambda’ form with a ‘return’ keyword, or class
macros that introduce a special ‘self’ binding.

   With syntax parameters, instead of introducing the binding
unhygienically each time, we instead create one binding for the keyword,
which we can then adjust later when we want the keyword to have a
different meaning.  As no new bindings are introduced, hygiene is
preserved.  This is similar to the dynamic binding mechanisms we have at
run-time (*note* parameters: SRFI-39.), except that the dynamic binding
only occurs during macro expansion.  The code after macro expansion
remains lexically scoped.

 -- Syntax: define-syntax-parameter keyword transformer
     Binds KEYWORD to the value obtained by evaluating TRANSFORMER.  The
     TRANSFORMER provides the default expansion for the syntax
     parameter, and in the absence of ‘syntax-parameterize’, is
     functionally equivalent to ‘define-syntax’.  Usually, you will just
     want to have the TRANSFORMER throw a syntax error indicating that
     the KEYWORD is supposed to be used in conjunction with another
     macro, for example:
          (define-syntax-parameter return
            (lambda (stx)
              (syntax-violation 'return "return used outside of a lambda^" stx)))

 -- Syntax: syntax-parameterize ((keyword transformer) ...) exp ...
     Adjusts KEYWORD ... to use the values obtained by evaluating their
     TRANSFORMER ..., in the expansion of the EXP ... forms.  Each
     KEYWORD must be bound to a syntax-parameter.  ‘syntax-parameterize’
     differs from ‘let-syntax’, in that the binding is not shadowed, but
     adjusted, and so uses of the keyword in the expansion of EXP ...
     use the new transformers.  This is somewhat similar to how
     ‘parameterize’ adjusts the values of regular parameters, rather
     than creating new bindings.

          (define-syntax lambda^
            (syntax-rules ()
              [(lambda^ argument-list body body* ...)
               (lambda argument-list
                 (call-with-current-continuation
                  (lambda (escape)
                    ;; In the body we adjust the 'return' keyword so that calls
                    ;; to 'return' are replaced with calls to the escape
                    ;; continuation.
                    (syntax-parameterize ([return (syntax-rules ()
                                                    [(return vals (... ...))
                                                     (escape vals (... ...))])])
                      body body* ...))))]))

          ;; Now we can write functions that return early.  Here, 'product' will
          ;; return immediately if it sees any 0 element.
          (define product
            (lambda^ (list)
                     (fold (lambda (n o)
                             (if (zero? n)
                                 (return 0)
                                 (* n o)))
                           1
                           list)))

6.8.8 Eval-when
---------------

As ‘syntax-case’ macros have the whole power of Scheme available to
them, they present a problem regarding time: when a macro runs, what
parts of the program are available for the macro to use?

   The default answer to this question is that when you import a module
(via ‘define-module’ or ‘use-modules’), that module will be loaded up at
expansion-time, as well as at run-time.  Additionally, top-level
syntactic definitions within one compilation unit made by
‘define-syntax’ are also evaluated at expansion time, in the order that
they appear in the compilation unit (file).

   But if a syntactic definition needs to call out to a normal procedure
at expansion-time, it might well need need special declarations to
indicate that the procedure should be made available at expansion-time.

   For example, the following code tries to embed a compilation
timestamp in the compiled bytecode using a macro that expands to the
date as a string literal.  It will work at a REPL, but not in a file, as
it cannot be byte-compiled:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-19))
     (define start-date (date->string (current-date)))
     (define-syntax *compilation-date*
      (lambda (sintax)
         start-date))
     (display *compilation-date*)
     (newline)

   It works at a REPL because the expressions are evaluated one-by-one,
in order, but if placed in a file, the expressions are expanded
one-by-one, but not evaluated until the compiled file is loaded.

   The fix is to use ‘eval-when’.

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-19))
     (eval-when (expand load eval)
       (define start-date (date->string (current-date))))
     (define-syntax *compilation-date*
      (lambda (sintax)
         start-date))
     (display *compilation-date*)
     (newline)

 -- Syntax: eval-when conditions exp...
     Evaluate EXP... under the given CONDITIONS.  Valid conditions
     include:

     ‘expand’
          Evaluate during macro expansion, whether compiling or not.

     ‘load’
          Evaluate during the evaluation phase of compiled code, e.g.
          when loading a compiled module or running compiled code at the
          REPL.

     ‘eval’
          Evaluate during the evaluation phase of non-compiled code.

     ‘compile’
          Evaluate during macro expansion, but only when compiling.

     In other words, when using the primitive evaluator, ‘eval-when’
     expressions with ‘expand’ are run during macro expansion, and those
     with ‘eval’ are run during the evaluation phase.

     When using the compiler, ‘eval-when’ expressions with either
     ‘expand’ or ‘compile’ are run during macro expansion, and those
     with ‘load’ are run during the evaluation phase.

     When in doubt, use the three conditions ‘(expand load eval)’, as in
     the example above.  Other uses of ‘eval-when’ may void your
     warranty or poison your cat.

6.8.9 Macro Expansion
---------------------

Usually, macros are expanded on behalf of the user as needed.  Macro
expansion is an integral part of ‘eval’ and ‘compile’.  Users can also
expand macros at the REPL prompt via the ‘expand’ REPL command; *Note*
Compile Commands::.

   Macros can also be expanded programmatically, via ‘macroexpand’, but
the details get a bit hairy for two reasons.

   The first complication is that the result of macro-expansion isn’t
Scheme: it’s Tree-IL, Guile’s high-level intermediate language.  *Note*
Tree-IL::.  As “hygienic macros” can produce identifiers that are
distinct but have the same name, the output format needs to be able to
represent distinctions between variable identities and names.  Again,
*Note* Tree-IL::, for all the details.  The easiest thing is to just run
‘tree-il->scheme’ on the result of macro-expansion:

     (macroexpand '(+ 1 2))
     ⇒
     #<tree-il (call (toplevel +) (const 1) (const 2))>

     (use-modules (language tree-il))
     (tree-il->scheme (macroexpand '(+ 1 2)))
     ⇒
     (+ 1 2)

   The second complication involves ‘eval-when’.  As an example, what
would it mean to macro-expand the definition of a macro?

     (macroexpand '(define-syntax qux (identifier-syntax 'bar)))
     ⇒
     ?

   The answer is that it depends who is macro-expanding, and why.  Do
you define the macro in the current environment?  Residualize a macro
definition?  Both?  Neither?  The default is to expand in “eval” mode,
which means an ‘eval-when’ clauses will only proceed when ‘eval’ (or
‘expand’) is in its condition set.  Top-level macros will be ‘eval’’d in
the top-level environment.

   In this way ‘(macroexpand FOO)’ is equivalent to ‘(macroexpand FOO 'e
'(eval))’.  The second argument is the mode (‘'e’ for “eval”) and the
third is the eval-syntax-expanders-when parameter (only ‘eval’ in this
default setting).

   But if you are compiling the macro definition, probably you want to
reify the macro definition itself.  In that case you pass ‘'c’ as the
second argument to ‘macroexpand’.  But probably you want the macro
definition to be present at compile time as well, so you pass ‘'(compile
load eval)’ as the ESEW parameter.  In fact ‘(compile FOO #:to
'tree-il)’ is entirely equivalent to ‘(macroexpand FOO 'c '(compile load
eval))’; *Note* The Scheme Compiler::.

   It’s a terrible interface; we know.  The macroexpander is somewhat
tricksy regarding modes, so unless you are building a macro-expanding
tool, we suggest to avoid invoking it directly.

6.8.10 Hygiene and the Top-Level
--------------------------------

Consider the following macro.

     (define-syntax-rule (defconst name val)
       (begin
         (define t val)
         (define-syntax-rule (name) t)))

   If we use it to make a couple of bindings:

     (defconst foo 42)
     (defconst bar 37)

   The expansion would look something like this:

     (begin
       (define t 42)
       (define-syntax-rule (foo) t))
     (begin
       (define t 37)
       (define-syntax-rule (bar) t))

   As the two ‘t’ bindings were introduced by the macro, they should be
introduced hygienically – and indeed they are, inside a lexical contour
(a ‘let’ or some other lexical scope).  The ‘t’ reference in ‘foo’ is
distinct to the reference in ‘bar’.

   At the top-level things are more complicated.  Before Guile 2.2, a
use of ‘defconst’ at the top-level would not introduce a fresh binding
for ‘t’.  This was consistent with a weaselly interpretation of the
Scheme standard, in which all possible bindings may be assumed to exist,
at the top-level, and in which we merely take advantage of toplevel
‘define’ of an existing binding being equivalent to ‘set!’.  But it’s
not a good reason.

   The solution is to create fresh names for all bindings introduced by
macros – not just bindings in lexical contours, but also bindings
introduced at the top-level.

   However, the obvious strategy of just giving random names to
introduced toplevel identifiers poses a problem for separate
compilation.  Consider without loss of generality a ‘defconst’ of ‘foo’
in module ‘a’ that introduces the fresh top-level name ‘t-1’.  If we
then compile a module ‘b’ that uses ‘foo’, there is now a reference to
‘t-1’ in module ‘b’.  If module ‘a’ is then expanded again, for whatever
reason, for example in a simple recompilation, the introduced ‘t’ gets a
fresh name; say, ‘t-2’.  Now module ‘b’ has broken because module ‘a’ no
longer has a binding for ‘t-1’.

   If introduced top-level identifiers “escape” a module, in whatever
way, they then form part of the binary interface (ABI) of a module.  It
is unacceptable from an engineering point of view to allow the ABI to
change randomly.  (It also poses practical problems in meeting the
recompilation conditions of the Lesser GPL license, for such modules.)
For this reason many people prefer to never use identifier-introducing
macros at the top-level, instead making those macros receive the names
for their introduced identifiers as part of their arguments, or to
construct them programmatically and use ‘datum->syntax’.  But this
approach requires omniscience as to the implementation of all macros one
might use, and also limits the expressive power of Scheme macros.

   There is no perfect solution to this issue.  Guile does a terrible
thing here.  When it goes to introduce a top-level identifier, Guile
gives the identifier a pseudo-fresh name: a name that depends on the
hash of the source expression in which the name occurs.  The result in
this case is that the introduced definitions expand as:

     (begin
       (define t-1dc5e42de7c1050c 42)
       (define-syntax-rule (foo) t-1dc5e42de7c1050c))
     (begin
       (define t-10cb8ce9fdddd6e9 37)
       (define-syntax-rule (bar) t-10cb8ce9fdddd6e9))

   However, note that as the hash depends solely on the expression
introducing the definition, we also have:

     (defconst baz 42)
     ⇒ (begin
         (define t-1dc5e42de7c1050c 42)
         (define-syntax-rule (baz) t-1dc5e42de7c1050c))

   Note that the introduced binding has the same name!  This is because
the source expression, ‘(define t 42)’, was the same.  Probably you will
never see an error in this area, but it is important to understand the
components of the interface of a module, and that interface may include
macro-introduced identifiers.

6.8.11 Internal Macros
----------------------

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-syntax-transformer name type binding
     Construct a syntax transformer object.  This is part of Guile’s
     low-level support for syntax-case.

 -- Scheme Procedure: macro? obj
 -- C Function: scm_macro_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a syntax transformer, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

     Note that it’s a bit difficult to actually get a macro as a
     first-class object; simply naming it (like ‘case’) will produce a
     syntax error.  But it is possible to get these objects using
     ‘module-ref’:

          (macro? (module-ref (current-module) 'case))
          ⇒ #t

 -- Scheme Procedure: macro-type m
 -- C Function: scm_macro_type (m)
     Return the TYPE that was given when M was constructed, via
     ‘make-syntax-transformer’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: macro-name m
 -- C Function: scm_macro_name (m)
     Return the name of the macro M.

 -- Scheme Procedure: macro-binding m
 -- C Function: scm_macro_binding (m)
     Return the binding of the macro M.

 -- Scheme Procedure: macro-transformer m
 -- C Function: scm_macro_transformer (m)
     Return the transformer of the macro M.  This will return a
     procedure, for which one may ask the docstring.  That’s the whole
     reason this section is documented.  Actually a part of the result
     of ‘macro-binding’.

6.9.1 Equality
--------------

There are three kinds of core equality predicates in Scheme, described
below.  The same kinds of comparisons arise in other functions, like
‘memq’ and friends (*note* List Searching::).

   For all three tests, objects of different types are never equal.  So
for instance a list and a vector are not ‘equal?’, even if their
contents are the same.  Exact and inexact numbers are considered
different types too, and are hence not equal even if their values are
the same.

   ‘eq?’ tests just for the same object (essentially a pointer
comparison).  This is fast, and can be used when searching for a
particular object, or when working with symbols or keywords (which are
always unique objects).

   ‘eqv?’ extends ‘eq?’ to look at the value of numbers and characters.
It can for instance be used somewhat like ‘=’ (*note* Comparison::) but
without an error if one operand isn’t a number.

   ‘equal?’ goes further, it looks (recursively) into the contents of
lists, vectors, etc.  This is good for instance on lists that have been
read or calculated in various places and are the same, just not made up
of the same pairs.  Such lists look the same (when printed), and
‘equal?’ will consider them the same.


 -- Scheme Procedure: eq? ...
 -- C Function: scm_eq_p (x, y)
     The Scheme procedure returns ‘#t’ if all of its arguments are the
     same object, except for numbers and characters.  The C function
     does the same but takes exactly two arguments.  For example,

          (define x (vector 1 2 3))
          (define y (vector 1 2 3))

          (eq? x x)  ⇒ #t
          (eq? x y)  ⇒ #f

     Numbers and characters are not equal to any other object, but the
     problem is they’re not necessarily ‘eq?’ to themselves either.
     This is even so when the number comes directly from a variable,

          (let ((n (+ 2 3)))
            (eq? n n))       ⇒ *unspecified*

     Generally ‘eqv?’ below should be used when comparing numbers or
     characters.  ‘=’ (*note* Comparison::) or ‘char=?’ (*note*
     Characters::) can be used too.

     It’s worth noting that end-of-list ‘()’, ‘#t’, ‘#f’, a symbol of a
     given name, and a keyword of a given name, are unique objects.
     There’s just one of each, so for instance no matter how ‘()’ arises
     in a program, it’s the same object and can be compared with ‘eq?’,

          (define x (cdr '(123)))
          (define y (cdr '(456)))
          (eq? x y) ⇒ #t

          (define x (string->symbol "foo"))
          (eq? x 'foo) ⇒ #t

 -- C Function: int scm_is_eq (SCM x, SCM y)
     Return ‘1’ when X and Y are equal in the sense of ‘eq?’, otherwise
     return ‘0’.

     The ‘==’ operator should not be used on ‘SCM’ values, an ‘SCM’ is a
     C type which cannot necessarily be compared using ‘==’ (*note* The
     SCM Type::).


 -- Scheme Procedure: eqv? ...
 -- C Function: scm_eqv_p (x, y)
     The Scheme procedure returns ‘#t’ if all of its arguments are the
     same object, or for characters and numbers the same value.  The C
     function is similar but takes exactly two arguments.

     On objects except characters and numbers, ‘eqv?’ is the same as
     ‘eq?’ above.  ‘(eqv? x y)’ is true if X and Y are the same object.

     If X and Y are numbers or characters, ‘eqv?’ compares their type
     and value.  An exact number is not ‘eqv?’ to an inexact number
     (even if their value is the same).

          (eqv? 3 (+ 1 2)) ⇒ #t
          (eqv? 1 1.0)     ⇒ #f

 -- Scheme Procedure: equal? ...
 -- C Function: scm_equal_p (x, y)
     The Scheme procedure returns ‘#t’ if all of its arguments are the
     same type, and their contents or value are equal.  The C function
     is similar, but takes exactly two arguments.

     For a pair, string, vector, array or structure, ‘equal?’ compares
     the contents, and does so using the same ‘equal?’ recursively, so a
     deep structure can be traversed.

          (equal? (list 1 2 3) (list 1 2 3))   ⇒ #t
          (equal? (list 1 2 3) (vector 1 2 3)) ⇒ #f

     For other objects, ‘equal?’ compares as per ‘eqv?’ above, which
     means characters and numbers are compared by type and value (and
     like ‘eqv?’, exact and inexact numbers are not ‘equal?’, even if
     their value is the same).

          (equal? 3 (+ 1 2)) ⇒ #t
          (equal? 1 1.0)     ⇒ #f

     Hash tables are currently only compared as per ‘eq?’, so two
     different tables are not ‘equal?’, even if their contents are the
     same.

     ‘equal?’ does not support circular data structures, it may go into
     an infinite loop if asked to compare two circular lists or similar.

     GOOPS object types (*note* GOOPS::), including foreign object types
     (*note* Defining New Foreign Object Types::), can have an ‘equal?’
     implementation specialized on two values of the same type.  If
     ‘equal?’ is called on two GOOPS objects of the same type, ‘equal?’
     will dispatch out to a generic function.  This lets an application
     traverse the contents or control what is considered ‘equal?’ for
     two objects of such a type.  If there’s no such handler, the
     default is to just compare as per ‘eq?’.

6.9.2 Object Properties
-----------------------

It’s often useful to associate a piece of additional information with a
Scheme object even though that object does not have a dedicated slot
available in which the additional information could be stored.  Object
properties allow you to do just that.

   Guile’s representation of an object property is a
procedure-with-setter (*note* Procedures with Setters::) that can be used
with the generalized form of ‘set!’ to set and retrieve that property
for any Scheme object.  So, setting a property looks like this:

     (set! (my-property obj1) value-for-obj1)
     (set! (my-property obj2) value-for-obj2)

And retrieving values of the same property looks like this:

     (my-property obj1)
     ⇒
     value-for-obj1

     (my-property obj2)
     ⇒
     value-for-obj2

   To create an object property in the first place, use the
‘make-object-property’ procedure:

     (define my-property (make-object-property))

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-object-property
     Create and return an object property.  An object property is a
     procedure-with-setter that can be called in two ways.  ‘(set!
     (PROPERTY OBJ) VAL)’ sets OBJ’s PROPERTY to VAL.  ‘(PROPERTY OBJ)’
     returns the current setting of OBJ’s PROPERTY.

   A single object property created by ‘make-object-property’ can
associate distinct property values with all Scheme values that are
distinguishable by ‘eq?’ (ruling out numeric values).

   Internally, object properties are implemented using a weak key hash
table.  This means that, as long as a Scheme value with property values
is protected from garbage collection, its property values are also
protected.  When the Scheme value is collected, its entry in the
property table is removed and so the (ex-) property values are no longer
protected by the table.

   Guile also implements a more traditional Lispy interface to
properties, in which each object has an list of key-value pairs
associated with it.  Properties in that list are keyed by symbols.  This
is a legacy interface; you should use weak hash tables or object
properties instead.

 -- Scheme Procedure: object-properties obj
 -- C Function: scm_object_properties (obj)
     Return OBJ’s property list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-object-properties! obj alist
 -- C Function: scm_set_object_properties_x (obj, alist)
     Set OBJ’s property list to ALIST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: object-property obj key
 -- C Function: scm_object_property (obj, key)
     Return the property of OBJ with name KEY.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-object-property! obj key value
 -- C Function: scm_set_object_property_x (obj, key, value)
     In OBJ’s property list, set the property named KEY to VALUE.

6.9.3 Sorting
-------------

Sorting is very important in computer programs.  Therefore, Guile comes
with several sorting procedures built-in.  As always, procedures with
names ending in ‘!’ are side-effecting, that means that they may modify
their parameters in order to produce their results.

   The first group of procedures can be used to merge two lists (which
must be already sorted on their own) and produce sorted lists containing
all elements of the input lists.

 -- Scheme Procedure: merge alist blist less
 -- C Function: scm_merge (alist, blist, less)
     Merge two already sorted lists into one.  Given two lists ALIST and
     BLIST, such that ‘(sorted? alist less?)’ and ‘(sorted? blist
     less?)’, return a new list in which the elements of ALIST and BLIST
     have been stably interleaved so that ‘(sorted? (merge alist blist
     less?) less?)’.  Note: this does _not_ accept vectors.

 -- Scheme Procedure: merge! alist blist less
 -- C Function: scm_merge_x (alist, blist, less)
     Takes two lists ALIST and BLIST such that ‘(sorted? alist less?)’
     and ‘(sorted? blist less?)’ and returns a new list in which the
     elements of ALIST and BLIST have been stably interleaved so that
     ‘(sorted? (merge alist blist less?) less?)’.  This is the
     destructive variant of ‘merge’ Note: this does _not_ accept
     vectors.

   The following procedures can operate on sequences which are either
vectors or list.  According to the given arguments, they return sorted
vectors or lists, respectively.  The first of the following procedures
determines whether a sequence is already sorted, the other sort a given
sequence.  The variants with names starting with ‘stable-’ are special
in that they maintain a special property of the input sequences: If two
or more elements are the same according to the comparison predicate,
they are left in the same order as they appeared in the input.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sorted? items less
 -- C Function: scm_sorted_p (items, less)
     Return ‘#t’ if ITEMS is a list or vector such that, for each
     element X and the next element Y of ITEMS, ‘(LESS Y X)’ returns
     ‘#f’.  Otherwise return ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sort items less
 -- C Function: scm_sort (items, less)
     Sort the sequence ITEMS, which may be a list or a vector.  LESS is
     used for comparing the sequence elements.  This is not a stable
     sort.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sort! items less
 -- C Function: scm_sort_x (items, less)
     Sort the sequence ITEMS, which may be a list or a vector.  LESS is
     used for comparing the sequence elements.  The sorting is
     destructive, that means that the input sequence is modified to
     produce the sorted result.  This is not a stable sort.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stable-sort items less
 -- C Function: scm_stable_sort (items, less)
     Sort the sequence ITEMS, which may be a list or a vector.  LESS is
     used for comparing the sequence elements.  This is a stable sort.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stable-sort! items less
 -- C Function: scm_stable_sort_x (items, less)
     Sort the sequence ITEMS, which may be a list or a vector.  LESS is
     used for comparing the sequence elements.  The sorting is
     destructive, that means that the input sequence is modified to
     produce the sorted result.  This is a stable sort.

   The procedures in the last group only accept lists or vectors as
input, as their names indicate.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sort-list items less
 -- C Function: scm_sort_list (items, less)
     Sort the list ITEMS, using LESS for comparing the list elements.
     This is a stable sort.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sort-list! items less
 -- C Function: scm_sort_list_x (items, less)
     Sort the list ITEMS, using LESS for comparing the list elements.
     The sorting is destructive, that means that the input list is
     modified to produce the sorted result.  This is a stable sort.

 -- Scheme Procedure: restricted-vector-sort! vec less startpos endpos
 -- C Function: scm_restricted_vector_sort_x (vec, less, startpos,
          endpos)
     Sort the vector VEC, using LESS for comparing the vector elements.
     STARTPOS (inclusively) and ENDPOS (exclusively) delimit the range
     of the vector which gets sorted.  The return value is not
     specified.

6.9.4 Copying Deep Structures
-----------------------------

The procedures for copying lists (*note* Lists::) only produce a flat
copy of the input list, and currently Guile does not even contain
procedures for copying vectors.  The ‘(ice-9 copy-tree)’ module contains
a ‘copy-tree’ function that can be used for this purpose, as it does not
only copy the spine of a list, but also copies any pairs in the cars of
the input lists.

     (use-modules (ice-9 copy-tree))

 -- Scheme Procedure: copy-tree obj
 -- C Function: scm_copy_tree (obj)
     Recursively copy the data tree that is bound to OBJ, and return the
     new data structure.  ‘copy-tree’ recurses down the contents of both
     pairs and vectors (since both cons cells and vector cells may point
     to arbitrary objects), and stops recursing when it hits any other
     object.

6.9.5 General String Conversion
-------------------------------

When debugging Scheme programs, but also for providing a human-friendly
interface, a procedure for converting any Scheme object into string
format is very useful.  Conversion from/to strings can of course be done
with specialized procedures when the data type of the object to convert
is known, but with this procedure, it is often more comfortable.

   ‘object->string’ converts an object by using a print procedure for
writing to a string port, and then returning the resulting string.
Converting an object back from the string is only possible if the object
type has a read syntax and the read syntax is preserved by the printing
procedure.

 -- Scheme Procedure: object->string obj [printer]
 -- C Function: scm_object_to_string (obj, printer)
     Return a Scheme string obtained by printing OBJ.  Printing function
     can be specified by the optional second argument PRINTER (default:
     ‘write’).

6.9.6 Hooks
-----------

A hook is a list of procedures to be called at well defined points in
time.  Typically, an application provides a hook H and promises its
users that it will call all of the procedures in H at a defined point in
the application’s processing.  By adding its own procedure to H, an
application user can tap into or even influence the progress of the
application.

   Guile itself provides several such hooks for debugging and
customization purposes: these are listed in a subsection below.

   When an application first creates a hook, it needs to know how many
arguments will be passed to the hook’s procedures when the hook is run.
The chosen number of arguments (which may be none) is declared when the
hook is created, and all the procedures that are added to that hook must
be capable of accepting that number of arguments.

   A hook is created using ‘make-hook’.  A procedure can be added to or
removed from a hook using ‘add-hook!’ or ‘remove-hook!’, and all of a
hook’s procedures can be removed together using ‘reset-hook!’.  When an
application wants to run a hook, it does so using ‘run-hook’.

### 6.9.6.1 Hook Usage by Example
.............................

Hook usage is shown by some examples in this section.  First, we will
define a hook of arity 2 — that is, the procedures stored in the hook
will have to accept two arguments.

     (define hook (make-hook 2))
     hook
     ⇒ #<hook 2 40286c90>

   Now we are ready to add some procedures to the newly created hook
with ‘add-hook!’.  In the following example, two procedures are added,
which print different messages and do different things with their
arguments.

     (add-hook! hook (lambda (x y)
                         (display "Foo: ")
                         (display (+ x y))
                         (newline)))
     (add-hook! hook (lambda (x y)
                         (display "Bar: ")
                         (display (* x y))
                         (newline)))

   Once the procedures have been added, we can invoke the hook using
‘run-hook’.

     (run-hook hook 3 4)
     ⊣ Bar: 12
     ⊣ Foo: 7

   Note that the procedures are called in the reverse of the order with
which they were added.  This is because the default behaviour of
‘add-hook!’ is to add its procedure to the _front_ of the hook’s
procedure list.  You can force ‘add-hook!’ to add its procedure to the
_end_ of the list instead by providing a third ‘#t’ argument on the
second call to ‘add-hook!’.

     (add-hook! hook (lambda (x y)
                         (display "Foo: ")
                         (display (+ x y))
                         (newline)))
     (add-hook! hook (lambda (x y)
                         (display "Bar: ")
                         (display (* x y))
                         (newline))
                         #t)             ; <- Change here!

     (run-hook hook 3 4)
     ⊣ Foo: 7
     ⊣ Bar: 12


File: guile.info,  Node: Hook Reference,  Next: C Hooks,  Prev: Hook Example,  Up: Hooks

### 6.9.6.2 Hook Reference
......................

When you create a hook with ‘make-hook’, you must specify the arity of
the procedures which can be added to the hook.  If the arity is not
given explicitly as an argument to ‘make-hook’, it defaults to zero.
All procedures of a given hook must have the same arity, and when the
procedures are invoked using ‘run-hook’, the number of arguments passed
must match the arity specified at hook creation time.

   The order in which procedures are added to a hook matters.  If the
third parameter to ‘add-hook!’ is omitted or is equal to ‘#f’, the
procedure is added in front of the procedures which might already be on
that hook, otherwise the procedure is added at the end.  The procedures
are always called from the front to the end of the list when they are
invoked via ‘run-hook’.

   The ordering of the list of procedures returned by ‘hook->list’
matches the order in which those procedures would be called if the hook
was run using ‘run-hook’.

   Note that the C functions in the following entries are for handling
“Scheme-level” hooks in C. There are also “C-level” hooks which have
their own interface (*note* C Hooks::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-hook [n_args]
 -- C Function: scm_make_hook (n_args)
     Create a hook for storing procedure of arity N_ARGS.  N_ARGS
     defaults to zero.  The returned value is a hook object to be used
     with the other hook procedures.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hook? x
 -- C Function: scm_hook_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if X is a hook, ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hook-empty? hook
 -- C Function: scm_hook_empty_p (hook)
     Return ‘#t’ if HOOK is an empty hook, ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: add-hook! hook proc [append_p]
 -- C Function: scm_add_hook_x (hook, proc, append_p)
     Add the procedure PROC to the hook HOOK.  The procedure is added to
     the end if APPEND_P is true, otherwise it is added to the front.
     The return value of this procedure is not specified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: remove-hook! hook proc
 -- C Function: scm_remove_hook_x (hook, proc)
     Remove the procedure PROC from the hook HOOK.  The return value of
     this procedure is not specified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: reset-hook! hook
 -- C Function: scm_reset_hook_x (hook)
     Remove all procedures from the hook HOOK.  The return value of this
     procedure is not specified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hook->list hook
 -- C Function: scm_hook_to_list (hook)
     Convert the procedure list of HOOK to a list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: run-hook hook arg ...
 -- C Function: scm_run_hook (hook, args)
     Apply all procedures from the hook HOOK to the arguments ARG ....
     The order of the procedure application is first to last.  The
     return value of this procedure is not specified.

   If, in C code, you are certain that you have a hook object and well
formed argument list for that hook, you can also use ‘scm_c_run_hook’,
which is identical to ‘scm_run_hook’ but does no type checking.

 -- C Function: void scm_c_run_hook (SCM hook, SCM args)
     The same as ‘scm_run_hook’ but without any type checking to confirm
     that HOOK is actually a hook object and that ARGS is a well-formed
     list matching the arity of the hook.

   For C code, ‘SCM_HOOKP’ is a faster alternative to ‘scm_hook_p’:

 -- C Macro: int SCM_HOOKP (x)
     Return 1 if X is a Scheme-level hook, 0 otherwise.

### 6.9.6.3 Hooks For C Code.
.........................

The hooks already described are intended to be populated by Scheme-level
procedures.  In addition to this, the Guile library provides an
independent set of interfaces for the creation and manipulation of hooks
that are designed to be populated by functions implemented in C.

   The original motivation here was to provide a kind of hook that could
safely be invoked at various points during garbage collection.
Scheme-level hooks are unsuitable for this purpose as running them could
itself require memory allocation, which would then invoke garbage
collection recursively ... However, it is also the case that these hooks
are easier to work with than the Scheme-level ones if you only want to
register C functions with them.  So if that is mainly what your code
needs to do, you may prefer to use this interface.

   To create a C hook, you should allocate storage for a structure of
type ‘scm_t_c_hook’ and then initialize it using ‘scm_c_hook_init’.

 -- C Type: scm_t_c_hook
     Data type for a C hook.  The internals of this type should be
     treated as opaque.

 -- C Enum: scm_t_c_hook_type
     Enumeration of possible hook types, which are:

     ‘SCM_C_HOOK_NORMAL’
          Type of hook for which all the registered functions will
          always be called.
     ‘SCM_C_HOOK_OR’
          Type of hook for which the sequence of registered functions
          will be called only until one of them returns C true (a
          non-NULL pointer).
     ‘SCM_C_HOOK_AND’
          Type of hook for which the sequence of registered functions
          will be called only until one of them returns C false (a NULL
          pointer).

 -- C Function: void scm_c_hook_init (scm_t_c_hook *hook, void
          *hook_data, scm_t_c_hook_type type)
     Initialize the C hook at memory pointed to by HOOK.  TYPE should be
     one of the values of the ‘scm_t_c_hook_type’ enumeration, and
     controls how the hook functions will be called.  HOOK_DATA is a
     closure parameter that will be passed to all registered hook
     functions when they are called.

   To add or remove a C function from a C hook, use ‘scm_c_hook_add’ or
‘scm_c_hook_remove’.  A hook function must expect three ‘void *’
parameters which are, respectively:

HOOK_DATA
     The hook closure data that was specified at the time the hook was
     initialized by ‘scm_c_hook_init’.

FUNC_DATA
     The function closure data that was specified at the time that that
     function was registered with the hook by ‘scm_c_hook_add’.

DATA
     The call closure data specified by the ‘scm_c_hook_run’ call that
     runs the hook.

 -- C Type: scm_t_c_hook_function
     Function type for a C hook function: takes three ‘void *’
     parameters and returns a ‘void *’ result.

 -- C Function: void scm_c_hook_add (scm_t_c_hook *hook,
          scm_t_c_hook_function func, void *func_data, int appendp)
     Add function FUNC, with function closure data FUNC_DATA, to the C
     hook HOOK.  The new function is appended to the hook’s list of
     functions if APPENDP is non-zero, otherwise prepended.

 -- C Function: void scm_c_hook_remove (scm_t_c_hook *hook,
          scm_t_c_hook_function func, void *func_data)
     Remove function FUNC, with function closure data FUNC_DATA, from
     the C hook HOOK.  ‘scm_c_hook_remove’ checks both FUNC and
     FUNC_DATA so as to allow for the same FUNC being registered
     multiple times with different closure data.

   Finally, to invoke a C hook, call the ‘scm_c_hook_run’ function
specifying the hook and the call closure data for this run:

 -- C Function: void * scm_c_hook_run (scm_t_c_hook *hook, void *data)
     Run the C hook HOOK will call closure data DATA.  Subject to the
     variations for hook types ‘SCM_C_HOOK_OR’ and ‘SCM_C_HOOK_AND’,
     ‘scm_c_hook_run’ calls HOOK’s registered functions in turn, passing
     them the hook’s closure data, each function’s closure data, and the
     call closure data.

     ‘scm_c_hook_run’’s return value is the return value of the last
     function to be called.

### 6.9.6.4 Hooks for Garbage Collection
....................................

Whenever Guile performs a garbage collection, it calls the following
hooks in the order shown.

 -- C Hook: scm_before_gc_c_hook
     C hook called at the very start of a garbage collection, after
     setting ‘scm_gc_running_p’ to 1, but before entering the GC
     critical section.

     If garbage collection is blocked because ‘scm_block_gc’ is
     non-zero, GC exits early soon after calling this hook, and no
     further hooks will be called.

 -- C Hook: scm_before_mark_c_hook
     C hook called before beginning the mark phase of garbage
     collection, after the GC thread has entered a critical section.

 -- C Hook: scm_before_sweep_c_hook
     C hook called before beginning the sweep phase of garbage
     collection.  This is the same as at the end of the mark phase,
     since nothing else happens between marking and sweeping.

 -- C Hook: scm_after_sweep_c_hook
     C hook called after the end of the sweep phase of garbage
     collection, but while the GC thread is still inside its critical
     section.

 -- C Hook: scm_after_gc_c_hook
     C hook called at the very end of a garbage collection, after the GC
     thread has left its critical section.

 -- Scheme Hook: after-gc-hook
     Scheme hook with arity 0.  This hook is run asynchronously (*note*
     Asyncs::) soon after the GC has completed and any other events that
     were deferred during garbage collection have been processed.  (Also
     accessible from C with the name ‘scm_after_gc_hook’.)

   All the C hooks listed here have type ‘SCM_C_HOOK_NORMAL’, are
initialized with hook closure data NULL, are invoked by ‘scm_c_hook_run’
with call closure data NULL.

   The Scheme hook ‘after-gc-hook’ is particularly useful in conjunction
with guardians (*note* Guardians::).  Typically, if you are using a
guardian, you want to call the guardian after garbage collection to see
if any of the objects added to the guardian have been collected.  By
adding a thunk that performs this call to ‘after-gc-hook’, you can
ensure that your guardian is tested after every garbage collection
cycle.

6.10 Definitions and Variable Bindings
======================================

Scheme supports the definition of variables in different contexts.
Variables can be defined at the top level, so that they are visible in
the entire program, and variables can be defined locally to procedures
and expressions.  This is important for modularity and data abstraction.

* Menu:

* Top Level::                   Top level variable definitions.
* Local Bindings::              Local variable bindings.
* Internal Definitions::        Internal definitions.
* Binding Reflection::          Querying variable bindings.
* Binding Multiple Values::     Binding multiple return values.


File: guile.info,  Node: Top Level,  Next: Local Bindings,  Up: Binding Constructs

6.10.1 Top Level Variable Definitions
-------------------------------------

At the top level of a program (i.e., not nested within any other
expression), a definition of the form

     (define a VALUE)

defines a variable called ‘a’ and sets it to the value VALUE.

   If the variable already exists in the current module, because it has
already been created by a previous ‘define’ expression with the same
name, its value is simply changed to the new VALUE.  In this case, then,
the above form is completely equivalent to

     (set! a VALUE)

This equivalence means that ‘define’ can be used interchangeably with
‘set!’ to change the value of variables at the top level of the REPL or
a Scheme source file.  It is useful during interactive development when
reloading a Scheme file that you have modified, because it allows the
‘define’ expressions in that file to work as expected both the first
time that the file is loaded and on subsequent occasions.

   Note, though, that ‘define’ and ‘set!’ are not always equivalent.
For example, a ‘set!’ is not allowed if the named variable does not
already exist, and the two expressions can behave differently in the
case where there are imported variables visible from another module.

 -- Scheme Syntax: define name value
     Create a top level variable named NAME with value VALUE.  If the
     named variable already exists, just change its value.  The return
     value of a ‘define’ expression is unspecified.

   The C API equivalents of ‘define’ are ‘scm_define’ and
‘scm_c_define’, which differ from each other in whether the variable
name is specified as a ‘SCM’ symbol or as a null-terminated C string.

 -- C Function: scm_define (sym, value)
 -- C Function: scm_c_define (const char *name, value)
     C equivalents of ‘define’, with variable name specified either by
     SYM, a symbol, or by NAME, a null-terminated C string.  Both
     variants return the new or preexisting variable object.

   ‘define’ (when it occurs at top level), ‘scm_define’ and
‘scm_c_define’ all create or set the value of a variable in the top
level environment of the current module.  If there was not already a
variable with the specified name belonging to the current module, but a
similarly named variable from another module was visible through having
been imported, the newly created variable in the current module will
shadow the imported variable, such that the imported variable is no
longer visible.

   Attention: Scheme definitions inside local binding constructs (*note*
Local Bindings::) act differently (*note* Internal Definitions::).

   Many people end up in a development style of adding and changing
definitions at runtime, building out their program without restarting
it.  (You can do this using ‘reload-module’, the ‘reload’ REPL command,
the ‘load’ procedure, or even just pasting code into a REPL.) If you are
one of these people, you will find that sometimes there are some
variables that you _don’t_ want to redefine all the time.  For these,
use ‘define-once’.

 -- Scheme Syntax: define-once name value
     Create a top level variable named NAME with value VALUE, but only
     if NAME is not already bound in the current module.

   Old Lispers probably know ‘define-once’ under its Lisp name,
‘defvar’.

6.10.2 Local Variable Bindings
------------------------------

As opposed to definitions at the top level, which creates bindings that
are visible to all code in a module, it is also possible to define
variables which are only visible in a well-defined part of the program.
Normally, this part of a program will be a procedure or a subexpression
of a procedure.

   With the constructs for local binding (‘let’, ‘let*’, ‘letrec’, and
‘letrec*’), the Scheme language has a block structure like most other
programming languages since the days of ALGOL 60.  Readers familiar to
languages like C or Java should already be used to this concept, but the
family of ‘let’ expressions has a few properties which are well worth
knowing.

   The most basic local binding construct is ‘let’.

 -- syntax: let bindings body
     BINDINGS has the form

          ((VARIABLE1 INIT1) ...)

     that is zero or more two-element lists of a variable and an
     arbitrary expression each.  All VARIABLE names must be distinct.

     A ‘let’ expression is evaluated as follows.

        • All INIT expressions are evaluated.

        • New storage is allocated for the VARIABLES.

        • The values of the INIT expressions are stored into the
          variables.

        • The expressions in BODY are evaluated in order, and the value
          of the last expression is returned as the value of the ‘let’
          expression.

     The INIT expressions are not allowed to refer to any of the
     VARIABLES.

   The other binding constructs are variations on the same theme: making
new values, binding them to variables, and executing a body in that new,
extended lexical context.

 -- syntax: let* bindings body
     Similar to ‘let’, but the variable bindings are performed
     sequentially, that means that all INIT expression are allowed to
     use the variables defined on their left in the binding list.

     A ‘let*’ expression can always be expressed with nested ‘let’
     expressions.

          (let* ((a 1) (b a))
             b)
          ≡
          (let ((a 1))
            (let ((b a))
              b))

 -- syntax: letrec bindings body
     Similar to ‘let’, but it is possible to refer to the VARIABLE from
     lambda expression created in any of the INITS.  That is, procedures
     created in the INIT expression can recursively refer to the defined
     variables.

          (letrec ((even? (lambda (n)
                            (if (zero? n)
                                #t
                                (odd? (- n 1)))))
                   (odd? (lambda (n)
                            (if (zero? n)
                                #f
                                (even? (- n 1))))))
            (even? 88))
          ⇒
          #t

     Note that while the INIT expressions may refer to the new
     variables, they may not access their values.  For example, making
     the ‘even?’ function above creates a closure (*note* About
     Closure::) referencing the ‘odd?’ variable.  But ‘odd?’ can’t be
     called until after execution has entered the body.

 -- syntax: letrec* bindings body
     Similar to ‘letrec’, except the INIT expressions are bound to their
     variables in order.

     ‘letrec*’ thus relaxes the letrec restriction, in that later INIT
     expressions may refer to the values of previously bound variables.

          (letrec ((a 42)
                   (b (+ a 10)))  ;; Illegal access
            (* a b))
          ;; The behavior of the expression above is unspecified

          (letrec* ((a 42)
                    (b (+ a 10)))
            (* a b))
          ⇒ 2184

   There is also an alternative form of the ‘let’ form, which is used
for expressing iteration.  Because of the use as a looping construct,
this form (the “named let”) is documented in the section about iteration
(*note* Iteration: while do.)


File: guile.info,  Node: Internal Definitions,  Next: Binding Reflection,  Prev: Local Bindings,  Up: Binding Constructs

6.10.3 Internal definitions
---------------------------

A ‘define’ form which appears inside the body of a ‘lambda’, ‘let’,
‘let*’, ‘letrec’, ‘letrec*’ or equivalent expression is called an
“internal definition”.  An internal definition differs from a top level
definition (*note* Top Level::), because the definition is only visible
inside the complete body of the enclosing form.  Let us examine the
following example.

     (let ((frumble "froz"))
       (define banana (lambda () (apple 'peach)))
       (define apple (lambda (x) x))
       (banana))
     ⇒
     peach

   Here the enclosing form is a ‘let’, so the ‘define’s in the
‘let’-body are internal definitions.  Because the scope of the internal
definitions is the *complete* body of the ‘let’-expression, the
‘lambda’-expression which gets bound to the variable ‘banana’ may refer
to the variable ‘apple’, even though its definition appears lexically
_after_ the definition of ‘banana’.  This is because a sequence of
internal definition acts as if it were a ‘letrec*’ expression.

     (let ()
       (define a 1)
       (define b 2)
       (+ a b))

is equivalent to

     (let ()
       (letrec* ((a 1) (b 2))
         (+ a b)))

   Internal definitions may be mixed with non-definition expressions.
If an expression precedes a definition, it is treated as if it were a
definition of an unreferenced variable.  So this:

     (let ()
       (define a 1)
       (foo)
       (define b 2)
       (+ a b))

is equivalent to

     (let ()
       (letrec* ((a 1) (_ (begin (foo) #f)) (b 2))
         (+ a b)))

   Another noteworthy difference to top level definitions is that within
one group of internal definitions all variable names must be distinct.
Whereas on the top level a second define for a given variable acts like
a ‘set!’, for internal definitions, duplicate bound identifiers signals
an error.

   As a historical note, it used to be that internal bindings were
expanded in terms of ‘letrec’, not ‘letrec*’.  This was the situation
for the R5RS report and before.  However with the R6RS, it was
recognized that sequential definition was a more intuitive expansion, as
in the following case:

     (let ()
       (define a 1)
       (define b (+ a a))
       (+ a b))

Guile decided to follow the R6RS in this regard, and now expands
internal definitions using ‘letrec*’.  Relatedly, it used to be that
internal definitions had to precede all expressions in the body; this
restriction was relaxed in Guile 3.0.

6.10.4 Querying variable bindings
---------------------------------

Guile provides a procedure for checking whether a symbol is bound in the
top level environment.

 -- Scheme Procedure: defined? sym [module]
 -- C Function: scm_defined_p (sym, module)
     Return ‘#t’ if SYM is defined in the module MODULE or the current
     module when MODULE is not specified; otherwise return ‘#f’.

6.10.5 Binding multiple return values
-------------------------------------

 -- Syntax: define-values formals expression
     The EXPRESSION is evaluated, and the FORMALS are bound to the
     return values in the same way that the formals in a ‘lambda’
     expression are matched to the arguments in a procedure call.

     (define-values (q r) (floor/ 10 3))
     (list q r) ⇒ (3 1)

     (define-values (x . y) (values 1 2 3))
     x ⇒ 1
     y ⇒ (2 3)

     (define-values x (values 1 2 3))
     x ⇒ (1 2 3)

6.11.1 Sequencing and Splicing
------------------------------

As an expression, the ‘begin’ syntax is used to evaluate a sequence of
sub-expressions in order.  Consider the conditional expression below:

     (if (> x 0)
         (begin (display "greater") (newline)))

   If the test is true, we want to display “greater” to the current
output port, then display a newline.  We use ‘begin’ to form a compound
expression out of this sequence of sub-expressions.

 -- syntax: begin expr ...
     The expression(s) are evaluated in left-to-right order and the
     value of the last expression is returned as the value of the
     ‘begin’-expression.  This expression type is used when the
     expressions before the last one are evaluated for their side
     effects.

   The ‘begin’ syntax has another role in definition context (*note*
Internal Definitions::).  A ‘begin’ form in a definition context
“splices” its subforms into its place.  For example, consider the
following procedure:

     (define (make-seal)
       (define-sealant seal open)
       (values seal open))

   Let us assume the existence of a ‘define-sealant’ macro that expands
out to some definitions wrapped in a ‘begin’, like so:

     (define (make-seal)
       (begin
         (define seal-tag
           (list 'seal))
         (define (seal x)
           (cons seal-tag x))
         (define (sealed? x)
           (and (pair? x) (eq? (car x) seal-tag)))
         (define (open x)
           (if (sealed? x)
               (cdr x)
               (error "Expected a sealed value:" x))))
       (values seal open))

   Here, because the ‘begin’ is in definition context, its subforms are
“spliced” into the place of the ‘begin’.  This allows the definitions
created by the macro to be visible to the following expression, the
‘values’ form.

   It is a fine point, but splicing and sequencing are different.  It
can make sense to splice zero forms, because it can make sense to have
zero internal definitions before the expressions in a procedure or
lexical binding form.  However it does not make sense to have a sequence
of zero expressions, because in that case it would not be clear what the
value of the sequence would be, because in a sequence of zero
expressions, there can be no last value.  Sequencing zero expressions is
an error.

   It would be more elegant in some ways to eliminate splicing from the
Scheme language, and without macros (*note* Macros::), that would be a
good idea.  But it is useful to be able to write macros that expand out
to multiple definitions, as in ‘define-sealant’ above, so Scheme abuses
the ‘begin’ form for these two tasks.

6.11.2 Simple Conditional Evaluation
------------------------------------

Guile provides three syntactic constructs for conditional evaluation.
‘if’ is the normal if-then-else expression (with an optional else
branch), ‘cond’ is a conditional expression with multiple branches and
‘case’ branches if an expression has one of a set of constant values.

 -- syntax: if test consequent [alternate]
     All arguments may be arbitrary expressions.  First, TEST is
     evaluated.  If it returns a true value, the expression CONSEQUENT
     is evaluated and ALTERNATE is ignored.  If TEST evaluates to ‘#f’,
     ALTERNATE is evaluated instead.  The values of the evaluated branch
     (CONSEQUENT or ALTERNATE) are returned as the values of the ‘if’
     expression.

     When ALTERNATE is omitted and the TEST evaluates to ‘#f’, the value
     of the expression is not specified.

   When you go to write an ‘if’ without an alternate (a “one-armed
‘if’”), part of what you are expressing is that you don’t care about the
return value (or values) of the expression.  As such, you are more
interested in the _effect_ of evaluating the consequent expression.  (By
convention, we use the word “statement” to refer to an expression that
is evaluated for effect, not for value).

   In such a case, it is considered more clear to express these
intentions with these special forms, ‘when’ and ‘unless’.  As an added
bonus, these forms accept multiple statements to evaluate, which are
implicitly wrapped in a ‘begin’.

 -- Scheme Syntax: when test statement1 statement2 ...
 -- Scheme Syntax: unless test statement1 statement2 ...
     The actual definitions of these forms are in many ways their most
     clear documentation:

          (define-syntax-rule (when test stmt stmt* ...)
            (if test (begin stmt stmt* ...)))

          (define-syntax-rule (unless test stmt stmt* ...)
            (if (not test) (begin stmt stmt* ...)))

     That is to say, ‘when’ evaluates its consequent statements in order
     if TEST is true.  ‘unless’ is the opposite: it evaluates the
     statements if TEST is false.

 -- syntax: cond clause1 clause2 ...
     Each ‘cond’-clause must look like this:

          (TEST EXPRESSION ...)

     where TEST and EXPRESSION are arbitrary expressions, or like this

          (TEST => EXPRESSION)

     where EXPRESSION must evaluate to a procedure.

     The TESTs of the clauses are evaluated in order and as soon as one
     of them evaluates to a true value, the corresponding EXPRESSIONs
     are evaluated in order and the last value is returned as the value
     of the ‘cond’-expression.  For the ‘=>’ clause type, EXPRESSION is
     evaluated and the resulting procedure is applied to the value of
     TEST.  The result of this procedure application is then the result
     of the ‘cond’-expression.

     One additional ‘cond’-clause is available as an extension to
     standard Scheme:

          (TEST GUARD => EXPRESSION)

     where GUARD and EXPRESSION must evaluate to procedures.  For this
     clause type, TEST may return multiple values, and ‘cond’ ignores
     its boolean state; instead, ‘cond’ evaluates GUARD and applies the
     resulting procedure to the value(s) of TEST, as if GUARD were the
     CONSUMER argument of ‘call-with-values’.  If the result of that
     procedure call is a true value, it evaluates EXPRESSION and applies
     the resulting procedure to the value(s) of TEST, in the same manner
     as the GUARD was called.

     The TEST of the last CLAUSE may be the symbol ‘else’.  Then, if
     none of the preceding TESTs is true, the EXPRESSIONs following the
     ‘else’ are evaluated to produce the result of the
     ‘cond’-expression.

 -- syntax: case key clause1 clause2 ...
     KEY may be any expression, and the CLAUSEs must have the form

          ((DATUM1 ...) EXPR1 EXPR2 ...)

     or

          ((DATUM1 ...) => EXPRESSION)

     and the last CLAUSE may have the form

          (else EXPR1 EXPR2 ...)

     or

          (else => EXPRESSION)

     All DATUMs must be distinct.  First, KEY is evaluated.  The result
     of this evaluation is compared against all DATUM values using
     ‘eqv?’.  When this comparison succeeds, the expression(s) following
     the DATUM are evaluated from left to right, returning the value of
     the last expression as the result of the ‘case’ expression.

     If the KEY matches no DATUM and there is an ‘else’-clause, the
     expressions following the ‘else’ are evaluated.  If there is no
     such clause, the result of the expression is unspecified.

     For the ‘=>’ clause types, EXPRESSION is evaluated and the
     resulting procedure is applied to the value of KEY.  The result of
     this procedure application is then the result of the
     ‘case’-expression.

6.11.3 Conditional Evaluation of a Sequence of Expressions
----------------------------------------------------------

‘and’ and ‘or’ evaluate all their arguments in order, similar to
‘begin’, but evaluation stops as soon as one of the expressions
evaluates to false or true, respectively.

 -- syntax: and expr ...
     Evaluate the EXPRs from left to right and stop evaluation as soon
     as one expression evaluates to ‘#f’; the remaining expressions are
     not evaluated.  The value of the last evaluated expression is
     returned.  If no expression evaluates to ‘#f’, the value of the
     last expression is returned.

     If used without expressions, ‘#t’ is returned.

 -- syntax: or expr ...
     Evaluate the EXPRs from left to right and stop evaluation as soon
     as one expression evaluates to a true value (that is, a value
     different from ‘#f’); the remaining expressions are not evaluated.
     The value of the last evaluated expression is returned.  If all
     expressions evaluate to ‘#f’, ‘#f’ is returned.

     If used without expressions, ‘#f’ is returned.

6.11.4 Iteration mechanisms
---------------------------

Scheme has only few iteration mechanisms, mainly because iteration in
Scheme programs is normally expressed using recursion.  Nevertheless,
R5RS defines a construct for programming loops, calling ‘do’.  In
addition, Guile has an explicit looping syntax called ‘while’.

 -- syntax: do ((variable init [step]) ...) (test expr ...) body ...
     Bind VARIABLEs and evaluate BODY until TEST is true.  The return
     value is the last EXPR after TEST, if given.  A simple example will
     illustrate the basic form,

          (do ((i 1 (1+ i)))
              ((> i 4))
            (display i))
          ⊣ 1234

     Or with two variables and a final return value,

          (do ((i 1 (1+ i))
               (p 3 (* 3 p)))
              ((> i 4)
               p)
            (format #t "3**~s is ~s\n" i p))
          ⊣
          3**1 is 3
          3**2 is 9
          3**3 is 27
          3**4 is 81
          ⇒
          243

     The VARIABLE bindings are established like a ‘let’, in that the
     expressions are all evaluated and then all bindings made.  When
     iterating, the optional STEP expressions are evaluated with the
     previous bindings in scope, then new bindings all made.

     The TEST expression is a termination condition.  Looping stops when
     the TEST is true.  It’s evaluated before running the BODY each
     time, so if it’s true the first time then BODY is not run at all.

     The optional EXPRs after the TEST are evaluated at the end of
     looping, with the final VARIABLE bindings available.  The last EXPR
     gives the return value, or if there are no EXPRs the return value
     is unspecified.

     Each iteration establishes bindings to fresh locations for the
     VARIABLEs, like a new ‘let’ for each iteration.  This is done for
     VARIABLEs without STEP expressions too.  The following illustrates
     this, showing how a new ‘i’ is captured by the ‘lambda’ in each
     iteration (*note* The Concept of Closure: About Closure.).

          (define lst '())
          (do ((i 1 (1+ i)))
              ((> i 4))
            (set! lst (cons (lambda () i) lst)))
          (map (lambda (proc) (proc)) lst)
          ⇒
          (4 3 2 1)

 -- syntax: while cond body ...
     Run a loop executing the BODY forms while COND is true.  COND is
     tested at the start of each iteration, so if it’s ‘#f’ the first
     time then BODY is not executed at all.

     Within ‘while’, two extra bindings are provided, they can be used
     from both COND and BODY.

      -- Scheme Procedure: break break-arg ...
          Break out of the ‘while’ form.

      -- Scheme Procedure: continue
          Abandon the current iteration, go back to the start and test
          COND again, etc.

     If the loop terminates normally, by the COND evaluating to ‘#f’,
     then the ‘while’ expression as a whole evaluates to ‘#f’.  If it
     terminates by a call to ‘break’ with some number of arguments,
     those arguments are returned from the ‘while’ expression, as
     multiple values.  Otherwise if it terminates by a call to ‘break’
     with no arguments, then return value is ‘#t’.

          (while #f (error "not reached")) ⇒ #f
          (while #t (break)) ⇒ #t
          (while #t (break 1 2 3)) ⇒ 1 2 3

     Each ‘while’ form gets its own ‘break’ and ‘continue’ procedures,
     operating on that ‘while’.  This means when loops are nested the
     outer ‘break’ can be used to escape all the way out.  For example,

          (while (test1)
            (let ((outer-break break))
              (while (test2)
                (if (something)
                  (outer-break #f))
                ...)))

     Note that each ‘break’ and ‘continue’ procedure can only be used
     within the dynamic extent of its ‘while’.  Outside the ‘while’
     their behaviour is unspecified.

   Another very common way of expressing iteration in Scheme programs is
the use of the so-called “named let”.

   Named let is a variant of ‘let’ which creates a procedure and calls
it in one step.  Because of the newly created procedure, named let is
more powerful than ‘do’–it can be used for iteration, but also for
arbitrary recursion.

 -- syntax: let variable bindings body
     For the definition of BINDINGS see the documentation about ‘let’
     (*note* Local Bindings::).

     Named ‘let’ works as follows:

        • A new procedure which accepts as many arguments as are in
          BINDINGS is created and bound locally (using ‘let’) to
          VARIABLE.  The new procedure’s formal argument names are the
          name of the VARIABLES.

        • The BODY expressions are inserted into the newly created
          procedure.

        • The procedure is called with the INIT expressions as the
          formal arguments.

     The next example implements a loop which iterates (by recursion)
     1000 times.

          (let lp ((x 1000))
            (if (positive? x)
                (lp (- x 1))
                x))
          ⇒
          0

6.11.5 Prompts
--------------

Prompts are control-flow barriers between different parts of a program.
In the same way that a user sees a shell prompt (e.g., the Bash prompt)
as a barrier between the operating system and her programs, Scheme
prompts allow the Scheme programmer to treat parts of programs as if
they were running in different operating systems.

   We use this roundabout explanation because, unless you’re a
functional programming junkie, you probably haven’t heard the term,
“delimited, composable continuation”.  That’s OK; it’s a relatively
recent topic, but a very useful one to know about.

File: guile.info,  Node: Prompt Primitives,  Next: Shift and Reset,  Up: Prompts

### 6.11.5.1 Prompt Primitives
..........................

Guile’s primitive delimited control operators are ‘call-with-prompt’ and
‘abort-to-prompt’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-prompt tag thunk handler
     Set up a prompt, and call THUNK within that prompt.

     During the dynamic extent of the call to THUNK, a prompt named TAG
     will be present in the dynamic context, such that if a user calls
     ‘abort-to-prompt’ (see below) with that tag, control rewinds back
     to the prompt, and the HANDLER is run.

     HANDLER must be a procedure.  The first argument to HANDLER will be
     the state of the computation begun when THUNK was called, and
     ending with the call to ‘abort-to-prompt’.  The remaining arguments
     to HANDLER are those passed to ‘abort-to-prompt’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-prompt-tag [stem]
     Make a new prompt tag.  A prompt tag is simply a unique object.
     Currently, a prompt tag is a fresh pair.  This may change in some
     future Guile version.

 -- Scheme Procedure: default-prompt-tag
     Return the default prompt tag.  Having a distinguished default
     prompt tag allows some useful prompt and abort idioms, discussed in
     the next section.  Note that ‘default-prompt-tag’ is actually a
     parameter, and so may be dynamically rebound using ‘parameterize’.
     *Note* Parameters::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: abort-to-prompt tag val1 val2 ...
     Unwind the dynamic and control context to the nearest prompt named
     TAG, also passing the given values.

   C programmers may recognize ‘call-with-prompt’ and ‘abort-to-prompt’
as a fancy kind of ‘setjmp’ and ‘longjmp’, respectively.  Prompts are
indeed quite useful as non-local escape mechanisms.  Guile’s
‘with-exception-handler’ and ‘raise-exception’ are implemented in terms
of prompts.  Prompts are more convenient than ‘longjmp’, in that one has
the opportunity to pass multiple values to the jump target.

   Also unlike ‘longjmp’, the prompt handler is given the full state of
the process that was aborted, as the first argument to the prompt’s
handler.  That state is the “continuation” of the computation wrapped by
the prompt.  It is a “delimited continuation”, because it is not the
whole continuation of the program; rather, just the computation
initiated by the call to ‘call-with-prompt’.

   The continuation is a procedure, and may be reinstated simply by
invoking it, with any number of values.  Here’s where things get
interesting, and complicated as well.  Besides being described as
delimited, continuations reified by prompts are also “composable”,
because invoking a prompt-saved continuation composes that continuation
with the current one.

   Imagine you have saved a continuation via call-with-prompt:

     (define cont
       (call-with-prompt
        ;; tag
        'foo
        ;; thunk
        (lambda ()
          (+ 34 (abort-to-prompt 'foo)))
        ;; handler
        (lambda (k) k)))

   The resulting continuation is the addition of 34.  It’s as if you had
written:

     (define cont
       (lambda (x)
         (+ 34 x)))

   So, if we call ‘cont’ with one numeric value, we get that number,
incremented by 34:

     (cont 8)
     ⇒ 42
     (* 2 (cont 8))
     ⇒ 84

   The last example illustrates what we mean when we say, "composes with
the current continuation".  We mean that there is a current continuation
– some remaining things to compute, like ‘(lambda (x) (* x 2))’ – and
that calling the saved continuation doesn’t wipe out the current
continuation, it composes the saved continuation with the current one.

   We’re belaboring the point here because traditional Scheme
continuations, as discussed in the next section, aren’t composable, and
are actually less expressive than continuations captured by prompts.
But there’s a place for them both.

   Before moving on, we should mention that if the handler of a prompt
is a ‘lambda’ expression, and the first argument isn’t referenced, an
abort to that prompt will not cause a continuation to be reified.  This
can be an important efficiency consideration to keep in mind.

   One example where this optimization matters is “escape
continuations”.  Escape continuations are delimited continuations whose
only use is to make a non-local exit—i.e., to escape from the current
continuation.  A common use of escape continuations is when handling an
exception (*note* Exceptions::).

   The constructs below are syntactic sugar atop prompts to simplify the
use of escape continuations.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-escape-continuation proc
 -- Scheme Procedure: call/ec proc
     Call PROC with an escape continuation.

     In the example below, the RETURN continuation is used to escape the
     continuation of the call to ‘fold’.

          (use-modules (ice-9 control)
                       (srfi srfi-1))

          (define (prefix x lst)
            ;; Return all the elements before the first occurrence
            ;; of X in LST.
            (call/ec
              (lambda (return)
                (fold (lambda (element prefix)
                        (if (equal? element x)
                            (return (reverse prefix))  ; escape `fold'
                            (cons element prefix)))
                      '()
                      lst))))

          (prefix 'a '(0 1 2 a 3 4 5))
          ⇒ (0 1 2)

 -- Scheme Syntax: let-escape-continuation k body ...
 -- Scheme Syntax: let/ec k body ...
     Bind K within BODY to an escape continuation.

     This is equivalent to ‘(call/ec (lambda (K) BODY ...))’.

   Additionally there is another helper primitive exported by ‘(ice-9
control)’, so load up that module for ‘suspendable-continuation?’:

     (use-modules (ice-9 control))

 -- Scheme Procedure: suspendable-continuation? tag
     Return ‘#t’ if a call to ‘abort-to-prompt’ with the prompt tag TAG
     would produce a delimited continuation that could be resumed later.

     Almost all continuations have this property.  The exception is
     where some code between the ‘call-with-prompt’ and the
     ‘abort-to-prompt’ recursed through C for some reason, the
     ‘abort-to-prompt’ will succeed but any attempt to resume the
     continuation (by calling it) would fail.  This is because composing
     a saved continuation with the current continuation involves
     relocating the stack frames that were saved from the old stack onto
     a (possibly) new position on the new stack, and Guile can only do
     this for stack frames that it created for Scheme code, not stack
     frames created by the C compiler.  It’s a bit gnarly but if you
     stick with Scheme, you won’t have any problem.

     If no prompt is found with the given tag, this procedure just
     returns ‘#f’.

### 6.11.5.2 Shift, Reset, and All That
...................................

There is a whole zoo of delimited control operators, and as it does not
seem to be a bounded set, Guile implements support for them in a
separate module:

     (use-modules (ice-9 control))

   Firstly, we have a helpful abbreviation for the ‘call-with-prompt’
operator.

 -- Scheme Syntax: % expr
 -- Scheme Syntax: % expr handler
 -- Scheme Syntax: % tag expr handler
     Evaluate EXPR in a prompt, optionally specifying a tag and a
     handler.  If no tag is given, the default prompt tag is used.

     If no handler is given, a default handler is installed.  The
     default handler accepts a procedure of one argument, which will be
     called on the captured continuation, within a prompt.

     Sometimes it’s easier just to show code, as in this case:

          (define (default-prompt-handler k proc)
            (% (default-prompt-tag)
               (proc k)
               default-prompt-handler))

     The ‘%’ symbol is chosen because it looks like a prompt.

   Likewise there is an abbreviation for ‘abort-to-prompt’, which
assumes the default prompt tag:

 -- Scheme Procedure: abort val1 val2 ...
     Abort to the default prompt tag, passing VAL1 VAL2 ... to the
     handler.

   As mentioned before, ‘(ice-9 control)’ also provides other delimited
control operators.  This section is a bit technical, and first-time
users of delimited continuations should probably come back to it after
some practice with ‘%’.

   Still here?  So, when one implements a delimited control operator
like ‘call-with-prompt’, one needs to make two decisions.  Firstly, does
the handler run within or outside the prompt?  Having the handler run
within the prompt allows an abort inside the handler to return to the
same prompt handler, which is often useful.  However it prevents tail
calls from the handler, so it is less general.

   Similarly, does invoking a captured continuation reinstate a prompt?
Again we have the tradeoff of convenience versus proper tail calls.

   These decisions are captured in the Felleisen “F” operator.  If
neither the continuations nor the handlers implicitly add a prompt, the
operator is known as “–F–”.  This is the case for Guile’s
‘call-with-prompt’ and ‘abort-to-prompt’.

   If both continuation and handler implicitly add prompts, then the
operator is “+F+”.  ‘shift’ and ‘reset’ are such operators.

 -- Scheme Syntax: reset body1 body2 ...
     Establish a prompt, and evaluate BODY1 BODY2 ... within that
     prompt.

     The prompt handler is designed to work with ‘shift’, described
     below.

 -- Scheme Syntax: shift cont body1 body2 ...
     Abort to the nearest ‘reset’, and evaluate BODY1 BODY2 ... in a
     context in which the captured continuation is bound to CONT.

     As mentioned above, taken together, the BODY1 BODY2 ... expressions
     and the invocations of CONT implicitly establish a prompt.

   Interested readers are invited to explore Oleg Kiselyov’s wonderful
web site at <http://okmij.org/ftp/>, for more information on these
operators.


File: guile.info,  Node: Continuations,  Next: Multiple Values,  Prev: Prompts,  Up: Control Mechanisms

6.11.6 Continuations
--------------------

A “continuation” is the code that will execute when a given function or
expression returns.  For example, consider

     (define (foo)
       (display "hello\n")
       (display (bar)) (newline)
       (exit))

   The continuation from the call to ‘bar’ comprises a ‘display’ of the
value returned, a ‘newline’ and an ‘exit’.  This can be expressed as a
function of one argument.

     (lambda (r)
       (display r) (newline)
       (exit))

   In Scheme, continuations are represented as special procedures just
like this.  The special property is that when a continuation is called
it abandons the current program location and jumps directly to that
represented by the continuation.

   A continuation is like a dynamic label, capturing at run-time a point
in program execution, including all the nested calls that have lead to
it (or rather the code that will execute when those calls return).

   Continuations are created with the following functions.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-current-continuation proc
 -- Scheme Procedure: call/cc proc
     Capture the current continuation and call ‘(PROC CONT)’ with it.
     The return value is the value returned by PROC, or when ‘(CONT
     VALUE)’ is later invoked, the return is the VALUE passed.

     Normally CONT should be called with one argument, but when the
     location resumed is expecting multiple values (*note* Multiple
     Values::) then they should be passed as multiple arguments, for
     instance ‘(CONT X Y Z)’.

     CONT may only be used from the same side of a continuation barrier
     as it was created (*note* Continuation Barriers::), and in a
     multi-threaded program only from the thread in which it was
     created.

     The call to PROC is not part of the continuation captured, it runs
     only when the continuation is created.  Often a program will want
     to store CONT somewhere for later use; this can be done in PROC.

     The ‘call’ in the name ‘call-with-current-continuation’ refers to
     the way a call to PROC gives the newly created continuation.  It’s
     not related to the way a call is used later to invoke that
     continuation.

     ‘call/cc’ is an alias for ‘call-with-current-continuation’.  This
     is in common use since the latter is rather long.


Here is a simple example,

     (define kont #f)
     (format #t "the return is ~a\n"
             (call/cc (lambda (k)
                        (set! kont k)
                        1)))
     ⇒ the return is 1

     (kont 2)
     ⇒ the return is 2

   ‘call/cc’ captures a continuation in which the value returned is
going to be displayed by ‘format’.  The ‘lambda’ stores this in ‘kont’
and gives an initial return ‘1’ which is displayed.  The later
invocation of ‘kont’ resumes the captured point, but this time returning
‘2’, which is displayed.

   When Guile is run interactively, a call to ‘format’ like this has an
implicit return back to the read-eval-print loop.  ‘call/cc’ captures
that like any other return, which is why interactively ‘kont’ will come
back to read more input.


   C programmers may note that ‘call/cc’ is like ‘setjmp’ in the way it
records at runtime a point in program execution.  A call to a
continuation is like a ‘longjmp’ in that it abandons the present
location and goes to the recorded one.  Like ‘longjmp’, the value passed
to the continuation is the value returned by ‘call/cc’ on resuming
there.  However ‘longjmp’ can only go up the program stack, but the
continuation mechanism can go anywhere.

   When a continuation is invoked, ‘call/cc’ and subsequent code
effectively “returns” a second time.  It can be confusing to imagine a
function returning more times than it was called.  It may help instead
to think of it being stealthily re-entered and then program flow going
on as normal.

   ‘dynamic-wind’ (*note* Dynamic Wind::) can be used to ensure setup and
cleanup code is run when a program locus is resumed or abandoned through
the continuation mechanism.


   Continuations are a powerful mechanism, and can be used to implement
almost any sort of control structure, such as loops, coroutines, or
exception handlers.

   However the implementation of continuations in Guile is not as
efficient as one might hope, because Guile is designed to cooperate with
programs written in other languages, such as C, which do not know about
continuations.  Basically continuations are captured by a block copy of
the stack, and resumed by copying back.

   For this reason, continuations captured by ‘call/cc’ should be used
only when there is no other simple way to achieve the desired result, or
when the elegance of the continuation mechanism outweighs the need for
performance.

   Escapes upwards from loops or nested functions are generally best
handled with prompts (*note* Prompts::).  Coroutines can be efficiently
implemented with cooperating threads (a thread holds a full program
stack but doesn’t copy it around the way continuations do).

6.11.7 Returning and Accepting Multiple Values
----------------------------------------------

Scheme allows a procedure to return more than one value to its caller.
This is quite different to other languages which only allow single-value
returns.  Returning multiple values is different from returning a list
(or pair or vector) of values to the caller, because conceptually not
_one_ compound object is returned, but several distinct values.

   The primitive procedures for handling multiple values are ‘values’
and ‘call-with-values’.  ‘values’ is used for returning multiple values
from a procedure.  This is done by placing a call to ‘values’ with zero
or more arguments in tail position in a procedure body.
‘call-with-values’ combines a procedure returning multiple values with a
procedure which accepts these values as parameters.

 -- Scheme Procedure: values arg ...
 -- C Function: scm_values (args)
     Delivers all of its arguments to its continuation.  Except for
     continuations created by the ‘call-with-values’ procedure, all
     continuations take exactly one value.  The effect of passing no
     value or more than one value to continuations that were not created
     by ‘call-with-values’ is unspecified.

     For ‘scm_values’, ARGS is a list of arguments and the return is a
     multiple-values object which the caller can return.  In the current
     implementation that object shares structure with ARGS, so ARGS
     should not be modified subsequently.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_values (SCM *base, size_t n)
     ‘scm_c_values’ is an alternative to ‘scm_values’.  It creates a new
     values object, and copies into it the N values starting from BASE.

     Currently this creates a list and passes it to ‘scm_values’, but we
     expect that in the future we will be able to use a more efficient
     representation.

 -- C Function: size_t scm_c_nvalues (SCM obj)
     If OBJ is a multiple-values object, returns the number of values it
     contains.  Otherwise returns 1.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_value_ref (SCM obj, size_t idx)
     Returns the value at the position specified by IDX in OBJ.  Note
     that OBJ will ordinarily be a multiple-values object, but it need
     not be.  Any other object represents a single value (itself), and
     is handled appropriately.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-values producer consumer
     Calls its PRODUCER argument with no values and a continuation that,
     when passed some values, calls the CONSUMER procedure with those
     values as arguments.  The continuation for the call to CONSUMER is
     the continuation of the call to ‘call-with-values’.

          (call-with-values (lambda () (values 4 5))
                            (lambda (a b) b))
          ⇒ 5

          (call-with-values * -)
          ⇒ -1

   In addition to the fundamental procedures described above, Guile has
a module which exports a syntax called ‘receive’, which is much more
convenient.  This is in the ‘(ice-9 receive)’ and is the same as
specified by SRFI-8 (*note* SRFI-8::).

     (use-modules (ice-9 receive))

 -- library syntax: receive formals expr body ...
     Evaluate the expression EXPR, and bind the result values (zero or
     more) to the formal arguments in FORMALS.  FORMALS is a list of
     symbols, like the argument list in a ‘lambda’ (*note* Lambda::).
     After binding the variables, the expressions in BODY ... are
     evaluated in order, the return value is the result from the last
     expression.

     For example getting results from ‘partition’ in SRFI-1 (*note*
     SRFI-1::),

          (receive (odds evens)
              (partition odd? '(7 4 2 8 3))
            (display odds)
            (display " and ")
            (display evens))
          ⊣ (7 3) and (4 2 8)

6.11.8 Exceptions
-----------------

What happens when things go wrong?  Guile’s exception facility exists to
help answer this question, allowing programs to describe the problem and
to handle the situation in a flexible way.

   When a program runs into a problem, such as division by zero, it will
raise an exception.  Sometimes exceptions get raised by Guile on a
program’s behalf.  Sometimes a program will want to raise exceptions of
its own.  Raising an exception stops the current computation and instead
invokes the current exception handler, passing it an exception object
describing the unexpected situation.

   Usually an exception handler will unwind the computation back to some
kind of safe point.  For example, typical logic for a key press driven
application might look something like this:

     main-loop:
       read the next key press and call dispatch-key

     dispatch-key:
       lookup the key in a keymap and call an appropriate procedure,
       say find-file

     find-file:
       interactively read the required file name, then call
       find-specified-file

     find-specified-file:
       check whether file exists; if not, raise an exception
       ...

   In this case, ‘main-loop’ can install an exception handler that would
cause any exception raised inside ‘dispatch-key’ to print a warning and
jump back to the main loop.

   The following subsections go into more detail about exception
objects, raising exceptions, and handling exceptions.  It also presents
a historical interface that was used in Guile’s first 25 years and which
won’t be going away any time soon.

### 6.11.8.1 Exception Objects
..........................

When Guile encounters an exceptional situation, it raises an exception,
where the exception is an object that describes the exceptional
situation.  Exception objects are structured data, built on the record
facility (*note* Records::).

 -- Exception Type: &exception
     The base exception type.  All exception objects are composed of
     instances of subtypes of ‘&exception’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-type? obj
     Return true if OBJ is an exception type.

   Exception types exist in a hierarchy.  New exception types can be
defined using ‘make-exception-type’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-exception-type id parent field-names
     Return a new exception type named ID, inheriting from PARENT, and
     with the fields whose names are listed in FIELD-NAMES.  FIELD-NAMES
     must be a list of symbols and must not contain names already used
     by PARENT or one of its supertypes.

   Exception type objects are record type objects, and as such, one can
use ‘record-constructor’ on an exception type to get its constructor.
The constructor will take as many arguments as the exception has fields
(including supertypes).  *Note* Records::.

   However, ‘record-predicate’ and ‘record-accessor’ aren’t usually what
you want to use as exception type predicates and field accessors.  The
reason is, instances of exception types can be composed into “compound
exceptions”.  Exception accessors should pick out the specific component
of a compound exception, and then access the field on that specific
component.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-exception exceptions ...
     Return an exception object composed of EXCEPTIONS.

 -- Scheme Procedure: exception? obj
     Return true if OBJ is an exception object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-predicate type
     Return a procedure that will return true if its argument is a
     simple exception that is an instance of TYPE, or a compound
     exception composed of such an instance.

 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-accessor rtd proc
     Return a procedure that will tail-call PROC on an instance of the
     exception type RTD, or on the component of a compound exception
     that is an instance of RTD.

   Compound exceptions are useful to separately express the different
aspects of a situation.  For example, compound exceptions allow a
programmer to say that “this situation is a programming error, and also
here’s a useful message to show to the user, and here are some relevant
objects that can give more information about the error”.  This error
could be composed of instances of the ‘&programming-error’, ‘&message’,
and ‘&irritants’ exception types.

   The subtyping relationship in exceptions is useful to let
different-but-similar situations to be treated the same; for example
there are many varieties of programming errors (for example,
divide-by-zero or type mismatches), but perhaps there are common ways
that the user would like to handle them all, and that common way might
be different than how one might handle an error originating outside the
program (for example, a file-not-found error).

   The standard exception hierarchy in Guile takes its cues from R6RS,
though the names of some of the types are different.  *Note* rnrs
exceptions::, for more details.

   To have access to Guile’s exception type hierarchy, import the
‘(ice-9 exceptions)’ module:

     (use-modules (ice-9 exceptions))

   The following diagram gives an overview of the standard exception
type hierarchy.

     &exception
     |- &warning
     |- &message
     |- &irritants
     |- &origin
     \- &error
        |- &external-error
        \- &programming-error
           |- &assertion-failure
           |- &non-continuable
           |- &implementation-restriction
           |- &lexical
           |- &syntax
           \- &undefined-variable

 -- Exception Type: &warning
     An exception type denoting warnings.  These are usually raised
     using ‘#:continuable? #t’; see the ‘raise-exception’ documentation
     for more.
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-warning
 -- Scheme Procedure: warning? obj
     Constructor and predicate for ‘&warning’ exception objects.

 -- Exception Type: &message message
     An exception type that provides a message to display to the user.
     Usually used as a component of a compound exception.
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-exception-with-message message
 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-with-message? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-message exn
     Constructor, predicate, and accessor for ‘&message’ exception
     objects.

 -- Exception Type: &irritants irritants
     An exception type that provides a list of objects that were
     unexpected in some way.  Usually used as a component of a compound
     exception.
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-exception-with-irritants irritants
 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-with-irritants? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-irritants exn
     Constructor, predicate, and accessor for ‘&irritants’ exception
     objects.

 -- Exception Type: &origin origin
     An exception type that indicates the origin of an exception,
     typically expressed as a procedure name, as a symbol.  Usually used
     as a component of a compound exception.
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-exception-with-origin origin
 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-with-origin? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-origin exn
     Constructor, predicate, and accessor for ‘&origin’ exception
     objects.

 -- Exception Type: &error
     An exception type denoting errors: situations that are not just
     exceptional, but wrong.
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-error
 -- Scheme Procedure: error? obj
     Constructor and predicate for ‘&error’ exception objects.

 -- Exception Type: &external-error
     An exception type denoting errors that proceed from the interaction
     of the program with the world, for example a “file not found”
     error.
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-external-error
 -- Scheme Procedure: external-error? obj
     Constructor and predicate for ‘&external-error’ exception objects.

 -- Exception Type: &programming-error
     An exception type denoting errors that proceed from inside a
     program: type mismatches and so on.
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-programming-error
 -- Scheme Procedure: programming-error? obj
     Constructor and predicate for ‘&programming-error’ exception
     objects.

 -- Exception Type: &non-continuable
     An exception type denoting errors that proceed from inside a
     program: type mismatches and so on.
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-non-continuable-error
 -- Scheme Procedure: non-continuable-error? obj
     Constructor and predicate for ‘&non-continuable’ exception objects.

 -- Exception Type: &lexical
     An exception type denoting lexical errors, for example unbalanced
     parentheses.
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-lexical-error
 -- Scheme Procedure: lexical-error? obj
     Constructor and predicate for ‘&lexical’ exception objects.

 -- Exception Type: &syntax form subform
     An exception type denoting syntax errors, for example a ‘cond’
     expression with invalid syntax.  The FORM field indicates the form
     containing the error, and SUBFORM indicates the unexpected
     subcomponent, or ‘#f’ if unavailable.
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-syntax-error form subform
 -- Scheme Procedure: syntax-error? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: syntax-error-form exn
 -- Scheme Procedure: syntax-error-subform exn
     Constructor, predicate, and accessors for ‘&syntax’ exception

     An exception type denoting undefined variables.
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-undefine-variable-error
 -- Scheme Procedure: undefined-variable-error? obj
     Constructor and predicate for ‘&undefined-variable’ exception
     objects.

   Incidentally, the ‘(ice-9 exceptions)’ module also includes a
‘define-exception-type’ macro that can be used to conveniently add new
exception types to the hierarchy.

 -- Syntax: define-exception-type name parent constructor predicate
          (field accessor) ...
     Define NAME to be a new exception type, inheriting from PARENT.
     Define CONSTRUCTOR and PREDICATE to be the exception constructor
     and predicate, respectively, and define an ACCESSOR for each FIELD.

### 6.11.8.2 Raising and Handling Exceptions
........................................

An exception object describes an exceptional situation.  To bring that
description to the attention of the user or to handle the situation
programmatically, the first step is to “raise” the exception.

 -- Scheme Procedure: raise-exception obj [#:continuable=#f]
     Raise an exception by invoking the current exception handler on
     OBJ.  The handler is called with a continuation whose dynamic
     environment is that of the call to ‘raise’, except that the current
     exception handler is the one that was in place when the handler
     being called was installed.

     If CONTINUABLE? is true, the handler is invoked in tail position
     relative to the ‘raise-exception’ call.  Otherwise if the handler
     returns, a non-continuable exception of type ‘&non-continuable’ is
     raised in the same dynamic environment as the handler.

   As the above description notes, Guile has a notion of a “current
exception handler”.  At the REPL, this exception handler may enter a
recursive debugger; in a standalone program, it may simply print a
representation of the error and exit.

   To establish an exception handler within the dynamic extent of a
call, use ‘with-exception-handler’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-exception-handler handler thunk
          [#:unwind?=#f] [#:unwind-for-type=#t]
     Establish HANDLER, a procedure of one argument, as the current
     exception handler during the dynamic extent of invoking THUNK.

     If ‘raise-exception’ is called during the dynamic extent of
     invoking THUNK, HANDLER will be invoked on the argument of
     ‘raise-exception’.

   There are two kinds of exception handlers: unwinding and
non-unwinding.

   By default, exception handlers are non-unwinding.  Unless
‘with-exception-handler’ was invoked with ‘#:unwind? #t’, exception
handlers are invoked within the continuation of the error, without
unwinding the stack.  The dynamic environment of the handler call will
be that of the ‘raise-exception’ call, with the difference that the
current exception handler will be “unwound” to the \"outer\" handler
(the one that was in place when the corresponding
‘with-exception-handler’ was called).

   However, it’s often the case that one would like to handle an
exception by unwinding the computation to an earlier state and running
the error handler there.  After all, unless the ‘raise-exception’ call
is continuable, the exception handler needs to abort the continuation.
To support this use case, if ‘with-exception-handler’ was invoked with
‘#:unwind? #t’ is true, ‘raise-exception’ will first unwind the stack by
invoking an “escape continuation” (*note* ‘call/ec’: Prompt Primitives.),
and then invoke the handler with the continuation of the
‘with-exception-handler’ call.

   Finally, one more wrinkle: for unwinding exception handlers, it can
be useful to Guile if it can determine whether an exception handler
would indeed handle a particular exception or not.  This is especially
the case for exceptions raised in resource-exhaustion scenarios like
‘stack-overflow’ or ‘out-of-memory’, where you want to immediately
shrink resource use before recovering.  *Note* Stack Overflow::.  For
this purpose, the ‘#:unwind-for-type’ keyword argument allows users to
specify the kind of exception handled by an exception handler; if ‘#t’,
all exceptions will be handled; if an exception type object, only
exceptions of that type will be handled; otherwise if a symbol, only
that exceptions with the given ‘exception-kind’ will be handled.

### 6.11.8.3 Throw and Catch
........................

Guile only adopted ‘with-exception-handler’ and ‘raise-exception’ as its
primary exception-handling facility in 2019.  Before then, exception
handling was fundamentally based on three other primitives with a
somewhat more complex interface: ‘catch’, ‘with-throw-handler’, and
‘throw’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: catch key thunk handler [pre-unwind-handler]
 -- C Function: scm_catch_with_pre_unwind_handler (key, thunk, handler,
          pre_unwind_handler)
 -- C Function: scm_catch (key, thunk, handler)
     Establish an exception handler during the dynamic extent of the
     call to THUNK.  KEY is either ‘#t’, indicating that all exceptions
     should be handled, or a symbol, restricting the exceptions handled
     to those having the KEY as their ‘exception-kind’.

     If THUNK executes normally, meaning without throwing any
     exceptions, the handler procedures are not called at all and the
     result of the ‘thunk’ call is the result of the ‘catch’.  Otherwise
     if an exception is thrown that matches KEY, HANDLER is called with
     the continuation of the ‘catch’ call.

   Given the discussion from the previous section, it is most precise
and concise to specify what ‘catch’ does by expressing it in terms of
‘with-exception-handler’.  Calling ‘catch’ with the three arguments is
the same as:

     (define (catch key thunk handler)
       (with-exception-handler
        (lambda (exn)
          (apply handler (exception-kind exn) (exception-args exn)))
        thunk
        #:unwind? #t
        #:unwind-for-type key))

   By invoking ‘with-exception-handler’ with ‘#:unwind? #t’, ‘catch’
sets up an escape continuation that will be invoked in an exceptional
situation before the handler is called.

   If ‘catch’ is called with four arguments, then the use of THUNK
should be replaced with:

        (lambda ()
          (with-throw-handler key thunk pre-unwind-handler))

   As can be seen above, if a pre-unwind-handler is passed to ‘catch’,
it’s like calling ‘with-throw-handler’ inside the body thunk.

   ‘with-throw-handler’ is the second of the older primitives, and is
used to be able to intercept an exception that is being thrown before
the stack is unwound.  This could be to clean up some related state, to
print a backtrace, or to pass information about the exception to a
debugger, for example.

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-throw-handler key thunk handler
 -- C Function: scm_with_throw_handler (key, thunk, handler)
     Add HANDLER to the dynamic context as a throw handler for key KEY,
     then invoke THUNK.

   It’s not possible to exactly express ‘with-throw-handler’ in terms of
‘with-exception-handler’, but we can get close.

     (define (with-throw-handler key thunk handler)
       (with-exception-handler
        (lambda (exn)
          (when (or (eq? key #t) (eq? key (exception-kind exn)))
            (apply handler (exception-kind exn) (exception-args exn)))
          (raise-exception exn))
        thunk))

   As you can see, unlike in the case of ‘catch’, the handler for
‘with-throw-handler’ is invoked within the continuation of
‘raise-exception’, before unwinding the stack.  If the throw handler
returns normally, the exception will be re-raised, to be handled by the
next exception handler.

   The special wrinkle of ‘with-throw-handler’ that can’t be shown above
is that if invoking the handler causes a ‘raise-exception’ instead of
completing normally, the exception is thrown in the _original_ dynamic
environment of the ‘raise-exception’.  Any inner exception handler will
get another shot at handling the exception.  Here is an example to
illustrate this behavior:

     (catch 'a
       (lambda ()
         (with-throw-handler 'b
           (lambda ()
             (catch 'a
               (lambda ()
                 (throw 'b))
               inner-handler))
           (lambda (key . args)
             (throw 'a))))
       outer-handler)

This code will call ‘inner-handler’ and then continue with the
continuation of the inner ‘catch’.

   Finally, we get to ‘throw’, which is the older equivalent to
‘raise-exception’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: throw key arg ...
 -- C Function: scm_throw (key, args)
     Raise an exception with kind KEY and arguments ARGS.  KEY is a
     symbol, denoting the “kind” of the exception.

   Again, we can specify what ‘throw’ does by expressing it in terms of
‘raise-exception’.

     (define (throw key . args)
       (raise-exception (make-exception-from-throw key args)))

   At this point, we should mention the primitive that manage the
relationship between structured exception objects ‘throw’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-exception-from-throw key args
     Create an exception object for the given KEY and ARGS passed to
     ‘throw’.  This may be a specific type of exception, for example
     ‘&programming-error’; Guile maintains a set of custom transformers
     for the various KEY values that have been used historically.

 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-kind exn
     If EXN is an exception created via ‘make-exception-from-throw’,
     return the corresponding KEY for the exception.  Otherwise, unless
     EXN is an exception of a type with a known mapping to ‘throw’,
     return the symbol ‘%exception’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-args exn
     If EXN is an exception created via ‘make-exception-from-throw’,
     return the corresponding ARGS for the exception.  Otherwise, unless
     EXN is an exception of a type with a known mapping to ‘throw’,
     return ‘(list EXN)’.


File: guile.info,  Node: Exceptions and C,  Prev: Throw and Catch,  Up: Exceptions

### 6.11.8.4 Exceptions and C
.........................

There are some specific versions of Guile’s original ‘catch’ and
‘with-throw-handler’ exception-handling primitives that are still widely
used in C code.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_catch (SCM tag, scm_t_catch_body body, void
          *body_data, scm_t_catch_handler handler, void *handler_data,
          scm_t_catch_handler pre_unwind_handler, void
          *pre_unwind_handler_data)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_internal_catch (SCM tag, scm_t_catch_body body,
          void *body_data, scm_t_catch_handler handler, void
          *handler_data)
     The above ‘scm_catch_with_pre_unwind_handler’ and ‘scm_catch’ take
     Scheme procedures as body and handler arguments.  ‘scm_c_catch’ and
     ‘scm_internal_catch’ are equivalents taking C functions.

     BODY is called as ‘BODY (BODY_DATA)’ with a catch on exceptions of
     the given TAG type.  If an exception is caught, PRE_UNWIND_HANDLER
     and HANDLER are called as ‘HANDLER (HANDLER_DATA, KEY, ARGS)’.  KEY
     and ARGS are the ‘SCM’ key and argument list from the ‘throw’.

     BODY and HANDLER should have the following prototypes.
     ‘scm_t_catch_body’ and ‘scm_t_catch_handler’ are pointer typedefs
     for these.

          SCM body (void *data);
          SCM handler (void *data, SCM key, SCM args);

     The BODY_DATA and HANDLER_DATA parameters are passed to the
     respective calls so an application can communicate extra
     information to those functions.

     If the data consists of an ‘SCM’ object, care should be taken that
     it isn’t garbage collected while still required.  If the ‘SCM’ is a
     local C variable, one way to protect it is to pass a pointer to
     that variable as the data parameter, since the C compiler will then
     know the value must be held on the stack.  Another way is to use
     ‘scm_remember_upto_here_1’ (*note* Foreign Object Memory
     Management::).

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_with_throw_handler (SCM tag, scm_t_catch_body
          body, void *body_data, scm_t_catch_handler handler, void
          *handler_data, int lazy_catch_p)
     The above ‘scm_with_throw_handler’ takes Scheme procedures as body
     (thunk) and handler arguments.  ‘scm_c_with_throw_handler’ is an
     equivalent taking C functions.  See ‘scm_c_catch’ (*note* Exceptions
     and C::) for a description of the parameters, the behaviour however
     of course follows ‘with-throw-handler’.

6.11.9 Procedures for Signaling Errors
--------------------------------------

Guile provides a set of convenience procedures for signaling error
conditions that are implemented on top of the exception primitives just
described.

 -- Scheme Procedure: error msg arg ...
     Raise an error with key ‘misc-error’ and a message constructed by
     displaying MSG and writing ARG ....

 -- Scheme Procedure: scm-error key subr message args data
 -- C Function: scm_error_scm (key, subr, message, args, data)
     Raise an error with key KEY.  SUBR can be a string naming the
     procedure associated with the error, or ‘#f’.  MESSAGE is the error
     message string, possibly containing ‘~S’ and ‘~A’ escapes.  When an
     error is reported, these are replaced by formatting the
     corresponding members of ARGS: ‘~A’ (was ‘%s’ in older versions of
     Guile) formats using ‘display’ and ‘~S’ (was ‘%S’) formats using
     ‘write’.  DATA is a list or ‘#f’ depending on KEY: if KEY is
     ‘system-error’ then it should be a list containing the Unix ‘errno’
     value; If KEY is ‘signal’ then it should be a list containing the
     Unix signal number; If KEY is ‘out-of-range’, ‘wrong-type-arg’, or
     ‘keyword-argument-error’, it is a list containing the bad value;
     otherwise it will usually be ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: strerror err
 -- C Function: scm_strerror (err)
     Return the Unix error message corresponding to ERR, an integer
     ‘errno’ value.

     When ‘setlocale’ has been called (*note* Locales::), the message is
     in the language and charset of ‘LC_MESSAGES’.  (This is done by the
     C library.)

 -- syntax: false-if-exception expr
     Returns the result of evaluating its argument; however if an
     exception occurs then ‘#f’ is returned instead.

6.11.10 Dynamic Wind
--------------------

For Scheme code, the fundamental procedure to react to non-local entry
and exits of dynamic contexts is ‘dynamic-wind’.  C code could use
‘scm_internal_dynamic_wind’, but since C does not allow the convenient
construction of anonymous procedures that close over lexical variables,
this will be, well, inconvenient.

   Therefore, Guile offers the functions ‘scm_dynwind_begin’ and
‘scm_dynwind_end’ to delimit a dynamic extent.  Within this dynamic
extent, which is called a “dynwind context”, you can perform various
“dynwind actions” that control what happens when the dynwind context is
entered or left.  For example, you can register a cleanup routine with
‘scm_dynwind_unwind_handler’ that is executed when the context is left.
There are several other more specialized dynwind actions as well, for
example to temporarily block the execution of asyncs or to temporarily
change the current output port.  They are described elsewhere in this
manual.

   Here is an example that shows how to prevent memory leaks.


     /* Suppose there is a function called FOO in some library that you
        would like to make available to Scheme code (or to C code that
        follows the Scheme conventions).

        FOO takes two C strings and returns a new string.  When an error has
        occurred in FOO, it returns NULL.
     */

     char *foo (char *s1, char *s2);

     /* SCM_FOO interfaces the C function FOO to the Scheme way of life.
        It takes care to free up all temporary strings in the case of
        non-local exits.
      */

     SCM
     scm_foo (SCM s1, SCM s2)
     {
       char *c_s1, *c_s2, *c_res;

       scm_dynwind_begin (0);

       c_s1 = scm_to_locale_string (s1);

       /* Call 'free (c_s1)' when the dynwind context is left.
       */
       scm_dynwind_unwind_handler (free, c_s1, SCM_F_WIND_EXPLICITLY);

       c_s2 = scm_to_locale_string (s2);

       /* Same as above, but more concisely.
       */
       scm_dynwind_free (c_s2);

       c_res = foo (c_s1, c_s2);
       if (c_res == NULL)
         scm_report_out_of_memory ();

       scm_dynwind_end ();

       return scm_take_locale_string (res);
     }

 -- Scheme Procedure: dynamic-wind in_guard thunk out_guard
 -- C Function: scm_dynamic_wind (in_guard, thunk, out_guard)
     All three arguments must be 0-argument procedures.  IN_GUARD is
     called, then THUNK, then OUT_GUARD.

     If, any time during the execution of THUNK, the dynamic extent of
     the ‘dynamic-wind’ expression is escaped non-locally, OUT_GUARD is
     called.  If the dynamic extent of the dynamic-wind is re-entered,
     IN_GUARD is called.  Thus IN_GUARD and OUT_GUARD may be called any
     number of times.

          (define x 'normal-binding)
          ⇒ x
          (define a-cont
            (call-with-current-continuation
             (lambda (escape)
               (let ((old-x x))
                 (dynamic-wind
                     ;; in-guard:
                     ;;
                     (lambda () (set! x 'special-binding))

                     ;; thunk
                     ;;
                     (lambda () (display x) (newline)
                                (call-with-current-continuation escape)
                                (display x) (newline)
                                x)

                     ;; out-guard:
                     ;;
                     (lambda () (set! x old-x)))))))
          ;; Prints:
          special-binding
          ;; Evaluates to:
          ⇒ a-cont
          x
          ⇒ normal-binding
          (a-cont #f)
          ;; Prints:
          special-binding
          ;; Evaluates to:
          ⇒ a-cont  ;; the value of the (define a-cont...)

          ⇒ special-binding

 -- C Type: scm_t_dynwind_flags
     This is an enumeration of several flags that modify the behavior of
     ‘scm_dynwind_begin’.  The flags are listed in the following table.

     ‘SCM_F_DYNWIND_REWINDABLE’
          The dynamic context is “rewindable”.  This means that it can
          be reentered non-locally (via the invocation of a
          continuation).  The default is that a dynwind context can not
          be reentered non-locally.

 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_begin (scm_t_dynwind_flags flags)
     The function ‘scm_dynwind_begin’ starts a new dynamic context and
     makes it the ‘current’ one.

     The FLAGS argument determines the default behavior of the context.
     Normally, use 0.  This will result in a context that can not be
     reentered with a captured continuation.  When you are prepared to
     handle reentries, include ‘SCM_F_DYNWIND_REWINDABLE’ in FLAGS.

     Being prepared for reentry means that the effects of unwind
     handlers can be undone on reentry.  In the example above, we want
     to prevent a memory leak on non-local exit and thus register an
     unwind handler that frees the memory.  But once the memory is
     freed, we can not get it back on reentry.  Thus reentry can not be
     allowed.

     The consequence is that continuations become less useful when
     non-reentrant contexts are captured, but you don’t need to worry
     about that too much.

     The context is ended either implicitly when a non-local exit
     happens, or explicitly with ‘scm_dynwind_end’.  You must make sure
     that a dynwind context is indeed ended properly.  If you fail to
     call ‘scm_dynwind_end’ for each ‘scm_dynwind_begin’, the behavior
     is undefined.

 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_end ()
     End the current dynamic context explicitly and make the previous
     one current.

 -- C Type: scm_t_wind_flags
     This is an enumeration of several flags that modify the behavior of
     ‘scm_dynwind_unwind_handler’ and ‘scm_dynwind_rewind_handler’.  The
     flags are listed in the following table.

     ‘SCM_F_WIND_EXPLICITLY’
          The registered action is also carried out when the dynwind
          context is entered or left locally.

 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_unwind_handler (void (*func)(void *),
          void *data, scm_t_wind_flags flags)
 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_unwind_handler_with_scm (void
          (*func)(SCM), SCM data, scm_t_wind_flags flags)
     Arranges for FUNC to be called with DATA as its arguments when the
     current context ends implicitly.  If FLAGS contains
     ‘SCM_F_WIND_EXPLICITLY’, FUNC is also called when the context ends
     explicitly with ‘scm_dynwind_end’.

     The function ‘scm_dynwind_unwind_handler_with_scm’ takes care that
     DATA is protected from garbage collection.

 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_rewind_handler (void (*func)(void *),
          void *data, scm_t_wind_flags flags)
 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_rewind_handler_with_scm (void
          (*func)(SCM), SCM data, scm_t_wind_flags flags)
     Arrange for FUNC to be called with DATA as its argument when the
     current context is restarted by rewinding the stack.  When FLAGS
     contains ‘SCM_F_WIND_EXPLICITLY’, FUNC is called immediately as
     well.

     The function ‘scm_dynwind_rewind_handler_with_scm’ takes care that
     DATA is protected from garbage collection.

 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_free (void *mem)
     Arrange for MEM to be freed automatically whenever the current
     context is exited, whether normally or non-locally.
     ‘scm_dynwind_free (mem)’ is an equivalent shorthand for
     ‘scm_dynwind_unwind_handler (free, mem, SCM_F_WIND_EXPLICITLY)’.

6.11.11 Fluids and Dynamic States
---------------------------------

A _fluid_ is a variable whose value is associated with the dynamic
extent of a function call.  In the same way that an operating system
runs a process with a given set of current input and output ports (or
file descriptors), in Guile you can arrange to call a function while
binding a fluid to a particular value.  That association between fluid
and value will exist during the dynamic extent of the function call.

   Fluids are therefore a building block for implementing dynamically
scoped variables.  Dynamically scoped variables are useful when you want
to set a variable to a value during some dynamic extent in the execution
of your program and have them revert to their original value when the
control flow is outside of this dynamic extent.  See the description of
‘with-fluids’ below for details.  This association between fluids,
values, and dynamic extents is robust to multiple entries (as when a
captured continuation is invoked more than once) and early exits (for
example, when throwing exceptions).

   Guile uses fluids to implement parameters (*note* Parameters::).
Usually you just want to use parameters directly.  However it can be
useful to know what a fluid is and how it works, so that’s what this
section is about.

   The current set of fluid-value associations can be captured in a
_dynamic state_ object.  A dynamic extent is simply that: a snapshot of
the current fluid-value associations.  Guile users can capture the
current dynamic state with ‘current-dynamic-state’ and restore it later
via ‘with-dynamic-state’ or similar procedures.  This facility is
especially useful when implementing lightweight thread-like
abstractions.

   New fluids are created with ‘make-fluid’ and ‘fluid?’ is used for
testing whether an object is actually a fluid.  The values stored in a
fluid can be accessed with ‘fluid-ref’ and ‘fluid-set!’.

   *Note* Thread Local Variables::, for further notes on fluids, threads,
parameters, and dynamic states.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-fluid [dflt]
 -- C Function: scm_make_fluid ()
 -- C Function: scm_make_fluid_with_default (dflt)
     Return a newly created fluid, whose initial value is DFLT, or ‘#f’
     if DFLT is not given.  Fluids are objects that can hold one value
     per dynamic state.  That is, modifications to this value are only
     visible to code that executes with the same dynamic state as the
     modifying code.  When a new dynamic state is constructed, it
     inherits the values from its parent.  Because each thread normally
     executes with its own dynamic state, you can use fluids for thread
     local storage.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-unbound-fluid
 -- C Function: scm_make_unbound_fluid ()
     Return a new fluid that is initially unbound (instead of being
     implicitly bound to some definite value).

 -- Scheme Procedure: fluid? obj
 -- C Function: scm_fluid_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a fluid; otherwise, return ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fluid-ref fluid
 -- C Function: scm_fluid_ref (fluid)
     Return the value associated with FLUID in the current dynamic root.
     If FLUID has not been set, then return its default value.  Calling
     ‘fluid-ref’ on an unbound fluid produces a runtime error.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fluid-set! fluid value
 -- C Function: scm_fluid_set_x (fluid, value)
     Set the value associated with FLUID in the current dynamic root.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fluid-ref* fluid depth
 -- C Function: scm_fluid_ref_star (fluid, depth)
     Return the DEPTHth oldest value associated with FLUID in the
     current thread.  If DEPTH equals or exceeds the number of values
     that have been assigned to FLUID, return the default value of the
     fluid.  ‘(fluid-ref* f 0)’ is equivalent to ‘(fluid-ref f)’.

     ‘fluid-ref*’ is useful when you want to maintain a stack-like
     structure in a fluid, such as the stack of current exception
     handlers.  Using ‘fluid-ref*’ instead of an explicit stack allows
     any partial continuation captured by ‘call-with-prompt’ to only
     capture the bindings made within the limits of the prompt instead
     of the entire continuation.  *Note* Prompts::, for more on delimited
     continuations.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fluid-unset! fluid
 -- C Function: scm_fluid_unset_x (fluid)
     Disassociate the given fluid from any value, making it unbound.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fluid-bound? fluid
 -- C Function: scm_fluid_bound_p (fluid)
     Returns ‘#t’ if the given fluid is bound to a value, otherwise
     ‘#f’.

   ‘with-fluids*’ temporarily changes the values of one or more fluids,
so that the given procedure and each procedure called by it access the
given values.  After the procedure returns, the old values are restored.

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-fluid* fluid value thunk
 -- C Function: scm_with_fluid (fluid, value, thunk)
     Set FLUID to VALUE temporarily, and call THUNK.  THUNK must be a
     procedure with no argument.

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-fluids* fluids values thunk
 -- C Function: scm_with_fluids (fluids, values, thunk)
     Set FLUIDS to VALUES temporary, and call THUNK.  FLUIDS must be a
     list of fluids and VALUES must be the same number of their values
     to be applied.  Each substitution is done in the order given.
     THUNK must be a procedure with no argument.  It is called inside a
     ‘dynamic-wind’ and the fluids are set/restored when control enter
     or leaves the established dynamic extent.

 -- Scheme Macro: with-fluids ((fluid value) ...) body1 body2 ...
     Execute body BODY1 BODY2 ... while each FLUID is set to the
     corresponding VALUE.  Both FLUID and VALUE are evaluated and FLUID
     must yield a fluid.  The body is executed inside a ‘dynamic-wind’
     and the fluids are set/restored when control enter or leaves the
     established dynamic extent.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_with_fluids (SCM fluids, SCM vals, SCM
          (*cproc)(void *), void *data)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_with_fluid (SCM fluid, SCM val, SCM
          (*cproc)(void *), void *data)
     The function ‘scm_c_with_fluids’ is like ‘scm_with_fluids’ except
     that it takes a C function to call instead of a Scheme thunk.

     The function ‘scm_c_with_fluid’ is similar but only allows one
     fluid to be set instead of a list.

 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_fluid (SCM fluid, SCM val)
     This function must be used inside a pair of calls to
     ‘scm_dynwind_begin’ and ‘scm_dynwind_end’ (*note* Dynamic Wind::).
     During the dynwind context, the fluid FLUID is set to VAL.

     More precisely, the value of the fluid is swapped with a ‘backup’
     value whenever the dynwind context is entered or left.  The backup
     value is initialized with the VAL argument.

 -- Scheme Procedure: dynamic-state? obj
 -- C Function: scm_dynamic_state_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a dynamic state object; return ‘#f’
     otherwise.

 -- C Procedure: int scm_is_dynamic_state (SCM obj)
     Return non-zero if OBJ is a dynamic state object; return zero
     otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: current-dynamic-state
 -- C Function: scm_current_dynamic_state ()
     Return a snapshot of the current fluid-value associations as a
     fresh dynamic state object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-current-dynamic-state state
 -- C Function: scm_set_current_dynamic_state (state)
     Restore the saved fluid-value associations from STATE, replacing
     the current fluid-value associations.  Return the current
     fluid-value associatoins as a dynamic state object, as in
     ‘current-dynamic-state’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-dynamic-state state proc
 -- C Function: scm_with_dynamic_state (state, proc)
     Call PROC while the fluid bindings from STATE have been made
     current, saving the current fluid bindings.  When control leaves
     the invocation of PROC, restore the saved bindings, saving instead
     the fluid bindings from inside the call.  If control later
     re-enters PROC, restore those saved bindings, saving the current
     bindings, and so on.

 -- C Procedure: void scm_dynwind_current_dynamic_state (SCM state)
     Set the current dynamic state to STATE for the current dynwind
     context.  Like ‘with-dynamic-state’, but in terms of Guile’s
     “dynwind” C API.

 -- C Procedure: void * scm_c_with_dynamic_state (SCM state, void
          *(*func)(void *), void *data)
     Like ‘scm_with_dynamic_state’, but call FUNC with DATA.


File: guile.info,  Node: Parameters,  Next: Handling Errors,  Prev: Fluids and Dynamic States,  Up: Control Mechanisms

6.11.12 Parameters
------------------

Parameters are Guile’s facility for dynamically bound variables.

   On the most basic level, a parameter object is a procedure.  Calling
it with no arguments returns its value.  Calling it with one argument
sets the value.

     (define my-param (make-parameter 123))
     (my-param) ⇒ 123
     (my-param 456)
     (my-param) ⇒ 456

   The ‘parameterize’ special form establishes new locations for
parameters, those new locations having effect within the dynamic extent
of the ‘parameterize’ body.  Leaving restores the previous locations.
Re-entering (through a saved continuation) will again use the new
locations.

     (parameterize ((my-param 789))
       (my-param)) ⇒ 789
     (my-param) ⇒ 456

   Parameters are like dynamically bound variables in other Lisp
dialects.  They allow an application to establish parameter settings (as
the name suggests) just for the execution of a particular bit of code,
restoring when done.  Examples of such parameters might be
case-sensitivity for a search, or a prompt for user input.

   Global variables are not as good as parameter objects for this sort
of thing.  Changes to them are visible to all threads, but in Guile
parameter object locations are per-thread, thereby truly limiting the
effect of ‘parameterize’ to just its dynamic execution.

   Passing arguments to functions is thread-safe, but that soon becomes
tedious when there’s more than a few or when they need to pass down
through several layers of calls before reaching the point they should
affect.  Introducing a new setting to existing code is often easier with
a parameter object than adding arguments.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-parameter init [converter]
     Return a new parameter object, with initial value INIT.

     If a CONVERTER is given, then a call ‘(CONVERTER val)’ is made for
     each value set, its return is the value stored.  Such a call is
     made for the INIT initial value too.

     A CONVERTER allows values to be validated, or put into a canonical
     form.  For example,

          (define my-param (make-parameter 123
                             (lambda (val)
                               (if (not (number? val))
                                   (error "must be a number"))
                               (inexact->exact val))))
          (my-param 0.75)
          (my-param) ⇒ 3/4

 -- library syntax: parameterize ((param value) ...) body1 body2 ...
     Establish a new dynamic scope with the given PARAMs bound to new
     locations and set to the given VALUEs.  BODY1 BODY2 ... is
     evaluated in that environment.  The value returned is that of last
     body form.

     Each PARAM is an expression which is evaluated to get the parameter
     object.  Often this will just be the name of a variable holding the
     object, but it can be anything that evaluates to a parameter.

     The PARAM expressions and VALUE expressions are all evaluated
     before establishing the new dynamic bindings, and they’re evaluated
     in an unspecified order.

     For example,

          (define prompt (make-parameter "Type something: "))
          (define (get-input)
            (display (prompt))
            ...)

          (parameterize ((prompt "Type a number: "))
            (get-input)
            ...)

   Parameter objects are implemented using fluids (*note* Fluids and
Dynamic States::), so each dynamic state has its own parameter
locations.  That includes the separate locations when outside any
‘parameterize’ form.  When a parameter is created it gets a separate
initial location in each dynamic state, all initialized to the given
INIT value.

   New code should probably just use parameters instead of fluids,
because the interface is better.  But for migrating old code or
otherwise providing interoperability, Guile provides the
‘fluid->parameter’ procedure:

 -- Scheme Procedure: fluid->parameter fluid [conv]
     Make a parameter that wraps a fluid.

     The value of the parameter will be the same as the value of the
     fluid.  If the parameter is rebound in some dynamic extent, perhaps
     via ‘parameterize’, the new value will be run through the optional
     CONV procedure, as with any parameter.  Note that unlike
     ‘make-parameter’, CONV is not applied to the initial value.

   As alluded to above, because each thread usually has a separate
dynamic state, each thread has its own locations behind parameter
objects, and changes in one thread are not visible to any other.  When a
new dynamic state or thread is created, the values of parameters in the
originating context are copied, into new locations.

   Guile’s parameters conform to SRFI-39 (*note* SRFI-39::).

6.11.13 How to Handle Errors
----------------------------

Guile is currently in a transition from its historical ‘catch’ and
‘throw’ error handling and signaling operators to the new structured
exception facility; *Note* Exceptions::.  However in the meantime, here
is some documentation on errors and the older ‘catch’ and ‘throw’
interface.

   Errors are always thrown with a KEY and four arguments:

   • KEY: a symbol which indicates the type of error.  The symbols used
     by libguile are listed below.

   • SUBR: the name of the procedure from which the error is thrown, or
     ‘#f’.

   • MESSAGE: a string (possibly language and system dependent)
     describing the error.  The tokens ‘~A’ and ‘~S’ can be embedded
     within the message: they will be replaced with members of the ARGS
     list when the message is printed.  ‘~A’ indicates an argument
     printed using ‘display’, while ‘~S’ indicates an argument printed
     using ‘write’.  MESSAGE can also be ‘#f’, to allow it to be derived
     from the KEY by the error handler (may be useful if the KEY is to
     be thrown from both C and Scheme).

   • ARGS: a list of arguments to be used to expand ‘~A’ and ‘~S’ tokens
     in MESSAGE.  Can also be ‘#f’ if no arguments are required.

   • REST: a list of any additional objects required.  e.g., when the
     key is ‘'system-error’, this contains the C errno value.  Can also
     be ‘#f’ if no additional objects are required.

   In addition to ‘catch’ and ‘throw’, the following Scheme facilities
are available:

 -- Scheme Procedure: display-error frame port subr message args rest
 -- C Function: scm_display_error (frame, port, subr, message, args,
          rest)
     Display an error message to the output port PORT.  FRAME is the
     frame in which the error occurred, SUBR is the name of the
     procedure in which the error occurred and MESSAGE is the actual
     error message, which may contain formatting instructions.  These
     will format the arguments in the list ARGS accordingly.  REST is
     currently ignored.

   The following are the error keys defined by libguile and the
situations in which they are used:

   • ‘error-signal’: thrown after receiving an unhandled fatal signal
     such as SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGFPE etc.  The REST argument in the
     throw contains the coded signal number (at present this is not the
     same as the usual Unix signal number).

   • ‘system-error’: thrown after the operating system indicates an
     error condition.  The REST argument in the throw contains the errno
     value.

   • ‘numerical-overflow’: numerical overflow.

   • ‘out-of-range’: the arguments to a procedure do not fall within the
     accepted domain.

   • ‘wrong-type-arg’: an argument to a procedure has the wrong type.

   • ‘wrong-number-of-args’: a procedure was called with the wrong
     number of arguments.

   • ‘memory-allocation-error’: memory allocation error.

   • ‘stack-overflow’: stack overflow error.

   • ‘regular-expression-syntax’: errors generated by the regular
     expression library.

   • ‘misc-error’: other errors.

### 6.11.13.1 C Support
...................

In the following C functions, SUBR and MESSAGE parameters can be ‘NULL’
to give the effect of ‘#f’ described above.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_error (SCM KEY, const char *SUBR, const char
          *MESSAGE, SCM ARGS, SCM REST)
     Throw an error, as per ‘scm-error’ (*note* Error Reporting::).

 -- C Function: void scm_syserror (const char *SUBR)
 -- C Function: void scm_syserror_msg (const char *SUBR, const char
          *MESSAGE, SCM ARGS)
     Throw an error with key ‘system-error’ and supply ‘errno’ in the
     REST argument.  For ‘scm_syserror’ the message is generated using
     ‘strerror’.

     Care should be taken that any code in between the failing operation
     and the call to these routines doesn’t change ‘errno’.

 -- C Function: void scm_num_overflow (const char *SUBR)
 -- C Function: void scm_out_of_range (const char *SUBR, SCM BAD_VALUE)
 -- C Function: void scm_wrong_num_args (SCM PROC)
 -- C Function: void scm_wrong_type_arg (const char *SUBR, int ARGNUM,
          SCM BAD_VALUE)
 -- C Function: void scm_wrong_type_arg_msg (const char *SUBR, int
          ARGNUM, SCM BAD_VALUE, const char *EXPECTED)
 -- C Function: void scm_misc_error (const char *SUBR, const char
          *MESSAGE, SCM ARGS)
     Throw an error with the various keys described above.

     In ‘scm_wrong_num_args’, PROC should be a Scheme symbol which is
     the name of the procedure incorrectly invoked.  The other routines
     take the name of the invoked procedure as a C string.

     In ‘scm_wrong_type_arg_msg’, EXPECTED is a C string describing the
     type of argument that was expected.

     In ‘scm_misc_error’, MESSAGE is the error message string, possibly
     containing ‘simple-format’ escapes (*note* Simple Output::), and the
     corresponding arguments in the ARGS list.

### 6.11.13.2 Signalling Type Errors
................................

Every function visible at the Scheme level should aggressively check the
types of its arguments, to avoid misinterpreting a value, and perhaps
causing a segmentation fault.  Guile provides some macros to make this
easier.

 -- Macro: void SCM_ASSERT (int TEST, SCM OBJ, unsigned int POSITION,
          const char *SUBR)
 -- Macro: void SCM_ASSERT_TYPE (int TEST, SCM OBJ, unsigned int
          POSITION, const char *SUBR, const char *EXPECTED)
     If TEST is zero, signal a “wrong type argument” error, attributed
     to the subroutine named SUBR, operating on the value OBJ, which is
     the POSITION’th argument of SUBR.

     In ‘SCM_ASSERT_TYPE’, EXPECTED is a C string describing the type of
     argument that was expected.

 -- Macro: int SCM_ARG1
 -- Macro: int SCM_ARG2
 -- Macro: int SCM_ARG3
 -- Macro: int SCM_ARG4
 -- Macro: int SCM_ARG5
 -- Macro: int SCM_ARG6
 -- Macro: int SCM_ARG7
     One of the above values can be used for POSITION to indicate the
     number of the argument of SUBR which is being checked.
     Alternatively, a positive integer number can be used, which allows
     to check arguments after the seventh.  However, for parameter
     numbers up to seven it is preferable to use ‘SCM_ARGN’ instead of
     the corresponding raw number, since it will make the code easier to
     understand.

 -- Macro: int SCM_ARGn
     Passing a value of zero or ‘SCM_ARGn’ for POSITION allows to leave
     it unspecified which argument’s type is incorrect.  Again,
     ‘SCM_ARGn’ should be preferred over a raw zero constant.

6.11.14 Continuation Barriers
-----------------------------

The non-local flow of control caused by continuations might sometimes
not be wanted.  You can use ‘with-continuation-barrier’ to erect fences
that continuations can not pass.

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-continuation-barrier proc
 -- C Function: scm_with_continuation_barrier (proc)
     Call PROC and return its result.  Do not allow the invocation of
     continuations that would leave or enter the dynamic extent of the
     call to ‘with-continuation-barrier’.  Such an attempt causes an
     error to be signaled.

     Throws (such as errors) that are not caught from within PROC are
     caught by ‘with-continuation-barrier’.  In that case, a short
     message is printed to the current error port and ‘#f’ is returned.

     Thus, ‘with-continuation-barrier’ returns exactly once.

 -- C Function: void * scm_c_with_continuation_barrier (void *(*func)
          (void *), void *data)
     Like ‘scm_with_continuation_barrier’ but call FUNC on DATA.  When
     an error is caught, ‘NULL’ is returned.

6.12.1 Ports
------------

Ports are the way that Guile performs input and output.  Guile can read
in characters or bytes from an “input port”, or write them out to an
“output port”.  Some ports support both interfaces.

   There are a number of different port types implemented in Guile.
File ports provide input and output over files, as you might imagine.
For example, we might display a string to a file like this:

     (let ((port (open-output-file "foo.txt")))
       (display "Hello, world!\n" port)
       (close-port port))

   There are also string ports, for taking input from a string, or
collecting output to a string; bytevector ports, for doing the same but
using a bytevector as a source or sink of data; and soft ports, for
arranging to call Scheme functions to provide input or handle output.
*Note* Port Types::.

   Ports should be “closed” when they are not needed by calling
‘close-port’ on them, as in the example above.  This will make sure that
any pending output is successfully written out to disk, in the case of a
file port, or otherwise to whatever mutable store is backed by the port.
Any error that occurs while writing out that buffered data would also be
raised promptly at the ‘close-port’, and not later when the port is
closed by the garbage collector.  *Note* Buffering::, for more on
buffered output.

   Closing a port also releases any precious resource the file might
have.  Usually in Scheme a programmer doesn’t have to clean up after
their data structures (*note* Memory Management::), but most systems have
strict limits on how many files can be open, both on a per-process and a
system-wide basis.  A program that uses many files should take care not
to hit those limits.  The same applies to similar system resources such
as pipes and sockets.

   Indeed for these reasons the above example is not the most idiomatic
way to use ports.  It is more common to acquire ports via procedures
like ‘call-with-output-file’, which handle the ‘close-port’
automatically:

     (call-with-output-file "foo.txt"
       (lambda (port)
         (display "Hello, world!\n" port)))

   Finally, all ports have associated input and output buffers, as
appropriate.  Buffering is a common strategy to limit the overhead of
small reads and writes: without buffering, each character fetched from a
file would involve at least one call into the kernel, and maybe more
depending on the character and the encoding.  Instead, Guile will batch
reads and writes into internal buffers.  However, sometimes you want to
make output on a port show up immediately.  *Note* Buffering::, for more
on interfaces to control port buffering.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port? x
 -- C Function: scm_port_p (x)
     Return a boolean indicating whether X is a port.

 -- Scheme Procedure: input-port? x
 -- C Function: scm_input_port_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if X is an input port, otherwise return ‘#f’.  Any
     object satisfying this predicate also satisfies ‘port?’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: output-port? x
 -- C Function: scm_output_port_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if X is an output port, otherwise return ‘#f’.  Any
     object satisfying this predicate also satisfies ‘port?’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: close-port port
 -- C Function: scm_close_port (port)
     Close the specified port object.  Return ‘#t’ if it successfully
     closes a port or ‘#f’ if it was already closed.  An exception may
     be raised if an error occurs, for example when flushing buffered
     output.  *Note* Buffering::, for more on buffered output.  *Note*
     close: Ports and File Descriptors, for a procedure which can close
     file descriptors.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-closed? port
 -- C Function: scm_port_closed_p (port)
     Return ‘#t’ if PORT is closed or ‘#f’ if it is open.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-port port proc
     Call PROC, passing it PORT and closing PORT upon exit of PROC.
     Return the return values of PROC.

6.12.2 Binary I/O
-----------------

Guile’s ports are fundamentally binary in nature: at the lowest level,
they work on bytes.  This section describes Guile’s core binary I/O
operations.  *Note* Textual I/O::, for input and output of strings and
characters.

   To use these routines, first include the binary I/O module:

     (use-modules (ice-9 binary-ports))

   Note that although this module’s name suggests that binary ports are
some different kind of port, that’s not the case: all ports in Guile are
both binary and textual ports.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-u8 port
 -- C Function: scm_get_u8 (port)
     Return an octet read from PORT, an input port, blocking as
     necessary, or the end-of-file object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lookahead-u8 port
 -- C Function: scm_lookahead_u8 (port)
     Like ‘get-u8’ but does not update PORT’s position to point past the
     octet.

   The end-of-file object is unlike any other kind of object: it’s not a
pair, a symbol, or anything else.  To check if a value is the
end-of-file object, use the ‘eof-object?’ predicate.

 -- Scheme Procedure: eof-object? x
 -- C Function: scm_eof_object_p (x)
     Return ‘#t’ if X is an end-of-file object, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

   Note that unlike other procedures in this module, ‘eof-object?’ is
defined in the default environment.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-bytevector-n port count
 -- C Function: scm_get_bytevector_n (port, count)
     Read COUNT octets from PORT, blocking as necessary and return a
     bytevector containing the octets read.  If fewer bytes are
     available, a bytevector smaller than COUNT is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-bytevector-n! port bv start count
 -- C Function: scm_get_bytevector_n_x (port, bv, start, count)
     Read COUNT bytes from PORT and store them in BV starting at index
     START.  Return either the number of bytes actually read or the
     end-of-file object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-bytevector-some port
 -- C Function: scm_get_bytevector_some (port)
     Read from PORT, blocking as necessary, until bytes are available or
     an end-of-file is reached.  Return either the end-of-file object or
     a new bytevector containing some of the available bytes (at least
     one), and update the port position to point just past these bytes.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-bytevector-some! port bv start count
 -- C Function: scm_get_bytevector_some_x (port, bv, start, count)
     Read up to COUNT bytes from PORT, blocking as necessary until at
     least one byte is available or an end-of-file is reached.  Store
     them in BV starting at index START.  Return the number of bytes
     actually read, or an end-of-file object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-bytevector-all port
 -- C Function: scm_get_bytevector_all (port)
     Read from PORT, blocking as necessary, until the end-of-file is
     reached.  Return either a new bytevector containing the data read
     or the end-of-file object (if no data were available).

 -- Scheme Procedure: unget-bytevector port bv [start [count]]
 -- C Function: scm_unget_bytevector (port, bv, start, count)
     Place the contents of BV in PORT, optionally starting at index
     START and limiting to COUNT octets, so that its bytes will be read
     from left-to-right as the next bytes from PORT during subsequent
     read operations.  If called multiple times, the unread bytes will
     be read again in last-in first-out order.

   To perform binary output on a port, use ‘put-u8’ or ‘put-bytevector’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: put-u8 port octet
 -- C Function: scm_put_u8 (port, octet)
     Write OCTET, an integer in the 0–255 range, to PORT, a binary
     output port.

 -- Scheme Procedure: put-bytevector port bv [start [count]]
 -- C Function: scm_put_bytevector (port, bv, start, count)
     Write the contents of BV to PORT, optionally starting at index
     START and limiting to COUNT octets.

### Binary I/O in R7RS
..................

*note* R7RS: R7RS Standard Libraries. defines the following binary I/O
procedures.  Access them with

     (use-modules (scheme base))

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-output-bytevector
     Returns a binary output port that will accumulate bytes for
     retrieval by *note* ‘get-output-bytevector’:
     x-get-output-bytevector.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-u8 byte [out]
     Writes BYTE to the given binary output port OUT and returns an
     unspecified value.  OUT defaults to ‘(current-output-port)’.

     See also *note* ‘put-u8’: x-put-u8.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-u8 [in]
     Returns the next byte available from the binary input port IN,
     updating the port to point to the following byte.  If no more bytes
     are available, an end-of-file object is returned.  IN defaults to
     ‘(current-input-port)’.

     See also *note* ‘get-u8’: x-get-u8.

 -- Scheme Procedure: peek-u8 [in]
     Returns the next byte available from the binary input port IN, but
     without updating the port to point to the following byte.  If no
     more bytes are available, an end-of-file object is returned.  IN
     defaults to ‘(current-input-port)’.

     See also *note* ‘lookahead-u8’: x-lookahead-u8.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-output-bytevector port
     Returns a bytevector consisting of the bytes that have been output
     to PORT so far in the order they were output.  It is an error if
     PORT was not created with *note* ‘open-output-bytevector’:
     x-open-output-bytevector.

          (define out (open-output-bytevector))
          (write-u8 1 out)
          (write-u8 2 out)
          (write-u8 3 out)
          (get-output-bytevector out) ⇒ #vu8(1 2 3)

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-input-bytevector bv
     Takes a bytevector BV and returns a binary input port that delivers
     bytes from BV.

          (define in (open-input-bytevector #vu8(1 2 3)))
          (read-u8 in) ⇒ 1
          (peek-u8 in) ⇒ 2
          (read-u8 in) ⇒ 2
          (read-u8 in) ⇒ 3
          (read-u8 in) ⇒ #<eof>

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-bytevector! bv [port [start [end]]]
     Reads the next END - START bytes, or as many as are available
     before the end of file, from the binary input port into the
     bytevector BV in left-to-right order beginning at the START
     position.  If END is not supplied, reads until the end of BV has
     been reached.  If START is not supplied, reads beginning at
     position 0.

     Returns the number of bytes read.  If no bytes are available, an
     end-of-file object is returned.

          (define in (open-input-bytevector #vu8(1 2 3)))
          (define bv (make-bytevector 5 0))
          (read-bytevector! bv in 1 3) ⇒ 2
          bv ⇒ #vu8(0 1 2 0 0 0)

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-bytevector k in
     Reads the next K bytes, or as many as are available before the end
     of file if that is less than K, from the binary input port IN into
     a newly allocated bytevector in left-to-right order, and returns
     the bytevector.  If no bytes are available before the end of file,
     an end-of-file object is returned.

          (define bv #vu8(1 2 3))
          (read-bytevector 2 (open-input-bytevector bv)) ⇒ #vu8(1 2)
          (read-bytevector 10 (open-input-bytevector bv)) ⇒ #vu8(1 2 3)

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-bytevector bv [port [start [end]]]
     Writes the bytes of bytevector BV from START to END in
     left-to-right order to the binary output PORT.  START defaults to 0
     and END defaults to the length of BV.

          (define out (open-output-bytevector))
          (write-bytevector #vu8(0 1 2 3 4) out 2 4)
          (get-output-bytevector out) ⇒ #vu8(2 3)

6.12.3 Encoding
---------------

Textual input and output on Guile ports is layered on top of binary
operations.  To this end, each port has an associated character encoding
that controls how bytes read from the port are converted to characters,
and how characters written to the port are converted to bytes.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-encoding port
 -- C Function: scm_port_encoding (port)
     Returns, as a string, the character encoding that PORT uses to
     interpret its input and output.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-port-encoding! port enc
 -- C Function: scm_set_port_encoding_x (port, enc)
     Sets the character encoding that will be used to interpret I/O to
     PORT.  ENC is a string containing the name of an encoding.  Valid
     encoding names are those defined by IANA
     (http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets), for example
     ‘"UTF-8"’ or ‘"ISO-8859-1"’.

   When ports are created, they are assigned an encoding.  The usual
process to determine the initial encoding for a port is to take the
value of the ‘%default-port-encoding’ fluid.

 -- Scheme Variable: %default-port-encoding
     A fluid containing name of the encoding to be used by default for
     newly created ports (*note* Fluids and Dynamic States::).  As a
     special case, the value ‘#f’ is equivalent to ‘"ISO-8859-1"’.

   The ‘%default-port-encoding’ itself defaults to the encoding
appropriate for the current locale, if ‘setlocale’ has been called.
*Note* Locales::, for more on locales and when you might need to call
‘setlocale’ explicitly.

   Some port types have other ways of determining their initial locales.
String ports, for example, default to the UTF-8 encoding, in order to be
able to represent all characters regardless of the current locale.  File
ports can optionally sniff their file for a ‘coding:’ declaration; *Note*
File Ports::.  Binary ports might be initialized to the ISO-8859-1
encoding in which each codepoint between 0 and 255 corresponds to a byte
with that value.

   Currently, the ports only work with _non-modal_ encodings.  Most
encodings are non-modal, meaning that the conversion of bytes to a
string doesn’t depend on its context: the same byte sequence will always
return the same string.  A couple of modal encodings are in common use,
like ISO-2022-JP and ISO-2022-KR, and they are not yet supported.

   Each port also has an associated conversion strategy, which
determines what to do when a Guile character can’t be converted to the
port’s encoded character representation for output.  There are three
possible strategies: to raise an error, to replace the character with a
hex escape, or to replace the character with a substitute character.
Port conversion strategies are also used when decoding characters from
an input port.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-conversion-strategy port
 -- C Function: scm_port_conversion_strategy (port)
     Returns the behavior of the port when outputting a character that
     is not representable in the port’s current encoding.

     If PORT is ‘#f’, then the current default behavior will be
     returned.  New ports will have this default behavior when they are
     created.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-port-conversion-strategy! port sym
 -- C Function: scm_set_port_conversion_strategy_x (port, sym)
     Sets the behavior of Guile when outputting a character that is not
     representable in the port’s current encoding, or when Guile
     encounters a decoding error when trying to read a character.  SYM
     can be either ‘error’, ‘substitute’, or ‘escape’.

     If PORT is an open port, the conversion error behavior is set for
     that port.  If it is ‘#f’, it is set as the default behavior for
     any future ports that get created in this thread.

   As with port encodings, there is a fluid which determines the initial
conversion strategy for a port.

 -- Scheme Variable: %default-port-conversion-strategy
     The fluid that defines the conversion strategy for newly created
     ports, and also for other conversion routines such as
     ‘scm_to_stringn’, ‘scm_from_stringn’, ‘string->pointer’, and
     ‘pointer->string’.

     Its value must be one of the symbols described above, with the same
     semantics: ‘error’, ‘substitute’, or ‘escape’.

     When Guile starts, its value is ‘substitute’.

     Note that ‘(set-port-conversion-strategy! #f SYM)’ is equivalent to
     ‘(fluid-set! %default-port-conversion-strategy SYM)’.

   As mentioned above, for an output port there are three possible port
conversion strategies.  The ‘error’ strategy will throw an error when a
nonconvertible character is encountered.  The ‘substitute’ strategy will
replace nonconvertible characters with a question mark (‘?’).  Finally
the ‘escape’ strategy will print nonconvertible characters as a hex
escape, using the escaping that is recognized by Guile’s string syntax.
Note that if the port’s encoding is a Unicode encoding, like ‘UTF-8’,
then encoding errors are impossible.

   For an input port, the ‘error’ strategy will cause Guile to throw an
error if it encounters an invalid encoding, such as might happen if you
tried to read ‘ISO-8859-1’ as ‘UTF-8’.  The error is thrown before
advancing the read position.  The ‘substitute’ strategy will replace the
bad bytes with a U+FFFD replacement character, in accordance with
Unicode recommendations.  When reading from an input port, the ‘escape’
strategy is treated as if it were ‘error’.

6.12.4 Textual I/O
------------------

This section describes Guile’s core textual I/O operations on characters
and strings.  *Note* Binary I/O::, for input and output of bytes and
bytevectors.  *Note* Encoding::, for more on how characters relate to
bytes.  To read general S-expressions from ports, *Note* Scheme Read::.
*Note* Scheme Write::, for interfaces that write generic Scheme datums.

   To use these routines, first include the textual I/O module:

     (use-modules (ice-9 textual-ports))

   Note that although this module’s name suggests that textual ports are
some different kind of port, that’s not the case: all ports in Guile are
both binary and textual ports.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-char input-port
     Reads from INPUT-PORT, blocking as necessary, until a complete
     character is available from INPUT-PORT, or until an end of file is
     reached.

     If a complete character is available before the next end of file,
     ‘get-char’ returns that character and updates the input port to
     point past the character.  If an end of file is reached before any
     character is read, ‘get-char’ returns the end-of-file object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lookahead-char input-port
     The ‘lookahead-char’ procedure is like ‘get-char’, but it does not
     update INPUT-PORT to point past the character.

   In the same way that it’s possible to "unget" a byte or bytes, it’s
possible to "unget" the bytes corresponding to an encoded character.

 -- Scheme Procedure: unget-char port char
     Place character CHAR in PORT so that it will be read by the next
     read operation.  If called multiple times, the unread characters
     will be read again in last-in first-out order.

 -- Scheme Procedure: unget-string port str
     Place the string STR in PORT so that its characters will be read
     from left-to-right as the next characters from PORT during
     subsequent read operations.  If called multiple times, the unread
     characters will be read again in last-in first-out order.

   Reading in a character at a time can be inefficient.  If it’s
possible to perform I/O over multiple characters at a time, via strings,
that might be faster.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-string-n input-port count
     The ‘get-string-n’ procedure reads from INPUT-PORT, blocking as
     necessary, until COUNT characters are available, or until an end of
     file is reached.  COUNT must be an exact, non-negative integer,
     representing the number of characters to be read.

     If COUNT characters are available before end of file,
     ‘get-string-n’ returns a string consisting of those COUNT
     characters.  If fewer characters are available before an end of
     file, but one or more characters can be read, ‘get-string-n’
     returns a string containing those characters.  In either case, the
     input port is updated to point just past the characters read.  If
     no characters can be read before an end of file, the end-of-file
     object is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-string-n! input-port string start count
     The ‘get-string-n!’ procedure reads from INPUT-PORT in the same
     manner as ‘get-string-n’.  START and COUNT must be exact,
     non-negative integer objects, with COUNT representing the number of
     characters to be read.  STRING must be a string with at least
     $START + COUNT$ characters.

     If COUNT characters are available before an end of file, they are
     written into STRING starting at index START, and COUNT is returned.
     If fewer characters are available before an end of file, but one or
     more can be read, those characters are written into STRING starting
     at index START and the number of characters actually read is
     returned as an exact integer object.  If no characters can be read
     before an end of file, the end-of-file object is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-string-all input-port
     Reads from INPUT-PORT until an end of file, decoding characters in
     the same manner as ‘get-string-n’ and ‘get-string-n!’.

     If characters are available before the end of file, a string
     containing all the characters decoded from that data are returned.
     If no character precedes the end of file, the end-of-file object is
     returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-line input-port
     Reads from INPUT-PORT up to and including the linefeed character or
     end of file, decoding characters in the same manner as
     ‘get-string-n’ and ‘get-string-n!’.

     If a linefeed character is read, a string containing all of the
     text up to (but not including) the linefeed character is returned,
     and the port is updated to point just past the linefeed character.
     If an end of file is encountered before any linefeed character is
     read, but some characters have been read and decoded as characters,
     a string containing those characters is returned.  If an end of
     file is encountered before any characters are read, the end-of-file
     object is returned.

   Finally, there are just two core procedures to write characters to a
port.

 -- Scheme Procedure: put-char port char
     Writes CHAR to the port.  The ‘put-char’ procedure returns an
     unspecified value.

 -- Scheme Procedure: put-string port string
 -- Scheme Procedure: put-string port string start
 -- Scheme Procedure: put-string port string start count
     Write the COUNT characters of STRING starting at index START to the
     port.

     START and COUNT must be non-negative exact integer objects.  STRING
     must have a length of at least START + COUNT.  START defaults to 0.
     COUNT defaults to ‘(string-length STRING)’ - START$.

     Calling ‘put-string’ is equivalent in all respects to calling
     ‘put-char’ on the relevant sequence of characters, except that it
     will attempt to write multiple characters to the port at a time,
     even if the port is unbuffered.

     The ‘put-string’ procedure returns an unspecified value.

   Textual ports have a textual position associated with them: a line
and a column.  Reading in characters or writing them out advances the
line and the column appropriately.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-column port
 -- Scheme Procedure: port-line port
 -- C Function: scm_port_column (port)
 -- C Function: scm_port_line (port)
     Return the current column number or line number of PORT.

   Port lines and positions are represented as 0-origin integers, which
is to say that the the first character of the first line is line 0,
column 0.  However, when you display a line number, for example in an
error message, we recommend you add 1 to get 1-origin integers.  This is
because lines numbers traditionally start with 1, and that is what
non-programmers will find most natural.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-port-column! port column
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-port-line! port line
 -- C Function: scm_set_port_column_x (port, column)
 -- C Function: scm_set_port_line_x (port, line)
     Set the current column or line number of PORT.

6.12.5 Simple Textual Output
----------------------------

Guile exports a simple formatted output function, ‘simple-format’.  For
a more capable formatted output facility, *Note* Formatted Output::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: simple-format destination message . args
 -- C Function: scm_simple_format (destination, message, args)
     Write MESSAGE to DESTINATION, defaulting to the current output
     port.  MESSAGE can contain ‘~A’ and ‘~S’ escapes.  When printed,
     the escapes are replaced with corresponding members of ARGS: ‘~A’
     formats using ‘display’ and ‘~S’ formats using ‘write’.  If
     DESTINATION is ‘#t’, then use the current output port, if
     DESTINATION is ‘#f’, then return a string containing the formatted
     text.  Does not add a trailing newline.

   Somewhat confusingly, Guile binds the ‘format’ identifier to
‘simple-format’ at startup.  Once ‘(ice-9 format)’ loads, it actually
replaces the core ‘format’ binding, so depending on whether you or a
module you use has loaded ‘(ice-9 format)’, you may be using the simple
or the more capable version.


File: guile.info,  Node: Buffering,  Next: Random Access,  Prev: Simple Output,  Up: Input and Output

6.12.6 Buffering
----------------

Every port has associated input and output buffers.  You can think of
ports as being backed by some mutable store, and that store might be far
away.  For example, ports backed by file descriptors have to go all the
way to the kernel to read and write their data.  To avoid this
round-trip cost, Guile usually reads in data from the mutable store in
chunks, and then services small requests like ‘get-char’ out of that
intermediate buffer.  Similarly, small writes like ‘write-char’ first go
to a buffer, and are sent to the store when the buffer is full (or when
port is flushed).  Buffered ports speed up your program by reducing the
number of round-trips to the mutable store, and they do so in a way that
is mostly transparent to the user.

   There are two major ways, however, in which buffering affects program
semantics.  Building correct, performant programs requires understanding
these situations.

   The first case is in random-access read/write ports (*note* Random
Access::).  These ports, usually backed by a file, logically operate
over the same mutable store when both reading and writing.  So, if you
read a character, causing the buffer to fill, then write a character,
the bytes you filled in your read buffer are now invalid.  Every time
you switch between reading and writing, Guile has to flush any pending
buffer.  If this happens frequently, the cost can be high.  In that case
you should reduce the amount that you buffer, in both directions.
Similarly, Guile has to flush buffers before seeking.  None of these
considerations apply to sockets, which don’t logically read from and
write to the same mutable store, and are not seekable.  Note also that
sockets are unbuffered by default.  *Note* Network Sockets and
Communication::.

   The second case is the more pernicious one.  If you write data to a
buffered port, it probably doesn’t go out to the mutable store directly.
(This “probably” introduces some indeterminism in your program: what
goes to the store, and when, depends on how full the buffer is.  It is
something that the user needs to explicitly be aware of.)  The data is
written to the store later – when the buffer fills up due to another
write, or when ‘force-output’ is called, or when ‘close-port’ is called,
or when the program exits, or even when the garbage collector runs.  The
salient point is, _the errors are signalled then too_.  Buffered writes
defer error detection (and defer the side effects to the mutable store),
perhaps indefinitely if the port type does not need to be closed at GC.

   One common heuristic that works well for textual ports is to flush
output when a newline (‘\n’) is written.  This “line buffering” mode is
on by default for TTY ports.  Most other ports are “block buffered”,
meaning that once the output buffer reaches the block size, which
depends on the port and its configuration, the output is flushed as a
block, without regard to what is in the block.  Likewise reads are read
in at the block size, though if there are fewer bytes available to read,
the buffer may not be entirely filled.

   Note that binary reads or writes that are larger than the buffer size
go directly to the mutable store without passing through the buffers.
If your access pattern involves many big reads or writes, buffering
might not matter so much to you.

   To control the buffering behavior of a port, use ‘setvbuf’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setvbuf port mode [size]
 -- C Function: scm_setvbuf (port, mode, size)
     Set the buffering mode for PORT.  MODE can be one of the following
     symbols:

     ‘none’
          non-buffered
     ‘line’
          line buffered
     ‘block’
          block buffered, using a newly allocated buffer of SIZE bytes.
          If SIZE is omitted, a default size will be used.

   Another way to set the buffering, for file ports, is to open the file
with ‘0’ or ‘l’ as part of the mode string, for unbuffered or
line-buffered ports, respectively.  *Note* File Ports::, for more.

   Any buffered output data will be written out when the port is closed.
To make sure to flush it at specific points in your program, use
‘force-otput’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: force-output [port]
 -- C Function: scm_force_output (port)
     Flush the specified output port, or the current output port if PORT
     is omitted.  The current output buffer contents, if any, are passed
     to the underlying port implementation.

     The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: flush-all-ports
 -- C Function: scm_flush_all_ports ()
     Equivalent to calling ‘force-output’ on all open output ports.  The
     return value is unspecified.

   Similarly, sometimes you might want to switch from using Guile’s
ports to working directly on file descriptors.  In that case, for input
ports use ‘drain-input’ to get any buffered input from that port.

 -- Scheme Procedure: drain-input port
 -- C Function: scm_drain_input (port)
     This procedure clears a port’s input buffers, similar to the way
     that force-output clears the output buffer.  The contents of the
     buffers are returned as a single string, e.g.,

          (define p (open-input-file ...))
          (drain-input p) => empty string, nothing buffered yet.
          (unread-char (read-char p) p)
          (drain-input p) => initial chars from p, up to the buffer size.

   All of these considerations are very similar to those of streams in
the C library, although Guile’s ports are not built on top of C streams.
Still, it is useful to read what other systems do.  *Note*
(libc)Streams::, for more discussion on C streams.

6.12.7 Random Access
--------------------

 -- Scheme Procedure: seek fd_port offset whence
 -- C Function: scm_seek (fd_port, offset, whence)
     Sets the current position of FD_PORT to the integer OFFSET.  For a
     file port, OFFSET is expressed as a number of bytes; for other
     types of ports, such as string ports, OFFSET is an abstract
     representation of the position within the port’s data, not
     necessarily expressed as a number of bytes.  OFFSET is interpreted
     according to the value of WHENCE.

     One of the following variables should be supplied for WHENCE:
      -- Variable: SEEK_SET
          Seek from the beginning of the file.
      -- Variable: SEEK_CUR
          Seek from the current position.
      -- Variable: SEEK_END
          Seek from the end of the file.
     If FD_PORT is a file descriptor, the underlying system call is
     ‘lseek’.  PORT may be a string port.

     The value returned is the new position in FD_PORT.  This means that
     the current position of a port can be obtained using:
          (seek port 0 SEEK_CUR)

 -- Scheme Procedure: ftell fd_port
 -- C Function: scm_ftell (fd_port)
     Return an integer representing the current position of FD_PORT,
     measured from the beginning.  Equivalent to:

          (seek port 0 SEEK_CUR)

 -- Scheme Procedure: truncate-file file [length]
 -- C Function: scm_truncate_file (file, length)
     Truncate FILE to LENGTH bytes.  FILE can be a filename string, a
     port object, or an integer file descriptor.  The return value is
     unspecified.

     For a port or file descriptor LENGTH can be omitted, in which case
     the file is truncated at the current position (per ‘ftell’ above).

     On most systems a file can be extended by giving a length greater
     than the current size, but this is not mandatory in the POSIX
     standard.

6.12.8 Line Oriented and Delimited Text
---------------------------------------

The delimited-I/O module can be accessed with:

     (use-modules (ice-9 rdelim))

   It can be used to read or write lines of text, or read text delimited
by a specified set of characters.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-line [port] [handle-delim]
     Return a line of text from PORT if specified, otherwise from the
     value returned by ‘(current-input-port)’.  Under Unix, a line of
     text is terminated by the first end-of-line character or by
     end-of-file.

     If HANDLE-DELIM is specified, it should be one of the following
     symbols:
     ‘trim’
          Discard the terminating delimiter.  This is the default, but
          it will be impossible to tell whether the read terminated with
          a delimiter or end-of-file.
     ‘concat’
          Append the terminating delimiter (if any) to the returned
          string.
     ‘peek’
          Push the terminating delimiter (if any) back on to the port.
     ‘split’
          Return a pair containing the string read from the port and the
          terminating delimiter or end-of-file object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-line! buf [port]
     Read a line of text into the supplied string BUF and return the
     number of characters added to BUF.  If BUF is filled, then ‘#f’ is
     returned.  Read from PORT if specified, otherwise from the value
     returned by ‘(current-input-port)’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-delimited delims [port] [handle-delim]
     Read text until one of the characters in the string DELIMS is found
     or end-of-file is reached.  Read from PORT if supplied, otherwise
     from the value returned by ‘(current-input-port)’.  HANDLE-DELIM
     takes the same values as described for ‘read-line’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-delimited! delims buf [port] [handle-delim]
          [start] [end]
     Read text into the supplied string BUF.

     If a delimiter was found, return the number of characters written,
     except if HANDLE-DELIM is ‘split’, in which case the return value
     is a pair, as noted above.

     As a special case, if PORT was already at end-of-stream, the EOF
     object is returned.  Also, if no characters were written because
     the buffer was full, ‘#f’ is returned.

     It’s something of a wacky interface, to be honest.

 -- Scheme Procedure: %read-delimited! delims str gobble [port [start
          [end]]]
 -- C Function: scm_read_delimited_x (delims, str, gobble, port, start,
          end)
     Read characters from PORT into STR until one of the characters in
     the DELIMS string is encountered.  If GOBBLE is true, discard the
     delimiter character; otherwise, leave it in the input stream for
     the next read.  If PORT is not specified, use the value of
     ‘(current-input-port)’.  If START or END are specified, store data
     only into the substring of STR bounded by START and END (which
     default to the beginning and end of the string, respectively).

     Return a pair consisting of the delimiter that terminated the
     string and the number of characters read.  If reading stopped at
     the end of file, the delimiter returned is the EOF-OBJECT; if the
     string was filled without encountering a delimiter, this value is
     ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: %read-line [port]
 -- C Function: scm_read_line (port)
     Read a newline-terminated line from PORT, allocating storage as
     necessary.  The newline terminator (if any) is removed from the
     string, and a pair consisting of the line and its delimiter is
     returned.  The delimiter may be either a newline or the EOF-OBJECT;
     if ‘%read-line’ is called at the end of file, it returns the pair
     ‘(#<eof> . #<eof>)’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-line obj [port]
 -- C Function: scm_write_line (obj, port)
     Display OBJ and a newline character to PORT.  If PORT is not
     specified, ‘(current-output-port)’ is used.  This procedure is
     equivalent to:
          (display obj [port])
          (newline [port])


File: guile.info,  Node: Default Ports,  Next: Port Types,  Prev: Line/Delimited,  Up: Input and Output

6.12.9 Default Ports for Input, Output and Errors
-------------------------------------------------

 -- Scheme Procedure: current-input-port
 -- C Function: scm_current_input_port ()
     Return the current input port.  This is the default port used by
     many input procedures.

     Initially this is the “standard input” in Unix and C terminology.
     When the standard input is a tty the port is unbuffered, otherwise
     it’s fully buffered.

     Unbuffered input is good if an application runs an interactive
     subprocess, since any type-ahead input won’t go into Guile’s buffer
     and be unavailable to the subprocess.

     Note that Guile buffering is completely separate from the tty “line
     discipline”.  In the usual cooked mode on a tty Guile only sees a
     line of input once the user presses <Return>.

 -- Scheme Procedure: current-output-port
 -- C Function: scm_current_output_port ()
     Return the current output port.  This is the default port used by
     many output procedures.

     Initially this is the “standard output” in Unix and C terminology.
     When the standard output is a tty this port is unbuffered,
     otherwise it’s fully buffered.

     Unbuffered output to a tty is good for ensuring progress output or
     a prompt is seen.  But an application which always prints whole
     lines could change to line buffered, or an application with a lot
     of output could go fully buffered and perhaps make explicit
     ‘force-output’ calls (*note* Buffering::) at selected points.

 -- Scheme Procedure: current-error-port
 -- C Function: scm_current_error_port ()
     Return the port to which errors and warnings should be sent.

     Initially this is the “standard error” in Unix and C terminology.
     When the standard error is a tty this port is unbuffered, otherwise
     it’s fully buffered.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-current-input-port port
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-current-output-port port
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-current-error-port port
 -- C Function: scm_set_current_input_port (port)
 -- C Function: scm_set_current_output_port (port)
 -- C Function: scm_set_current_error_port (port)
     Change the ports returned by ‘current-input-port’,
     ‘current-output-port’ and ‘current-error-port’, respectively, so
     that they use the supplied PORT for input or output.

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-input-from-port port thunk
 -- Scheme Procedure: with-output-to-port port thunk
 -- Scheme Procedure: with-error-to-port port thunk
     Call THUNK in a dynamic environment in which ‘current-input-port’,
     ‘current-output-port’ or ‘current-error-port’ is rebound to the
     given PORT.

 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_current_input_port (SCM port)
 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_current_output_port (SCM port)
 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_current_error_port (SCM port)
     These functions must be used inside a pair of calls to
     ‘scm_dynwind_begin’ and ‘scm_dynwind_end’ (*note* Dynamic Wind::).
     During the dynwind context, the indicated port is set to PORT.

     More precisely, the current port is swapped with a ‘backup’ value
     whenever the dynwind context is entered or left.  The backup value
     is initialized with the PORT argument.

### 6.12.10.1 File Ports
....................

The following procedures are used to open file ports.  See also *note*
open: Ports and File Descriptors, for an interface to the Unix ‘open’
system call.

   All file access uses the “LFS” large file support functions when
available, so files bigger than 2 Gbytes (2^31 bytes) can be read and
written on a 32-bit system.

   Most systems have limits on how many files can be open, so it’s
strongly recommended that file ports be closed explicitly when no longer
required (*note* Ports::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-file filename mode [#:guess-encoding=#f]
          [#:encoding=#f]
 -- C Function: scm_open_file_with_encoding (filename, mode,
          guess_encoding, encoding)
 -- C Function: scm_open_file (filename, mode)
     Open the file whose name is FILENAME, and return a port
     representing that file.  The attributes of the port are determined
     by the MODE string.  The way in which this is interpreted is
     similar to C stdio.  The first character must be one of the
     following:

     ‘r’
          Open an existing file for input.
     ‘w’
          Open a file for output, creating it if it doesn’t already
          exist or removing its contents if it does.
     ‘a’
          Open a file for output, creating it if it doesn’t already
          exist.  All writes to the port will go to the end of the file.
          The "append mode" can be turned off while the port is in use
          *note* fcntl: Ports and File Descriptors.

     The following additional characters can be appended:

     ‘b’
          Open the underlying file in binary mode, if supported by the
          system.  Also, open the file using the binary-compatible
          character encoding "ISO-8859-1", ignoring the default port
          encoding.
     ‘+’
          Open the port for both input and output.  E.g., ‘r+’: open an
          existing file for both input and output.
     ‘e’
          Mark the underlying file descriptor as close-on-exec, as per
          the ‘O_CLOEXEC’ flag.
     ‘0’
          Create an "unbuffered" port.  In this case input and output
          operations are passed directly to the underlying port
          implementation without additional buffering.  This is likely
          to slow down I/O operations.  The buffering mode can be
          changed while a port is in use (*note* Buffering::).
     ‘l’
          Add line-buffering to the port.  The port output buffer will
          be automatically flushed whenever a newline character is
          written.
     ‘b’
          Use binary mode, ensuring that each byte in the file will be
          read as one Scheme character.

          To provide this property, the file will be opened with the
          8-bit character encoding "ISO-8859-1", ignoring the default
          port encoding.  *Note* Ports::, for more information on port
          encodings.

          Note that while it is possible to read and write binary data
          as characters or strings, it is usually better to treat bytes
          as octets, and byte sequences as bytevectors.  *Note* Binary
          I/O::, for more.

          This option had another historical meaning, for DOS
          compatibility: in the default (textual) mode, DOS reads a
          CR-LF sequence as one LF byte.  The ‘b’ flag prevents this
          from happening, adding ‘O_BINARY’ to the underlying ‘open’
          call.  Still, the flag is generally useful because of its port
          encoding ramifications.

     Unless binary mode is requested, the character encoding of the new
     port is determined as follows: First, if GUESS-ENCODING is true,
     the ‘file-encoding’ procedure is used to guess the encoding of the
     file (*note* Character Encoding of Source Files::).  If
     GUESS-ENCODING is false or if ‘file-encoding’ fails, ENCODING is
     used unless it is also false.  As a last resort, the default port
     encoding is used.  *Note* Ports::, for more information on port
     encodings.  It is an error to pass a non-false GUESS-ENCODING or
     ENCODING if binary mode is requested.

     If a file cannot be opened with the access requested, ‘open-file’
     throws an exception.

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-input-file filename [#:guess-encoding=#f]
          [#:encoding=#f] [#:binary=#f]

     Open FILENAME for input.  If BINARY is true, open the port in
     binary mode, otherwise use text mode.  ENCODING and GUESS-ENCODING
     determine the character encoding as described above for
     ‘open-file’.  Equivalent to
          (open-file FILENAME
                     (if BINARY "rb" "r")
                     #:guess-encoding GUESS-ENCODING
                     #:encoding ENCODING)

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-output-file filename [#:encoding=#f]
          [#:binary=#f]

     Open FILENAME for output.  If BINARY is true, open the port in
     binary mode, otherwise use text mode.  ENCODING specifies the
     character encoding as described above for ‘open-file’.  Equivalent
     to
          (open-file FILENAME
                     (if BINARY "wb" "w")
                     #:encoding ENCODING)

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-input-file filename proc
          [#:guess-encoding=#f] [#:encoding=#f] [#:binary=#f]
 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-output-file filename proc
          [#:encoding=#f] [#:binary=#f]
     Open FILENAME for input or output, and call ‘(PROC port)’ with the
     resulting port.  Return the value returned by PROC.  FILENAME is
     opened as per ‘open-input-file’ or ‘open-output-file’ respectively,
     and an error is signaled if it cannot be opened.

     When PROC returns, the port is closed.  If PROC does not return
     (e.g. if it throws an error), then the port might not be closed
     automatically, though it will be garbage collected in the usual way
     if not otherwise referenced.

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-input-from-file filename thunk
          [#:guess-encoding=#f] [#:encoding=#f] [#:binary=#f]
 -- Scheme Procedure: with-output-to-file filename thunk [#:encoding=#f]
          [#:binary=#f]
 -- Scheme Procedure: with-error-to-file filename thunk [#:encoding=#f]
          [#:binary=#f]
     Open FILENAME and call ‘(THUNK)’ with the new port setup as
     respectively the ‘current-input-port’, ‘current-output-port’, or
     ‘current-error-port’.  Return the value returned by THUNK.
     FILENAME is opened as per ‘open-input-file’ or ‘open-output-file’
     respectively, and an error is signaled if it cannot be opened.

     When THUNK returns, the port is closed and the previous setting of
     the respective current port is restored.

     The current port setting is managed with ‘dynamic-wind’, so the
     previous value is restored no matter how THUNK exits (eg. an
     exception), and if THUNK is re-entered (via a captured
     continuation) then it’s set again to the FILENAME port.

     The port is closed when THUNK returns normally, but not when exited
     via an exception or new continuation.  This ensures it’s still
     ready for use if THUNK is re-entered by a captured continuation.
     Of course the port is always garbage collected and closed in the
     usual way when no longer referenced anywhere.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-mode port
 -- C Function: scm_port_mode (port)
     Return the port modes associated with the open port PORT.  These
     will not necessarily be identical to the modes used when the port
     was opened, since modes such as "append" which are used only during
     port creation are not retained.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-filename port
 -- C Function: scm_port_filename (port)
     Return the filename associated with PORT, or ‘#f’ if no filename is
     associated with the port.

     PORT must be open; ‘port-filename’ cannot be used once the port is
     closed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-port-filename! port filename
 -- C Function: scm_set_port_filename_x (port, filename)
     Change the filename associated with PORT, using the current input
     port if none is specified.  Note that this does not change the
     port’s source of data, but only the value that is returned by
     ‘port-filename’ and reported in diagnostic output.

 -- Scheme Procedure: file-port? obj
 -- C Function: scm_file_port_p (obj)
     Determine whether OBJ is a port that is related to a file.

### 6.12.10.2 Bytevector Ports
..........................

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-bytevector-input-port bv [transcoder]
 -- C Function: scm_open_bytevector_input_port (bv, transcoder)
     Return an input port whose contents are drawn from bytevector BV
     (*note* Bytevectors::).

     The TRANSCODER argument is currently not supported.

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-bytevector-output-port [transcoder]
 -- C Function: scm_open_bytevector_output_port (transcoder)
     Return two values: a binary output port and a procedure.  The
     latter should be called with zero arguments to obtain a bytevector
     containing the data accumulated by the port, as illustrated below.

          (call-with-values
            (lambda ()
              (open-bytevector-output-port))
            (lambda (port get-bytevector)
              (display "hello" port)
              (get-bytevector)))

          ⇒ #vu8(104 101 108 108 111)

     The TRANSCODER argument is currently not supported.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-output-bytevector proc
     Call the one-argument procedure PROC with a newly created
     bytevector output port.  When the function returns, the bytevector
     composed of the characters written into the port is returned.  PROC
     should not close the port.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-input-bytevector bytevector proc
     Call the one-argument procedure PROC with a newly created input
     port from which BYTEVECTOR’s contents may be read.  The values
     yielded by the PROC is returned.

### 6.12.10.3 String Ports
......................

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-output-string proc
 -- C Function: scm_call_with_output_string (proc)
     Calls the one-argument procedure PROC with a newly created output
     port.  When the function returns, the string composed of the
     characters written into the port is returned.  PROC should not
     close the port.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-input-string string proc
 -- C Function: scm_call_with_input_string (string, proc)
     Calls the one-argument procedure PROC with a newly created input
     port from which STRING’s contents may be read.  The value yielded
     by the PROC is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-output-to-string thunk
     Calls the zero-argument procedure THUNK with the current output
     port set temporarily to a new string port.  It returns a string
     composed of the characters written to the current output.

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-input-from-string string thunk
     Calls the zero-argument procedure THUNK with the current input port
     set temporarily to a string port opened on the specified STRING.
     The value yielded by THUNK is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-input-string str
 -- C Function: scm_open_input_string (str)
     Take a string and return an input port that delivers characters
     from the string.  The port can be closed by ‘close-input-port’,
     though its storage will be reclaimed by the garbage collector if it
     becomes inaccessible.

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-output-string
 -- C Function: scm_open_output_string ()
     Return an output port that will accumulate characters for retrieval
     by ‘get-output-string’.  The port can be closed by the procedure
     ‘close-output-port’, though its storage will be reclaimed by the
     garbage collector if it becomes inaccessible.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-output-string port
 -- C Function: scm_get_output_string (port)
     Given an output port created by ‘open-output-string’, return a
     string consisting of the characters that have been output to the
     port so far.

     ‘get-output-string’ must be used before closing PORT, once closed
     the string cannot be obtained.

   With string ports, the port-encoding is treated differently than
other types of ports.  When string ports are created, they do not
inherit a character encoding from the current locale.  They are given a
default locale that allows them to handle all valid string characters.
Typically one should not modify a string port’s character encoding away
from its default.  *Note* Encoding::.


File: guile.info,  Node: Custom Ports,  Next: Soft Ports,  Prev: String Ports,  Up: Port Types

### 6.12.10.4 Custom Ports
......................

Custom ports allow the user to provide input and handle output via
user-supplied procedures.  Guile currently only provides custom binary
ports, not textual ports; for custom textual ports, *Note* Soft Ports::.
We should add the R6RS custom textual port interfaces though.
Contributions are appreciated.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-custom-binary-input-port id read!
          get-position set-position! close
     Return a new custom binary input port(1) named ID (a string) whose
     input is drained by invoking READ! and passing it a bytevector, an
     index where bytes should be written, and the number of bytes to
     read.  The ‘read!’ procedure must return an integer indicating the
     number of bytes read, or ‘0’ to indicate the end-of-file.

     Optionally, if GET-POSITION is not ‘#f’, it must be a thunk that
     will be called when ‘port-position’ is invoked on the custom binary
     port and should return an integer indicating the position within
     the underlying data stream; if GET-POSITION was not supplied, the
     returned port does not support ‘port-position’.

     Likewise, if SET-POSITION! is not ‘#f’, it should be a one-argument
     procedure.  When ‘set-port-position!’ is invoked on the custom
     binary input port, SET-POSITION! is passed an integer indicating
     the position of the next byte is to read.

     Finally, if CLOSE is not ‘#f’, it must be a thunk.  It is invoked
     when the custom binary input port is closed.

     The returned port is fully buffered by default, but its buffering
     mode can be changed using ‘setvbuf’ (*note* Buffering::).

     Using a custom binary input port, the ‘open-bytevector-input-port’
     procedure (*note* Bytevector Ports::) could be implemented as
     follows:

          (define (open-bytevector-input-port source)
            (define position 0)
            (define length (bytevector-length source))

            (define (read! bv start count)
              (let ((count (min count (- length position))))
                (bytevector-copy! source position
                                  bv start count)
                (set! position (+ position count))
                count))

            (define (get-position) position)

            (define (set-position! new-position)
              (set! position new-position))

            (make-custom-binary-input-port "the port" read!
                                            get-position set-position!
                                            #f))

          (read (open-bytevector-input-port (string->utf8 "hello")))
          ⇒ hello

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-custom-binary-output-port id write!
          get-position set-position! close
     Return a new custom binary output port named ID (a string) whose
     output is sunk by invoking WRITE! and passing it a bytevector, an
     index where bytes should be read from this bytevector, and the
     number of bytes to be “written”.  The ‘write!’ procedure must
     return an integer indicating the number of bytes actually written;
     when it is passed ‘0’ as the number of bytes to write, it should
     behave as though an end-of-file was sent to the byte sink.

     The other arguments are as for ‘make-custom-binary-input-port’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-custom-binary-input/output-port id read!
          write! get-position set-position! close
     Return a new custom binary input/output port named ID (a string).
     The various arguments are the same as for The other arguments are
     as for ‘make-custom-binary-input-port’ and
     ‘make-custom-binary-output-port’.  If buffering is enabled on the
     port, as is the case by default, input will be buffered in both
     directions; *Note* Buffering::.  If the SET-POSITION! function is
     provided and not ‘#f’, then the port will also be marked as
     random-access, causing the buffer to be flushed between reads and
     writes.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is similar in spirit to Guile’s “soft ports” (*note* Soft
Ports::).

### 6.12.10.5 Soft Ports
....................

A “soft port” is a port based on a vector of procedures capable of
accepting or delivering characters.  It allows emulation of I/O ports.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-soft-port pv modes
     Return a port capable of receiving or delivering characters as
     specified by the MODES string (*note* open-file: File Ports.).  PV
     must be a vector of length 5 or 6.  Its components are as follows:

       0. procedure accepting one character for output
       1. procedure accepting a string for output
       2. thunk for flushing output
       3. thunk for getting one character
       4. thunk for closing port (not by garbage collection)
       5. (if present and not ‘#f’) thunk for computing the number of
          characters that can be read from the port without blocking.

     For an output-only port only elements 0, 1, 2, and 4 need be
     procedures.  For an input-only port only elements 3 and 4 need be
     procedures.  Thunks 2 and 4 can instead be ‘#f’ if there is no
     useful operation for them to perform.

     If thunk 3 returns ‘#f’ or an ‘eof-object’ (*note* eof-object?:
     (r5rs)Input.) it indicates that the port has reached end-of-file.
     For example:

          (define stdout (current-output-port))
          (define p (make-soft-port
                     (vector
                      (lambda (c) (write c stdout))
                      (lambda (s) (display s stdout))
                      (lambda () (display "." stdout))
                      (lambda () (char-upcase (read-char)))
                      (lambda () (display "@" stdout)))
                     "rw"))

          (write p p) ⇒ #<input-output: soft 8081e20>

### 6.12.10.6 Void Ports
....................

This kind of port causes any data to be discarded when written to, and
always returns the end-of-file object when read from.

 -- Scheme Procedure: %make-void-port mode
 -- C Function: scm_sys_make_void_port (mode)
     Create and return a new void port.  A void port acts like
     ‘/dev/null’.  The MODE argument specifies the input/output modes
     for this port: see the documentation for ‘open-file’ in *note* File
     Ports::.


File: guile.info,  Node: Venerable Port Interfaces,  Next: Using Ports from C,  Prev: Port Types,  Up: Input and Output

6.12.11 Venerable Port Interfaces
---------------------------------

Over the 25 years or so that Guile has been around, its port system has
evolved, adding many useful features.  At the same time there have been
four major Scheme standards released in those 25 years, which also
evolve the common Scheme understanding of what a port interface should
be.  Alas, it would be too much to ask for all of these evolutionary
branches to be consistent.  Some of Guile’s original interfaces don’t
mesh with the later Scheme standards, and yet Guile can’t just drop old
interfaces.  Sadly as well, the R6RS and R7RS standards both part from a
base of R5RS, but end up in different and somewhat incompatible designs.

   Guile’s approach is to pick a set of port primitives that make sense
together.  We document that set of primitives, design our internal
interfaces around them, and recommend them to users.  As the R6RS I/O
system is the most capable standard that Scheme has yet produced in this
domain, we mostly recommend that; ‘(ice-9 binary-ports)’ and ‘(ice-9
textual-ports)’ are wholly modelled on ‘(rnrs io ports)’.  Guile does
not wholly copy R6RS, however; *Note* R6RS Incompatibilities::.

   At the same time, we have many venerable port interfaces, lore handed
down to us from our hacker ancestors.  Most of these interfaces even
predate the expectation that Scheme should have modules, so they are
present in the default environment.  In Guile we support them as well
and we have no plans to remove them, but again we don’t recommend them
for new users.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-ready? [port]
     Return ‘#t’ if a character is ready on input PORT and return ‘#f’
     otherwise.  If ‘char-ready?’ returns ‘#t’ then the next ‘read-char’
     operation on PORT is guaranteed not to hang.  If PORT is a file
     port at end of file then ‘char-ready?’ returns ‘#t’.

     ‘char-ready?’ exists to make it possible for a program to accept
     characters from interactive ports without getting stuck waiting for
     input.  Any input editors associated with such ports must make sure
     that characters whose existence has been asserted by ‘char-ready?’
     cannot be rubbed out.  If ‘char-ready?’ were to return ‘#f’ at end
     of file, a port at end of file would be indistinguishable from an
     interactive port that has no ready characters.

     Note that ‘char-ready?’ only works reliably for terminals and
     sockets with one-byte encodings.  Under the hood it will return
     ‘#t’ if the port has any input buffered, or if the file descriptor
     that backs the port polls as readable, indicating that Guile can
     fetch more bytes from the kernel.  However being able to fetch one
     byte doesn’t mean that a full character is available; *Note*
     Encoding::.  Also, on many systems it’s possible for a file
     descriptor to poll as readable, but then block when it comes time
     to read bytes.  Note also that on Linux kernels, all file ports
     backed by files always poll as readable.  For non-file ports, this
     procedure always returns ‘#t’, except for soft ports, which have a
     ‘char-ready?’ handler.  *Note* Soft Ports::.

     In short, this is a legacy procedure whose semantics are hard to
     provide.  However it is a useful check to see if any input is
     buffered.  *Note* Non-Blocking I/O::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-char [port]
     The same as ‘get-char’, except that PORT defaults to the current
     input port.  *Note* Textual I/O::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: peek-char [port]
     The same as ‘lookahead-char’, except that PORT defaults to the
     current input port.  *Note* Textual I/O::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: unread-char cobj [port]
     The same as ‘unget-char’, except that PORT defaults to the current
     input port, and the arguments are swapped.  *Note* Textual I/O::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: unread-string str port
 -- C Function: scm_unread_string (str, port)
     The same as ‘unget-string’, except that PORT defaults to the
     current input port, and the arguments are swapped.  *Note* Textual
     I/O::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: newline [port]
     Send a newline to PORT.  If PORT is omitted, send to the current
     output port.  Equivalent to ‘(put-char port #\newline)’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-char chr [port]
     The same as ‘put-char’, except that PORT defaults to the current
     input port, and the arguments are swapped.  *Note* Textual I/O::.

6.12.12 Using Ports from C
--------------------------

Guile’s C interfaces provides some niceties for sending and receiving
bytes and characters in a way that works better with C.

 -- C Function: size_t scm_c_read (SCM port, void *buffer, size_t size)
     Read up to SIZE bytes from PORT and store them in BUFFER.  The
     return value is the number of bytes actually read, which can be
     less than SIZE if end-of-file has been reached.

     Note that as this is a binary input procedure, this function does
     not update ‘port-line’ and ‘port-column’ (*note* Textual I/O::).

 -- C Function: void scm_c_write (SCM port, const void *buffer, size_t
          size)
     Write SIZE bytes at BUFFER to PORT.

     Note that as this is a binary output procedure, this function does
     not update ‘port-line’ and ‘port-column’ (*note* Textual I/O::).

 -- C Function: size_t scm_c_read_bytes (SCM port, SCM bv, size_t start,
          size_t count)
 -- C Function: void scm_c_write_bytes (SCM port, SCM bv, size_t start,
          size_t count)
     Like ‘scm_c_read’ and ‘scm_c_write’, but reading into or writing
     from the bytevector BV.  COUNT indicates the byte index at which to
     start in the bytevector, and the read or write will continue for
     COUNT bytes.

 -- C Function: void scm_unget_bytes (const unsigned char *buf, size_t
          len, SCM port)
 -- C Function: void scm_unget_byte (int c, SCM port)
 -- C Function: void scm_ungetc (scm_t_wchar c, SCM port)
     Like ‘unget-bytevector’, ‘unget-byte’, and ‘unget-char’,
     respectively.  *Note* Textual I/O::.

     buffer is a string in the latin-1 encoding.  In the second, the
     ‘scm_t_uint32*’ buffer is a string in the UTF-32 encoding.  These
     routines will update the port’s line and column.

6.12.13 Implementing New Port Types in C
----------------------------------------

This section describes how to implement a new port type in C. Although
ports support many operations, as a data structure they present an
opaque interface to the user.  To the port implementor, you have two
pieces of information to work with: the port type, and the port’s
“stream”.  The port type is an opaque pointer allocated when defining
your port type.  It is your key into the port API, and it helps you
identify which ports are actually yours.  The “stream” is a pointer you
control, and which you set when you create a port.  Get a stream from a
port using the ‘SCM_STREAM’ macro.  Note that your port methods are only
ever called with ports of your type.

   A port type is created by calling ‘scm_make_port_type’.  Once you
have your port type, you can create ports with ‘scm_c_make_port’, or
‘scm_c_make_port_with_encoding’.

 -- Function: scm_t_port_type* scm_make_port_type (char *name, size_t
          (*read) (SCM port, SCM dst, size_t start, size_t count),
          size_t (*write) (SCM port, SCM src, size_t start, size_t
          count))
     Define a new port type.  The NAME, READ and WRITE parameters are
     initial values for those port type fields, as described below.  The
     other fields are initialized with default values and can be changed
     later.

 -- Function: SCM scm_c_make_port_with_encoding (scm_t_port_type *type,
          unsigned long mode_bits, SCM encoding, SCM
          conversion_strategy, scm_t_bits stream)
 -- Function: SCM scm_c_make_port (scm_t_port_type *type, unsigned long
          mode_bits, scm_t_bits stream)
     Make a port with the given TYPE.  The STREAM indicates the private
     data associated with the port, which your port implementation may
     later retrieve with ‘SCM_STREAM’.  The mode bits should include one
     or more of the flags ‘SCM_RDNG’ or ‘SCM_WRTNG’, indicating that the
     port is an input and/or an output port, respectively.  The mode
     bits may also include ‘SCM_BUF0’ or ‘SCM_BUFLINE’, indicating that
     the port should be unbuffered or line-buffered, respectively.  The
     default is that the port will be block-buffered.  *Note*
     Buffering::.

     As you would imagine, ENCODING and CONVERSION_STRATEGY specify the
     port’s initial textual encoding and conversion strategy.  Both are
     symbols.  ‘scm_c_make_port’ is the same as
     ‘scm_c_make_port_with_encoding’, except it uses the default port
     encoding and conversion strategy.

   The port type has a number of associate procedures and properties
which collectively implement the port’s behavior.  Creating a new port
type mostly involves writing these procedures.

‘name’
     A pointer to a NUL terminated string: the name of the port type.
     This property is initialized via the first argument to
     ‘scm_make_port_type’.

‘read’
     A port’s ‘read’ implementation fills read buffers.  It should copy
     bytes to the supplied bytevector ‘dst’, starting at offset ‘start’
     and continuing for ‘count’ bytes, returning the number of bytes
     read.

‘write’
     A port’s ‘write’ implementation flushes write buffers to the
     mutable store.  It should write out bytes from the supplied
     bytevector ‘src’, starting at offset ‘start’ and continuing for
     ‘count’ bytes, and return the number of bytes that were written.

‘read_wait_fd’
‘write_wait_fd’
     If a port’s ‘read’ or ‘write’ function returns ‘(size_t) -1’, that
     indicates that reading or writing would block.  In that case to
     preserve the illusion of a blocking read or write operation,
     Guile’s C port run-time will ‘poll’ on the file descriptor returned
     by either the port’s ‘read_wait_fd’ or ‘write_wait_fd’ function.
     Set using

      -- Function: void scm_set_port_read_wait_fd (scm_t_port_type
               *type, int (*wait_fd) (SCM port))
      -- Function: void scm_set_port_write_wait_fd (scm_t_port_type
               *type, int (*wait_fd) (SCM port))

     Only a port type which implements the ‘read_wait_fd’ or
     ‘write_wait_fd’ port methods can usefully return ‘(size_t) -1’ from
     a read or write function.  *Note* Non-Blocking I/O::, for more on
     non-blocking I/O in Guile.

‘print’
     Called when ‘write’ is called on the port, to print a port
     description.  For example, for a file port it may produce something
     like: ‘#<input: /etc/passwd 3>’.  Set using

      -- Function: void scm_set_port_print (scm_t_port_type *type, int
               (*print) (SCM port, SCM dest_port, scm_print_state
               *pstate))
          The first argument PORT is the port being printed, the second
          argument DEST_PORT is where its description should go.

‘close’
     Called when the port is closed.  It should free any resources used
     by the port.  Set using

      -- Function: void scm_set_port_close (scm_t_port_type *type, void
               (*close) (SCM port))

     By default, ports that are garbage collected just go away without
     closing.  If your port type needs to release some external resource
     like a file descriptor, or needs to make sure that its internal
     buffers are flushed even if the port is collected while it was
     open, then mark the port type as needing a close on GC.

      -- Function: void scm_set_port_needs_close_on_gc (scm_t_port_type
               *type, int needs_close_p)

‘seek’
     Set the current position of the port.  Guile will flush read and/or
     write buffers before seeking, as appropriate.

      -- Function: void scm_set_port_seek (scm_t_port_type *type,
               scm_t_off (*seek) (SCM port, scm_t_off offset, int
               whence))

‘truncate’
     Truncate the port data to be specified length.  Guile will flush
     buffers before hand, as appropriate.  Set using

      -- Function: void scm_set_port_truncate (scm_t_port_type *type,
               void (*truncate) (SCM port, scm_t_off length))

‘random_access_p’
     Determine whether this port is a random-access port.

     Seeking on a random-access port with buffered input, or switching
     to writing after reading, will cause the buffered input to be
     discarded and Guile will seek the port back the buffered number of
     bytes.  Likewise seeking on a random-access port with buffered
     output, or switching to reading after writing, will flush pending
     bytes with a call to the ‘write’ procedure.  *Note* Buffering::.

     Indicate to Guile that your port needs this behavior by returning a
     nonzero value from your ‘random_access_p’ function.  The default
     implementation of this function returns nonzero if the port type
     supplies a seek implementation.

      -- Function: void scm_set_port_random_access_p (scm_t_port_type
               *type, int (*random_access_p) (SCM port));

‘get_natural_buffer_sizes’
     Guile will internally attach buffers to ports.  An input port
     always has a read buffer and an output port always has a write
     buffer.  *Note* Buffering::.  A port buffer consists of a
     bytevector, along with some cursors into that bytevector denoting
     where to get and put data.

     Port implementations generally don’t have to be concerned with
     buffering: a port type’s ‘read’ or ‘write’ function will receive
     the buffer’s bytevector as an argument, along with an offset and a
     length into that bytevector, and should then either fill or empty
     that bytevector.  However in some cases, port implementations may
     be able to provide an appropriate default buffer size to Guile.

      -- Function: void scm_set_port_get_natural_buffer_sizes
               (scm_t_port_type *type, void (*get_natural_buffer_sizes)
               (SCM, size_t *read_buf_size, size_t *write_buf_size))
          Fill in READ_BUF_SIZE and WRITE_BUF_SIZE with an appropriate
          buffer size for this port, if one is known.

     File ports implement a ‘get_natural_buffer_sizes’ to let the
     operating system inform Guile about the appropriate buffer sizes
     for the particular file opened by the port.

   Note that calls to all of these methods can proceed in parallel and
concurrently and from any thread up until the point that the port is
closed.  The call to ‘close’ will happen when no other method is
running, and no method will be called after the ‘close’ method is
called.  If your port implementation needs mutual exclusion to prevent
concurrency, it is responsible for locking appropriately.

6.12.14 Non-Blocking I/O
------------------------

Most ports in Guile are “blocking”: when you try to read a character
from a port, Guile will block on the read until a character is ready, or
end-of-stream is detected.  Likewise whenever Guile goes to write
(possibly buffered) data to an output port, Guile will block until all
the data is written.

   Interacting with ports in blocking mode is very convenient: you can
write straightforward, sequential algorithms whose code flow reflects
the flow of data.  However, blocking I/O has two main limitations.

   The first is that it’s easy to get into a situation where code is
waiting on data.  Time spent waiting on data when code could be doing
something else is wasteful and prevents your program from reaching its
peak throughput.  If you implement a web server that sequentially
handles requests from clients, it’s very easy for the server to end up
waiting on a client to finish its HTTP request, or waiting on it to
consume the response.  The end result is that you are able to serve
fewer requests per second than you’d like to serve.

   The second limitation is related: a blocking parser over
user-controlled input is a denial-of-service vulnerability.  Indeed the
so-called “slow loris” attack of the early 2010s was just that: an
attack on common web servers that drip-fed HTTP requests, one character
at a time.  All it took was a handful of slow loris connections to
occupy an entire web server.

   In Guile we would like to preserve the ability to write
straightforward blocking networking processes of all kinds, but under
the hood to allow those processes to suspend their requests if they
would block.

   To do this, the first piece is to allow Guile ports to declare
themselves as being nonblocking.  This is currently supported only for
file ports, which also includes sockets, terminals, or any other port
that is backed by a file descriptor.  To do that, we use an arcane UNIX
incantation:

     (let ((flags (fcntl socket F_GETFL)))
       (fcntl socket F_SETFL (logior O_NONBLOCK flags)))

   Now the file descriptor is open in non-blocking mode.  If Guile tries
to read or write from this file and the read or write returns a result
indicating that more data can only be had by doing a blocking read or
write, Guile will block by polling on the socket’s ‘read-wait-fd’ or
‘write-wait-fd’, to preserve the illusion of a blocking read or write.
*Note* I/O Extensions:: for more on those internal interfaces.

   So far we have just reproduced the status quo: the file descriptor is
non-blocking, but the operations on the port do block.  To go farther,
it would be nice if we could suspend the “thread” using delimited
continuations, and only resume the thread once the file descriptor is
readable or writable.  (*Note* Prompts::).

   But here we run into a difficulty.  The ports code is implemented in
C, which means that although we can suspend the computation to some
outer prompt, we can’t resume it because Guile can’t resume delimited
continuations that capture the C stack.

   To overcome this difficulty we have created a compatible but entirely
parallel implementation of port operations.  To use this implementation,
do the following:

     (use-modules (ice-9 suspendable-ports))
     (install-suspendable-ports!)

   This will replace the core I/O primitives like ‘get-char’ and
‘put-bytevector’ with new versions that are exactly the same as the ones
in the standard library, but with two differences.  One is that when a
read or a write would block, the suspendable port operations call out
the value of the ‘current-read-waiter’ or ‘current-write-waiter’
parameter, as appropriate.  *Note* Parameters::.  The default read and
write waiters do the same thing that the C read and write waiters do,
which is to poll.  User code can parameterize the waiters, though,
enabling the computation to suspend and allow the program to process
other I/O operations.  Because the new suspendable ports implementation
is written in Scheme, that suspended computation can resume again later
when it is able to make progress.  Success!

   The other main difference is that because the new ports
implementation is written in Scheme, it is slower than C, currently by a
factor of 3 or 4, though it depends on many factors.  For this reason we
have to keep the C implementations as the default ones.  One day when
Guile’s compiler is better, we can close this gap and have only one port
operation implementation again.

   Note that Guile does not currently include an implementation of the
facility to suspend the current thread and schedule other threads in the
meantime.  Before adding such a thing, we want to make sure that we’re
providing the right primitives that can be used to build schedulers and
other user-space concurrency patterns, and that the patterns that we
settle on are the right patterns.  In the meantime, have a look at 8sync
(<https://gnu.org/software/8sync>) for a prototype of an asynchronous
I/O and concurrency facility.

 -- Scheme Procedure: install-suspendable-ports!
     Replace the core ports implementation with suspendable ports, as
     described above.  This will mutate the values of the bindings like
     ‘get-char’, ‘put-u8’, and so on in place.

 -- Scheme Procedure: uninstall-suspendable-ports!
     Restore the original core ports implementation, un-doing the effect
     of ‘install-suspendable-ports!’.

 -- Scheme Parameter: current-read-waiter
 -- Scheme Parameter: current-write-waiter
     Parameters whose values are procedures of one argument, called when
     a suspendable port operation would block on a port while reading or
     writing, respectively.  The default values of these parameters do a
     blocking ‘poll’ on the port’s file descriptor.  The procedures are
     passed the port in question as their one argument.


File: guile.info,  Node: BOM Handling,  Prev: Non-Blocking I/O,  Up: Input and Output

6.12.15 Handling of Unicode Byte Order Marks
--------------------------------------------

This section documents the finer points of Guile’s handling of Unicode
byte order marks (BOMs).  A byte order mark (U+FEFF) is typically found
at the start of a UTF-16 or UTF-32 stream, to allow readers to reliably
determine the byte order.  Occasionally, a BOM is found at the start of
a UTF-8 stream, but this is much less common and not generally
recommended.

   Guile attempts to handle BOMs automatically, and in accordance with
the recommendations of the Unicode Standard, when the port encoding is
set to ‘UTF-8’, ‘UTF-16’, or ‘UTF-32’.  In brief, Guile automatically
writes a BOM at the start of a UTF-16 or UTF-32 stream, and
automatically consumes one from the start of a UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32
stream.

   As specified in the Unicode Standard, a BOM is only handled specially
at the start of a stream, and only if the port encoding is set to
‘UTF-8’, ‘UTF-16’ or ‘UTF-32’.  If the port encoding is set to
‘UTF-16BE’, ‘UTF-16LE’, ‘UTF-32BE’, or ‘UTF-32LE’, then BOMs are _not_
handled specially, and none of the special handling described in this
section applies.

   • To ensure that Guile will properly detect the byte order of a
     UTF-16 or UTF-32 stream, you must perform a textual read before any
     writes, seeks, or binary I/O. Guile will not attempt to read a BOM
     unless a read is explicitly requested at the start of the stream.

   • If a textual write is performed before the first read, then an
     arbitrary byte order will be chosen.  Currently, big endian is the
     default on all platforms, but that may change in the future.  If
     you wish to explicitly control the byte order of an output stream,
     set the port encoding to ‘UTF-16BE’, ‘UTF-16LE’, ‘UTF-32BE’, or
     ‘UTF-32LE’, and explicitly write a BOM (‘#\xFEFF’) if desired.

   • If ‘set-port-encoding!’ is called in the middle of a stream, Guile
     treats this as a new logical “start of stream” for purposes of BOM
     handling, and will forget about any BOMs that had previously been
     seen.  Therefore, it may choose a different byte order than had
     been used previously.  This is intended to support multiple logical
     text streams embedded within a larger binary stream.

   • Binary I/O operations are not guaranteed to update Guile’s notion
     of whether the port is at the “start of the stream”, nor are they
     guaranteed to produce or consume BOMs.

   • For ports that support seeking (e.g.  normal files), the input and
     output streams are considered linked: if the user reads first, then
     a BOM will be consumed (if appropriate), but later writes will
     _not_ produce a BOM. Similarly, if the user writes first, then
     later reads will _not_ consume a BOM.

   • For ports that are not random access (e.g.  pipes, sockets, and
     terminals), the input and output streams are considered
     _independent_ for purposes of BOM handling: the first read will
     consume a BOM (if appropriate), and the first write will _also_
     produce a BOM (if appropriate).  However, the input and output
     streams will always use the same byte order.

   • Seeks to the beginning of a file will set the “start of stream”
     flags.  Therefore, a subsequent textual read or write will consume
     or produce a BOM. However, unlike ‘set-port-encoding!’, if a byte
     order had already been chosen for the port, it will remain in
     effect after a seek, and cannot be changed by the presence of a
     BOM. Seeks anywhere other than the beginning of a file clear the
     “start of stream” flags.

6.13 Regular Expressions
========================

A “regular expression” (or “regexp”) is a pattern that describes a whole
class of strings.  A full description of regular expressions and their
syntax is beyond the scope of this manual.

   If your system does not include a POSIX regular expression library,
and you have not linked Guile with a third-party regexp library such as
Rx, these functions will not be available.  You can tell whether your
Guile installation includes regular expression support by checking
whether ‘(provided? 'regex)’ returns true.

   The following regexp and string matching features are provided by the
‘(ice-9 regex)’ module.  Before using the described functions, you
should load this module by executing ‘(use-modules (ice-9 regex))’.

* Menu:

* Regexp Functions::            Functions that create and match regexps.
* Match Structures::            Finding what was matched by a regexp.
* Backslash Escapes::           Removing the special meaning of regexp
                                meta-characters.


File: guile.info,  Node: Regexp Functions,  Next: Match Structures,  Up: Regular Expressions

6.13.1 Regexp Functions
-----------------------

By default, Guile supports POSIX extended regular expressions.  That
means that the characters ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘+’ and ‘?’ are special, and must be
escaped if you wish to match the literal characters and there is no
support for “non-greedy” variants of ‘*’, ‘+’ or ‘?’.

   This regular expression interface was modeled after that implemented
by SCSH, the Scheme Shell.  It is intended to be upwardly compatible
with SCSH regular expressions.

   Zero bytes (‘#\nul’) cannot be used in regex patterns or input
strings, since the underlying C functions treat that as the end of
string.  If there’s a zero byte an error is thrown.

   Internally, patterns and input strings are converted to the current
locale’s encoding, and then passed to the C library’s regular expression
routines (*note* (libc)Regular Expressions::).  The returned match
structures always point to characters in the strings, not to individual
bytes, even in the case of multi-byte encodings.  This ensures that the
match structures are correct when performing matching with characters
that have a multi-byte representation in the locale encoding.  Note,
however, that using characters which cannot be represented in the locale
encoding can lead to surprising results.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-match pattern str [start]
     Compile the string PATTERN into a regular expression and compare it
     with STR.  The optional numeric argument START specifies the
     position of STR at which to begin matching.

     ‘string-match’ returns a “match structure” which describes what, if
     anything, was matched by the regular expression.  *Note* Match
     Structures::.  If STR does not match PATTERN at all, ‘string-match’
     returns ‘#f’.

   Two examples of a match follow.  In the first example, the pattern
matches the four digits in the match string.  In the second, the pattern
matches nothing.

     (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002")
     ⇒ #("blah2002" (4 . 8))

     (string-match "[A-Za-z]" "123456")
     ⇒ #f

   Each time ‘string-match’ is called, it must compile its PATTERN
argument into a regular expression structure.  This operation is
expensive, which makes ‘string-match’ inefficient if the same regular
expression is used several times (for example, in a loop).  For better
performance, you can compile a regular expression in advance and then
match strings against the compiled regexp.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-regexp pat flag...
 -- C Function: scm_make_regexp (pat, flaglst)
     Compile the regular expression described by PAT, and return the
     compiled regexp structure.  If PAT does not describe a legal
     regular expression, ‘make-regexp’ throws a
     ‘regular-expression-syntax’ error.

     The FLAG arguments change the behavior of the compiled regular
     expression.  The following values may be supplied:

      -- Variable: regexp/icase
          Consider uppercase and lowercase letters to be the same when
          matching.

      -- Variable: regexp/newline
          If a newline appears in the target string, then permit the ‘^’
          and ‘$’ operators to match immediately after or immediately
          before the newline, respectively.  Also, the ‘.’ and ‘[^...]’
          operators will never match a newline character.  The intent of
          this flag is to treat the target string as a buffer containing
          many lines of text, and the regular expression as a pattern
          that may match a single one of those lines.

      -- Variable: regexp/basic
          Compile a basic (“obsolete”) regexp instead of the extended
          (“modern”) regexps that are the default.  Basic regexps do not
          consider ‘|’, ‘+’ or ‘?’ to be special characters, and require
          the ‘{...}’ and ‘(...)’ metacharacters to be backslash-escaped
          (*note* Backslash Escapes::).  There are several other
          differences between basic and extended regular expressions,
          but these are the most significant.

      -- Variable: regexp/extended
          Compile an extended regular expression rather than a basic
          regexp.  This is the default behavior; this flag will not
          usually be needed.  If a call to ‘make-regexp’ includes both
          ‘regexp/basic’ and ‘regexp/extended’ flags, the one which
          comes last will override the earlier one.

 -- Scheme Procedure: regexp-exec rx str [start [flags]]
 -- C Function: scm_regexp_exec (rx, str, start, flags)
     Match the compiled regular expression RX against ‘str’.  If the
     optional integer START argument is provided, begin matching from
     that position in the string.  Return a match structure describing
     the results of the match, or ‘#f’ if no match could be found.

     The FLAGS argument changes the matching behavior.  The following
     flag values may be supplied, use ‘logior’ (*note* Bitwise
     Operations::) to combine them,

      -- Variable: regexp/notbol
          Consider that the START offset into STR is not the beginning
          of a line and should not match operator ‘^’.

          If RX was created with the ‘regexp/newline’ option above, ‘^’
          will still match after a newline in STR.

      -- Variable: regexp/noteol
          Consider that the end of STR is not the end of a line and
          should not match operator ‘$’.

          If RX was created with the ‘regexp/newline’ option above, ‘$’
          will still match before a newline in STR.

     ;; Regexp to match uppercase letters
     (define r (make-regexp "[A-Z]*"))

     ;; Regexp to match letters, ignoring case
     (define ri (make-regexp "[A-Z]*" regexp/icase))

     ;; Search for bob using regexp r
     (match:substring (regexp-exec r "bob"))
     ⇒ ""                  ; no match

     ;; Search for bob using regexp ri
     (match:substring (regexp-exec ri "Bob"))
     ⇒ "Bob"               ; matched case insensitive

 -- Scheme Procedure: regexp? obj
 -- C Function: scm_regexp_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a compiled regular expression, or ‘#f’
     otherwise.


 -- Scheme Procedure: list-matches regexp str [flags]
     Return a list of match structures which are the non-overlapping
     matches of REGEXP in STR.  REGEXP can be either a pattern string or
     a compiled regexp.  The FLAGS argument is as per ‘regexp-exec’
     above.

          (map match:substring (list-matches "[a-z]+" "abc 42 def 78"))
          ⇒ ("abc" "def")

 -- Scheme Procedure: fold-matches regexp str init proc [flags]
     Apply PROC to the non-overlapping matches of REGEXP in STR, to
     build a result.  REGEXP can be either a pattern string or a
     compiled regexp.  The FLAGS argument is as per ‘regexp-exec’ above.

     PROC is called as ‘(PROC match prev)’ where MATCH is a match
     structure and PREV is the previous return from PROC.  For the first
     call PREV is the given INIT parameter.  ‘fold-matches’ returns the
     final value from PROC.

     For example to count matches,

          (fold-matches "[a-z][0-9]" "abc x1 def y2" 0
                        (lambda (match count)
                          (1+ count)))
          ⇒ 2


   Regular expressions are commonly used to find patterns in one string
and replace them with the contents of another string.  The following
functions are convenient ways to do this.

 -- Scheme Procedure: regexp-substitute port match item ...
     Write to PORT selected parts of the match structure MATCH.  Or if
     PORT is ‘#f’ then form a string from those parts and return that.

     Each ITEM specifies a part to be written, and may be one of the
     following,

        • A string.  String arguments are written out verbatim.

        • An integer.  The submatch with that number is written
          (‘match:substring’).  Zero is the entire match.

        • The symbol ‘pre’.  The portion of the matched string preceding
          the regexp match is written (‘match:prefix’).

        • The symbol ‘post’.  The portion of the matched string
          following the regexp match is written (‘match:suffix’).

     For example, changing a match and retaining the text before and
     after,

          (regexp-substitute #f (string-match "[0-9]+" "number 25 is good")
                             'pre "37" 'post)
          ⇒ "number 37 is good"

     Or matching a YYYYMMDD format date such as ‘20020828’ and
     re-ordering and hyphenating the fields.

          (define date-regex
             "([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])([0-9][0-9])([0-9][0-9])")
          (define s "Date 20020429 12am.")
          (regexp-substitute #f (string-match date-regex s)
                             'pre 2 "-" 3 "-" 1 'post " (" 0 ")")
          ⇒ "Date 04-29-2002 12am. (20020429)"

 -- Scheme Procedure: regexp-substitute/global port regexp target
          item...
     Write to PORT selected parts of matches of REGEXP in TARGET.  If
     PORT is ‘#f’ then form a string from those parts and return that.
     REGEXP can be a string or a compiled regex.

     This is similar to ‘regexp-substitute’, but allows global
     substitutions on TARGET.  Each ITEM behaves as per
     ‘regexp-substitute’, with the following differences,

        • A function.  Called as ‘(ITEM match)’ with the match structure
          for the REGEXP match, it should return a string to be written
          to PORT.

        • The symbol ‘post’.  This doesn’t output anything, but instead
          causes ‘regexp-substitute/global’ to recurse on the unmatched
          portion of TARGET.

          This _must_ be supplied to perform a global search and replace
          on TARGET; without it ‘regexp-substitute/global’ returns after
          a single match and output.

     For example, to collapse runs of tabs and spaces to a single hyphen
     each,

          (regexp-substitute/global #f "[ \t]+"  "this   is   the text"
                                    'pre "-" 'post)
          ⇒ "this-is-the-text"

     Or using a function to reverse the letters in each word,

          (regexp-substitute/global #f "[a-z]+"  "to do and not-do"
            'pre (lambda (m) (string-reverse (match:substring m))) 'post)
          ⇒ "ot od dna ton-od"

     Without the ‘post’ symbol, just one regexp match is made.  For
     example the following is the date example from ‘regexp-substitute’
     above, without the need for the separate ‘string-match’ call.

          (define date-regex
             "([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])([0-9][0-9])([0-9][0-9])")
          (define s "Date 20020429 12am.")
          (regexp-substitute/global #f date-regex s
                                    'pre 2 "-" 3 "-" 1 'post " (" 0 ")")

          ⇒ "Date 04-29-2002 12am. (20020429)"

6.13.2 Match Structures
-----------------------

A “match structure” is the object returned by ‘string-match’ and
‘regexp-exec’.  It describes which portion of a string, if any, matched
the given regular expression.  Match structures include: a reference to
the string that was checked for matches; the starting and ending
positions of the regexp match; and, if the regexp included any
parenthesized subexpressions, the starting and ending positions of each
submatch.

   In each of the regexp match functions described below, the ‘match’
argument must be a match structure returned by a previous call to
‘string-match’ or ‘regexp-exec’.  Most of these functions return some
information about the original target string that was matched against a
regular expression; we will call that string TARGET for easy reference.

 -- Scheme Procedure: regexp-match? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a match structure returned by a previous call
     to ‘regexp-exec’, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: match:substring match [n]
     Return the portion of TARGET matched by subexpression number N.
     Submatch 0 (the default) represents the entire regexp match.  If
     the regular expression as a whole matched, but the subexpression
     number N did not match, return ‘#f’.

     (define s (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002foo"))
     (match:substring s)
     ⇒ "2002"

     ;; match starting at offset 6 in the string
     (match:substring
       (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah987654" 6))
     ⇒ "7654"

 -- Scheme Procedure: match:start match [n]
     Return the starting position of submatch number N.

   In the following example, the result is 4, since the match starts at
character index 4:

     (define s (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002foo"))
     (match:start s)
     ⇒ 4

 -- Scheme Procedure: match:end match [n]
     Return the ending position of submatch number N.

   In the following example, the result is 8, since the match runs
between characters 4 and 8 (i.e. the “2002”).

     (define s (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002foo"))
     (match:end s)
     ⇒ 8

 -- Scheme Procedure: match:prefix match
     Return the unmatched portion of TARGET preceding the regexp match.

          (define s (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002foo"))
          (match:prefix s)
          ⇒ "blah"

 -- Scheme Procedure: match:suffix match
     Return the unmatched portion of TARGET following the regexp match.

     (define s (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002foo"))
     (match:suffix s)
     ⇒ "foo"

 -- Scheme Procedure: match:count match
     Return the number of parenthesized subexpressions from MATCH.  Note
     that the entire regular expression match itself counts as a
     subexpression, and failed submatches are included in the count.

 -- Scheme Procedure: match:string match
     Return the original TARGET string.

     (define s (string-match "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" "blah2002foo"))
     (match:string s)
     ⇒ "blah2002foo"


File: guile.info,  Node: Backslash Escapes,  Prev: Match Structures,  Up: Regular Expressions

6.13.3 Backslash Escapes
------------------------

Sometimes you will want a regexp to match characters like ‘*’ or ‘$’
exactly.  For example, to check whether a particular string represents a
menu entry from an Info node, it would be useful to match it against a
regexp like ‘^* [^:]*::’.  However, this won’t work; because the
asterisk is a metacharacter, it won’t match the ‘*’ at the beginning of
the string.  In this case, we want to make the first asterisk un-magic.

   You can do this by preceding the metacharacter with a backslash
character ‘\’.  (This is also called “quoting” the metacharacter, and is
known as a “backslash escape”.)  When Guile sees a backslash in a
regular expression, it considers the following glyph to be an ordinary
character, no matter what special meaning it would ordinarily have.
Therefore, we can make the above example work by changing the regexp to
‘^\* [^:]*::’.  The ‘\*’ sequence tells the regular expression engine to
match only a single asterisk in the target string.

   Since the backslash is itself a metacharacter, you may force a regexp
to match a backslash in the target string by preceding the backslash
with itself.  For example, to find variable references in a TeX program,
you might want to find occurrences of the string ‘\let\’ followed by any
number of alphabetic characters.  The regular expression
‘\\let\\[A-Za-z]*’ would do this: the double backslashes in the regexp
each match a single backslash in the target string.

 -- Scheme Procedure: regexp-quote str
     Quote each special character found in STR with a backslash, and
     return the resulting string.

   *Very important:* Using backslash escapes in Guile source code (as in
Emacs Lisp or C) can be tricky, because the backslash character has
special meaning for the Guile reader.  For example, if Guile encounters
the character sequence ‘\n’ in the middle of a string while processing
Scheme code, it replaces those characters with a newline character.
Similarly, the character sequence ‘\t’ is replaced by a horizontal tab.
Several of these “escape sequences” are processed by the Guile reader
before your code is executed.  Unrecognized escape sequences are
ignored: if the characters ‘\*’ appear in a string, they will be
translated to the single character ‘*’.

   This translation is obviously undesirable for regular expressions,
since we want to be able to include backslashes in a string in order to
escape regexp metacharacters.  Therefore, to make sure that a backslash
is preserved in a string in your Guile program, you must use _two_
consecutive backslashes:

     (define Info-menu-entry-pattern (make-regexp "^\\* [^:]*"))

   The string in this example is preprocessed by the Guile reader before
any code is executed.  The resulting argument to ‘make-regexp’ is the
string ‘^\* [^:]*’, which is what we really want.

   This also means that in order to write a regular expression that
matches a single backslash character, the regular expression string in
the source code must include _four_ backslashes.  Each consecutive pair
of backslashes gets translated by the Guile reader to a single
backslash, and the resulting double-backslash is interpreted by the
regexp engine as matching a single backslash character.  Hence:

     (define tex-variable-pattern (make-regexp "\\\\let\\\\=[A-Za-z]*"))

   The reason for the unwieldiness of this syntax is historical.  Both
regular expression pattern matchers and Unix string processing systems
have traditionally used backslashes with the special meanings described
above.  The POSIX regular expression specification and ANSI C standard
both require these semantics.  Attempting to abandon either convention
would cause other kinds of compatibility problems, possibly more severe
ones.  Therefore, without extending the Scheme reader to support strings
with different quoting conventions (an ungainly and confusing extension
when implemented in other languages), we must adhere to this cumbersome
escape syntax.

6.14 LALR(1) Parsing
====================

The ‘(system base lalr)’ module provides the ‘lalr-scm’ LALR(1) parser
generator by Dominique Boucher (https://github.com/schemeway/lalr-scm/).
‘lalr-scm’ uses the same algorithm as GNU Bison (*note* Introduction to
Bison: (bison)Introduction.).  Parsers are defined using the
‘lalr-parser’ macro.

 -- Scheme Syntax: lalr-parser [OPTIONS] TOKENS RULES...
     Generate an LALR(1) syntax analyzer.  TOKENS is a list of symbols
     representing the terminal symbols of the grammar.  RULES are the
     grammar production rules.

     Each rule has the form ‘(NON-TERMINAL (RHS ...) : ACTION ...)’,
     where NON-TERMINAL is the name of the rule, RHS are the right-hand
     sides, i.e., the production rule, and ACTION is a semantic action
     associated with the rule.

     The generated parser is a two-argument procedure that takes a
     “tokenizer” and a “syntax error procedure”.  The tokenizer should
     be a thunk that returns lexical tokens as produced by
     ‘make-lexical-token’.  The syntax error procedure may be called
     with at least an error message (a string), and optionally the
     lexical token that caused the error.

   Please refer to the ‘lalr-scm’ documentation for details.

6.15 PEG Parsing
================

Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) are a way of specifying formal
languages for text processing.  They can be used either for matching
(like regular expressions) or for building recursive descent parsers
(like lex/yacc).  Guile uses a superset of PEG syntax that allows more
control over what information is preserved during parsing.

   Wikipedia has a clear and concise introduction to PEGs if you want to
familiarize yourself with the syntax:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar>.

   The ‘(ice-9 peg)’ module works by compiling PEGs down to lambda
expressions.  These can either be stored in variables at compile-time by
the define macros (‘define-peg-pattern’ and
‘define-peg-string-patterns’) or calculated explicitly at runtime with
the compile functions (‘compile-peg-pattern’ and ‘peg-string-compile’).

   They can then be used for either parsing (‘match-pattern’) or
searching (‘search-for-pattern’).  For convenience, ‘search-for-pattern’
also takes pattern literals in case you want to inline a simple search
(people often use regular expressions this way).

   The rest of this documentation consists of a syntax reference, an API
reference, and a tutorial.

6.15.1 PEG Syntax Reference
---------------------------

### Normal PEG Syntax:
..................

 -- PEG Pattern: sequence a b
     Parses A.  If this succeeds, continues to parse B from the end of
     the text parsed as A.  Succeeds if both A and B succeed.

     ‘"a b"’

     ‘(and a b)’

 -- PEG Pattern: ordered choice a b
     Parses A.  If this fails, backtracks and parses B.  Succeeds if
     either A or B succeeds.

     ‘"a/b"’

     ‘(or a b)’

 -- PEG Pattern: zero or more a
     Parses A as many times in a row as it can, starting each A at the
     end of the text parsed by the previous A.  Always succeeds.

     ‘"a*"’

     ‘(* a)’

 -- PEG Pattern: one or more a
     Parses A as many times in a row as it can, starting each A at the
     end of the text parsed by the previous A.  Succeeds if at least one
     A was parsed.

     ‘"a+"’

     ‘(+ a)’

 -- PEG Pattern: optional a
     Tries to parse A.  Succeeds if A succeeds.

     ‘"a?"’

     ‘(? a)’

 -- PEG Pattern: followed by a
     Makes sure it is possible to parse A, but does not actually parse
     it.  Succeeds if A would succeed.

     ‘"&a"’

     ‘(followed-by a)’

 -- PEG Pattern: not followed by a
     Makes sure it is impossible to parse A, but does not actually parse
     it.  Succeeds if A would fail.

     ‘"!a"’

     ‘(not-followed-by a)’

 -- PEG Pattern: string literal ``abc''
     Parses the string "ABC".  Succeeds if that parsing succeeds.

     ‘"'abc'"’

     ‘"abc"’

 -- PEG Pattern: any character
     Parses any single character.  Succeeds unless there is no more text
     to be parsed.

     ‘"."’

     ‘peg-any’

 -- PEG Pattern: character class a b
     Alternative syntax for “Ordered Choice A B” if A and B are
     characters.

     ‘"[ab]"’

     ‘(or "a" "b")’

 -- PEG Pattern: range of characters a z
     Parses any character falling between A and Z.

     ‘"[a-z]"’

     ‘(range #\a #\z)’

   Example:

     "(a !b / c &d*) 'e'+"

   Would be:

     (and
      (or
       (and a (not-followed-by b))
       (and c (followed-by (* d))))
      (+ "e"))

### Extended Syntax
...............

There is some extra syntax for S-expressions.

 -- PEG Pattern: ignore a
     Ignore the text matching A

 -- PEG Pattern: capture a
     Capture the text matching A.

 -- PEG Pattern: peg a
     Embed the PEG pattern A using string syntax.

   Example:

     "!a / 'b'"

   Is equivalent to

     (or (peg "!a") "b")

   and

     (or (not-followed-by a) "b")

6.15.2 PEG API Reference
------------------------

### Define Macros
.............

The most straightforward way to define a PEG is by using one of the
define macros (both of these macroexpand into ‘define’ expressions).
These macros bind parsing functions to variables.  These parsing
functions may be invoked by ‘match-pattern’ or ‘search-for-pattern’,
which return a PEG match record.  Raw data can be retrieved from this
record with the PEG match deconstructor functions.  More complicated
(and perhaps enlightening) examples can be found in the tutorial.

 -- Scheme Macro: define-peg-string-patterns peg-string
     Defines all the nonterminals in the PEG PEG-STRING.  More
     precisely, ‘define-peg-string-patterns’ takes a superset of PEGs.
     A normal PEG has a ‘<-’ between the nonterminal and the pattern.
     ‘define-peg-string-patterns’ uses this symbol to determine what
     information it should propagate up the parse tree.  The normal ‘<-’
     propagates the matched text up the parse tree, ‘<--’ propagates the
     matched text up the parse tree tagged with the name of the
     nonterminal, and ‘<’ discards that matched text and propagates
     nothing up the parse tree.  Also, nonterminals may consist of any
     alphanumeric character or a “-” character (in normal PEGs
     nonterminals can only be alphabetic).

     For example, if we:
          (define-peg-string-patterns
            "as <- 'a'+
          bs <- 'b'+
          as-or-bs <- as/bs")
          (define-peg-string-patterns
            "as-tag <-- 'a'+
          bs-tag <-- 'b'+
          as-or-bs-tag <-- as-tag/bs-tag")
     Then:
          (match-pattern as-or-bs "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 0 end: 2 string: aabbcc tree: aa>
          (match-pattern as-or-bs-tag "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 0 end: 2 string: aabbcc tree: (as-or-bs-tag (as-tag aa))>

     Note that in doing this, we have bound 6 variables at the toplevel
     (AS, BS, AS-OR-BS, AS-TAG, BS-TAG, and AS-OR-BS-TAG).

 -- Scheme Macro: define-peg-pattern name capture-type peg-sexp
     Defines a single nonterminal NAME.  CAPTURE-TYPE determines how
     much information is passed up the parse tree.  PEG-SEXP is a PEG in
     S-expression form.

     Possible values for capture-type:

     ‘all’
          passes the matched text up the parse tree tagged with the name
          of the nonterminal.
     ‘body’
          passes the matched text up the parse tree.
     ‘none’
          passes nothing up the parse tree.

     For Example, if we:
          (define-peg-pattern as body (+ "a"))
          (define-peg-pattern bs body (+ "b"))
          (define-peg-pattern as-or-bs body (or as bs))
          (define-peg-pattern as-tag all (+ "a"))
          (define-peg-pattern bs-tag all (+ "b"))
          (define-peg-pattern as-or-bs-tag all (or as-tag bs-tag))
     Then:
          (match-pattern as-or-bs "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 0 end: 2 string: aabbcc tree: aa>
          (match-pattern as-or-bs-tag "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 0 end: 2 string: aabbcc tree: (as-or-bs-tag (as-tag aa))>

     Note that in doing this, we have bound 6 variables at the toplevel
     (AS, BS, AS-OR-BS, AS-TAG, BS-TAG, and AS-OR-BS-TAG).

### Compile Functions
.................

It is sometimes useful to be able to compile anonymous PEG patterns at
runtime.  These functions let you do that using either syntax.

 -- Scheme Procedure: peg-string-compile peg-string capture-type
     Compiles the PEG pattern in PEG-STRING propagating according to
     CAPTURE-TYPE (capture-type can be any of the values from
     ‘define-peg-pattern’).

 -- Scheme Procedure: compile-peg-pattern peg-sexp capture-type
     Compiles the PEG pattern in PEG-SEXP propagating according to
     CAPTURE-TYPE (capture-type can be any of the values from
     ‘define-peg-pattern’).

   The functions return syntax objects, which can be useful if you want
to use them in macros.  If all you want is to define a new nonterminal,
you can do the following:

     (define exp '(+ "a"))
     (define as (compile (compile-peg-pattern exp 'body)))

   You can use this nonterminal with all of the regular PEG functions:

     (match-pattern as "aaaaa") ⇒
     #<peg start: 0 end: 5 string: bbbbb tree: bbbbb>

### Parsing & Matching Functions
............................

For our purposes, “parsing” means parsing a string into a tree starting
from the first character, while “matching” means searching through the
string for a substring.  In practice, the only difference between the
two functions is that ‘match-pattern’ gives up if it can’t find a valid
substring starting at index 0 and ‘search-for-pattern’ keeps looking.
They are both equally capable of “parsing” and “matching” given those
constraints.

 -- Scheme Procedure: match-pattern nonterm string
     Parses STRING using the PEG stored in NONTERM.  If no match was
     found, ‘match-pattern’ returns false.  If a match was found, a PEG
     match record is returned.

     The ‘capture-type’ argument to ‘define-peg-pattern’ allows you to
     choose what information to hold on to while parsing.  The options
     are:

     ‘all’
          tag the matched text with the nonterminal
     ‘body’
          just the matched text
     ‘none’
          nothing

          (define-peg-pattern as all (+ "a"))
          (match-pattern as "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 0 end: 2 string: aabbcc tree: (as aa)>

          (define-peg-pattern as body (+ "a"))
          (match-pattern as "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 0 end: 2 string: aabbcc tree: aa>

          (define-peg-pattern as none (+ "a"))
          (match-pattern as "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 0 end: 2 string: aabbcc tree: ()>

          (define-peg-pattern bs body (+ "b"))
          (match-pattern bs "aabbcc") ⇒
          #f

 -- Scheme Macro: search-for-pattern nonterm-or-peg string
     Searches through STRING looking for a matching subexpression.
     NONTERM-OR-PEG can either be a nonterminal or a literal PEG
     pattern.  When a literal PEG pattern is provided,
     ‘search-for-pattern’ works very similarly to the regular expression
     searches many hackers are used to.  If no match was found,
     ‘search-for-pattern’ returns false.  If a match was found, a PEG
     match record is returned.

          (define-peg-pattern as body (+ "a"))
          (search-for-pattern as "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 0 end: 2 string: aabbcc tree: aa>
          (search-for-pattern (+ "a") "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 0 end: 2 string: aabbcc tree: aa>
          (search-for-pattern "'a'+" "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 0 end: 2 string: aabbcc tree: aa>

          (define-peg-pattern as all (+ "a"))
          (search-for-pattern as "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 0 end: 2 string: aabbcc tree: (as aa)>

          (define-peg-pattern bs body (+ "b"))
          (search-for-pattern bs "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 2 end: 4 string: aabbcc tree: bb>
          (search-for-pattern (+ "b") "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 2 end: 4 string: aabbcc tree: bb>
          (search-for-pattern "'b'+" "aabbcc") ⇒
          #<peg start: 2 end: 4 string: aabbcc tree: bb>

          (define-peg-pattern zs body (+ "z"))
          (search-for-pattern zs "aabbcc") ⇒
          #f
          (search-for-pattern (+ "z") "aabbcc") ⇒
          #f
          (search-for-pattern "'z'+" "aabbcc") ⇒
          #f

### PEG Match Records
.................

The ‘match-pattern’ and ‘search-for-pattern’ functions both return PEG
match records.  Actual information can be extracted from these with the
following functions.

 -- Scheme Procedure: peg:string match-record
     Returns the original string that was parsed in the creation of
     ‘match-record’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: peg:start match-record
     Returns the index of the first parsed character in the original
     string (from ‘peg:string’).  If this is the same as ‘peg:end’,
     nothing was parsed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: peg:end match-record
     Returns one more than the index of the last parsed character in the
     original string (from ‘peg:string’).  If this is the same as
     ‘peg:start’, nothing was parsed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: peg:substring match-record
     Returns the substring parsed by ‘match-record’.  This is equivalent
     to ‘(substring (peg:string match-record) (peg:start match-record)
     (peg:end match-record))’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: peg:tree match-record
     Returns the tree parsed by ‘match-record’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: peg-record? match-record
     Returns true if ‘match-record’ is a PEG match record, or false
     otherwise.

   Example:
     (define-peg-pattern bs all (peg "'b'+"))

     (search-for-pattern bs "aabbcc") ⇒
     #<peg start: 2 end: 4 string: aabbcc tree: (bs bb)>

     (let ((pm (search-for-pattern bs "aabbcc")))
        `((string ,(peg:string pm))
          (start ,(peg:start pm))
          (end ,(peg:end pm))
          (substring ,(peg:substring pm))
          (tree ,(peg:tree pm))
          (record? ,(peg-record? pm)))) ⇒
     ((string "aabbcc")
      (start 2)
      (end 4)
      (substring "bb")
      (tree (bs "bb"))
      (record? #t))

### Miscellaneous
.............

 -- Scheme Procedure: context-flatten tst lst
     Takes a predicate TST and a list LST.  Flattens LST until all
     elements are either atoms or satisfy TST.  If LST itself satisfies
     TST, ‘(list lst)’ is returned (this is a flat list whose only
     element satisfies TST).

          (context-flatten (lambda (x) (and (number? (car x)) (= (car x) 1))) '(2 2 (1 1 (2 2)) (2 2 (1 1)))) ⇒
          (2 2 (1 1 (2 2)) 2 2 (1 1))
          (context-flatten (lambda (x) (and (number? (car x)) (= (car x) 1))) '(1 1 (1 1 (2 2)) (2 2 (1 1)))) ⇒
          ((1 1 (1 1 (2 2)) (2 2 (1 1))))

     If you’re wondering why this is here, take a look at the tutorial.

 -- Scheme Procedure: keyword-flatten terms lst
     A less general form of ‘context-flatten’.  Takes a list of terminal
     atoms ‘terms’ and flattens LST until all elements are either atoms,
     or lists which have an atom from ‘terms’ as their first element.
          (keyword-flatten '(a b) '(c a b (a c) (b c) (c (b a) (c a)))) ⇒
          (c a b (a c) (b c) c (b a) c a)

6.15.3 PEG Tutorial
-------------------

### Parsing /etc/passwd
...................

This example will show how to parse /etc/passwd using PEGs.

   First we define an example /etc/passwd file:

     (define *etc-passwd*
       "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
     daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
     bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
     sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh
     nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/bin/sh
     messagebus:x:103:107::/var/run/dbus:/bin/false
     ")

   As a first pass at this, we might want to have all the entries in
/etc/passwd in a list.

   Doing this with string-based PEG syntax would look like this:
     (define-peg-string-patterns
       "passwd <- entry* !.
     entry <-- (! NL .)* NL*
     NL < '\n'")

   A ‘passwd’ file is 0 or more entries (‘entry*’) until the end of the
file (‘!.’ (‘.’ is any character, so ‘!.’ means “not anything”)).  We
want to capture the data in the nonterminal ‘passwd’, but not tag it
with the name, so we use ‘<-’.

   An entry is a series of 0 or more characters that aren’t newlines
(‘(! NL .)*’) followed by 0 or more newlines (‘NL*’).  We want to tag
all the entries with ‘entry’, so we use ‘<--’.

   A newline is just a literal newline (‘'\n'’).  We don’t want a bunch
of newlines cluttering up the output, so we use ‘<’ to throw away the
captured data.

   Here is the same PEG defined using S-expressions:
     (define-peg-pattern passwd body (and (* entry) (not-followed-by peg-any)))
     (define-peg-pattern entry all (and (* (and (not-followed-by NL) peg-any))
                   (* NL)))
     (define-peg-pattern NL none "\n")

   Obviously this is much more verbose.  On the other hand, it’s more
explicit, and thus easier to build automatically.  However, there are
some tricks that make S-expressions easier to use in some cases.  One is
the ‘ignore’ keyword; the string syntax has no way to say “throw away
this text” except breaking it out into a separate nonterminal.  For
instance, to throw away the newlines we had to define ‘NL’.  In the
S-expression syntax, we could have simply written ‘(ignore "\n")’.
Also, for the cases where string syntax is really much cleaner, the
‘peg’ keyword can be used to embed string syntax in S-expression syntax.
For instance, we could have written:

     (define-peg-pattern passwd body (peg "entry* !."))

   However we define it, parsing ‘*etc-passwd*’ with the ‘passwd’
nonterminal yields the same results:

     (peg:tree (match-pattern passwd *etc-passwd*)) ⇒
     ((entry "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash")
      (entry "daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh")
      (entry "bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh")
      (entry "sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh")
      (entry "nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/bin/sh")
      (entry "messagebus:x:103:107::/var/run/dbus:/bin/false"))

   However, here is something to be wary of:

     (peg:tree (match-pattern passwd "one entry")) ⇒
     (entry "one entry")

   By default, the parse trees generated by PEGs are compressed as much
as possible without losing information.  It may not look like this is
what you want at first, but uncompressed parse trees are an enormous
headache (there’s no easy way to predict how deep particular lists will
nest, there are empty lists littered everywhere, etc.  etc.).  One
side-effect of this, however, is that sometimes the compressor is too
aggressive.  No information is discarded when ‘((entry "one entry"))’ is
compressed to ‘(entry "one entry")’, but in this particular case it
probably isn’t what we want.

   There are two functions for easily dealing with this:
‘keyword-flatten’ and ‘context-flatten’.  The ‘keyword-flatten’ function
takes a list of keywords and a list to flatten, then tries to coerce the
list such that the first element of all sublists is one of the keywords.
The ‘context-flatten’ function is similar, but instead of a list of
keywords it takes a predicate that should indicate whether a given
sublist is good enough (refer to the API reference for more details).

   What we want here is ‘keyword-flatten’.
     (keyword-flatten '(entry) (peg:tree (match-pattern passwd *etc-passwd*))) ⇒
     ((entry "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash")
      (entry "daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh")
      (entry "bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh")
      (entry "sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh")
      (entry "nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/bin/sh")
      (entry "messagebus:x:103:107::/var/run/dbus:/bin/false"))
     (keyword-flatten '(entry) (peg:tree (match-pattern passwd "one entry"))) ⇒
     ((entry "one entry"))

   Of course, this is a somewhat contrived example.  In practice we
would probably just tag the ‘passwd’ nonterminal to remove the ambiguity
(using either the ‘all’ keyword for S-expressions or the ‘<--’ symbol
for strings)..

     (define-peg-pattern tag-passwd all (peg "entry* !."))
     (peg:tree (match-pattern tag-passwd *etc-passwd*)) ⇒
     (tag-passwd
       (entry "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash")
       (entry "daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh")
       (entry "bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh")
       (entry "sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh")
       (entry "nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/bin/sh")
       (entry "messagebus:x:103:107::/var/run/dbus:/bin/false"))
     (peg:tree (match-pattern tag-passwd "one entry"))
     (tag-passwd
       (entry "one entry"))

   If you’re ever uncertain about the potential results of parsing
something, remember the two absolute rules:
  1. No parsing information will ever be discarded.
  2. There will never be any lists with fewer than 2 elements.

   For the purposes of (1), "parsing information" means things tagged
with the ‘any’ keyword or the ‘<--’ symbol.  Plain strings will be
concatenated.

   Let’s extend this example a bit more and actually pull some useful
information out of the passwd file:

     (define-peg-string-patterns
       "passwd <-- entry* !.
     entry <-- login C pass C uid C gid C nameORcomment C homedir C shell NL*
     login <-- text
     pass <-- text
     uid <-- [0-9]*
     gid <-- [0-9]*
     nameORcomment <-- text
     homedir <-- path
     shell <-- path
     path <-- (SLASH pathELEMENT)*
     pathELEMENT <-- (!NL !C  !'/' .)*
     text <- (!NL !C  .)*
     C < ':'
     NL < '\n'
     SLASH < '/'")

   This produces rather pretty parse trees:
     (passwd
       (entry (login "root")
              (pass "x")
              (uid "0")
              (gid "0")
              (nameORcomment "root")
              (homedir (path (pathELEMENT "root")))
              (shell (path (pathELEMENT "bin") (pathELEMENT "bash"))))
       (entry (login "daemon")
              (pass "x")
              (uid "1")
              (gid "1")
              (nameORcomment "daemon")
              (homedir
                (path (pathELEMENT "usr") (pathELEMENT "sbin")))
              (shell (path (pathELEMENT "bin") (pathELEMENT "sh"))))
       (entry (login "bin")
              (pass "x")
              (uid "2")
              (gid "2")
              (nameORcomment "bin")
              (homedir (path (pathELEMENT "bin")))
              (shell (path (pathELEMENT "bin") (pathELEMENT "sh"))))
       (entry (login "sys")
              (pass "x")
              (uid "3")
              (gid "3")
              (nameORcomment "sys")
              (homedir (path (pathELEMENT "dev")))
              (shell (path (pathELEMENT "bin") (pathELEMENT "sh"))))
       (entry (login "nobody")
              (pass "x")
              (uid "65534")
              (gid "65534")
              (nameORcomment "nobody")
              (homedir (path (pathELEMENT "nonexistent")))
              (shell (path (pathELEMENT "bin") (pathELEMENT "sh"))))
       (entry (login "messagebus")
              (pass "x")
              (uid "103")
              (gid "107")
              nameORcomment
              (homedir
                (path (pathELEMENT "var")
                      (pathELEMENT "run")
                      (pathELEMENT "dbus")))
              (shell (path (pathELEMENT "bin") (pathELEMENT "false")))))

   Notice that when there’s no entry in a field (e.g.  ‘nameORcomment’
for messagebus) the symbol is inserted.  This is the “don’t throw away
any information” rule—we succesfully matched a ‘nameORcomment’ of 0
characters (since we used ‘*’ when defining it).  This is usually what
you want, because it allows you to e.g.  use ‘list-ref’ to pull out
elements (since they all have known offsets).

   If you’d prefer not to have symbols for empty matches, you can
replace the ‘*’ with a ‘+’ and add a ‘?’ after the ‘nameORcomment’ in
‘entry’.  Then it will try to parse 1 or more characters, fail
(inserting nothing into the parse tree), but continue because it didn’t
have to match the nameORcomment to continue.

### Embedding Arithmetic Expressions
................................

We can parse simple mathematical expressions with the following PEG:

     (define-peg-string-patterns
       "expr <- sum
     sum <-- (product ('+' / '-') sum) / product
     product <-- (value ('*' / '/') product) / value
     value <-- number / '(' expr ')'
     number <-- [0-9]+")

   Then:
     (peg:tree (match-pattern expr "1+1/2*3+(1+1)/2")) ⇒
     (sum (product (value (number "1")))
          "+"
          (sum (product
                 (value (number "1"))
                 "/"
                 (product
                   (value (number "2"))
                   "*"
                   (product (value (number "3")))))
               "+"
               (sum (product
                      (value "("
                             (sum (product (value (number "1")))
                                  "+"
                                  (sum (product (value (number "1")))))
                             ")")
                      "/"
                      (product (value (number "2")))))))

   There is very little wasted effort in this PEG. The ‘number’
nonterminal has to be tagged because otherwise the numbers might run
together with the arithmetic expressions during the string concatenation
stage of parse-tree compression (the parser will see “1” followed by “/”
and decide to call it “1/”).  When in doubt, tag.

   It is very easy to turn these parse trees into lisp expressions:

     (define (parse-sum sum left . rest)
       (if (null? rest)
           (apply parse-product left)
           (list (string->symbol (car rest))
          (apply parse-product left)
          (apply parse-sum (cadr rest)))))

     (define (parse-product product left . rest)
       (if (null? rest)
           (apply parse-value left)
           (list (string->symbol (car rest))
          (apply parse-value left)
          (apply parse-product (cadr rest)))))

     (define (parse-value value first . rest)
       (if (null? rest)
           (string->number (cadr first))
           (apply parse-sum (car rest))))

     (define parse-expr parse-sum)

   (Notice all these functions look very similar; for a more complicated
PEG, it would be worth abstracting.)

   Then:
     (apply parse-expr (peg:tree (match-pattern expr "1+1/2*3+(1+1)/2"))) ⇒
     (+ 1 (+ (/ 1 (* 2 3)) (/ (+ 1 1) 2)))

   But wait!  The associativity is wrong!  Where it says ‘(/ 1 (* 2
3))’, it should say ‘(* (/ 1 2) 3)’.

   It’s tempting to try replacing e.g.  ‘"sum <-- (product ('+' / '-')
sum) / product"’ with ‘"sum <-- (sum ('+' / '-') product) / product"’,
but this is a Bad Idea.  PEGs don’t support left recursion.  To see why,
imagine what the parser will do here.  When it tries to parse ‘sum’, it
first has to try and parse ‘sum’.  But to do that, it first has to try
and parse ‘sum’.  This will continue until the stack gets blown off.

   So how does one parse left-associative binary operators with PEGs?
Honestly, this is one of their major shortcomings.  There’s no
general-purpose way of doing this, but here the repetition operators are
a good choice:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-1))

     (define-peg-string-patterns
       "expr <- sum
     sum <-- (product ('+' / '-'))* product
     product <-- (value ('*' / '/'))* value
     value <-- number / '(' expr ')'
     number <-- [0-9]+")

     ;; take a deep breath...
     (define (make-left-parser next-func)
       (lambda (sum first . rest) ;; general form, comments below assume
         ;; that we're dealing with a sum expression
         (if (null? rest) ;; form (sum (product ...))
           (apply next-func first)
           (if (string? (cadr first));; form (sum ((product ...) "+") (product ...))
        (list (string->symbol (cadr first))
         (apply next-func (car first))
         (apply next-func (car rest)))
               ;; form (sum (((product ...) "+") ((product ...) "+")) (product ...))
        (car
         (reduce ;; walk through the list and build a left-associative tree
          (lambda (l r)
            (list (list (cadr r) (car r) (apply next-func (car l)))
             (string->symbol (cadr l))))
          'ignore
          (append ;; make a list of all the products
                  ;; the first one should be pre-parsed
           (list (list (apply next-func (caar first))
             (string->symbol (cadar first))))
           (cdr first)
                  ;; the last one has to be added in
           (list (append rest '("done"))))))))))

     (define (parse-value value first . rest)
       (if (null? rest)
           (string->number (cadr first))
           (apply parse-sum (car rest))))
     (define parse-product (make-left-parser parse-value))
     (define parse-sum (make-left-parser parse-product))
     (define parse-expr parse-sum)

   Then:
     (apply parse-expr (peg:tree (match-pattern expr "1+1/2*3+(1+1)/2"))) ⇒
     (+ (+ 1 (* (/ 1 2) 3)) (/ (+ 1 1) 2))

   As you can see, this is much uglier (it could be made prettier by
using ‘context-flatten’, but the way it’s written above makes it clear
how we deal with the three ways the zero-or-more ‘*’ expression can
parse).  Fortunately, most of the time we can get away with only using
right-associativity.

### Simplified Functions
....................

For a more tantalizing example, consider the following grammar that
parses (highly) simplified C functions:

     (define-peg-string-patterns
       "cfunc <-- cSP ctype cSP cname cSP cargs cLB cSP cbody cRB
     ctype <-- cidentifier
     cname <-- cidentifier
     cargs <-- cLP (! (cSP cRP) carg cSP (cCOMMA / cRP) cSP)* cSP
     carg <-- cSP ctype cSP cname
     cbody <-- cstatement *
     cidentifier <- [a-zA-z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
     cstatement <-- (!';'.)*cSC cSP
     cSC < ';'
     cCOMMA < ','
     cLP < '('
     cRP < ')'
     cLB < '{'
     cRB < '}'
     cSP < [ \t\n]*")

   Then:
     (match-pattern cfunc "int square(int a) { return a*a;}") ⇒
     (32
      (cfunc (ctype "int")
             (cname "square")
             (cargs (carg (ctype "int") (cname "a")))
             (cbody (cstatement "return a*a"))))

   And:
     (match-pattern cfunc "int mod(int a, int b) { int c = a/b;return a-b*c; }") ⇒
     (52
      (cfunc (ctype "int")
             (cname "mod")
             (cargs (carg (ctype "int") (cname "a"))
                    (carg (ctype "int") (cname "b")))
             (cbody (cstatement "int c = a/b")
                    (cstatement "return a- b*c"))))

   By wrapping all the ‘carg’ nonterminals in a ‘cargs’ nonterminal, we
were able to remove any ambiguity in the parsing structure and avoid
having to call ‘context-flatten’ on the output of ‘match-pattern’.  We
used the same trick with the ‘cstatement’ nonterminals, wrapping them in
a ‘cbody’ nonterminal.

   The whitespace nonterminal ‘cSP’ used here is a (very) useful
instantiation of a common pattern for matching syntactically irrelevant
information.  Since it’s tagged with ‘<’ and ends with ‘*’ it won’t
clutter up the parse trees (all the empty lists will be discarded during
the compression step) and it will never cause parsing to fail.


File: guile.info,  Node: PEG Internals,  Prev: PEG Tutorial,  Up: PEG Parsing

6.15.4 PEG Internals
--------------------

A PEG parser takes a string as input and attempts to parse it as a given
nonterminal.  The key idea of the PEG implementation is that every
nonterminal is just a function that takes a string as an argument and
attempts to parse that string as its nonterminal.  The functions always
start from the beginning, but a parse is considered successful if there
is material left over at the end.

   This makes it easy to model different PEG parsing operations.  For
instance, consider the PEG grammar ‘"ab"’, which could also be written
‘(and "a" "b")’.  It matches the string “ab”.  Here’s how that might be
implemented in the PEG style:

     (define (match-and-a-b str)
       (match-a str)
       (match-b str))

   As you can see, the use of functions provides an easy way to model
sequencing.  In a similar way, one could model ‘(or a b)’ with something
like the following:

     (define (match-or-a-b str)
       (or (match-a str) (match-b str)))

   Here the semantics of a PEG ‘or’ expression map naturally onto
Scheme’s ‘or’ operator.  This function will attempt to run ‘(match-a
str)’, and return its result if it succeeds.  Otherwise it will run
‘(match-b str)’.

   Of course, the code above wouldn’t quite work.  We need some way for
the parsing functions to communicate.  The actual interface used is
below.

### Parsing Function Interface
..........................

A parsing function takes three arguments - a string, the length of that
string, and the position in that string it should start parsing at.  In
effect, the parsing functions pass around substrings in pieces - the
first argument is a buffer of characters, and the second two give a
range within that buffer that the parsing function should look at.

   Parsing functions return either #f, if they failed to match their
nonterminal, or a list whose first element must be an integer
representing the final position in the string they matched and whose cdr
can be any other data the function wishes to return, or ’() if it
doesn’t have any more data.

   The one caveat is that if the extra data it returns is a list, any
adjacent strings in that list will be appended by ‘match-pattern’.  For
instance, if a parsing function returns ‘(13 ("a" "b" "c"))’,
‘match-pattern’ will take ‘(13 ("abc"))’ as its value.

   For example, here is a function to match “ab” using the actual
interface.

     (define (match-a-b str len pos)
        (and (<= (+ pos 2) len)
             (string= str "ab" pos (+ pos 2))
             (list (+ pos 2) '()))) ; we return no extra information

   The above function can be used to match a string by running
‘(match-pattern match-a-b "ab")’.

### Code Generators and Extensible Syntax
.....................................

PEG expressions, such as those in a ‘define-peg-pattern’ form, are
interpreted internally in two steps.

   First, any string PEG is expanded into an s-expression PEG by the
code in the ‘(ice-9 peg string-peg)’ module.

   Then, the s-expression PEG that results is compiled into a parsing
function by the ‘(ice-9 peg codegen)’ module.  In particular, the
function ‘compile-peg-pattern’ is called on the s-expression.  It then
decides what to do based on the form it is passed.

   The PEG syntax can be expanded by providing ‘compile-peg-pattern’
more options for what to do with its forms.  The extended syntax will be
associated with a symbol, for instance ‘my-parsing-form’, and will be
called on all PEG expressions of the form
     (my-parsing-form ...)

   The parsing function should take two arguments.  The first will be a
syntax object containing a list with all of the arguments to the form
(but not the form’s name), and the second will be the ‘capture-type’
argument that is passed to ‘define-peg-pattern’.

   New functions can be registered by calling ‘(add-peg-compiler! symbol
function)’, where ‘symbol’ is the symbol that will indicate a form of
this type and ‘function’ is the code generating function described
above.  The function ‘add-peg-compiler!’ is exported from the ‘(ice-9
peg codegen)’ module.

### 6.16.1.1 Expression Syntax
..........................

An expression to be evaluated takes one of the following forms.

SYMBOL
     A symbol is evaluated by dereferencing.  A binding of that symbol
     is sought and the value there used.  For example,

          (define x 123)
          x ⇒ 123

(PROC ARGS...)
     A parenthesised expression is a function call.  PROC and each
     argument are evaluated, then the function (which PROC evaluated to)
     is called with those arguments.

     The order in which PROC and the arguments are evaluated is
     unspecified, so be careful when using expressions with side
     effects.

          (max 1 2 3) ⇒ 3

          (define (get-some-proc)  min)
          ((get-some-proc) 1 2 3) ⇒ 1

     The same sort of parenthesised form is used for a macro invocation,
     but in that case the arguments are not evaluated.  See the
     descriptions of macros for more on this (*note* Macros::, and *note*
     Syntax Rules::).

CONSTANT
     Number, string, character and boolean constants evaluate “to
     themselves”, so can appear as literals.

          123     ⇒ 123
          99.9    ⇒ 99.9
          "hello" ⇒ "hello"
          #\z     ⇒ #\z
          #t      ⇒ #t

     Note that an application must not attempt to modify literal
     strings, since they may be in read-only memory.

(quote DATA)
’DATA
     Quoting is used to obtain a literal symbol (instead of a variable
     reference), a literal list (instead of a function call), or a
     literal vector.  ’ is simply a shorthand for a ‘quote’ form.  For
     example,

          'x                   ⇒ x
          '(1 2 3)             ⇒ (1 2 3)
          '#(1 (2 3) 4)        ⇒ #(1 (2 3) 4)
          (quote x)            ⇒ x
          (quote (1 2 3))      ⇒ (1 2 3)
          (quote #(1 (2 3) 4)) ⇒ #(1 (2 3) 4)

     Note that an application must not attempt to modify literal lists
     or vectors obtained from a ‘quote’ form, since they may be in
     read-only memory.

(quasiquote DATA)
‘DATA
     Backquote quasi-quotation is like ‘quote’, but selected
     sub-expressions are evaluated.  This is a convenient way to
     construct a list or vector structure most of which is constant, but
     at certain points should have expressions substituted.

     The same effect can always be had with suitable ‘list’, ‘cons’ or
     ‘vector’ calls, but quasi-quoting is often easier.

     (unquote EXPR)
     ,EXPR
          Within the quasiquote DATA, ‘unquote’ or ‘,’ indicates an
          expression to be evaluated and inserted.  The comma syntax ‘,’
          is simply a shorthand for an ‘unquote’ form.  For example,

               `(1 2 (* 9 9) 3 4)       ⇒ (1 2 (* 9 9) 3 4)
               `(1 2 ,(* 9 9) 3 4)      ⇒ (1 2 81 3 4)
               `(1 (unquote (+ 1 1)) 3) ⇒ (1 2 3)
               `#(1 ,(/ 12 2))          ⇒ #(1 6)

     (unquote-splicing EXPR)
     ,@EXPR
          Within the quasiquote DATA, ‘unquote-splicing’ or ‘,@’
          indicates an expression to be evaluated and the elements of
          the returned list inserted.  EXPR must evaluate to a list.
          The “comma-at” syntax ‘,@’ is simply a shorthand for an
          ‘unquote-splicing’ form.

               (define x '(2 3))
               `(1 ,x 4)                           ⇒ (1 (2 3) 4)
               `(1 ,@x 4)                         ⇒ (1 2 3 4)
               `(1 (unquote-splicing (map 1+ x)))  ⇒ (1 3 4)
               `#(9 ,@x 9)                        ⇒ #(9 2 3 9)

          Notice ‘,@’ differs from plain ‘,’ in the way one level of
          nesting is stripped.  For ‘,@’ the elements of a returned list
          are inserted, whereas with ‘,’ it would be the list itself
          inserted.


File: guile.info,  Node: Comments,  Next: Block Comments,  Prev: Expression Syntax,  Up: Scheme Syntax

### 6.16.1.2 Comments
.................

Comments in Scheme source files are written by starting them with a
semicolon character (‘;’).  The comment then reaches up to the end of
the line.  Comments can begin at any column, and the may be inserted on
the same line as Scheme code.

     ; Comment
     ;; Comment too
     (define x 1)        ; Comment after expression
     (let ((y 1))
       ;; Display something.
       (display y)
     ;;; Comment at left margin.
       (display (+ y 1)))

   It is common to use a single semicolon for comments following
expressions on a line, to use two semicolons for comments which are
indented like code, and three semicolons for comments which start at
column 0, even if they are inside an indented code block.  This
convention is used when indenting code in Emacs’ Scheme mode.


File: guile.info,  Node: Block Comments,  Next: Case Sensitivity,  Prev: Comments,  Up: Scheme Syntax

### 6.16.1.3 Block Comments
.......................

In addition to the standard line comments defined by R5RS, Guile has
another comment type for multiline comments, called “block comments”.
This type of comment begins with the character sequence ‘#!’ and ends
with the characters ‘!#’.

   These comments are compatible with the block comments in the Scheme
Shell ‘scsh’ (*note* The Scheme shell (scsh)::).  The characters ‘#!’
were chosen because they are the magic characters used in shell scripts
for indicating that the name of the program for executing the script
follows on the same line.

   Thus a Guile script often starts like this.

     #! /usr/local/bin/guile -s
     !#

   More details on Guile scripting can be found in the scripting section
(*note* Guile Scripting::).

   Similarly, Guile (starting from version 2.0) supports nested block
comments as specified by R6RS and SRFI-30
(http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-30/srfi-30.html):

     (+ 1 #| this is a #| nested |# block comment |# 2)
     ⇒ 3

   For backward compatibility, this syntax can be overridden with
‘read-hash-extend’ (*note* ‘read-hash-extend’: Reader Extensions.).

   There is one special case where the contents of a comment can
actually affect the interpretation of code.  When a character encoding
declaration, such as ‘coding: utf-8’ appears in one of the first few
lines of a source file, it indicates to Guile’s default reader that this
source code file is not ASCII. For details see *note* Character Encoding
of Source Files::.

### 6.16.1.4 Case Sensitivity
.........................

Scheme as defined in R5RS is not case sensitive when reading symbols.
Guile, on the contrary is case sensitive by default, so the identifiers

     guile-whuzzy
     Guile-Whuzzy

   are the same in R5RS Scheme, but are different in Guile.

   It is possible to turn off case sensitivity in Guile by setting the
reader option ‘case-insensitive’.  For more information on reader
options, *Note* Scheme Read::.

     (read-enable 'case-insensitive)

   It is also possible to disable (or enable) case sensitivity within a
single file by placing the reader directives ‘#!fold-case’ (or
‘#!no-fold-case’) within the file itself.

### 6.16.1.6 Reader Extensions
..........................

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-hash-extend chr proc
 -- C Function: scm_read_hash_extend (chr, proc)
     Install the procedure PROC for reading expressions starting with
     the character sequence ‘#’ and CHR.  PROC will be called with two
     arguments: the character CHR and the port to read further data
     from.  The object returned will be the return value of ‘read’.
     Passing ‘#f’ for PROC will remove a previous setting.

6.16.2 Reading Scheme Code
--------------------------

 -- Scheme Procedure: read [port]
 -- C Function: scm_read (port)
     Read an s-expression from the input port PORT, or from the current
     input port if PORT is not specified.  Any whitespace before the
     next token is discarded.

   The behaviour of Guile’s Scheme reader can be modified by
manipulating its read options.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-options [setting]
     Display the current settings of the global read options.  If
     SETTING is omitted, only a short form of the current read options
     is printed.  Otherwise if SETTING is the symbol ‘help’, a complete
     options description is displayed.

   The set of available options, and their default values, may be had by
invoking ‘read-options’ at the prompt.

     scheme@(guile-user)> (read-options)
     (square-brackets keywords #f positions)
     scheme@(guile-user)> (read-options 'help)
     positions         yes   Record positions of source code expressions.
     case-insensitive  no    Convert symbols to lower case.
     keywords          #f    Style of keyword recognition: #f, 'prefix or 'postfix.
     r6rs-hex-escapes  no    Use R6RS variable-length character and string hex escapes.
     square-brackets   yes   Treat `[' and `]' as parentheses, for R6RS compatibility.
     hungry-eol-escapes no   In strings, consume leading whitespace after an
                             escaped end-of-line.
     curly-infix       no    Support SRFI-105 curly infix expressions.
     r7rs-symbols      no    Support R7RS |...| symbol notation.

   Note that Guile also includes a preliminary mechanism for setting
read options on a per-port basis.  For instance, the ‘case-insensitive’
read option is set (or unset) on the port when the reader encounters the
‘#!fold-case’ or ‘#!no-fold-case’ reader directives.  Similarly, the
‘#!curly-infix’ reader directive sets the ‘curly-infix’ read option on
the port, and ‘#!curly-infix-and-bracket-lists’ sets ‘curly-infix’ and
unsets ‘square-brackets’ on the port (*note* SRFI-105::).  There is
currently no other way to access or set the per-port read options.

   The boolean options may be toggled with ‘read-enable’ and
‘read-disable’.  The non-boolean ‘keywords’ option must be set using
‘read-set!’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-enable option-name
 -- Scheme Procedure: read-disable option-name
 -- Scheme Syntax: read-set! option-name value
     Modify the read options.  ‘read-enable’ should be used with boolean
     options and switches them on, ‘read-disable’ switches them off.

     ‘read-set!’ can be used to set an option to a specific value.  Due
     to historical oddities, it is a macro that expects an unquoted
     option name.

   For example, to make ‘read’ fold all symbols to their lower case
(perhaps for compatibility with older Scheme code), you can enter:

     (read-enable 'case-insensitive)

   For more information on the effect of the ‘r6rs-hex-escapes’ and
‘hungry-eol-escapes’ options, see (*note* String Syntax::).

   For more information on the ‘r7rs-symbols’ option, see (*note* Symbol
Read Syntax::).

6.16.3 Reading Scheme Code, For the Compiler
--------------------------------------------

When something goes wrong with a Scheme program, the user will want to
know how to fix it.  This starts with identifying where the error
occured: we want to associate a source location with each component part
of source code, and propagate that source location information through
to the compiler or interpreter.

   For that, Guile provides ‘read-syntax’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-syntax [port]
     Read an s-expression from the input port PORT, or from the current
     input port if PORT is not specified.

     If, after skipping white space and comments, no more bytes are
     available from PORT, return the end-of-file object.  *Note* Binary
     I/O::.  Otherwise, return an annotated datum.  An annotated datum
     is a syntax object which associates a source location with a datum.
     For example:

          (call-with-input-string "  foo" read-syntax)
          ; ⇒ #<syntax:unknown file:1:2 foo>
          (call-with-input-string "(foo)" read-syntax)
          ; ⇒
          ; #<syntax:unknown file:1:0
          ;   (#<syntax unknown file:1:1 foo>)>

     As the second example shows, all fields of pairs and vectors are
     also annotated, recursively.

   Most users are familiar with syntax objects in the context of macros,
which use syntax objects to associate scope information with
identifiers.  *Note* Macros::.  Here we use syntax objects to associate
source location information with any datum, but without attaching scope
information.  The Scheme compiler (‘compile’) and the interpreter
(‘eval’) can accept syntax objects directly as input, allowing them to
associate source information with resulting code.  *Note* Compilation::,
and *Note* Fly Evaluation::.

   Note that there is a legacy interface for getting source locations
into the Scheme compiler or interpreter, which is to use a side table
that associates “source properties” with each subdatum returned by
‘read’, instead of wrapping the datums directly as in ‘read-syntax’.
This has the disadvantage of not being able to annotate all kinds of
datums.  *Note* Source Properties::, for more information.

6.16.4 Writing Scheme Values
----------------------------

Any scheme value may be written to a port.  Not all values may be read
back in (*note* Scheme Read::), however.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write obj [port]
     Send a representation of OBJ to PORT or to the current output port
     if not given.

     The output is designed to be machine readable, and can be read back
     with ‘read’ (*note* Scheme Read::).  Strings are printed in double
     quotes, with escapes if necessary, and characters are printed in
     ‘#\’ notation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: display obj [port]
     Send a representation of OBJ to PORT or to the current output port
     if not given.

     The output is designed for human readability, it differs from
     ‘write’ in that strings are printed without double quotes and
     escapes, and characters are printed as per ‘write-char’, not in
     ‘#\’ form.

   As was the case with the Scheme reader, there are a few options that
affect the behavior of the Scheme printer.

 -- Scheme Procedure: print-options [setting]
     Display the current settings of the read options.  If SETTING is
     omitted, only a short form of the current read options is printed.
     Otherwise if SETTING is the symbol ‘help’, a complete options
     description is displayed.

   The set of available options, and their default values, may be had by
invoking ‘print-options’ at the prompt.

     scheme@(guile-user)> (print-options)
     (quote-keywordish-symbols reader highlight-suffix "}" highlight-prefix "{")
     scheme@(guile-user)> (print-options 'help)
     highlight-prefix          {       The string to print before highlighted values.
     highlight-suffix          }       The string to print after highlighted values.
     quote-keywordish-symbols  reader  How to print symbols that have a colon
                                       as their first or last character. The
                                       value '#f' does not quote the colons;
                                       '#t' quotes them; 'reader' quotes them
                                       when the reader option 'keywords' is
                                       not '#f'.
     escape-newlines           yes     Render newlines as \n when printing
                                       using `write'.
     r7rs-symbols              no      Escape symbols using R7RS |...| symbol
                                       notation.

   These options may be modified with the print-set!  syntax.

 -- Scheme Syntax: print-set! option-name value
     Modify the print options.  Due to historical oddities, ‘print-set!’
     is a macro that expects an unquoted option name.

6.16.5 Procedures for On the Fly Evaluation
-------------------------------------------

Scheme has the lovely property that its expressions may be represented
as data.  The ‘eval’ procedure takes a Scheme datum and evaluates it as
code.

 -- Scheme Procedure: eval exp module_or_state
 -- C Function: scm_eval (exp, module_or_state)
     Evaluate EXP, a list representing a Scheme expression, in the
     top-level environment specified by MODULE_OR_STATE.  While EXP is
     evaluated (using ‘primitive-eval’), MODULE_OR_STATE is made the
     current module.  The current module is reset to its previous value
     when ‘eval’ returns.  XXX - dynamic states.  Example: (eval ’(+ 1
     2) (interaction-environment))

 -- Scheme Procedure: interaction-environment
 -- C Function: scm_interaction_environment ()
     Return a specifier for the environment that contains
     implementation–defined bindings, typically a superset of those
     listed in the report.  The intent is that this procedure will
     return the environment in which the implementation would evaluate
     expressions dynamically typed by the user.

   *Note* Environments::, for other environments.

   One does not always receive code as Scheme data, of course, and this
is especially the case for Guile’s other language implementations (*note*
Other Languages::).  For the case in which all you have is a string, we
have ‘eval-string’.  There is a legacy version of this procedure in the
default environment, but you really want the one from ‘(ice-9
eval-string)’, so load it up:

     (use-modules (ice-9 eval-string))

 -- Scheme Procedure: eval-string string [#:module=#f] [#:file=#f]
          [#:line=#f] [#:column=#f] [#:lang=(current-language)]
          [#:compile?=#f]
     Parse STRING according to the current language, normally Scheme.
     Evaluate or compile the expressions it contains, in order,
     returning the last expression.

     If the MODULE keyword argument is set, save a module excursion
     (*note* Module System Reflection::) and set the current module to
     MODULE before evaluation.

     The FILE, LINE, and COLUMN keyword arguments can be used to
     indicate that the source string begins at a particular source
     location.

     Finally, LANG is a language, defaulting to the current language,
     and the expression is compiled if COMPILE? is true or there is no
     evaluator for the given language.

 -- C Function: scm_eval_string (string)
 -- C Function: scm_eval_string_in_module (string, module)
     These C bindings call ‘eval-string’ from ‘(ice-9 eval-string)’,
     evaluating within MODULE or the current module.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_eval_string (const char *string)
     ‘scm_eval_string’, but taking a C string in locale encoding instead
     of an ‘SCM’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: apply proc arg ... arglst
 -- C Function: scm_apply_0 (proc, arglst)
 -- C Function: scm_apply_1 (proc, arg1, arglst)
 -- C Function: scm_apply_2 (proc, arg1, arg2, arglst)
 -- C Function: scm_apply_3 (proc, arg1, arg2, arg3, arglst)
 -- C Function: scm_apply (proc, arg, rest)
     Call PROC with arguments ARG ... and the elements of the ARGLST
     list.

     ‘scm_apply’ takes parameters corresponding to a Scheme level
     ‘(lambda (proc arg1 . rest) ...)’.  So ARG1 and all but the last
     element of the REST list make up ARG ..., and the last element of
     REST is the ARGLST list.  Or if REST is the empty list ‘SCM_EOL’
     then there’s no ARG ..., and (ARG1) is the ARGLST.

     ARGLST is not modified, but the REST list passed to ‘scm_apply’ is
     modified.

 -- C Function: scm_call_0 (proc)
 -- C Function: scm_call_1 (proc, arg1)
 -- C Function: scm_call_2 (proc, arg1, arg2)
 -- C Function: scm_call_3 (proc, arg1, arg2, arg3)
 -- C Function: scm_call_4 (proc, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)
 -- C Function: scm_call_5 (proc, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)
 -- C Function: scm_call_6 (proc, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6)
 -- C Function: scm_call_7 (proc, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6,
          arg7)
 -- C Function: scm_call_8 (proc, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6,
          arg7, arg8)
 -- C Function: scm_call_9 (proc, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6,
          arg7, arg8, arg9)
     Call PROC with the given arguments.

 -- C Function: scm_call (proc, ...)
     Call PROC with any number of arguments.  The argument list must be
     terminated by ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’.  For example:

          scm_call (scm_c_public_ref ("guile", "+"),
                    scm_from_int (1),
                    scm_from_int (2),
                    SCM_UNDEFINED);

 -- C Function: scm_call_n (proc, argv, nargs)
     Call PROC with the array of arguments ARGV, as a ‘SCM*’.  The
     length of the arguments should be passed in NARGS, as a ‘size_t’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: primitive-eval exp
 -- C Function: scm_primitive_eval (exp)
     Evaluate EXP in the top-level environment specified by the current
     module.

6.16.6 Compiling Scheme Code
----------------------------

The ‘eval’ procedure directly interprets the S-expression representation
of Scheme.  An alternate strategy for evaluation is to determine ahead
of time what computations will be necessary to evaluate the expression,
and then use that recipe to produce the desired results.  This is known
as “compilation”.

   While it is possible to compile simple Scheme expressions such as ‘(+
2 2)’ or even ‘"Hello world!"’, compilation is most interesting in the
context of procedures.  Compiling a lambda expression produces a
compiled procedure, which is just like a normal procedure except
typically much faster, because it can bypass the generic interpreter.

   Functions from system modules in a Guile installation are normally
compiled already, so they load and run quickly.

   Note that well-written Scheme programs will not typically call the
procedures in this section, for the same reason that it is often bad
taste to use ‘eval’.  By default, Guile automatically compiles any files
it encounters that have not been compiled yet (*note* ‘--auto-compile’:
Invoking Guile.).  The compiler can also be invoked explicitly from the
shell as ‘guild compile foo.scm’.

   (Why are calls to ‘eval’ and ‘compile’ usually in bad taste?  Because
they are limited, in that they can only really make sense for top-level
expressions.  Also, most needs for “compile-time” computation are
fulfilled by macros and closures.  Of course one good counterexample is
the REPL itself, or any code that reads expressions from a port.)

   Automatic compilation generally works transparently, without any need
for user intervention.  However Guile does not yet do proper dependency
tracking, so that if file ‘A.scm’ uses macros from ‘B.scm’, and B.SCM
changes, ‘A.scm’ would not be automatically recompiled.  To forcibly
invalidate the auto-compilation cache, pass the ‘--fresh-auto-compile’
option to Guile, or set the ‘GUILE_AUTO_COMPILE’ environment variable to
‘fresh’ (instead of to ‘0’ or ‘1’).

   For more information on the compiler itself, see *note* Compiling to
the Virtual Machine::.  For information on the virtual machine, see
*note* A Virtual Machine for Guile::.

   The command-line interface to Guile’s compiler is the ‘guild compile’
command:

 -- Command: guild compile [option...] FILE...
     Compile FILE, a source file, and store bytecode in the compilation
     cache or in the file specified by the ‘-o’ option.  The following
     options are available:

     ‘-L DIR’
     ‘--load-path=DIR’
          Add DIR to the front of the module load path.

     ‘-o OFILE’
     ‘--output=OFILE’
          Write output bytecode to OFILE.  By convention, bytecode file
          names end in ‘.go’.  When ‘-o’ is omitted, the output file
          name is as for ‘compile-file’ (see below).

     ‘-x EXTENSION’
          Recognize EXTENSION as a valid source file name extension.

          For example, to compile R6RS code, you might want to pass ‘-x
          .sls’ so that files ending in ‘.sls’ can be found.

     ‘-W WARNING’
     ‘--warn=WARNING’
          Enable specific warning passes; use ‘-Whelp’ for a list of
          available options.  The default is ‘-W1’, which enables a
          number of common warnings.  Pass ‘-W0’ to disable all
          warnings.

     ‘-O OPT’
     ‘--optimize=OPT’
          Enable or disable specific compiler optimizations; use
          ‘-Ohelp’ for a list of available options.  The default is
          ‘-O2’, which enables most optimizations.  ‘-O0’ is recommended
          if compilation speed is more important than the speed of the
          compiled code.  Pass ‘-Ono-OPT’ to disable a specific compiler
          pass.  Any number of ‘-O’ options can be passed to the
          compiler, with later ones taking precedence.

     ‘--r6rs’
     ‘--r7rs’
          Compile in an environment whose default bindings, reader
          options, and load paths are adapted for specific Scheme
          standards.  *Note* R6RS Support::, and *Note* R7RS Support::.

     ‘-f LANG’
     ‘--from=LANG’
          Use LANG as the source language of FILE.  If this option is
          omitted, ‘scheme’ is assumed.

     ‘-t LANG’
     ‘--to=LANG’
          Use LANG as the target language of FILE.  If this option is
          omitted, ‘rtl’ is assumed.

     ‘-T TARGET’
     ‘--target=TARGET’
          Produce code for TARGET instead of %HOST-TYPE (*note*
          %host-type: Build Config.).  Target must be a valid GNU
          triplet, such as ‘armv5tel-unknown-linux-gnueabi’ (*note*
          (autoconf)Specifying Target Triplets::).

     Each FILE is assumed to be UTF-8-encoded, unless it contains a
     coding declaration as recognized by ‘file-encoding’ (*note*
     Character Encoding of Source Files::).

   The compiler can also be invoked directly by Scheme code.  These
interfaces are in their own module:

     (use-modules (system base compile))

 -- Scheme Procedure: compile exp [#:env=#f] [#:from=(current-language)]
          [#:to=value] [#:opts='()]
          [#:optimization-level=(default-optimization-level)]
          [#:warning-level=(default-warning-level)]
     Compile the expression EXP in the environment ENV.  If EXP is a
     procedure, the result will be a compiled procedure; otherwise
     ‘compile’ is mostly equivalent to ‘eval’.

     For a discussion of languages and compiler options, *Note* Compiling
     to the Virtual Machine::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: compile-file file [#:output-file=#f]
          [#:from=(current-language)] [#:to='rtl]
          [#:env=(default-environment from)] [#:opts='()]
          [#:optimization-level=(default-optimization-level)]
          [#:warning-level=(default-warning-level)]
          [#:canonicalization='relative]
     Compile the file named FILE.

     Output will be written to a OUTPUT-FILE.  If you do not supply an
     output file name, output is written to a file in the cache
     directory, as computed by ‘(compiled-file-name FILE)’.

     FROM and TO specify the source and target languages.  *Note*
     Compiling to the Virtual Machine::, for more information on these
     options, and on ENV and OPTS.

     As with ‘guild compile’, FILE is assumed to be UTF-8-encoded unless
     it contains a coding declaration.

 -- Scheme Parameter: default-optimization-level
     The default optimization level, as an integer from 0 to 9.  The
     default is 2.
 -- Scheme Parameter: default-warning-level
     The default warning level, as an integer from 0 to 9.  The default
     is 1.

   *Note* Parameters::, for more on how to set parameters.

 -- Scheme Procedure: compiled-file-name file
     Compute a cached location for a compiled version of a Scheme file
     named FILE.

     This file will usually be below the ‘$HOME/.cache/guile/ccache’
     directory, depending on the value of the ‘XDG_CACHE_HOME’
     environment variable.  The intention is that ‘compiled-file-name’
     provides a fallback location for caching auto-compiled files.  If
     you want to place a compile file in the ‘%load-compiled-path’, you
     should pass the OUTPUT-FILE option to ‘compile-file’, explicitly.

 -- Scheme Variable: %auto-compilation-options
     This variable contains the options passed to the ‘compile-file’
     procedure when auto-compiling source files.  By default, it enables
     useful compilation warnings.  It can be customized from ‘~/.guile’.


File: guile.info,  Node: Loading,  Next: Load Paths,  Prev: Compilation,  Up: Read/Load/Eval/Compile

6.16.7 Loading Scheme Code from File
------------------------------------

 -- Scheme Procedure: load filename [reader]
     Load FILENAME and evaluate its contents in the top-level
     environment.

     READER if provided should be either ‘#f’, or a procedure with the
     signature ‘(lambda (port) ...)’ which reads the next expression
     from PORT.  If READER is ‘#f’ or absent, Guile’s built-in ‘read’
     procedure is used (*note* Scheme Read::).

     The READER argument takes effect by setting the value of the
     ‘current-reader’ fluid (see below) before loading the file, and
     restoring its previous value when loading is complete.  The Scheme
     code inside FILENAME can itself change the current reader procedure
     on the fly by setting ‘current-reader’ fluid.

     If the variable ‘%load-hook’ is defined, it should be bound to a
     procedure that will be called before any code is loaded.  See
     documentation for ‘%load-hook’ later in this section.

 -- Scheme Procedure: load-compiled filename
     Load the compiled file named FILENAME.

     Compiling a source file (*note* Read/Load/Eval/Compile::) and then
     calling ‘load-compiled’ on the resulting file is equivalent to
     calling ‘load’ on the source file.

 -- Scheme Procedure: primitive-load filename
 -- C Function: scm_primitive_load (filename)
     Load the file named FILENAME and evaluate its contents in the
     top-level environment.  FILENAME must either be a full pathname or
     be a pathname relative to the current directory.  If the variable
     ‘%load-hook’ is defined, it should be bound to a procedure that
     will be called before any code is loaded.  See the documentation
     for ‘%load-hook’ later in this section.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_primitive_load (const char *filename)
     ‘scm_primitive_load’, but taking a C string instead of an ‘SCM’.

 -- Variable: current-reader
     ‘current-reader’ holds the read procedure that is currently being
     used by the above loading procedures to read expressions (from the
     file that they are loading).  ‘current-reader’ is a fluid, so it
     has an independent value in each dynamic root and should be read
     and set using ‘fluid-ref’ and ‘fluid-set!’ (*note* Fluids and
     Dynamic States::).

     Changing ‘current-reader’ is typically useful to introduce local
     syntactic changes, such that code following the ‘fluid-set!’ call
     is read using the newly installed reader.  The ‘current-reader’
     change should take place at evaluation time when the code is
     evaluated, or at compilation time when the code is compiled:

          (eval-when (compile eval)
            (fluid-set! current-reader my-own-reader))

     The ‘eval-when’ form above ensures that the ‘current-reader’ change
     occurs at the right time.

 -- Variable: %load-hook
     A procedure to be called ‘(%load-hook FILENAME)’ whenever a file is
     loaded, or ‘#f’ for no such call.  ‘%load-hook’ is used by all of
     the loading functions (‘load’ and ‘primitive-load’, and
     ‘load-from-path’ and ‘primitive-load-path’ documented in the next
     section).

     For example an application can set this to show what’s loaded,

          (set! %load-hook (lambda (filename)
                             (format #t "Loading ~a ...\n" filename)))
          (load-from-path "foo.scm")
          ⊣ Loading /usr/local/share/guile/site/foo.scm ...

 -- Scheme Procedure: current-load-port
 -- C Function: scm_current_load_port ()
     Return the current-load-port.  The load port is used internally by
     ‘primitive-load’.

6.16.8 Load Paths
-----------------

The procedure in the previous section look for Scheme code in the file
system at specific location.  Guile also has some procedures to search
the load path for code.

 -- Variable: %load-path
     List of directories which should be searched for Scheme modules and
     libraries.  When Guile starts up, ‘%load-path’ is initialized to
     the default load path ‘(list (%library-dir) (%site-dir)
     (%global-site-dir) (%package-data-dir))’.  The ‘GUILE_LOAD_PATH’
     environment variable can be used to prepend or append additional
     directories (*note* Environment Variables::).

     *Note* Build Config::, for more on ‘%site-dir’ and related
     procedures.

 -- Scheme Procedure: load-from-path filename
     Similar to ‘load’, but searches for FILENAME in the load paths.
     Preferentially loads a compiled version of the file, if it is
     available and up-to-date.

   A user can extend the load path by calling ‘add-to-load-path’.

 -- Scheme Syntax: add-to-load-path dir
     Add DIR to the load path.

   For example, a script might include this form to add the directory
that it is in to the load path:

     (add-to-load-path (dirname (current-filename)))

   It’s better to use ‘add-to-load-path’ than to modify ‘%load-path’
directly, because ‘add-to-load-path’ takes care of modifying the path
both at compile-time and at run-time.

 -- Scheme Procedure: primitive-load-path filename
          [exception-on-not-found]
 -- C Function: scm_primitive_load_path (filename)
     Search ‘%load-path’ for the file named FILENAME and load it into
     the top-level environment.  If FILENAME is a relative pathname and
     is not found in the list of search paths, an error is signalled.
     Preferentially loads a compiled version of the file, if it is
     available and up-to-date.

     If FILENAME is a relative pathname and is not found in the list of
     search paths, one of three things may happen, depending on the
     optional second argument, EXCEPTION-ON-NOT-FOUND.  If it is ‘#f’,
     ‘#f’ will be returned.  If it is a procedure, it will be called
     with no arguments.  (This allows a distinction to be made between
     exceptions raised by loading a file, and exceptions related to the
     loader itself.)  Otherwise an error is signalled.

     For compatibility with Guile 1.8 and earlier, the C function takes
     only one argument, which can be either a string (the file name) or
     an argument list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: %search-load-path filename
 -- C Function: scm_sys_search_load_path (filename)
     Search ‘%load-path’ for the file named FILENAME, which must be
     readable by the current user.  If FILENAME is found in the list of
     paths to search or is an absolute pathname, return its full
     pathname.  Otherwise, return ‘#f’.  Filenames may have any of the
     optional extensions in the ‘%load-extensions’ list;
     ‘%search-load-path’ will try each extension automatically.

 -- Variable: %load-extensions
     A list of default file extensions for files containing Scheme code.
     ‘%search-load-path’ tries each of these extensions when looking for
     a file to load.  By default, ‘%load-extensions’ is bound to the
     list ‘("" ".scm")’.

   As mentioned above, when Guile searches the ‘%load-path’ for a source
file, it will also search the ‘%load-compiled-path’ for a corresponding
compiled file.  If the compiled file is as new or newer than the source
file, it will be loaded instead of the source file, using
‘load-compiled’.

 -- Variable: %load-compiled-path
     Like ‘%load-path’, but for compiled files.  By default, this path
     has two entries: one for compiled files from Guile itself, and one
     for site packages.  The ‘GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH’ environment
     variable can be used to prepend or append additional directories
     (*note* Environment Variables::).

   When ‘primitive-load-path’ searches the ‘%load-compiled-path’ for a
corresponding compiled file for a relative path it does so by appending
‘.go’ to the relative path.  For example, searching for ‘ice-9/popen’
could find ‘/usr/lib/guile/3.0/ccache/ice-9/popen.go’, and use it
instead of ‘/usr/share/guile/3.0/ice-9/popen.scm’.

   If ‘primitive-load-path’ does not find a corresponding ‘.go’ file in
the ‘%load-compiled-path’, or the ‘.go’ file is out of date, it will
search for a corresponding auto-compiled file in the fallback path,
possibly creating one if one does not exist.

   *Note* Installing Site Packages::, for more on how to correctly
install site packages.  *Note* Modules and the File System::, for more on
the relationship between load paths and modules.  *Note* Compilation::,
for more on the fallback path and auto-compilation.

   Finally, there are a couple of helper procedures for general path
manipulation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: parse-path path [tail]
 -- C Function: scm_parse_path (path, tail)
     Parse PATH, which is expected to be a colon-separated string, into
     a list and return the resulting list with TAIL appended.  If PATH
     is ‘#f’, TAIL is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: parse-path-with-ellipsis path base
 -- C Function: scm_parse_path_with_ellipsis (path, base)
     Parse PATH, which is expected to be a colon-separated string, into
     a list and return the resulting list with BASE (a list) spliced in
     place of the ‘...’ path component, if present, or else BASE is
     added to the end.  If PATH is ‘#f’, BASE is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: search-path path filename [extensions
          [require-exts?]]
 -- C Function: scm_search_path (path, filename, rest)
     Search PATH for a directory containing a file named FILENAME.  The
     file must be readable, and not a directory.  If we find one, return
     its full filename; otherwise, return ‘#f’.  If FILENAME is
     absolute, return it unchanged.  If given, EXTENSIONS is a list of
     strings; for each directory in PATH, we search for FILENAME
     concatenated with each EXTENSION.  If REQUIRE-EXTS? is true,
     require that the returned file name have one of the given
     extensions; if REQUIRE-EXTS? is not given, it defaults to ‘#f’.

     For compatibility with Guile 1.8 and earlier, the C function takes
     only three arguments.


File: guile.info,  Node: Character Encoding of Source Files,  Next: Delayed Evaluation,  Prev: Load Paths,  Up: Read/Load/Eval/Compile

6.16.9 Character Encoding of Source Files
-----------------------------------------

Scheme source code files are usually encoded in ASCII or UTF-8, but the
built-in reader can interpret other character encodings as well.  When
Guile loads Scheme source code, it uses the ‘file-encoding’ procedure
(described below) to try to guess the encoding of the file.  In the
absence of any hints, UTF-8 is assumed.  One way to provide a hint about
the encoding of a source file is to place a coding declaration in the
top 500 characters of the file.

   A coding declaration has the form ‘coding: XXXXXX’, where ‘XXXXXX’ is
the name of a character encoding in which the source code file has been
encoded.  The coding declaration must appear in a scheme comment.  It
can either be a semicolon-initiated comment, or the first block ‘#!’
comment in the file.

   The name of the character encoding in the coding declaration is
typically lower case and containing only letters, numbers, and hyphens,
as recognized by ‘set-port-encoding!’ (*note* ‘set-port-encoding!’:
Ports.).  Common examples of character encoding names are ‘utf-8’ and
‘iso-8859-1’, as defined by IANA
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets).  Thus, the coding
declaration is mostly compatible with Emacs.

   However, there are some differences in encoding names recognized by
Emacs and encoding names defined by IANA, the latter being essentially a
subset of the former.  For instance, ‘latin-1’ is a valid encoding name
for Emacs, but it’s not according to the IANA standard, which Guile
follows; instead, you should use ‘iso-8859-1’, which is both understood
by Emacs and dubbed by IANA (IANA writes it uppercase but Emacs wants it
lowercase and Guile is case insensitive.)

   For source code, only a subset of all possible character encodings
can be interpreted by the built-in source code reader.  Only those
character encodings in which ASCII text appears unmodified can be used.
This includes ‘UTF-8’ and ‘ISO-8859-1’ through ‘ISO-8859-15’.  The
multi-byte character encodings ‘UTF-16’ and ‘UTF-32’ may not be used
because they are not compatible with ASCII.

   There might be a scenario in which one would want to read non-ASCII
code from a port, such as with the function ‘read’, instead of with
‘load’.  If the port’s character encoding is the same as the encoding of
the code to be read by the port, not other special handling is
necessary.  The port will automatically do the character encoding
conversion.  The functions ‘setlocale’ or by ‘set-port-encoding!’ are
used to set port encodings (*note* Ports::).

   If a port is used to read code of unknown character encoding, it can
accomplish this in three steps.  First, the character encoding of the
port should be set to ISO-8859-1 using ‘set-port-encoding!’.  Then, the
procedure ‘file-encoding’, described below, is used to scan for a coding
declaration when reading from the port.  As a side effect, it rewinds
the port after its scan is complete.  After that, the port’s character
encoding should be set to the encoding returned by ‘file-encoding’, if
any, again by using ‘set-port-encoding!’.  Then the code can be read as
normal.

   Alternatively, one can use the ‘#:guess-encoding’ keyword argument of
‘open-file’ and related procedures.  *Note* File Ports::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: file-encoding port
 -- C Function: scm_file_encoding (port)
     Attempt to scan the first few hundred bytes from the PORT for hints
     about its character encoding.  Return a string containing the
     encoding name or ‘#f’ if the encoding cannot be determined.  The
     port is rewound.

     Currently, the only supported method is to look for an Emacs-like
     character coding declaration (*note* how Emacs recognizes file
     encoding: (emacs)Recognize Coding.).  The coding declaration is of
     the form ‘coding: XXXXX’ and must appear in a Scheme comment.
     Additional heuristics may be added in the future.

6.16.10 Delayed Evaluation
--------------------------

Promises are a convenient way to defer a calculation until its result is
actually needed, and to run such a calculation only once.  Also *note*
SRFI-45::.

 -- syntax: delay expr
     Return a promise object which holds the given EXPR expression,
     ready to be evaluated by a later ‘force’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: promise? obj
 -- C Function: scm_promise_p (obj)
     Return true if OBJ is a promise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: force p
 -- C Function: scm_force (p)
     Return the value obtained from evaluating the EXPR in the given
     promise P.  If P has previously been forced then its EXPR is not
     evaluated again, instead the value obtained at that time is simply
     returned.

     During a ‘force’, an EXPR can call ‘force’ again on its own
     promise, resulting in a recursive evaluation of that EXPR.  The
     first evaluation to return gives the value for the promise.  Higher
     evaluations run to completion in the normal way, but their results
     are ignored, ‘force’ always returns the first value.

6.16.11 Local Evaluation
------------------------

Guile includes a facility to capture a lexical environment, and later
evaluate a new expression within that environment.  This code is
implemented in a module.

     (use-modules (ice-9 local-eval))

 -- syntax: the-environment
     Captures and returns a lexical environment for use with
     ‘local-eval’ or ‘local-compile’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: local-eval exp env
 -- C Function: scm_local_eval (exp, env)
 -- Scheme Procedure: local-compile exp env [opts=()]
     Evaluate or compile the expression EXP in the lexical environment
     ENV.

   Here is a simple example, illustrating that it is the variable that
gets captured, not just its value at one point in time.

     (define e (let ((x 100)) (the-environment)))
     (define fetch-x (local-eval '(lambda () x) e))
     (fetch-x)
     ⇒ 100
     (local-eval '(set! x 42) e)
     (fetch-x)
     ⇒ 42

   While EXP is evaluated within the lexical environment of
‘(the-environment)’, it has the dynamic environment of the call to
‘local-eval’.

   ‘local-eval’ and ‘local-compile’ can only evaluate expressions, not
definitions.

     (local-eval '(define foo 42)
                 (let ((x 100)) (the-environment)))
     ⇒ syntax error: definition in expression context

   Note that the current implementation of ‘(the-environment)’ only
captures “normal” lexical bindings, and pattern variables bound by
‘syntax-case’.  It does not currently capture local syntax transformers
bound by ‘let-syntax’, ‘letrec-syntax’ or non-top-level ‘define-syntax’
forms.  Any attempt to reference such captured syntactic keywords via
‘local-eval’ or ‘local-compile’ produces an error.

6.16.12 Local Inclusion
-----------------------

This section has discussed various means of linking Scheme code
together: fundamentally, loading up files at run-time using ‘load’ and
‘load-compiled’.  Guile provides another option to compose parts of
programs together at expansion-time instead of at run-time.

 -- Scheme Syntax: include file-name
     Open FILE-NAME, at expansion-time, and read the Scheme forms that
     it contains, splicing them into the location of the ‘include’,
     within a ‘begin’.

     If FILE-NAME is a relative path, it is searched for relative to the
     path that contains the file that the ‘include’ form appears in.

   If you are a C programmer, if ‘load’ in Scheme is like ‘dlopen’ in C,
consider ‘include’ to be like the C preprocessor’s ‘#include’.  When you
use ‘include’, it is as if the contents of the included file were typed
in instead of the ‘include’ form.

   Because the code is included at compile-time, it is available to the
macroexpander.  Syntax definitions in the included file are available to
later code in the form in which the ‘include’ appears, without the need
for ‘eval-when’.  (*Note* Eval When::.)

   For the same reason, compiling a form that uses ‘include’ results in
one compilation unit, composed of multiple files.  Loading the compiled
file is one ‘stat’ operation for the compilation unit, instead of ‘2*N’
in the case of ‘load’ (once for each loaded source file, and once each
corresponding compiled file, in the best case).

   Unlike ‘load’, ‘include’ also works within nested lexical contexts.
It so happens that the optimizer works best within a lexical context,
because all of the uses of bindings in a lexical context are visible, so
composing files by including them within a ‘(let () ...)’ can sometimes
lead to important speed improvements.

   On the other hand, ‘include’ does have all the disadvantages of early
binding: once the code with the ‘include’ is compiled, no change to the
included file is reflected in the future behavior of the including form.

   Also, the particular form of ‘include’, which requires an absolute
path, or a path relative to the current directory at compile-time, is
not very amenable to compiling the source in one place, but then
installing the source to another place.  For this reason, Guile provides
another form, ‘include-from-path’, which looks for the source file to
include within a load path.

 -- Scheme Syntax: include-from-path file-name
     Like ‘include’, but instead of expecting ‘file-name’ to be an
     absolute file name, it is expected to be a relative path to search
     in the ‘%load-path’.

   ‘include-from-path’ is more useful when you want to install all of
the source files for a package (as you should!).  It makes it possible
to evaluate an installed file from source, instead of relying on the
‘.go’ file being up to date.


File: guile.info,  Node: Sandboxed Evaluation,  Next: REPL Servers,  Prev: Local Inclusion,  Up: Read/Load/Eval/Compile

6.16.13 Sandboxed Evaluation
----------------------------

Sometimes you would like to evaluate code that comes from an untrusted
party.  The safest way to do this is to buy a new computer, evaluate the
code on that computer, then throw the machine away.  However if you are
unwilling to take this simple approach, Guile does include a limited
“sandbox” facility that can allow untrusted code to be evaluated with
some confidence.

   To use the sandboxed evaluator, load its module:

     (use-modules (ice-9 sandbox))

   Guile’s sandboxing facility starts with the ability to restrict the
time and space used by a piece of code.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-time-limit limit thunk limit-reached
     Call THUNK, but cancel it if LIMIT seconds of wall-clock time have
     elapsed.  If the computation is cancelled, call LIMIT-REACHED in
     tail position.  THUNK must not disable interrupts or prevent an
     abort via a ‘dynamic-wind’ unwind handler.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-allocation-limit limit thunk
          limit-reached
     Call THUNK, but cancel it if LIMIT bytes have been allocated.  If
     the computation is cancelled, call LIMIT-REACHED in tail position.
     THUNK must not disable interrupts or prevent an abort via a
     ‘dynamic-wind’ unwind handler.

     This limit applies to both stack and heap allocation.  The
     computation will not be aborted before LIMIT bytes have been
     allocated, but for the heap allocation limit, the check may be
     postponed until the next garbage collection.

     Note that as a current shortcoming, the heap size limit applies to
     all threads; concurrent allocation by other unrelated threads
     counts towards the allocation limit.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-time-and-allocation-limits time-limit
          allocation-limit thunk
     Invoke THUNK in a dynamic extent in which its execution is limited
     to TIME-LIMIT seconds of wall-clock time, and its allocation to
     ALLOCATION-LIMIT bytes.  THUNK must not disable interrupts or
     prevent an abort via a ‘dynamic-wind’ unwind handler.

     If successful, return all values produced by invoking THUNK.  Any
     uncaught exception thrown by the thunk will propagate out.  If the
     time or allocation limit is exceeded, an exception will be thrown
     to the ‘limit-exceeded’ key.

   The time limit and stack limit are both very precise, but the heap
limit only gets checked asynchronously, after a garbage collection.  In
particular, if the heap is already very large, the number of allocated
bytes between garbage collections will be large, and therefore the
precision of the check is reduced.

   Additionally, due to the mechanism used by the allocation limit (the
‘after-gc-hook’), large single allocations like ‘(make-vector #e1e7)’
are only detected after the allocation completes, even if the allocation
itself causes garbage collection.  It’s possible therefore for user code
to not only exceed the allocation limit set, but also to exhaust all
available memory, causing out-of-memory conditions at any allocation
site.  Failure to allocate memory in Guile itself should be safe and
cause an exception to be thrown, but most systems are not designed to
handle ‘malloc’ failures.  An allocation failure may therefore exercise
unexpected code paths in your system, so it is a weakness of the sandbox
(and therefore an interesting point of attack).

   The main sandbox interface is ‘eval-in-sandbox’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: eval-in-sandbox exp [#:time-limit 0.1]
          [#:allocation-limit #e10e6] [#:bindings all-pure-bindings]
          [#:module (make-sandbox-module bindings)] [#:sever-module? #t]
     Evaluate the Scheme expression EXP within an isolated "sandbox".
     Limit its execution to TIME-LIMIT seconds of wall-clock time, and
     limit its allocation to ALLOCATION-LIMIT bytes.

     The evaluation will occur in MODULE, which defaults to the result
     of calling ‘make-sandbox-module’ on BINDINGS, which itself defaults
     to ‘all-pure-bindings’.  This is the core of the sandbox: creating
     a scope for the expression that is “safe”.

     A safe sandbox module has two characteristics.  Firstly, it will
     not allow the expression being evaluated to avoid being cancelled
     due to time or allocation limits.  This ensures that the expression
     terminates in a timely fashion.

     Secondly, a safe sandbox module will prevent the evaluation from
     receiving information from previous evaluations, or from affecting
     future evaluations.  All combinations of binding sets exported by
     ‘(ice-9 sandbox)’ form safe sandbox modules.

     The BINDINGS should be given as a list of import sets.  One import
     set is a list whose car names an interface, like ‘(ice-9 q)’, and
     whose cdr is a list of imports.  An import is either a bare symbol
     or a pair of ‘(OUT . IN)’, where OUT and IN are both symbols and
     denote the name under which a binding is exported from the module,
     and the name under which to make the binding available,
     respectively.  Note that BINDINGS is only used as an input to the
     default initializer for the MODULE argument; if you pass
     ‘#:module’, BINDINGS is unused.  If SEVER-MODULE? is true (the
     default), the module will be unlinked from the global module tree
     after the evaluation returns, to allow MOD to be garbage-collected.

     If successful, return all values produced by EXP.  Any uncaught
     exception thrown by the expression will propagate out.  If the time
     or allocation limit is exceeded, an exception will be thrown to the
     ‘limit-exceeded’ key.

   Constructing a safe sandbox module is tricky in general.  Guile
defines an easy way to construct safe modules from predefined sets of
bindings.  Before getting to that interface, here are some general notes
on safety.

  1. The time and allocation limits rely on the ability to interrupt and
     cancel a computation.  For this reason, no binding included in a
     sandbox module should be able to indefinitely postpone interrupt
     handling, nor should a binding be able to prevent an abort.  In
     practice this second consideration means that ‘dynamic-wind’ should
     not be included in any binding set.
  2. The time and allocation limits apply only to the ‘eval-in-sandbox’
     call.  If the call returns a procedure which is later called, no
     limit is “automatically” in place.  Users of ‘eval-in-sandbox’ have
     to be very careful to reimpose limits when calling procedures that
     escape from sandboxes.
  3. Similarly, the dynamic environment of the ‘eval-in-sandbox’ call is
     not necessarily in place when any procedure that escapes from the
     sandbox is later called.

     This detail prevents us from exposing ‘primitive-eval’ to the
     sandbox, for two reasons.  The first is that it’s possible for
     legacy code to forge references to any binding, if the
     ‘allow-legacy-syntax-objects?’ parameter is true.  The default for
     this parameter is true; *note* Syntax Transformer Helpers:: for the
     details.  The parameter is bound to ‘#f’ for the duration of the
     ‘eval-in-sandbox’ call itself, but that will not be in place during
     calls to escaped procedures.

     The second reason we don’t expose ‘primitive-eval’ is that
     ‘primitive-eval’ implicitly works in the current module, which for
     an escaped procedure will probably be different than the module
     that is current for the ‘eval-in-sandbox’ call itself.

     The common denominator here is that if an interface exposed to the
     sandbox relies on dynamic environments, it is easy to mistakenly
     grant the sandboxed procedure additional capabilities in the form
     of bindings that it should not have access to.  For this reason,
     the default sets of predefined bindings do not depend on any
     dynamically scoped value.
  4. Mutation may allow a sandboxed evaluation to break some invariant
     in users of data supplied to it.  A lot of code culturally doesn’t
     expect mutation, but if you hand mutable data to a sandboxed
     evaluation and you also grant mutating capabilities to that
     evaluation, then the sandboxed code may indeed mutate that data.
     The default set of bindings to the sandbox do not include any
     mutating primitives.

     Relatedly, ‘set!’ may allow a sandbox to mutate a primitive,
     invalidating many system-wide invariants.  Guile is currently quite
     permissive when it comes to imported bindings and mutability.
     Although ‘set!’ to a module-local or lexically bound variable would
     be fine, we don’t currently have an easy way to disallow ‘set!’ to
     an imported binding, so currently no binding set includes ‘set!’.
  5. Mutation may allow a sandboxed evaluation to keep state, or make a
     communication mechanism with other code.  On the one hand this
     sounds cool, but on the other hand maybe this is part of your
     threat model.  Again, the default set of bindings doesn’t include
     mutating primitives, preventing sandboxed evaluations from keeping
     state.
  6. The sandbox should probably not be able to open a network
     connection, or write to a file, or open a file from disk.  The
     default binding set includes no interaction with the operating
     system.

   If you, dear reader, find the above discussion interesting, you will
enjoy Jonathan Rees’ dissertation, “A Security Kernel Based on the
Lambda Calculus”.

 -- Scheme Variable: all-pure-bindings
     All “pure” bindings that together form a safe subset of those
     bindings available by default to Guile user code.

 -- Scheme Variable: all-pure-and-impure-bindings
     Like ‘all-pure-bindings’, but additionally including mutating
     primitives like ‘vector-set!’.  This set is still safe in the sense
     mentioned above, with the caveats about mutation.

   The components of these composite sets are as follows:
 -- Scheme Variable: alist-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: array-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: bit-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: bitvector-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: char-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: char-set-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: clock-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: core-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: error-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: fluid-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: hash-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: iteration-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: keyword-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: list-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: macro-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: nil-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: number-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: pair-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: predicate-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: procedure-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: promise-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: prompt-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: regexp-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: sort-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: srfi-4-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: string-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: symbol-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: unspecified-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: variable-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: vector-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: version-bindings
     The components of ‘all-pure-bindings’.

 -- Scheme Variable: mutating-alist-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: mutating-array-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: mutating-bitvector-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: mutating-fluid-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: mutating-hash-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: mutating-list-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: mutating-pair-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: mutating-sort-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: mutating-srfi-4-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: mutating-string-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: mutating-variable-bindings
 -- Scheme Variable: mutating-vector-bindings
     The additional components of ‘all-pure-and-impure-bindings’.

   Finally, what do you do with a binding set?  What is a binding set
anyway?  ‘make-sandbox-module’ is here for you.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-sandbox-module bindings
     Return a fresh module that only contains BINDINGS.

     The BINDINGS should be given as a list of import sets.  One import
     set is a list whose car names an interface, like ‘(ice-9 q)’, and
     whose cdr is a list of imports.  An import is either a bare symbol
     or a pair of ‘(OUT . IN)’, where OUT and IN are both symbols and
     denote the name under which a binding is exported from the module,
     and the name under which to make the binding available,
     respectively.

   So you see that binding sets are just lists, and
‘all-pure-and-impure-bindings’ is really just the result of appending
all of the component binding sets.

6.16.14 REPL Servers
--------------------

The procedures in this section are provided by
     (use-modules (system repl server))

   When an application is written in Guile, it is often convenient to
allow the user to be able to interact with it by evaluating Scheme
expressions in a REPL.

   The procedures of this module allow you to spawn a “REPL server”,
which permits interaction over a local or TCP connection.  Guile itself
uses them internally to implement the ‘--listen’ switch, *note*
Command-line Options::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-tcp-server-socket [#:host=#f] [#:addr]
          [#:port=37146]
     Return a stream socket bound to a given address ADDR and port
     number PORT.  If the HOST is given, and ADDR is not, then the HOST
     string is converted to an address.  If neither is given, we use the
     loopback address.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-unix-domain-server-socket
          [#:path="/tmp/guile-socket"]
     Return a UNIX domain socket, bound to a given PATH.

 -- Scheme Procedure: run-server [server-socket]
 -- Scheme Procedure: spawn-server [server-socket]
     Create and run a REPL, making it available over the given
     SERVER-SOCKET.  If SERVER-SOCKET is not provided, it defaults to
     the socket created by calling ‘make-tcp-server-socket’ with no
     arguments.

     ‘run-server’ runs the server in the current thread, whereas
     ‘spawn-server’ runs the server in a new thread.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stop-server-and-clients!
     Closes the connection on all running server sockets.

     Please note that in the current implementation, the REPL threads
     are cancelled without unwinding their stacks.  If any of them are
     holding mutexes or are within a critical section, the results are
     unspecified.


File: guile.info,  Node: Cooperative REPL Servers,  Prev: REPL Servers,  Up: Read/Load/Eval/Compile

6.16.15 Cooperative REPL Servers
--------------------------------

The procedures in this section are provided by
     (use-modules (system repl coop-server))

   Whereas ordinary REPL servers run in their own threads (*note* REPL
Servers::), sometimes it is more convenient to provide REPLs that run at
specified times within an existing thread, for example in programs
utilizing an event loop or in single-threaded programs.  This allows for
safe access and mutation of a program’s data structures from the REPL,
without concern for thread synchronization.

   Although the REPLs are run in the thread that calls
‘spawn-coop-repl-server’ and ‘poll-coop-repl-server’, dedicated threads
are spawned so that the calling thread is not blocked.  The spawned
threads read input for the REPLs and to listen for new connections.

   Cooperative REPL servers must be polled periodically to evaluate any
pending expressions by calling ‘poll-coop-repl-server’ with the object
returned from ‘spawn-coop-repl-server’.  The thread that calls
‘poll-coop-repl-server’ will be blocked for as long as the expression
takes to be evaluated or if the debugger is entered.

 -- Scheme Procedure: spawn-coop-repl-server [server-socket]
     Create and return a new cooperative REPL server object, and spawn a
     new thread to listen for connections on SERVER-SOCKET.  Proper
     functioning of the REPL server requires that
     ‘poll-coop-repl-server’ be called periodically on the returned
     server object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: poll-coop-repl-server coop-server
     Poll the cooperative REPL server COOP-SERVER and apply a pending
     operation if there is one, such as evaluating an expression typed
     at the REPL prompt.  This procedure must be called from the same
     thread that called ‘spawn-coop-repl-server’.

6.17 Memory Management and Garbage Collection
=============================================

Guile uses a _garbage collector_ to manage most of its objects.  While
the garbage collector is designed to be mostly invisible, you sometimes
need to interact with it explicitly.

   See *note* Garbage Collection:: for a general discussion of how
garbage collection relates to using Guile from C.

* Menu:

* Garbage Collection Functions::
* Memory Blocks::
* Weak References::
* Guardians::


File: guile.info,  Node: Garbage Collection Functions,  Next: Memory Blocks,  Up: Memory Management

6.17.1 Function related to Garbage Collection
---------------------------------------------

 -- Scheme Procedure: gc
 -- C Function: scm_gc ()
     Finds all of the “live” ‘SCM’ objects and reclaims for further use
     those that are no longer accessible.  You normally don’t need to
     call this function explicitly.  Its functionality is invoked
     automatically as needed.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_gc_protect_object (SCM OBJ)
     Protects OBJ from being freed by the garbage collector, when it
     otherwise might be.  When you are done with the object, call
     ‘scm_gc_unprotect_object’ on the object.  Calls to
     ‘scm_gc_protect_object’/‘scm_gc_unprotect_object’ can be nested,
     and the object remains protected until it has been unprotected as
     many times as it was protected.  It is an error to unprotect an
     object more times than it has been protected.  Returns the SCM
     object it was passed.

     Note that storing OBJ in a C global variable has the same
     effect(1).

 -- C Function: SCM scm_gc_unprotect_object (SCM OBJ)

     Unprotects an object from the garbage collector which was protected
     by ‘scm_gc_unprotect_object’.  Returns the SCM object it was
     passed.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_permanent_object (SCM OBJ)

     Similar to ‘scm_gc_protect_object’ in that it causes the collector
     to always mark the object, except that it should not be nested
     (only call ‘scm_permanent_object’ on an object once), and it has no
     corresponding unpermanent function.  Once an object is declared
     permanent, it will never be freed.  Returns the SCM object it was
     passed.

 -- C Macro: void scm_remember_upto_here_1 (SCM obj)
 -- C Macro: void scm_remember_upto_here_2 (SCM obj1, SCM obj2)
     Create a reference to the given object or objects, so they’re
     certain to be present on the stack or in a register and hence will
     not be freed by the garbage collector before this point.

     Note that these functions can only be applied to ordinary C local
     variables (ie. “automatics”).  Objects held in global or static
     variables or some malloced block or the like cannot be protected
     with this mechanism.

 -- Scheme Procedure: gc-stats
 -- C Function: scm_gc_stats ()
     Return an association list of statistics about Guile’s current use
     of storage.

 -- Scheme Procedure: gc-live-object-stats
 -- C Function: scm_gc_live_object_stats ()
     Return an alist of statistics of the current live objects.

 -- Function: void scm_gc_mark (SCM X)
     Mark the object X, and recurse on any objects X refers to.  If X’s
     mark bit is already set, return immediately.  This function must
     only be called during the mark-phase of garbage collection,
     typically from a smob _mark_ function.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In Guile up to version 1.8, C global variables were not visited
by the garbage collector in the mark phase; hence,
‘scm_gc_protect_object’ was the only way in C to prevent a Scheme object
from being freed.

6.17.2 Memory Blocks
--------------------

In C programs, dynamic management of memory blocks is normally done with
the functions malloc, realloc, and free.  Guile has additional functions
for dynamic memory allocation that are integrated into the garbage
collector and the error reporting system.

   Memory blocks that are associated with Scheme objects (for example a
foreign object) should be allocated with ‘scm_gc_malloc’ or
‘scm_gc_malloc_pointerless’.  These two functions will either return a
valid pointer or signal an error.  Memory blocks allocated this way may
be released explicitly; however, this is not strictly needed, and we
recommend _not_ calling ‘scm_gc_free’.  All memory allocated with
‘scm_gc_malloc’ or ‘scm_gc_malloc_pointerless’ is automatically
reclaimed when the garbage collector no longer sees any live reference
to it(1).

   When garbage collection occurs, Guile will visit the words in memory
allocated with ‘scm_gc_malloc’, looking for live pointers.  This means
that if ‘scm_gc_malloc’-allocated memory contains a pointer to some
other part of the memory, the garbage collector notices it and prevents
it from being reclaimed(2).  Conversely, memory allocated with
‘scm_gc_malloc_pointerless’ is assumed to be “pointer-less” and is not
scanned for pointers.

   For memory that is not associated with a Scheme object, you can use
‘scm_malloc’ instead of ‘malloc’.  Like ‘scm_gc_malloc’, it will either
return a valid pointer or signal an error.  However, it will not assume
that the new memory block can be freed by a garbage collection.  The
memory must be explicitly freed with ‘free’.

   There is also ‘scm_gc_realloc’ and ‘scm_realloc’, to be used in place
of ‘realloc’ when appropriate, and ‘scm_gc_calloc’ and ‘scm_calloc’, to
be used in place of ‘calloc’ when appropriate.

   The function ‘scm_dynwind_free’ can be useful when memory should be
freed with libc’s ‘free’ when leaving a dynwind context, *Note* Dynamic
Wind::.

 -- C Function: void * scm_malloc (size_t SIZE)
 -- C Function: void * scm_calloc (size_t SIZE)
     Allocate SIZE bytes of memory and return a pointer to it.  When
     SIZE is 0, return ‘NULL’.  When not enough memory is available,
     signal an error.  This function runs the GC to free up some memory
     when it deems it appropriate.

     The memory is allocated by the libc ‘malloc’ function and can be
     freed with ‘free’.  There is no ‘scm_free’ function to go with
     ‘scm_malloc’ to make it easier to pass memory back and forth
     between different modules.

     The function ‘scm_calloc’ is similar to ‘scm_malloc’, but
     initializes the block of memory to zero as well.

     These functions will (indirectly) call
     ‘scm_gc_register_allocation’.

 -- C Function: void * scm_realloc (void *MEM, size_t NEW_SIZE)
     Change the size of the memory block at MEM to NEW_SIZE and return
     its new location.  When NEW_SIZE is 0, this is the same as calling
     ‘free’ on MEM and ‘NULL’ is returned.  When MEM is ‘NULL’, this
     function behaves like ‘scm_malloc’ and allocates a new block of
     size NEW_SIZE.

     When not enough memory is available, signal an error.  This
     function runs the GC to free up some memory when it deems it
     appropriate.

     This function will call ‘scm_gc_register_allocation’.

 -- C Function: void * scm_gc_malloc (size_t SIZE, const char *WHAT)
 -- C Function: void * scm_gc_malloc_pointerless (size_t SIZE, const
          char *WHAT)
 -- C Function: void * scm_gc_realloc (void *MEM, size_t OLD_SIZE,
          size_t NEW_SIZE, const char *WHAT);
 -- C Function: void * scm_gc_calloc (size_t SIZE, const char *WHAT)
     Allocate SIZE bytes of automatically-managed memory.  The memory is
     automatically freed when no longer referenced from any live memory
     block.

     When garbage collection occurs, Guile will visit the words in
     memory allocated with ‘scm_gc_malloc’ or ‘scm_gc_calloc’, looking
     for pointers to other memory allocations that are managed by the
     GC. In contrast, memory allocated by ‘scm_gc_malloc_pointerless’ is
     not scanned for pointers.

     The ‘scm_gc_realloc’ call preserves the “pointerlessness” of the
     memory area pointed to by MEM.  Note that you need to pass the old
     size of a reallocated memory block as well.  See below for a
     motivation.

 -- C Function: void scm_gc_free (void *MEM, size_t SIZE, const char
          *WHAT)
     Explicitly free the memory block pointed to by MEM, which was
     previously allocated by one of the above ‘scm_gc’ functions.  This
     function is almost always unnecessary, except for codebases that
     still need to compile on Guile 1.8.

     Note that you need to explicitly pass the SIZE parameter.  This is
     done since it should normally be easy to provide this parameter
     (for memory that is associated with GC controlled objects) and help
     keep the memory management overhead very low.  However, in Guile
     2.x, SIZE is always ignored.

 -- C Function: void scm_gc_register_allocation (size_t SIZE)
     Informs the garbage collector that SIZE bytes have been allocated,
     which the collector would otherwise not have known about.

     In general, Scheme will decide to collect garbage only after some
     amount of memory has been allocated.  Calling this function will
     make the Scheme garbage collector know about more allocation, and
     thus run more often (as appropriate).

     It is especially important to call this function when large
     unmanaged allocations, like images, may be freed by small Scheme
     allocations, like foreign objects.

 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_free (void *mem)
     Equivalent to ‘scm_dynwind_unwind_handler (free, MEM,
     SCM_F_WIND_EXPLICITLY)’.  That is, the memory block at MEM will be
     freed (using ‘free’ from the C library) when the current dynwind is
     left.

 -- Scheme Procedure: malloc-stats
     Return an alist ((WHAT .  N) ...)  describing number of malloced
     objects.  WHAT is the second argument to ‘scm_gc_malloc’, N is the
     number of objects of that type currently allocated.

     This function is only available if the ‘GUILE_DEBUG_MALLOC’
     preprocessor macro was defined when Guile was compiled.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In Guile up to version 1.8, memory allocated with ‘scm_gc_malloc’
_had_ to be freed with ‘scm_gc_free’.

   (2) In Guile up to 1.8, memory allocated with ‘scm_gc_malloc’ was
_not_ visited by the collector in the mark phase.  Consequently, the GC
had to be told explicitly about pointers to live objects contained in
the memory block, e.g., via SMOB mark functions (*note*
‘scm_set_smob_mark’: Smobs.)

6.17.3 Weak References
----------------------

[FIXME: This chapter is based on Mikael Djurfeldt’s answer to a question
by Michael Livshin.  Any mistakes are not theirs, of course.  ]

   Weak references let you attach bookkeeping information to data so
that the additional information automatically disappears when the
original data is no longer in use and gets garbage collected.  In a weak
key hash, the hash entry for that key disappears as soon as the key is
no longer referenced from anywhere else.  For weak value hashes, the
same happens as soon as the value is no longer in use.  Entries in a
doubly weak hash disappear when either the key or the value are not used
anywhere else anymore.

   Object properties offer the same kind of functionality as weak key
hashes in many situations.  (*note* Object Properties::)

   Here’s an example (a little bit strained perhaps, but one of the
examples is actually used in Guile):

   Assume that you’re implementing a debugging system where you want to
associate information about filename and position of source code
expressions with the expressions themselves.

   Hashtables can be used for that, but if you use ordinary hash tables
it will be impossible for the scheme interpreter to "forget" old source
when, for example, a file is reloaded.

   To implement the mapping from source code expressions to positional
information it is necessary to use weak-key tables since we don’t want
the expressions to be remembered just because they are in our table.

   To implement a mapping from source file line numbers to source code
expressions you would use a weak-value table.

   To implement a mapping from source code expressions to the procedures
they constitute a doubly-weak table has to be used.

* Weak hash tables::

 -- C Function: scm_make_weak_key_hash_table (size)
 -- C Function: scm_make_weak_value_hash_table (size)
 -- C Function: scm_make_doubly_weak_hash_table (size)
     Return a weak hash table with SIZE buckets.  As with any hash
     table, choosing a good size for the table requires some caution.

     You can modify weak hash tables in exactly the same way you would
     modify regular hash tables, with the exception of the routines that
     act on handles.  Weak tables have a different implementation behind
     the scenes that doesn’t have handles.  *note* Hash Tables::, for
     more on ‘hashq-ref’ et al.

   Note that in a weak-key hash table, the reference to the value is
strong.  This means that if the value references the key, even
indirectly, the key will never be collected, which can lead to a memory
leak.  The reverse is true for weak value tables.

6.17.4 Guardians
----------------

Guardians provide a way to be notified about objects that would
otherwise be collected as garbage.  Guarding them prevents the objects
from being collected and cleanup actions can be performed on them, for
example.

   See R. Kent Dybvig, Carl Bruggeman, and David Eby (1993) "Guardians
in a Generation-Based Garbage Collector".  ACM SIGPLAN Conference on
Programming Language Design and Implementation, June 1993.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-guardian
 -- C Function: scm_make_guardian ()
     Create a new guardian.  A guardian protects a set of objects from
     garbage collection, allowing a program to apply cleanup or other
     actions.

     ‘make-guardian’ returns a procedure representing the guardian.
     Calling the guardian procedure with an argument adds the argument
     to the guardian’s set of protected objects.  Calling the guardian
     procedure without an argument returns one of the protected objects
     which are ready for garbage collection, or ‘#f’ if no such object
     is available.  Objects which are returned in this way are removed
     from the guardian.

     You can put a single object into a guardian more than once and you
     can put a single object into more than one guardian.  The object
     will then be returned multiple times by the guardian procedures.

     An object is eligible to be returned from a guardian when it is no
     longer referenced from outside any guardian.

     There is no guarantee about the order in which objects are returned
     from a guardian.  If you want to impose an order on finalization
     actions, for example, you can do that by keeping objects alive in
     some global data structure until they are no longer needed for
     finalizing other objects.

     Being an element in a weak vector, a key in a hash table with weak
     keys, or a value in a hash table with weak values does not prevent
     an object from being returned by a guardian.  But as long as an
     object can be returned from a guardian it will not be removed from
     such a weak vector or hash table.  In other words, a weak link does
     not prevent an object from being considered collectable, but being
     inside a guardian prevents a weak link from being broken.

     A key in a weak key hash table can be thought of as having a strong
     reference to its associated value as long as the key is accessible.
     Consequently, when the key is only accessible from within a
     guardian, the reference from the key to the value is also
     considered to be coming from within a guardian.  Thus, if there is
     no other reference to the value, it is eligible to be returned from
     a guardian.

6.18 Modules
============

When programs become large, naming conflicts can occur when a function
or global variable defined in one file has the same name as a function
or global variable in another file.  Even just a _similarity_ between
function names can cause hard-to-find bugs, since a programmer might
type the wrong function name.

   The approach used to tackle this problem is called _information
encapsulation_, which consists of packaging functional units into a
given name space that is clearly separated from other name spaces.

   The language features that allow this are usually called _the module
system_ because programs are broken up into modules that are compiled
separately (or loaded separately in an interpreter).

   Older languages, like C, have limited support for name space
manipulation and protection.  In C a variable or function is public by
default, and can be made local to a module with the ‘static’ keyword.
But you cannot reference public variables and functions from another
module with different names.

   More advanced module systems have become a common feature in recently
designed languages: ML, Python, Perl, and Modula 3 all allow the
_renaming_ of objects from a foreign module, so they will not clutter
the global name space.

   In addition, Guile offers variables as first-class objects.  They can
be used for interacting with the module system.

6.18.1 General Information about Modules
----------------------------------------

A Guile module can be thought of as a collection of named procedures,
variables and macros.  More precisely, it is a set of “bindings” of
symbols (names) to Scheme objects.

   Within a module, all bindings are visible.  Certain bindings can be
declared “public”, in which case they are added to the module’s
so-called “export list”; this set of public bindings is called the
module’s “public interface” (*note* Creating Guile Modules::).

   A client module “uses” a providing module’s bindings by either
accessing the providing module’s public interface, or by building a
custom interface (and then accessing that).  In a custom interface, the
client module can “select” which bindings to access and can also
algorithmically “rename” bindings.  In contrast, when using the
providing module’s public interface, the entire export list is available
without renaming (*note* Using Guile Modules::).

   All Guile modules have a unique “module name”, for example ‘(ice-9
popen)’ or ‘(srfi srfi-11)’.  Module names are lists of one or more
symbols.

   When Guile goes to use an interface from a module, for example
‘(ice-9 popen)’, Guile first looks to see if it has loaded ‘(ice-9
popen)’ for any reason.  If the module has not been loaded yet, Guile
searches a “load path” for a file that might define it, and loads that
file.

   The following subsections go into more detail on using, creating,
installing, and otherwise manipulating modules and the module system.


File: guile.info,  Node: Using Guile Modules,  Next: Creating Guile Modules,  Prev: General Information about Modules,  Up: Modules

6.18.2 Using Guile Modules
--------------------------

To use a Guile module is to access either its public interface or a
custom interface (*note* General Information about Modules::).  Both
types of access are handled by the syntactic form ‘use-modules’, which
accepts one or more interface specifications and, upon evaluation,
arranges for those interfaces to be available to the current module.
This process may include locating and loading code for a given module if
that code has not yet been loaded, following ‘%load-path’ (*note* Modules
and the File System::).

   An “interface specification” has one of two forms.  The first
variation is simply to name the module, in which case its public
interface is the one accessed.  For example:

     (use-modules (ice-9 popen))

   Here, the interface specification is ‘(ice-9 popen)’, and the result
is that the current module now has access to ‘open-pipe’, ‘close-pipe’,
‘open-input-pipe’, and so on (*note* Pipes::).

   Note in the previous example that if the current module had already
defined ‘open-pipe’, that definition would be overwritten by the
definition in ‘(ice-9 popen)’.  For this reason (and others), there is a
second variation of interface specification that not only names a module
to be accessed, but also selects bindings from it and renames them to
suit the current module’s needs.  For example:

     (use-modules ((ice-9 popen)
                   #:select ((open-pipe . pipe-open) close-pipe)
                   #:renamer (symbol-prefix-proc 'unixy:)))

or more simply:

     (use-modules ((ice-9 popen)
                   #:select ((open-pipe . pipe-open) close-pipe)
                   #:prefix unixy:))

   Here, the interface specification is more complex than before, and
the result is that a custom interface with only two bindings is created
and subsequently accessed by the current module.  The mapping of old to
new names is as follows:

     (ice-9 popen) sees:             current module sees:
     open-pipe                       unixy:pipe-open
     close-pipe                      unixy:close-pipe

   This example also shows how to use the convenience procedure
‘symbol-prefix-proc’.

   You can also directly refer to bindings in a module by using the ‘@’
syntax.  For example, instead of using the ‘use-modules’ statement from
above and writing ‘unixy:pipe-open’ to refer to the ‘pipe-open’ from the
‘(ice-9 popen)’, you could also write ‘(@ (ice-9 popen) open-pipe)’.
Thus an alternative to the complete ‘use-modules’ statement would be

     (define unixy:pipe-open (@ (ice-9 popen) open-pipe))
     (define unixy:close-pipe (@ (ice-9 popen) close-pipe))

   There is also ‘@@’, which can be used like ‘@’, but does not check
whether the variable that is being accessed is actually exported.  Thus,
‘@@’ can be thought of as the impolite version of ‘@’ and should only be
used as a last resort or for debugging, for example.

   Note that just as with a ‘use-modules’ statement, any module that has
not yet been loaded will be loaded when referenced by a ‘@’ or ‘@@’
form.

   You can also use the ‘@’ and ‘@@’ syntaxes as the target of a ‘set!’
when the binding refers to a variable.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-prefix-proc prefix-sym
     Return a procedure that prefixes its arg (a symbol) with
     PREFIX-SYM.

 -- syntax: use-modules spec ...
     Resolve each interface specification SPEC into an interface and
     arrange for these to be accessible by the current module.  The
     return value is unspecified.

     SPEC can be a list of symbols, in which case it names a module
     whose public interface is found and used.

     SPEC can also be of the form:

           (MODULE-NAME [#:select SELECTION]
                        [#:prefix PREFIX]
                        [#:renamer RENAMER])

     in which case a custom interface is newly created and used.
     MODULE-NAME is a list of symbols, as above; SELECTION is a list of
     selection-specs; PREFIX is a symbol that is prepended to imported
     names; and RENAMER is a procedure that takes a symbol and returns
     its new name.  A selection-spec is either a symbol or a pair of
     symbols ‘(ORIG . SEEN)’, where ORIG is the name in the used module
     and SEEN is the name in the using module.  Note that SEEN is also
     modified by PREFIX and RENAMER.

     The ‘#:select’, ‘#:prefix’, and ‘#:renamer’ clauses are optional.
     If all are omitted, the returned interface has no bindings.  If the
     ‘#:select’ clause is omitted, PREFIX and RENAMER operate on the
     used module’s public interface.

     In addition to the above, SPEC can also include a ‘#:version’
     clause, of the form:

           #:version VERSION-SPEC

     where VERSION-SPEC is an R6RS-compatible version reference.  An
     error will be signaled in the case in which a module with the same
     name has already been loaded, if that module specifies a version
     and that version is not compatible with VERSION-SPEC.  *Note* R6RS
     Version References::, for more on version references.

     If the module name is not resolvable, ‘use-modules’ will signal an
     error.

 -- syntax: @ module-name binding-name
     Refer to the binding named BINDING-NAME in module MODULE-NAME.  The
     binding must have been exported by the module.

 -- syntax: @@ module-name binding-name
     Refer to the binding named BINDING-NAME in module MODULE-NAME.  The
     binding must not have been exported by the module.  This syntax is
     only intended for debugging purposes or as a last resort.  *Note*
     Declarative Modules::, for some limitations on the use of ‘@@’.

6.18.3 Creating Guile Modules
-----------------------------

When you want to create your own modules, you have to take the following
steps:

   • Create a Scheme source file and add all variables and procedures
     you wish to export, or which are required by the exported
     procedures.

   • Add a ‘define-module’ form at the beginning.

   • Export all bindings which should be in the public interface, either
     by using ‘define-public’ or ‘export’ (both documented below).

 -- syntax: define-module module-name option ...
     MODULE-NAME is a list of one or more symbols.

          (define-module (ice-9 popen))

     ‘define-module’ makes this module available to Guile programs under
     the given MODULE-NAME.

     OPTION ... are keyword/value pairs which specify more about the
     defined module.  The recognized options and their meaning are shown
     in the following table.

     ‘#:use-module INTERFACE-SPECIFICATION’
          Equivalent to a ‘(use-modules INTERFACE-SPECIFICATION)’ (*note*
          Using Guile Modules::).

     ‘#:autoload MODULE SYMBOL-LIST’
          Load MODULE when any of SYMBOL-LIST are accessed.  For
          example,

               (define-module (my mod)
                 #:autoload (srfi srfi-1) (partition delete-duplicates))
               ...
               (when something
                 (set! foo (delete-duplicates ...)))

          When a module is autoloaded, only the bindings in SYMBOL-LIST
          become available(1).

          An autoload is a good way to put off loading a big module
          until it’s really needed, for instance for faster startup or
          if it will only be needed in certain circumstances.

     ‘#:export LIST’
          Export all identifiers in LIST which must be a list of symbols
          or pairs of symbols.  This is equivalent to ‘(export LIST)’ in
          the module body.

     ‘#:re-export LIST’
          Re-export all identifiers in LIST which must be a list of
          symbols or pairs of symbols.  The symbols in LIST must be
          imported by the current module from other modules.  This is
          equivalent to ‘re-export’ below.

     ‘#:replace LIST’
          Export all identifiers in LIST (a list of symbols or pairs of
          symbols) and mark them as “replacing bindings”.  In the module
          user’s name space, this will have the effect of replacing any
          binding with the same name that is not also “replacing”.
          Normally a replacement results in an “override” warning
          message, ‘#:replace’ avoids that.

          In general, a module that exports a binding for which the
          ‘(guile)’ module already has a definition should use
          ‘#:replace’ instead of ‘#:export’.  ‘#:replace’, in a sense,
          lets Guile know that the module _purposefully_ replaces a core
          binding.  It is important to note, however, that this binding
          replacement is confined to the name space of the module user.
          In other words, the value of the core binding in question
          remains unchanged for other modules.

          Note that although it is often a good idea for the replaced
          binding to remain compatible with a binding in ‘(guile)’, to
          avoid surprising the user, sometimes the bindings will be
          incompatible.  For example, SRFI-19 exports its own version of
          ‘current-time’ (*note* SRFI-19 Time::) which is not compatible
          with the core ‘current-time’ function (*note* Time::).  Guile
          assumes that a user importing a module knows what she is
          doing, and uses ‘#:replace’ for this binding rather than
          ‘#:export’.

          A ‘#:replace’ clause is equivalent to ‘(export! LIST)’ in the
          module body.

          The ‘#:duplicates’ (see below) provides fine-grain control
          about duplicate binding handling on the module-user side.

     ‘#:re-export-and-replace LIST’
          Like ‘#:re-export’, but also marking the bindings as
          replacements in the sense of ‘#:replace’.

     ‘#:version LIST’
          Specify a version for the module in the form of LIST, a list
          of zero or more exact, nonnegative integers.  The
          corresponding ‘#:version’ option in the ‘use-modules’ form
          allows callers to restrict the value of this option in various
          ways.

     ‘#:duplicates LIST’
          Tell Guile to handle duplicate bindings for the bindings
          imported by the current module according to the policy defined
          by LIST, a list of symbols.  LIST must contain symbols
          representing a duplicate binding handling policy chosen among
          the following:

          ‘check’
               Raises an error when a binding is imported from more than
               one place.
          ‘warn’
               Issue a warning when a binding is imported from more than
               one place and leave the responsibility of actually
               handling the duplication to the next duplicate binding
               handler.
          ‘replace’
               When a new binding is imported that has the same name as
               a previously imported binding, then do the following:

                 1. If the old binding was said to be “replacing” (via
                    the ‘#:replace’ option above) and the new binding is
                    not replacing, the keep the old binding.
                 2. If the old binding was not said to be replacing and
                    the new binding is replacing, then replace the old
                    binding with the new one.
                 3. If neither the old nor the new binding is replacing,
                    then keep the old one.

          ‘warn-override-core’
               Issue a warning when a core binding is being overwritten
               and actually override the core binding with the new one.
          ‘first’
               In case of duplicate bindings, the firstly imported
               binding is always the one which is kept.
          ‘last’
               In case of duplicate bindings, the lastly imported
               binding is always the one which is kept.
          ‘noop’
               In case of duplicate bindings, leave the responsibility
               to the next duplicate handler.

          If LIST contains more than one symbol, then the duplicate
          binding handlers which appear first will be used first when
          resolving a duplicate binding situation.  As mentioned above,
          some resolution policies may explicitly leave the
          responsibility of handling the duplication to the next handler
          in LIST.

          If GOOPS has been loaded before the ‘#:duplicates’ clause is
          processed, there are additional strategies available for
          dealing with generic functions.  *Note* Merging Generics::, for
          more information.

          The default duplicate binding resolution policy is given by
          the ‘default-duplicate-binding-handler’ procedure, and is

               (replace warn-override-core warn last)

     ‘#:pure’
          Create a “pure” module, that is a module which does not
          contain any of the standard procedure bindings except for the
          syntax forms.  This is useful if you want to create “safe”
          modules, that is modules which do not know anything about
          dangerous procedures.

 -- syntax: export variable ...
     Add all VARIABLEs (which must be symbols or pairs of symbols) to
     the list of exported bindings of the current module.  If VARIABLE
     is a pair, its ‘car’ gives the name of the variable as seen by the
     current module and its ‘cdr’ specifies a name for the binding in
     the current module’s public interface.

 -- syntax: define-public ...
     Equivalent to ‘(begin (define foo ...) (export foo))’.

 -- syntax: re-export variable ...
     Add all VARIABLEs (which must be symbols or pairs of symbols) to
     the list of re-exported bindings of the current module.  Pairs of
     symbols are handled as in ‘export’.  Re-exported bindings must be
     imported by the current module from some other module.

 -- syntax: export! variable ...
     Like ‘export’, but marking the exported variables as replacing.
     Using a module with replacing bindings will cause any existing
     bindings to be replaced without issuing any warnings.  See the
     discussion of ‘#:replace’ above.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In Guile 2.2 and earlier, _all_ the module bindings would become
available; SYMBOL-LIST was just the list of bindings that will first
trigger the load.

6.18.4 Modules and the File System
----------------------------------

Typical programs only use a small subset of modules installed on a Guile
system.  In order to keep startup time down, Guile only loads modules
when a program uses them, on demand.

   When a program evaluates ‘(use-modules (ice-9 popen))’, and the
module is not loaded, Guile searches for a conventionally-named file
from in the “load path”.

   In this case, loading ‘(ice-9 popen)’ will eventually cause Guile to
run ‘(primitive-load-path "ice-9/popen")’.  ‘primitive-load-path’ will
search for a file ‘ice-9/popen’ in the ‘%load-path’ (*note* Load
Paths::).  For each directory in ‘%load-path’, Guile will try to find
the file name, concatenated with the extensions from ‘%load-extensions’.
By default, this will cause Guile to ‘stat’ ‘ice-9/popen.scm’, and then
‘ice-9/popen’.  *Note* Load Paths::, for more on ‘primitive-load-path’.

   If a corresponding compiled ‘.go’ file is found in the
‘%load-compiled-path’ or in the fallback path, and is as fresh as the
source file, it will be loaded instead of the source file.  If no
compiled file is found, Guile may try to compile the source file and
cache away the resulting ‘.go’ file.  *Note* Compilation::, for more on
compilation.

   Once Guile finds a suitable source or compiled file is found, the
file will be loaded.  If, after loading the file, the module under
consideration is still not defined, Guile will signal an error.

*Note* Installing Site Packages::.

6.18.5 R6RS Version References
------------------------------

Guile’s module system includes support for locating modules based on a
declared version specifier of the same form as the one described in R6RS
(*note* R6RS Library Form: (r6rs)Library form.).  By using the
‘#:version’ keyword in a ‘define-module’ form, a module may specify a
version as a list of zero or more exact, nonnegative integers.

   This version can then be used to locate the module during the module
search process.  Client modules and callers of the ‘use-modules’
function may specify constraints on the versions of target modules by
providing a “version reference”, which has one of the following forms:

      (SUB-VERSION-REFERENCE ...)
      (and VERSION-REFERENCE ...)
      (or VERSION-REFERENCE ...)
      (not VERSION-REFERENCE)

   in which SUB-VERSION-REFERENCE is in turn one of:

      (SUB-VERSION)
      (>= SUB-VERSION)
      (<= SUB-VERSION)
      (and SUB-VERSION-REFERENCE ...)
      (or SUB-VERSION-REFERENCE ...)
      (not SUB-VERSION-REFERENCE)

   in which SUB-VERSION is an exact, nonnegative integer as above.  A
version reference matches a declared module version if each element of
the version reference matches a corresponding element of the module
version, according to the following rules:

   • The ‘and’ sub-form matches a version or version element if every
     element in the tail of the sub-form matches the specified version
     or version element.

   • The ‘or’ sub-form matches a version or version element if any
     element in the tail of the sub-form matches the specified version
     or version element.

   • The ‘not’ sub-form matches a version or version element if the tail
     of the sub-form does not match the version or version element.

   • The ‘>=’ sub-form matches a version element if the element is
     greater than or equal to the SUB-VERSION in the tail of the
     sub-form.

   • The ‘<=’ sub-form matches a version element if the version is less
     than or equal to the SUB-VERSION in the tail of the sub-form.

   • A SUB-VERSION matches a version element if one is EQV? to the
     other.

   For example, a module declared as:

      (define-module (mylib mymodule) #:version (1 2 0))

   would be successfully loaded by any of the following ‘use-modules’
expressions:

      (use-modules ((mylib mymodule) #:version (1 2 (>= 0))))
      (use-modules ((mylib mymodule) #:version (or (1 2 0) (1 2 1))))
      (use-modules ((mylib mymodule) #:version ((and (>= 1) (not 2)) 2 0)))

6.18.6 R6RS Libraries
---------------------

In addition to the API described in the previous sections, you also have
the option to create modules using the portable ‘library’ form described
in R6RS (*note* R6RS Library Form: (r6rs)Library form.), and to import
libraries created in this format by other programmers.  Guile’s R6RS
library implementation takes advantage of the flexibility built into the
module system by expanding the R6RS library form into a corresponding
Guile ‘define-module’ form that specifies equivalent import and export
requirements and includes the same body expressions.  The library
expression:

       (library (mylib (1 2))
         (export mybinding)
         (import (otherlib (3))))

   is equivalent to the module definition:

       (define-module (mylib)
         #:version (1 2)
         #:use-module ((otherlib) #:version (3))
         #:export (mybinding))

   Central to the mechanics of R6RS libraries is the concept of import
and export “levels”, which control the visibility of bindings at various
phases of a library’s lifecycle — macros necessary to expand forms in
the library’s body need to be available at expand time; variables used
in the body of a procedure exported by the library must be available at
runtime.  R6RS specifies the optional ‘for’ sub-form of an _import set_
specification (see below) as a mechanism by which a library author can
indicate that a particular library import should take place at a
particular phase with respect to the lifecycle of the importing library.

   Guile’s library implementation uses a technique called “implicit
phasing” (first described by Abdulaziz Ghuloum and R. Kent Dybvig),
which allows the expander and compiler to automatically determine the
necessary visibility of a binding imported from another library.  As
such, the ‘for’ sub-form described below is ignored by Guile (but may be
required by Schemes in which phasing is explicit).

 -- Scheme Syntax: library name (export export-spec ...) (import
          import-spec ...) body ...
     Defines a new library with the specified name, exports, and
     imports, and evaluates the specified body expressions in this
     library’s environment.

     The library NAME is a non-empty list of identifiers, optionally
     ending with a version specification of the form described above
     (*note* Creating Guile Modules::).

     Each EXPORT-SPEC is the name of a variable defined or imported by
     the library, or must take the form ‘(rename (internal-name
     external-name) ...)’, where the identifier INTERNAL-NAME names a
     variable defined or imported by the library and EXTERNAL-NAME is
     the name by which the variable is seen by importing libraries.

     Each IMPORT-SPEC must be either an “import set” (see below) or must
     be of the form ‘(for import-set import-level ...)’, where each
     IMPORT-LEVEL is one of:

            run
            expand
            (meta LEVEL)

     where LEVEL is an integer.  Note that since Guile does not require
     explicit phase specification, any IMPORT-SETs found inside of ‘for’
     sub-forms will be “unwrapped” during expansion and processed as if
     they had been specified directly.

     Import sets in turn take one of the following forms:

            LIBRARY-REFERENCE
            (library LIBRARY-REFERENCE)
            (only IMPORT-SET IDENTIFIER ...)
            (except IMPORT-SET IDENTIFIER ...)
            (prefix IMPORT-SET IDENTIFIER)
            (rename IMPORT-SET (INTERNAL-IDENTIFIER EXTERNAL-IDENTIFIER) ...)

     where LIBRARY-REFERENCE is a non-empty list of identifiers ending
     with an optional version reference (*note* R6RS Version
     References::), and the other sub-forms have the following
     semantics, defined recursively on nested IMPORT-SETs:

        • The ‘library’ sub-form is used to specify libraries for import
          whose names begin with the identifier “library.”

        • The ‘only’ sub-form imports only the specified IDENTIFIERs
          from the given IMPORT-SET.

        • The ‘except’ sub-form imports all of the bindings exported by
          IMPORT-SET except for those that appear in the specified list
          of IDENTIFIERs.

        • The ‘prefix’ sub-form imports all of the bindings exported by
          IMPORT-SET, first prefixing them with the specified
          IDENTIFIER.

        • The ‘rename’ sub-form imports all of the identifiers exported
          by IMPORT-SET.  The binding for each INTERNAL-IDENTIFIER among
          these identifiers is made visible to the importing library as
          the corresponding EXTERNAL-IDENTIFIER; all other bindings are
          imported using the names provided by IMPORT-SET.

     Note that because Guile translates R6RS libraries into module
     definitions, an import specification may be used to declare a
     dependency on a native Guile module — although doing so may make
     your libraries less portable to other Schemes.

 -- Scheme Syntax: import import-spec ...
     Import into the current environment the libraries specified by the
     given import specifications, where each IMPORT-SPEC takes the same
     form as in the ‘library’ form described above.


File: guile.info,  Node: Variables,  Next: Module System Reflection,  Prev: R6RS Libraries,  Up: Modules

6.18.7 Variables
----------------

Each module has its own hash table, sometimes known as an “obarray”,
that maps the names defined in that module to their corresponding
variable objects.

   A variable is a box-like object that can hold any Scheme value.  It
is said to be “undefined” if its box holds a special Scheme value that
denotes undefined-ness (which is different from all other Scheme values,
including for example ‘#f’); otherwise the variable is “defined”.

   On its own, a variable object is anonymous.  A variable is said to be
“bound” when it is associated with a name in some way, usually a symbol
in a module obarray.  When this happens, the name is said to be bound to
the variable, in that module.

   (That’s the theory, anyway.  In practice, defined-ness and bound-ness
sometimes get confused, because Lisp and Scheme implementations have
often conflated — or deliberately drawn no distinction between — a name
that is unbound and a name that is bound to a variable whose value is
undefined.  We will try to be clear about the difference and explain any
confusion where it is unavoidable.)

   Variables do not have a read syntax.  Most commonly they are created
and bound implicitly by ‘define’ expressions: a top-level ‘define’
expression of the form

     (define NAME VALUE)

creates a variable with initial value VALUE and binds it to the name
NAME in the current module.  But they can also be created dynamically by
calling one of the constructor procedures ‘make-variable’ and
‘make-undefined-variable’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-undefined-variable
 -- C Function: scm_make_undefined_variable ()
     Return a variable that is initially unbound.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-variable init
 -- C Function: scm_make_variable (init)
     Return a variable initialized to value INIT.

 -- Scheme Procedure: variable-bound? var
 -- C Function: scm_variable_bound_p (var)
     Return ‘#t’ if VAR is bound to a value, or ‘#f’ otherwise.  Throws
     an error if VAR is not a variable object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: variable-ref var
 -- C Function: scm_variable_ref (var)
     Dereference VAR and return its value.  VAR must be a variable
     object; see ‘make-variable’ and ‘make-undefined-variable’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: variable-set! var val
 -- C Function: scm_variable_set_x (var, val)
     Set the value of the variable VAR to VAL.  VAR must be a variable
     object, VAL can be any value.  Return an unspecified value.

 -- Scheme Procedure: variable-unset! var
 -- C Function: scm_variable_unset_x (var)
     Unset the value of the variable VAR, leaving VAR unbound.

 -- Scheme Procedure: variable? obj
 -- C Function: scm_variable_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a variable object, else return ‘#f’.

6.18.8 Module System Reflection
-------------------------------

The previous sections have described a declarative view of the module
system.  You can also work with it programmatically by accessing and
modifying various parts of the Scheme objects that Guile uses to
implement the module system.

   At any time, there is a “current module”.  This module is the one
where a top-level ‘define’ and similar syntax will add new bindings.
You can find other module objects with ‘resolve-module’, for example.

   These module objects can be used as the second argument to ‘eval’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: current-module
 -- C Function: scm_current_module ()
     Return the current module object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-current-module module
 -- C Function: scm_set_current_module (module)
     Set the current module to MODULE and return the previous current
     module.

 -- Scheme Procedure: save-module-excursion thunk
     Call THUNK within a ‘dynamic-wind’ such that the module that is
     current at invocation time is restored when THUNK’s dynamic extent
     is left (*note* Dynamic Wind::).

     More precisely, if THUNK escapes non-locally, the current module
     (at the time of escape) is saved, and the original current module
     (at the time THUNK’s dynamic extent was last entered) is restored.
     If THUNK’s dynamic extent is re-entered, then the current module is
     saved, and the previously saved inner module is set current again.

 -- Scheme Procedure: resolve-module name [autoload=#t] [version=#f]
          [#:ensure=#t]
 -- C Function: scm_resolve_module (name)
     Find the module named NAME and return it.  When it has not already
     been defined and AUTOLOAD is true, try to auto-load it.  When it
     can’t be found that way either, create an empty module if ENSURE is
     true, otherwise return ‘#f’.  If VERSION is true, ensure that the
     resulting module is compatible with the given version reference
     (*note* R6RS Version References::).  The name is a list of symbols.

 -- Scheme Procedure: resolve-interface name [#:select=#f] [#:hide='()]
          [#:prefix=#f] [#:renamer=#f] [#:version=#f]
     Find the module named NAME as with ‘resolve-module’ and return its
     interface.  The interface of a module is also a module object, but
     it contains only the exported bindings.

 -- Scheme Procedure: module-uses module
     Return a list of the interfaces used by MODULE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: module-use! module interface
     Add INTERFACE to the front of the use-list of MODULE.  Both
     arguments should be module objects, and INTERFACE should very
     likely be a module returned by ‘resolve-interface’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: reload-module module
     Revisit the source file that corresponds to MODULE.  Raises an
     error if no source file is associated with the given module.

   As mentioned in the previous section, modules contain a mapping
between identifiers (as symbols) and storage locations (as variables).
Guile defines a number of procedures to allow access to this mapping.
If you are programming in C, *note* Accessing Modules from C::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: module-variable module name
     Return the variable bound to NAME (a symbol) in MODULE, or ‘#f’ if
     NAME is unbound.

 -- Scheme Procedure: module-add! module name var
     Define a new binding between NAME (a symbol) and VAR (a variable)
     in MODULE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: module-ref module name
     Look up the value bound to NAME in MODULE.  Like ‘module-variable’,
     but also does a ‘variable-ref’ on the resulting variable, raising
     an error if NAME is unbound.

 -- Scheme Procedure: module-define! module name value
     Locally bind NAME to VALUE in MODULE.  If NAME was already locally
     bound in MODULE, i.e., defined locally and not by an imported
     module, the value stored in the existing variable will be updated.
     Otherwise, a new variable will be added to the module, via
     ‘module-add!’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: module-set! module name value
     Update the binding of NAME in MODULE to VALUE, raising an error if
     NAME is not already bound in MODULE.

   There are many other reflective procedures available in the default
environment.  If you find yourself using one of them, please contact the
Guile developers so that we can commit to stability for that interface.

6.18.9 Declarative Modules
--------------------------

The first-class access to modules and module variables described in the
previous subsection is very powerful and allows Guile users to build
many tools to dynamically learn things about their Guile systems.
However, as Scheme godparent Mathias Felleisen wrote in “On the
Expressive Power of Programming Languages”, a more expressive language
is necessarily harder to reason about.  There are transformations that
Guile’s compiler would like to make which can’t be done if every
top-level definition is subject to mutation at any time.

   Consider this module:

     (define-module (boxes)
       #:export (make-box box-ref box-set! box-swap!))

     (define (make-box x) (list x))
     (define (box-ref box) (car box))
     (define (box-set! box x) (set-car! box x))
     (define (box-swap! box x)
       (let ((y (box-ref box)))
         (box-set! box x)
         y))

   Ideally you’d like for the ‘box-ref’ in ‘box-swap!’ to be inlined to
‘car’.  Guile’s compiler can do this, but only if it knows that
‘box-ref’’s definition is what it appears to be in the text.  However,
in the general case it could be that a programmer could reach into the
‘(boxes)’ module at any time and change the value of ‘box-ref’.

   To allow Guile to reason about the values of top-levels from a
module, a module can be marked as “declarative”.  This flag applies only
to the subset of top-level definitions that are themselves declarative:
those that are defined within the compilation unit, and not assigned
(‘set!’) or redefined within the compilation unit.

   To explicitly mark a module as being declarative, pass the
‘#:declarative?’ keyword argument when declaring a module:

     (define-module (boxes)
       #:export (make-box box-ref box-set! box-swap!)
       #:declarative? #t)

   By default, modules are compiled declaratively if the
‘user-modules-declarative?’ parameter is true when the module is
compiled.

 -- Scheme Parameter: user-modules-declarative?
     A boolean indicating whether definitions in modules created by
     ‘define-module’ or implicitly as part of a compilation unit without
     an explicit module can be treated as declarative.

   Because it’s usually what you want, the default value of
‘user-modules-declarative?’ is ‘#t’.

### Should I Mark My Module As Declarative?
.......................................

In the vast majority of use cases, declarative modules are what you
want.  However, there are exceptions.

   Consider the ‘(boxes)’ module above.  Let’s say you want to be able
to go in and change the definition of ‘box-set!’ at run-time:

     scheme@(guile-user)> (use-modules (boxes))
     scheme@(guile-user)> ,module boxes
     scheme@(boxes)> (define (box-set! x y) (set-car! x (pk y)))

   However, considering that ‘(boxes)’ is a declarative module, it could
be that ‘box-swap!’ inlined the call to ‘box-set!’ – so it may be that
you are surprised if you call ‘(box-swap! x y)’ and you don’t see the
new definition being used.  (Note, however, that Guile has no guarantees
about what definitions its compiler will or will not inline.)

   If you want to allow the definition of ‘box-set!’ to be changed and
to have all of its uses updated, then probably the best option is to
edit the module and reload the whole thing:

     scheme@(guile-user)> ,reload (boxes)

   The advantage of the reloading approach is that you maintain the
optimizations that declarative modules enable, while also being able to
live-update the code.  If the module keeps precious program state, those
definitions can be marked as ‘define-once’ to prevent reloads from
overwriting them.  *Note* Top Level::, for more on ‘define-once’.
Incidentally, ‘define-once’ also prevents declarative-definition
optimizations, so if there’s a limited subset of redefinable bindings,
‘define-once’ could be an interesting tool to mark those definitions as
works-in-progress for interactive program development.

   To users, whether a module is declarative or not is mostly
immaterial: besides normal use via ‘use-modules’, users can reference
and redefine public or private bindings programmatically or
interactively.  The only difference is that changing a declarative
definition may not change all of its uses.  If this use-case is
important to you, and if reloading whole modules is insufficient, then
you can mark all definitions in a module as non-declarative by adding
‘#:declarative? #f’ to the module definition.

   The default of whether modules are declarative or not can be
controlled via the ‘(user-modules-declarative?)’ parameter mentioned
above, but care should be taken to set this parameter when the modules
are compiled, e.g.  via ‘(eval-when (expand) (user-modules-declarative?
#f))’.  *Note* Eval When::.

   Alternately you can prevent declarative-definition optimizations by
compiling at the ‘-O1’ optimization level instead of the default ‘-O2’,
or via explicitly passing ‘-Ono-letrectify’ to the ‘guild compile’
invocation.  *Note* Compilation::, for more on compiler options.

   One final note.  Currently, definitions from declarative modules can
only be inlined within the module they are defined in, and within a
compilation unit.  This may change in the future to allow Guile to
inline imported declarative definitions as well (cross-module inlining).
To Guile, whether a definition is inlinable or not is a property of the
definition, not its use.  We hope to improve compiler tooling in the
future to allow the user to identify definitions that are out of date
when a declarative binding is redefined.

6.18.10 Accessing Modules from C
--------------------------------

The last sections have described how modules are used in Scheme code,
which is the recommended way of creating and accessing modules.  You can
also work with modules from C, but it is more cumbersome.

   The following procedures are available.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_call_with_current_module (SCM MODULE, SCM
          (*FUNC)(void *), void *DATA)
     Call FUNC and make MODULE the current module during the call.  The
     argument DATA is passed to FUNC.  The return value of
     ‘scm_c_call_with_current_module’ is the return value of FUNC.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_public_variable (SCM MODULE_NAME, SCM NAME)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_public_variable (const char *MODULE_NAME,
          const char *NAME)
     Find a the variable bound to the symbol NAME in the public
     interface of the module named MODULE_NAME.

     MODULE_NAME should be a list of symbols, when represented as a
     Scheme object, or a space-separated string, in the ‘const char *’
     case.  See ‘scm_c_define_module’ below, for more examples.

     Signals an error if no module was found with the given name.  If
     NAME is not bound in the module, just returns ‘#f’.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_private_variable (SCM MODULE_NAME, SCM NAME)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_private_variable (const char *MODULE_NAME,
          const char *NAME)
     Like ‘scm_public_variable’, but looks in the internals of the
     module named MODULE_NAME instead of the public interface.
     Logically, these procedures should only be called on modules you
     write.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_public_lookup (SCM MODULE_NAME, SCM NAME)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_public_lookup (const char *MODULE_NAME, const
          char *NAME)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_private_lookup (SCM MODULE_NAME, SCM NAME)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_private_lookup (const char *MODULE_NAME, const
          char *NAME)
     Like ‘scm_public_variable’ or ‘scm_private_variable’, but if the
     NAME is not bound in the module, signals an error.  Returns a
     variable, always.

          static SCM eval_string_var;

          /* NOTE: It is important that the call to 'my_init'
             happens-before all calls to 'my_eval_string'. */
          void my_init (void)
          {
            eval_string_var = scm_c_public_lookup ("ice-9 eval-string",
                                                   "eval-string");
          }

          SCM my_eval_string (SCM str)
          {
            return scm_call_1 (scm_variable_ref (eval_string_var), str);
          }

 -- C Function: SCM scm_public_ref (SCM MODULE_NAME, SCM NAME)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_public_ref (const char *MODULE_NAME, const
          char *NAME)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_private_ref (SCM MODULE_NAME, SCM NAME)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_private_ref (const char *MODULE_NAME, const
          char *NAME)
     Like ‘scm_public_lookup’ or ‘scm_private_lookup’, but additionally
     dereferences the variable.  If the variable object is unbound,
     signals an error.  Returns the value bound to NAME in MODULE_NAME.

   In addition, there are a number of other lookup-related procedures.
We suggest that you use the ‘scm_public_’ and ‘scm_private_’ family of
procedures instead, if possible.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_lookup (const char *NAME)
     Return the variable bound to the symbol indicated by NAME in the
     current module.  If there is no such binding or the symbol is not
     bound to a variable, signal an error.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_lookup (SCM NAME)
     Like ‘scm_c_lookup’, but the symbol is specified directly.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_module_lookup (SCM MODULE, const char *NAME)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_module_lookup (SCM MODULE, SCM NAME)
     Like ‘scm_c_lookup’ and ‘scm_lookup’, but the specified module is
     used instead of the current one.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_module_variable (SCM MODULE, SCM NAME)
     Like ‘scm_module_lookup’, but if the binding does not exist, just
     returns ‘#f’ instead of raising an error.

   To define a value, use ‘scm_define’:

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_define (const char *NAME, SCM VAL)
     Bind the symbol indicated by NAME to a variable in the current
     module and set that variable to VAL.  When NAME is already bound to
     a variable, use that.  Else create a new variable.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_define (SCM NAME, SCM VAL)
     Like ‘scm_c_define’, but the symbol is specified directly.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_module_define (SCM MODULE, const char *NAME,
          SCM VAL)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_module_define (SCM MODULE, SCM NAME, SCM VAL)
     Like ‘scm_c_define’ and ‘scm_define’, but the specified module is
     used instead of the current one.

   In some rare cases, you may need to access the variable that
‘scm_module_define’ would have accessed, without changing the binding of
the existing variable, if one is present.  In that case, use
‘scm_module_ensure_local_variable’:

 -- C Function: SCM scm_module_ensure_local_variable (SCM MODULE, SCM
          SYM)
     Like ‘scm_module_define’, but if the SYM is already locally bound
     in that module, the variable’s existing binding is not reset.
     Returns a variable.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_module_reverse_lookup (SCM MODULE, SCM VARIABLE)
     Find the symbol that is bound to VARIABLE in MODULE.  When no such
     binding is found, return ‘#f’.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_define_module (const char *NAME, void
          (*INIT)(void *), void *DATA)
     Define a new module named NAME and make it current while INIT is
     called, passing it DATA.  Return the module.

     The parameter NAME is a string with the symbols that make up the
     module name, separated by spaces.  For example, ‘"foo bar"’ names
     the module ‘(foo bar)’.

     When there already exists a module named NAME, it is used
     unchanged, otherwise, an empty module is created.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_resolve_module (const char *NAME)
     Find the module name NAME and return it.  When it has not already
     been defined, try to auto-load it.  When it can’t be found that way
     either, create an empty module.  The name is interpreted as for
     ‘scm_c_define_module’.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_c_use_module (const char *NAME)
     Add the module named NAME to the uses list of the current module,
     as with ‘(use-modules NAME)’.  The name is interpreted as for
     ‘scm_c_define_module’.

 -- C Function: void scm_c_export (const char *NAME, ...)
     Add the bindings designated by NAME, ...  to the public interface
     of the current module.  The list of names is terminated by ‘NULL’.

6.18.11 provide and require
---------------------------

Aubrey Jaffer, mostly to support his portable Scheme library SLIB,
implemented a provide/require mechanism for many Scheme implementations.
Library files in SLIB _provide_ a feature, and when user programs
_require_ that feature, the library file is loaded in.

   For example, the file ‘random.scm’ in the SLIB package contains the
line

     (provide 'random)

   so to use its procedures, a user would type

     (require 'random)

   and they would magically become available, _but still have the same
names!_  So this method is nice, but not as good as a full-featured
module system.

   When SLIB is used with Guile, provide and require can be used to
access its facilities.


File: guile.info,  Node: Environments,  Prev: provide and require,  Up: Modules

6.18.12 Environments
--------------------

Scheme, as defined in R5RS, does _not_ have a full module system.
However it does define the concept of a top-level “environment”.  Such
an environment maps identifiers (symbols) to Scheme objects such as
procedures and lists: *note* About Closure::.  In other words, it
implements a set of “bindings”.

   Environments in R5RS can be passed as the second argument to ‘eval’
(*note* Fly Evaluation::).  Three procedures are defined to return
environments: ‘scheme-report-environment’, ‘null-environment’ and
‘interaction-environment’ (*note* Fly Evaluation::).

   In addition, in Guile any module can be used as an R5RS environment,
i.e., passed as the second argument to ‘eval’.

   Note: the following two procedures are available only when the
‘(ice-9 r5rs)’ module is loaded:

     (use-modules (ice-9 r5rs))

 -- Scheme Procedure: scheme-report-environment version
 -- Scheme Procedure: null-environment version
     VERSION must be the exact integer ‘5’, corresponding to revision 5
     of the Scheme report (the Revised^5 Report on Scheme).
     ‘scheme-report-environment’ returns a specifier for an environment
     that is empty except for all bindings defined in the report that
     are either required or both optional and supported by the
     implementation.  ‘null-environment’ returns a specifier for an
     environment that is empty except for the (syntactic) bindings for
     all syntactic keywords defined in the report that are either
     required or both optional and supported by the implementation.

     Currently Guile does not support values of VERSION for other
     revisions of the report.

     The effect of assigning (through the use of ‘eval’) a variable
     bound in a ‘scheme-report-environment’ (for example ‘car’) is
     unspecified.  Currently the environments specified by
     ‘scheme-report-environment’ are not immutable in Guile.

6.19.1 Foreign Libraries
------------------------

Just as Guile can load up Scheme libraries at run-time, Guile can also
load some system libraries written in C or other low-level languages.
We refer to these as dynamically-loadable modules as “foreign
libraries”, to distinguish them from native libraries written in Scheme
or other languages implemented by Guile.

   Foreign libraries usually come in two forms.  Some foreign libraries
are part of the operating system, such as the compression library
‘libz’.  These shared libraries are built in such a way that many
programs can use their functionality without duplicating their code.
When a program written in C is built, it can declare that it uses a
specific set of shared libraries.  When the program is run, the
operating system takes care of locating and loading the shared
libraries.

   The operating system components that can dynamically load and link
shared libraries when a program is run are also available
programmatically during a program’s execution.  This is the interface
that’s most useful for Guile, and this is what we mean in Guile when we
refer to “dynamic linking”.  Dynamic linking at run-time is sometimes
called “dlopening”, to distinguish it from the dynamic linking that
happens at program start-up.

   The other kind of foreign library is sometimes known as a module,
plug-in, bundle, or an extension.  These foreign libraries aren’t meant
to be linked to by C programs, but rather only to be dynamically loaded
at run-time – they extend some main program with functionality, but
don’t stand on their own.  Sometimes a Guile library will implement some
of its functionality in a loadable module.

   In either case, the interface on the Guile side is the same.  You
load the interface using ‘load-foreign-library’.  The resulting foreign
library object implements a simple lookup interface whereby the user can
get addresses of data or code exported by the library.  There is no
facility to inspect foreign libraries; you have to know what’s in there
already before you look.

   Routines for loading foreign libraries and accessing their contents
are implemented in the ‘(system foreign-library)’ module.

     (use-modules (system foreign-library))

 -- Scheme Procedure: load-foreign-library [library]
          [#:extensions=system-library-extensions]
          [#:search-ltdl-library-path?=#t] [#:search-path=search-path]
          [#:search-system-paths?=#t] [#:lazy?=#t] [#:global=#f]
     [#:rename-on-cygwin?=#t] Find the shared library denoted by LIBRARY
     (a string or ‘#f’) and link it into the running Guile application.
     When everything works out, return a Scheme object suitable for
     representing the linked object file.  Otherwise an error is thrown.

     If LIBRARY argument is omitted, it defaults to ‘#f’.  If ‘library’
     is false, the resulting foreign library gives access to all symbols
     available for dynamic linking in the main binary.

     It is not necessary to include any extension such as ‘.so’ in
     LIBRARY.  For each system, Guile has a default set of extensions
     that it will try.  On GNU systems, the default extension set is
     just ‘.so’; on Windows, just ‘.dll’; and on Darwin (Mac OS), it is
     ‘.bundle’, ‘.so’, and ‘.dylib’.  Pass ‘#:extensions EXTENSIONS’ to
     override the default extensions list.  If LIBRARY contains one of
     the extensions, no extensions are tried, so it is possible to
     specify the extension if you know exactly what file to load.

     Unless LIBRARY denotes an absolute file name or otherwise contains
     a directory separator (‘/’, and also ‘\’ on Windows), Guile will
     search for the library in the directories listed in SEARCH-PATHS.
     The default search path has three components, which can all be
     overriden by colon-delimited (semicolon on Windows) environment
     variables:

     ‘GUILE_EXTENSIONS_PATH’
          This is the main environment variable for users to add
          directories containing Guile extensions.  The default value
          has no entries.  This environment variable was added in Guile
          3.0.6.
     ‘LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH’
          Before Guile 3.0.6, Guile loaded foreign libraries using
          ‘libltdl’, the dynamic library loader provided by libtool.
          This loader used ‘LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH’, and for backwards
          compatibility we still support that path.

          However, ‘libltdl’ would not only open ‘.so’ (or ‘.dll’ and so
          on) files, but also the ‘.la’ files created by libtool.  In
          installed libraries – libraries that are in the target
          directories of ‘make install’ – ‘.la’ files are never needed,
          to the extent that most GNU/Linux distributions remove them
          entirely.  It is sufficient to just load the ‘.so’ (or ‘.dll’
          and so on) files, which are always located in the same
          directory as the ‘.la’ files.

          But for uninstalled dynamic libraries, like those in a build
          tree, the situation is a bit of a mess.  If you have a project
          that uses libtool to build libraries – which is the case for
          Guile, and for most projects using autotools – and you build
          ‘foo.so’ in directory ‘D’, libtool will put ‘foo.la’ in ‘D’,
          but ‘foo.so’ gets put into ‘D/.libs’.

          Users were mostly oblivious to this situation, as ‘libltdl’
          had special logic to be able to read the ‘.la’ file to know
          where to find the ‘.so’, even from an uninstalled build tree,
          preventing the existence of ‘.libs’ from leaking out to the
          user.

          We don’t use libltdl now, essentially for flexibility and
          error-reporting reasons.  But, to keep this old use-case
          working, if SEARCH-LTDL-LIBRARY-PATH? is true, we add each
          entry of ‘LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH’ to the default extensions load
          path, additionally adding the ‘.libs’ subdirextories for each
          entry, in case there are ‘.so’ files there instead of
          alongside the ‘.la’ files.
     ‘GUILE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS_PATH’
          The last path in Guile’s search path belongs to Guile itself,
          and defaults to the libdir and the extensiondir, in that
          order.  For example, if you install to ‘/opt/guile’, these
          would probably be ‘/opt/guile/lib’ and
          ‘/opt/guile/lib/guile/3.0/extensions’, respectively.  *Note*
          Parallel Installations::, for more details on ‘extensionsdir’.

     Finally, if no library is found in the search path, and if LIBRARY
     is not absolute and does not include directory separators, and if
     SEARCH-SYSTEM-PATHS? is true, the operating system may have its own
     logic for where to locate LIBRARY.  For example, on GNU, there will
     be a default set of paths (often ‘/usr/lib’ and ‘/lib’, though it
     depends on the system), and the ‘LD_LIBRARY_PATH’ environment
     variable can add additional paths.  Other operating systems have
     other conventions.

     Falling back to the operating system for search is usually not a
     great thing; it is a recipe for making programs that work on one
     machine but not on others.  Still, when wrapping system libraries,
     it can be the only way to get things working at all.

     If LAZY? is true (the default), Guile will request the operating
     system to resolve symbols used by the loaded library as they are
     first used.  If GLOBAL? is true, symbols defined by the loaded
     library will be available when other modules need to resolve
     symbols; the default is ‘#f’, which keeps symbols local.

     If RENAME-ON-CYGWIN? is true (the default) – on Cygwin hosts only –
     the search behavior is modified such that a filename that starts
     with “lib” will be searched for under the name “cyg”, as is
     customary for Cygwin.

   The environment variables mentioned above are parsed when the
foreign-library module is first loaded and bound to parameters.  Null
path components, for example the three components of
‘GUILE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS_PATH="::"’, are ignored.

 -- Scheme Parameter: guile-extensions-path
 -- Scheme Parameter: ltdl-library-path
 -- Scheme Parameter: guile-system-extensions-path
     Parameters whose initial values are taken from
     ‘GUILE_EXTENSIONS_PATH’, ‘LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH’, and
     ‘GUILE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS_PATH’, respectively.  *Note* Parameters::.
     The current values of these parameters are used when building the
     search path when ‘load-foreign-library’ is called, unless the
     caller explicitly passes a ‘#:search-path’ argument.

 -- Scheme Procedure: foreign-library? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a foreign library, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

6.19.2 Foreign Extensions
-------------------------

One way to use shared libraries is to extend Guile.  Such loadable
modules generally define one distinguished initialization function that,
when called, will use the ‘libguile’ API to define procedures in the
current module.

   Concretely, you might extend Guile with an implementation of the
Bessel function, ‘j0’:

     #include <math.h>
     #include <libguile.h>

     SCM
     j0_wrapper (SCM x)
     {
       return scm_from_double (j0 (scm_to_double (x, "j0")));
     }

     void
     init_math_bessel (void)
     {
       scm_c_define_gsubr ("j0", 1, 0, 0, j0_wrapper);
     }

   The C source file would then need to be compiled into a shared
library.  On GNU/Linux, the compiler invocation might look like this:

     gcc -shared -o bessel.so -fPIC bessel.c

   A good default place to put shared libraries that extend Guile is
into the extensions dir.  From the command line or a build script,
invoke ‘pkg-config --variable=extensionsdir guile-3.0’ to print the
extensions dir.  *Note* Parallel Installations::, for more details.

   Guile can load up ‘bessel.so’ via ‘load-extension’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: load-extension lib init
 -- C Function: scm_load_extension (lib, init)
     Load and initialize the extension designated by LIB and INIT.

   The normal way for a extension to be used is to write a small Scheme
file that defines a module, and to load the extension into this module.
When the module is auto-loaded, the extension is loaded as well.  For
example:

     (define-module (math bessel)
       #:export (j0))

     (load-extension "bessel" "init_math_bessel")

   This ‘load-extension’ invocation loads the ‘bessel’ library via
‘(load-foreign-library "bessel")’, then looks up the ‘init_math_bessel’
symbol in the library, treating it as a function of no arguments, and
calls that function.

   If you decide to put your extension outside the default search path
for ‘load-foreign-library’, probably you should adapt the Scheme module
to specify its absolute path.  For example, if you use ‘automake’ to
build your extension and place it in ‘$(pkglibdir)’, you might define a
build-parameters module that gets created by the build system:

     (define-module (math config)
       #:export (extensiondir))
     (define extensiondir "PKGLIBDIR")

   This file would be ‘config.scm.in’.  You would define a ‘make’ rule
to substitute in the absolute installed file name:

     config.scm: config.scm.in
             sed 's|PKGLIBDIR|$(pkglibdir)|' <$< >$ 

   Then your ‘(math bessel)’ would import ‘(math config)’, then
‘(load-extension (in-vicinity extensiondir "bessel")
"init_math_bessel")’.

   An alternate approach would be to rebind the ‘guile-extensions-path’
parameter, or its corresponding environment variable, but note that
changing those parameters applies to other users of
‘load-foreign-library’ as well.

   Note that the new primitives that the extension adds to Guile with
‘scm_c_define_gsubr’ (*note* Primitive Procedures::) or with any of the
other mechanisms are placed into the module that is current when the
‘scm_c_define_gsubr’ is executed, so to be clear about what goes vwhere
it’s best to include the ‘load-extension’ in a module, as above.
Alternately, the C code can use ‘scm_c_define_module’ to specify which
module is being created:

     static void
     do_init (void *unused)
     {
       scm_c_define_gsubr ("j0", 1, 0, 0, j0_wrapper);
       scm_c_export ("j0", NULL);
     }

     void
     init_math_bessel ()
     {
       scm_c_define_module ("math bessel", do_init, NULL);
     }

   And yet...  if what we want is just the ‘j0’ function, it seems like
a lot of ceremony to have to compile a Guile-specific wrapper library
complete with an initialization function and wraper module to allow
Guile users to call it.  There is another way, but to get there, we have
to talk about function pointers and function types first.  *Note* Foreign
Functions::, to skip to the good parts.

6.19.3 Foreign Pointers
-----------------------

Foreign libraries are essentially key-value mappings, where the keys are
names of definitions and the values are the addresses of those
definitions.  To look up the address of a definition, use
‘foreign-library-pointer’ from the ‘(system foreign-library)’ module.

 -- Scheme Procedure: foreign-library-pointer lib name
     Return a “wrapped pointer” for the symbol NAME in the shared object
     referred to by LIB.  The returned pointer points to a C object.

     As a convenience, if LIB is not a foreign library, it will be
     passed to ‘load-foreign-library’.

   If we continue with the ‘bessel.so’ example from before, we can get
the address of the ‘init_math_bessel’ function via:

     (use-modules (system foreign-library))
     (define init (foreign-library-pointer "bessel" "init_math_bessel"))
     init
     ⇒ #<pointer 0x7fb35b1b4688>

   A value returned by ‘foreign-library-pointer’ is a Scheme wrapper for
a C pointer.  Pointers are a data type in Guile that is disjoint from
all other types.  The next section discusses ways to dereference
pointers, but before then we describe the usual type predicates and so
on.

   Note that the rest of the interfaces in this section are part of the
‘(system foreign)’ library:

     (use-modules (system foreign))

 -- Scheme Procedure: pointer-address pointer
 -- C Function: scm_pointer_address (pointer)
     Return the numerical value of POINTER.

          (pointer-address init)
          ⇒ 139984413364296 ; YMMV

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-pointer address [finalizer]
     Return a foreign pointer object pointing to ADDRESS.  If FINALIZER
     is passed, it should be a pointer to a one-argument C function that
     will be called when the pointer object becomes unreachable.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pointer? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a pointer object, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Variable: %null-pointer
     A foreign pointer whose value is 0.

 -- Scheme Procedure: null-pointer? pointer
     Return ‘#t’ if POINTER is the null pointer, ‘#f’ otherwise.

   For the purpose of passing SCM values directly to foreign functions,
and allowing them to return SCM values, Guile also supports some unsafe
casting operators.

 -- Scheme Procedure: scm->pointer scm
     Return a foreign pointer object with the ‘object-address’ of SCM.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pointer->scm pointer
     Unsafely cast POINTER to a Scheme object.  Cross your fingers!

   Sometimes you want to give C extensions access to the dynamic FFI. At
that point, the names get confusing, because “pointer” can refer to a
‘SCM’ object that wraps a pointer, or to a ‘void*’ value.  We will try
to use “pointer object” to refer to Scheme objects, and “pointer value”
to refer to ‘void *’ values.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_pointer (void *ptr, void (*finalizer)
          (void*))
     Create a pointer object from a pointer value.

     If FINALIZER is non-null, Guile arranges to call it on the pointer
     value at some point after the pointer object becomes collectable.

 -- C Function: void* scm_to_pointer (SCM obj)
     Unpack the pointer value from a pointer object.

6.19.4 Foreign Types
--------------------

From Scheme’s perspective, foreign pointers are shards of chaos.  The
user can create a foreign pointer for any address, and do with it what
they will.  The only thing that lends a sense of order to the whole is a
shared hallucination that certain storage locations have certain types.
When making Scheme wrappers for foreign interfaces, we hide the madness
by explicitly representing the the data types of parameters and fields.

   These “foreign type values” may be constructed using the constants
and procedures from the ‘(system foreign)’ module, which may be loaded
like this:

     (use-modules (system foreign))

   ‘(system foreign)’ exports a number of values expressing the basic C
types.

 -- Scheme Variable: int8
 -- Scheme Variable: uint8
 -- Scheme Variable: uint16
 -- Scheme Variable: int16
 -- Scheme Variable: uint32
 -- Scheme Variable: int32
 -- Scheme Variable: uint64
 -- Scheme Variable: int64
 -- Scheme Variable: float
 -- Scheme Variable: double
 -- Scheme Variable: complex-double
 -- Scheme Variable: complex-float
     These values represent the C numeric types of the specified sizes
     and signednesses.  ‘complex-float’ and ‘complex-double’ stand for
     C99 ‘float _Complex’ and ‘double _Complex’ respecively.

   In addition there are some convenience bindings for indicating types
of platform-dependent size.

 -- Scheme Variable: int
 -- Scheme Variable: unsigned-int
 -- Scheme Variable: long
 -- Scheme Variable: unsigned-long
 -- Scheme Variable: short
 -- Scheme Variable: unsigned-short
 -- Scheme Variable: size_t
 -- Scheme Variable: ssize_t
 -- Scheme Variable: ptrdiff_t
 -- Scheme Variable: intptr_t
 -- Scheme Variable: uintptr_t
     Values exported by the ‘(system foreign)’ module, representing C
     numeric types.  For example, ‘long’ may be ‘equal?’ to ‘int64’ on a
     64-bit platform.

 -- Scheme Variable: void
     The ‘void’ type.  It can be used as the first argument to
     ‘pointer->procedure’ to wrap a C function that returns nothing.

   In addition, the symbol ‘*’ is used by convention to denote pointer
types.  Procedures detailed in the following sections, such as
‘pointer->procedure’, accept it as a type descriptor.


File: guile.info,  Node: Foreign Functions,  Next: Void Pointers and Byte Access,  Prev: Foreign Types,  Up: Foreign Function Interface

6.19.5 Foreign Functions
------------------------

The most natural thing to do with a dynamic library is to grovel around
in it for a function pointer: a “foreign function”.  Load the ‘(system
foreign)’ module to use these Scheme interfaces.

     (use-modules (system foreign))

 -- Scheme Procedure: pointer->procedure return_type func_ptr arg_types
          [#:return-errno?=#f]
 -- C Function: scm_pointer_to_procedure (return_type, func_ptr,
          arg_types)
 -- C Function: scm_pointer_to_procedure_with_errno (return_type,
          func_ptr, arg_types)

     Make a foreign function.

     Given the foreign void pointer FUNC_PTR, its argument and return
     types ARG_TYPES and RETURN_TYPE, return a procedure that will pass
     arguments to the foreign function and return appropriate values.

     ARG_TYPES should be a list of foreign types.  ‘return_type’ should
     be a foreign type.  *Note* Foreign Types::, for more information on
     foreign types.

     If RETURN-ERRNO? is true, or when calling
     ‘scm_pointer_to_procedure_with_errno’, the returned procedure will
     return two values, with ‘errno’ as the second value.

   Finally, in ‘(system foreign-library)’ there is a convenient wrapper
function, joining together ‘foreign-libary-pointer’ and
‘procedure->pointer’:

 -- Scheme Procedure: foreign-library-function lib name
          [#:return-type=void] [#:arg-types='()] [#:return-errno?=#f]
     Load the address of NAME from LIB, and treat it as a function
     taking arguments ARG-TYPES and returning RETURN-TYPE, optionally
     also with errno.

     An invocation of ‘foreign-library-function’ is entirely equivalent
     to:
          (pointer->procedure RETURN-TYPE
                              (foreign-library-pointer LIB NAME)
                              ARG-TYPES
                              #:return-errno? RETURN-ERRNO?).

   Pulling all this together, here is a better definition of ‘(math
bessel)’:

     (define-module (math bessel)
       #:use-module (system foreign)
       #:use-module (system foreign-library)
       #:export (j0))

     (define j0
       (foreign-library-function "libm" "j0"
                                 #:return-type double
                                 #:arg-types (list double)))

   That’s it!  No C at all.

   Before going on to more detailed examples, the next two sections
discuss how to deal with data that is more complex than, say, ‘int8’.
*Note* More Foreign Functions::, to continue with foreign function
examples.


File: guile.info,  Node: Void Pointers and Byte Access,  Next: Foreign Structs,  Prev: Foreign Functions,  Up: Foreign Function Interface

6.19.6 Void Pointers and Byte Access
------------------------------------

Wrapped pointers are untyped, so they are essentially equivalent to C
‘void’ pointers.  As in C, the memory region pointed to by a pointer can
be accessed at the byte level.  This is achieved using _bytevectors_
(*note* Bytevectors::).  The ‘(rnrs bytevectors)’ module contains
procedures that can be used to convert byte sequences to Scheme objects
such as strings, floating point numbers, or integers.

   Load the ‘(system foreign)’ module to use these Scheme interfaces.

     (use-modules (system foreign))

 -- Scheme Procedure: pointer->bytevector pointer len [offset
          [uvec_type]]
 -- C Function: scm_pointer_to_bytevector (pointer, len, offset,
          uvec_type)
     Return a bytevector aliasing the LEN bytes pointed to by POINTER.

     The user may specify an alternate default interpretation for the
     memory by passing the UVEC_TYPE argument, to indicate that the
     memory is an array of elements of that type.  UVEC_TYPE should be
     something that ‘array-type’ would return, like ‘f32’ or ‘s16’.

     When OFFSET is passed, it specifies the offset in bytes relative to
     POINTER of the memory region aliased by the returned bytevector.

     Mutating the returned bytevector mutates the memory pointed to by
     POINTER, so buckle your seatbelts.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector->pointer bv [offset]
 -- C Function: scm_bytevector_to_pointer (bv, offset)
     Return a pointer aliasing the memory pointed to by BV or OFFSET
     bytes after BV when OFFSET is passed.

   In addition to these primitives, convenience procedures are
available:

 -- Scheme Procedure: dereference-pointer pointer
     Assuming POINTER points to a memory region that holds a pointer,
     return this pointer.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string->pointer string [encoding]
     Return a foreign pointer to a nul-terminated copy of STRING in the
     given ENCODING, defaulting to the current locale encoding.  The C
     string is freed when the returned foreign pointer becomes
     unreachable.

     This is the Scheme equivalent of ‘scm_to_stringn’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pointer->string pointer [length] [encoding]
     Return the string representing the C string pointed to by POINTER.
     If LENGTH is omitted or ‘-1’, the string is assumed to be
     nul-terminated.  Otherwise LENGTH is the number of bytes in memory
     pointed to by POINTER.  The C string is assumed to be in the given
     ENCODING, defaulting to the current locale encoding.

     This is the Scheme equivalent of ‘scm_from_stringn’.

   Most object-oriented C libraries use pointers to specific data
structures to identify objects.  It is useful in such cases to reify the
different pointer types as disjoint Scheme types.  The
‘define-wrapped-pointer-type’ macro simplifies this.

 -- Scheme Syntax: define-wrapped-pointer-type type-name pred wrap
          unwrap print
     Define helper procedures to wrap pointer objects into Scheme
     objects with a disjoint type.  Specifically, this macro defines:

        • PRED, a predicate for the new Scheme type;
        • WRAP, a procedure that takes a pointer object and returns an
          object that satisfies PRED;
        • UNWRAP, which does the reverse.

     WRAP preserves pointer identity, for two pointer objects P1 and P2
     that are ‘equal?’, ‘(eq? (WRAP P1) (WRAP P2)) ⇒ #t’.

     Finally, PRINT should name a user-defined procedure to print such
     objects.  The procedure is passed the wrapped object and a port to
     write to.

     For example, assume we are wrapping a C library that defines a
     type, ‘bottle_t’, and functions that can be passed ‘bottle_t *’
     pointers to manipulate them.  We could write:

          (define-wrapped-pointer-type bottle
            bottle?
            wrap-bottle unwrap-bottle
            (lambda (b p)
              (format p "#<bottle of ~a ~x>"
                      (bottle-contents b)
                      (pointer-address (unwrap-bottle b)))))

          (define grab-bottle
            ;; Wrapper for `bottle_t *grab (void)'.
            (let ((grab (foreign-library-function libbottle "grab_bottle"
                                                  #:return-type '*)))
              (lambda ()
                "Return a new bottle."
                (wrap-bottle (grab)))))

          (define bottle-contents
            ;; Wrapper for `const char *bottle_contents (bottle_t *)'.
            (let ((contents (foreign-library-function libbottle "bottle_contents"
                                                      #:return-type '*
                                                      #:arg-types  '(*))))
              (lambda (b)
                "Return the contents of B."
                (pointer->string (contents (unwrap-bottle b))))))

          (write (grab-bottle))
          ⇒ #<bottle of Château Haut-Brion 803d36>

     In this example, ‘grab-bottle’ is guaranteed to return a genuine
     ‘bottle’ object satisfying ‘bottle?’.  Likewise, ‘bottle-contents’
     errors out when its argument is not a genuine ‘bottle’ object.

   As another example, currently Guile has a variable, ‘scm_numptob’, as
part of its API. It is declared as a C ‘long’.  So, to read its value,
we can do:

     (use-modules (system foreign))
     (use-modules (rnrs bytevectors))
     (define numptob
       (foreign-library-pointer #f "scm_numptob"))
     numptob
     (bytevector-uint-ref (pointer->bytevector numptob (sizeof long))
                          0 (native-endianness)
                          (sizeof long))
     ⇒ 8

   If we wanted to corrupt Guile’s internal state, we could set
‘scm_numptob’ to another value; but we shouldn’t, because that variable
is not meant to be set.  Indeed this point applies more widely: the C
API is a dangerous place to be.  Not only might setting a value crash
your program, simply accessing the data pointed to by a dangling pointer
or similar can prove equally disastrous.

6.19.7 Foreign Structs
----------------------

Finally, one last note on foreign values before moving on to actually
calling foreign functions.  Sometimes you need to deal with C structs,
which requires interpreting each element of the struct according to the
its type, offset, and alignment.  The ‘(system foreign)’ module has some
primitives to support this.

     (use-modules (system foreign))

 -- Scheme Procedure: sizeof type
 -- C Function: scm_sizeof (type)
     Return the size of TYPE, in bytes.

     TYPE should be a valid C type, like ‘int’.  Alternately TYPE may be
     the symbol ‘*’, in which case the size of a pointer is returned.
     TYPE may also be a list of types, in which case the size of a
     ‘struct’ with ABI-conventional packing is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: alignof type
 -- C Function: scm_alignof (type)
     Return the alignment of TYPE, in bytes.

     TYPE should be a valid C type, like ‘int’.  Alternately TYPE may be
     the symbol ‘*’, in which case the alignment of a pointer is
     returned.  TYPE may also be a list of types, in which case the
     alignment of a ‘struct’ with ABI-conventional packing is returned.

   Guile also provides some convenience methods to pack and unpack
foreign pointers wrapping C structs.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-c-struct types vals
     Create a foreign pointer to a C struct containing VALS with types
     ‘types’.

     VALS and ‘types’ should be lists of the same length.

 -- Scheme Procedure: parse-c-struct foreign types
     Parse a foreign pointer to a C struct, returning a list of values.

     ‘types’ should be a list of C types.

   For example, to create and parse the equivalent of a ‘struct {
int64_t a; uint8_t b; }’:

     (parse-c-struct (make-c-struct (list int64 uint8)
                                    (list 300 43))
                     (list int64 uint8))
     ⇒ (300 43)

   As yet, Guile only has convenience routines to support
conventionally-packed structs.  But given the ‘bytevector->pointer’ and
‘pointer->bytevector’ routines, one can create and parse tightly packed
structs and unions by hand.  See the code for ‘(system foreign)’ for
details.


File: guile.info,  Node: More Foreign Functions,  Prev: Foreign Structs,  Up: Foreign Function Interface

6.19.8 More Foreign Functions
-----------------------------

It is possible to pass pointers to foreign functions, and to return them
as well.  In that case the type of the argument or return value should
be the symbol ‘*’, indicating a pointer.  For example, the following
code makes ‘memcpy’ available to Scheme:

     (use-modules (system foreign))
     (define memcpy
       (foreign-library-function #f "memcpy"
                                 #:return-type '*
                                 #:arg-types (list '* '* size_t)))

   To invoke ‘memcpy’, one must pass it foreign pointers:

     (use-modules (rnrs bytevectors))

     (define src-bits
       (u8-list->bytevector '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)))
     (define src
       (bytevector->pointer src-bits))
     (define dest
       (bytevector->pointer (make-bytevector 16 0)))

     (memcpy dest src (bytevector-length src-bits))

     (bytevector->u8-list (pointer->bytevector dest 16))
     ⇒ (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)

   One may also pass structs as values, passing structs as foreign
pointers.  *Note* Foreign Structs::, for more information on how to
express struct types and struct values.

   “Out” arguments are passed as foreign pointers.  The memory pointed
to by the foreign pointer is mutated in place.

     ;; struct timeval {
     ;;      time_t      tv_sec;     /* seconds */
     ;;      suseconds_t tv_usec;    /* microseconds */
     ;; };
     ;; assuming fields are of type "long"

     (define gettimeofday
       (let ((f (foreign-library-function #f "gettimeofday"
                                          #:return-type int
                                          #:arg-types (list '* '*)))
             (tv-type (list long long)))
         (lambda ()
           (let* ((timeval (make-c-struct tv-type (list 0 0)))
                  (ret (f timeval %null-pointer)))
             (if (zero? ret)
                 (apply values (parse-c-struct timeval tv-type))
                 (error "gettimeofday returned an error" ret))))))

     (gettimeofday)
     ⇒ 1270587589
     ⇒ 499553

   As you can see, this interface to foreign functions is at a very low,
somewhat dangerous level(1).

   The FFI can also work in the opposite direction: making Scheme
procedures callable from C. This makes it possible to use Scheme
procedures as “callbacks” expected by C function.

 -- Scheme Procedure: procedure->pointer return-type proc arg-types
 -- C Function: scm_procedure_to_pointer (return_type, proc, arg_types)
     Return a pointer to a C function of type RETURN-TYPE taking
     arguments of types ARG-TYPES (a list) and behaving as a proxy to
     procedure PROC.  Thus PROC’s arity, supported argument types, and
     return type should match RETURN-TYPE and ARG-TYPES.

   As an example, here’s how the C library’s ‘qsort’ array sorting
function can be made accessible to Scheme (*note* ‘qsort’: (libc)Array
Sort Function.):

     (define qsort!
       (let ((qsort (foreign-library-function
                     #f "qsort" #:arg-types (list '* size_t size_t '*))))
         (lambda (bv compare)
           ;; Sort bytevector BV in-place according to comparison
           ;; procedure COMPARE.
           (let ((ptr (procedure->pointer int
                                          (lambda (x y)
                                            ;; X and Y are pointers so,
                                            ;; for convenience, dereference
                                            ;; them before calling COMPARE.
                                            (compare (dereference-uint8* x)
                                                     (dereference-uint8* y)))
                                          (list '* '*))))
             (qsort (bytevector->pointer bv)
                    (bytevector-length bv) 1 ;; we're sorting bytes
                    ptr)))))

     (define (dereference-uint8* ptr)
       ;; Helper function: dereference the byte pointed to by PTR.
       (let ((b (pointer->bytevector ptr 1)))
         (bytevector-u8-ref b 0)))

     (define bv
       ;; An unsorted array of bytes.
       (u8-list->bytevector '(7 1 127 3 5 4 77 2 9 0)))

     ;; Sort BV.
     (qsort! bv (lambda (x y) (- x y)))

     ;; Let's see what the sorted array looks like:
     (bytevector->u8-list bv)
     ⇒ (0 1 2 3 4 5 7 9 77 127)

   And voilà!

   Note that ‘procedure->pointer’ is not supported (and not defined) on
a few exotic architectures.  Thus, user code may need to check
‘(defined? 'procedure->pointer)’.  Nevertheless, it is available on many
architectures, including (as of libffi 3.0.9) x86, ia64, SPARC, PowerPC,
ARM, and MIPS, to name a few.

6.20 Foreign Objects
====================

This chapter contains reference information related to defining and
working with foreign objects.  *Note* Defining New Foreign Object
Types::, for a tutorial-like introduction to foreign objects.

 -- C Type: scm_t_struct_finalize
     This function type returns ‘void’ and takes one ‘SCM’ argument.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_make_foreign_object_type (SCM name, SCM slots,
          scm_t_struct_finalize finalizer)
     Create a fresh foreign object type.  NAME is a symbol naming the
     type.  SLOTS is a list of symbols, each one naming a field in the
     foreign object type.  FINALIZER indicates the finalizer, and may be
     ‘NULL’.

   We recommend that finalizers be avoided if possible.  *Note* Foreign
Object Memory Management::.  Finalizers must be async-safe and
thread-safe.  Again, *note* Foreign Object Memory Management::.  If you
are embedding Guile in an application that is not thread-safe, and you
define foreign object types that need finalization, you might want to
disable automatic finalization, and arrange to call
‘scm_manually_run_finalizers ()’ yourself.

 -- C Function: int scm_set_automatic_finalization_enabled (int
          enabled_p)
     Enable or disable automatic finalization.  By default, Guile
     arranges to invoke object finalizers automatically, in a separate
     thread if possible.  Passing a zero value for ENABLED_P will
     disable automatic finalization for Guile as a whole.  If you
     disable automatic finalization, you will have to call
     ‘scm_run_finalizers ()’ periodically.

     Unlike most other Guile functions, you can call
     ‘scm_set_automatic_finalization_enabled’ before Guile has been
     initialized.

     Return the previous status of automatic finalization.

 -- C Function: int scm_run_finalizers (void)
     Invoke any pending finalizers.  Returns the number of finalizers
     that were invoked.  This function should be called when automatic
     finalization is disabled, though it may be called if it is enabled
     as well.

 -- C Function: void scm_assert_foreign_object_type (SCM type, SCM val)
     When VAL is a foreign object of the given TYPE, do nothing.
     Otherwise, signal an error.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_make_foreign_object_0 (SCM type)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_make_foreign_object_1 (SCM type, void *val0)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_make_foreign_object_2 (SCM type, void *val0,
          void *val1)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_make_foreign_object_3 (SCM type, void *val0,
          void *val1, void *val2)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_make_foreign_object_n (SCM type, size_t n, void
          *vals[])
     Make a new foreign object of the type with type TYPE and initialize
     the first N fields to the given values, as appropriate.

     The number of fields for objects of a given type is fixed when the
     type is created.  It is an error to give more initializers than
     there are fields in the value.  It is perfectly fine to give fewer
     initializers than needed; this is convenient when some fields are
     of non-pointer types, and would be easier to initialize with the
     setters described below.

 -- C Function: void* scm_foreign_object_ref (SCM obj, size_t n);
 -- C Function: scm_t_bits scm_foreign_object_unsigned_ref (SCM obj,
          size_t n);
 -- C Function: scm_t_signed_bits scm_foreign_object_signed_ref (SCM
          obj, size_t n);
     Return the value of the Nth field of the foreign object OBJ.  The
     backing store for the fields is as wide as a ‘scm_t_bits’ value,
     which is at least as wide as a pointer.  The different variants
     handle casting in a portable way.

 -- C Function: void scm_foreign_object_set_x (SCM obj, size_t n, void
          *val);
 -- C Function: void scm_foreign_object_unsigned_set_x (SCM obj, size_t
          n, scm_t_bits val);
 -- C Function: void scm_foreign_object_signed_set_x (SCM obj, size_t n,
          scm_t_signed_bits val);
     Set the value of the Nth field of the foreign object OBJ to VAL,
     after portably converting to a ‘scm_t_bits’ value, if needed.

   One can also access foreign objects from Scheme.  *Note* Foreign
Objects and Scheme::, for some examples.

     (use-modules (system foreign-object))

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-foreign-object-type name slots
          [#:finalizer=#f]
     Make a new foreign object type.  See the above documentation for
     ‘scm_make_foreign_object_type’; these functions are exactly
     equivalent, except for the way in which the finalizer gets attached
     to instances (an internal detail).

     The resulting value is a GOOPS class.  *Note* GOOPS::, for more on
     classes in Guile.

 -- Scheme Syntax: define-foreign-object-type name constructor (slot
          ...) [#:finalizer=#f]
     A convenience macro to define a type, using
     ‘make-foreign-object-type’, and bind it to NAME.  A constructor
     will be bound to CONSTRUCTOR, and getters will be bound to each of
     SLOT....

6.21 Smobs
==========

A “smob” is a “small object”.  Before foreign objects were introduced in
Guile 2.0.12 (*note* Foreign Objects::), smobs were the preferred way to
for C code to define new kinds of Scheme objects.  With the exception of
the so-called “applicable SMOBs” discussed below, smobs are now a legacy
interface and are headed for eventual deprecation.  *Note* Deprecation::.
New code should use the foreign object interface.

   This section contains reference information related to defining and
working with smobs.  For a tutorial-like introduction to smobs, see
“Defining New Types (Smobs)” in previous versions of this manual.

 -- Function: scm_t_bits scm_make_smob_type (const char *name, size_t
          size)
     This function adds a new smob type, named NAME, with instance size
     SIZE, to the system.  The return value is a tag that is used in
     creating instances of the type.

     If SIZE is 0, the default _free_ function will do nothing.

     If SIZE is not 0, the default _free_ function will deallocate the
     memory block pointed to by ‘SCM_SMOB_DATA’ with ‘scm_gc_free’.  The
     WHAT parameter in the call to ‘scm_gc_free’ will be NAME.

     Default values are provided for the _mark_, _free_, _print_, and
     _equalp_ functions.  If you want to customize any of these
     functions, the call to ‘scm_make_smob_type’ should be immediately
     followed by calls to one or several of ‘scm_set_smob_mark’,
     ‘scm_set_smob_free’, ‘scm_set_smob_print’, and/or
     ‘scm_set_smob_equalp’.

 -- C Function: void scm_set_smob_free (scm_t_bits tc, size_t (*free)
          (SCM obj))
     This function sets the smob freeing procedure (sometimes referred
     to as a “finalizer”) for the smob type specified by the tag TC.  TC
     is the tag returned by ‘scm_make_smob_type’.

     The FREE procedure must deallocate all resources that are directly
     associated with the smob instance OBJ.  It must assume that all
     ‘SCM’ values that it references have already been freed and are
     thus invalid.

     It must also not call any libguile function or macro except
     ‘scm_gc_free’, ‘SCM_SMOB_FLAGS’, ‘SCM_SMOB_DATA’,
     ‘SCM_SMOB_DATA_2’, and ‘SCM_SMOB_DATA_3’.

     The FREE procedure must return 0.

     Note that defining a freeing procedure is not necessary if the
     resources associated with OBJ consists only of memory allocated
     with ‘scm_gc_malloc’ or ‘scm_gc_malloc_pointerless’ because this
     memory is automatically reclaimed by the garbage collector when it
     is no longer needed (*note* ‘scm_gc_malloc’: Memory Blocks.).

   Smob free functions must be thread-safe.  *Note* Foreign Object Memory
Management::, for a discussion on finalizers and concurrency.  If you
are embedding Guile in an application that is not thread-safe, and you
define smob types that need finalization, you might want to disable
automatic finalization, and arrange to call ‘scm_manually_run_finalizers
()’ yourself.  *Note* Foreign Objects::.

 -- C Function: void scm_set_smob_mark (scm_t_bits tc, SCM (*mark) (SCM
          obj))
     This function sets the smob marking procedure for the smob type
     specified by the tag TC.  TC is the tag returned by
     ‘scm_make_smob_type’.

     Defining a marking procedure is almost always the wrong thing to
     do.  It is much, much preferable to allocate smob data with the
     ‘scm_gc_malloc’ and ‘scm_gc_malloc_pointerless’ functions, and
     allow the GC to trace pointers automatically.

     Any mark procedures you see currently almost surely date from the
     time of Guile 1.8, before the switch to the Boehm-Demers-Weiser
     collector.  Such smob implementations should be changed to just use
     ‘scm_gc_malloc’ and friends, and to lose their mark function.

     If you decide to keep the mark function, note that it may be called
     on objects that are on the free list.  Please read and digest the
     comments from the BDW GC’s ‘gc/gc_mark.h’ header.

     The MARK procedure must cause ‘scm_gc_mark’ to be called for every
     ‘SCM’ value that is directly referenced by the smob instance OBJ.
     One of these ‘SCM’ values can be returned from the procedure and
     Guile will call ‘scm_gc_mark’ for it.  This can be used to avoid
     deep recursions for smob instances that form a list.

     It must not call any libguile function or macro except
     ‘scm_gc_mark’, ‘SCM_SMOB_FLAGS’, ‘SCM_SMOB_DATA’,
     ‘SCM_SMOB_DATA_2’, and ‘SCM_SMOB_DATA_3’.

 -- C Function: void scm_set_smob_print (scm_t_bits tc, int (*print)
          (SCM obj, SCM port, scm_print_state* pstate))
     This function sets the smob printing procedure for the smob type
     specified by the tag TC.  TC is the tag returned by
     ‘scm_make_smob_type’.

     The PRINT procedure should output a textual representation of the
     smob instance OBJ to PORT, using information in PSTATE.

     The textual representation should be of the form ‘#<name ...>’.
     This ensures that ‘read’ will not interpret it as some other Scheme
     value.

     It is often best to ignore PSTATE and just print to PORT with
     ‘scm_display’, ‘scm_write’, ‘scm_simple_format’, and ‘scm_puts’.

 -- C Function: void scm_set_smob_equalp (scm_t_bits tc, SCM (*equalp)
          (SCM obj1, SCM obj2))
     This function sets the smob equality-testing predicate for the smob
     type specified by the tag TC.  TC is the tag returned by
     ‘scm_make_smob_type’.

     The EQUALP procedure should return ‘SCM_BOOL_T’ when OBJ1 is
     ‘equal?’ to OBJ2.  Else it should return ‘SCM_BOOL_F’.  Both OBJ1
     and OBJ2 are instances of the smob type TC.

 -- C Function: void scm_assert_smob_type (scm_t_bits tag, SCM val)
     When VAL is a smob of the type indicated by TAG, do nothing.  Else,
     signal an error.

 -- C Macro: int SCM_SMOB_PREDICATE (scm_t_bits tag, SCM exp)
     Return true if EXP is a smob instance of the type indicated by TAG,
     or false otherwise.  The expression EXP can be evaluated more than
     once, so it shouldn’t contain any side effects.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_new_smob (scm_t_bits tag, void *data)
 -- C Function: SCM scm_new_double_smob (scm_t_bits tag, void *data,
          void *data2, void *data3)
     Make a new smob of the type with tag TAG and smob data DATA, DATA2,
     and DATA3, as appropriate.

     The TAG is what has been returned by ‘scm_make_smob_type’.  The
     initial values DATA, DATA2, and DATA3 are of type ‘scm_t_bits’;
     when you want to use them for ‘SCM’ values, these values need to be
     converted to a ‘scm_t_bits’ first by using ‘SCM_UNPACK’.

     The flags of the smob instance start out as zero.

 -- C Macro: scm_t_bits SCM_SMOB_FLAGS (SCM obj)
     Return the 16 extra bits of the smob OBJ.  No meaning is predefined
     for these bits, you can use them freely.

 -- C Macro: scm_t_bits SCM_SET_SMOB_FLAGS (SCM obj, scm_t_bits flags)
     Set the 16 extra bits of the smob OBJ to FLAGS.  No meaning is
     predefined for these bits, you can use them freely.

 -- C Macro: scm_t_bits SCM_SMOB_DATA (SCM obj)
 -- C Macro: scm_t_bits SCM_SMOB_DATA_2 (SCM obj)
 -- C Macro: scm_t_bits SCM_SMOB_DATA_3 (SCM obj)
     Return the first (second, third) immediate word of the smob OBJ as
     a ‘scm_t_bits’ value.  When the word contains a ‘SCM’ value, use
     ‘SCM_SMOB_OBJECT’ (etc.)  instead.

 -- C Macro: void SCM_SET_SMOB_DATA (SCM obj, scm_t_bits val)
 -- C Macro: void SCM_SET_SMOB_DATA_2 (SCM obj, scm_t_bits val)
 -- C Macro: void SCM_SET_SMOB_DATA_3 (SCM obj, scm_t_bits val)
     Set the first (second, third) immediate word of the smob OBJ to
     VAL.  When the word should be set to a ‘SCM’ value, use
     ‘SCM_SMOB_SET_OBJECT’ (etc.)  instead.

 -- C Macro: SCM SCM_SMOB_OBJECT (SCM obj)
 -- C Macro: SCM SCM_SMOB_OBJECT_2 (SCM obj)
 -- C Macro: SCM SCM_SMOB_OBJECT_3 (SCM obj)
     Return the first (second, third) immediate word of the smob OBJ as
     a ‘SCM’ value.  When the word contains a ‘scm_t_bits’ value, use
     ‘SCM_SMOB_DATA’ (etc.)  instead.

 -- C Macro: void SCM_SET_SMOB_OBJECT (SCM obj, SCM val)
 -- C Macro: void SCM_SET_SMOB_OBJECT_2 (SCM obj, SCM val)
 -- C Macro: void SCM_SET_SMOB_OBJECT_3 (SCM obj, SCM val)
     Set the first (second, third) immediate word of the smob OBJ to
     VAL.  When the word should be set to a ‘scm_t_bits’ value, use
     ‘SCM_SMOB_SET_DATA’ (etc.)  instead.

 -- C Macro: SCM * SCM_SMOB_OBJECT_LOC (SCM obj)
 -- C Macro: SCM * SCM_SMOB_OBJECT_2_LOC (SCM obj)
 -- C Macro: SCM * SCM_SMOB_OBJECT_3_LOC (SCM obj)
     Return a pointer to the first (second, third) immediate word of the
     smob OBJ.  Note that this is a pointer to ‘SCM’.  If you need to
     work with ‘scm_t_bits’ values, use ‘SCM_PACK’ and ‘SCM_UNPACK’, as
     appropriate.

 -- Function: SCM scm_markcdr (SCM X)
     Mark the references in the smob X, assuming that X’s first data
     word contains an ordinary Scheme object, and X refers to no other
     objects.  This function simply returns X’s first data word.

6.22.1 Threads
--------------

Guile supports POSIX threads, unless it was configured with
‘--without-threads’ or the host lacks POSIX thread support.  When thread
support is available, the ‘threads’ feature is provided (*note*
‘provided?’: Feature Manipulation.).

   The procedures below manipulate Guile threads, which are wrappers
around the system’s POSIX threads.  For application-level parallelism,
using higher-level constructs, such as futures, is recommended (*note*
Futures::).

   To use these facilities, load the ‘(ice-9 threads)’ module.

     (use-modules (ice-9 threads))

 -- Scheme Procedure: all-threads
 -- C Function: scm_all_threads ()
     Return a list of all threads.

 -- Scheme Procedure: current-thread
 -- C Function: scm_current_thread ()
     Return the thread that called this function.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-new-thread thunk [handler]
     Call ‘thunk’ in a new thread and with a new dynamic state,
     returning the new thread.  The procedure THUNK is called via
     ‘with-continuation-barrier’.

     When HANDLER is specified, then THUNK is called from within a
     ‘catch’ with tag ‘#t’ that has HANDLER as its handler.  This catch
     is established inside the continuation barrier.

     Once THUNK or HANDLER returns, the return value is made the _exit
     value_ of the thread and the thread is terminated.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_spawn_thread (scm_t_catch_body body, void
          *body_data, scm_t_catch_handler handler, void *handler_data)
     Call BODY in a new thread, passing it BODY_DATA, returning the new
     thread.  The function BODY is called via
     ‘scm_c_with_continuation_barrier’.

     When HANDLER is non-‘NULL’, BODY is called via ‘scm_internal_catch’
     with tag ‘SCM_BOOL_T’ that has HANDLER and HANDLER_DATA as the
     handler and its data.  This catch is established inside the
     continuation barrier.

     Once BODY or HANDLER returns, the return value is made the _exit
     value_ of the thread and the thread is terminated.

 -- Scheme Procedure: thread? obj
 -- C Function: scm_thread_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ ff OBJ is a thread; otherwise, return ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: join-thread thread [timeout [timeoutval]]
 -- C Function: scm_join_thread (thread)
 -- C Function: scm_join_thread_timed (thread, timeout, timeoutval)
     Wait for THREAD to terminate and return its exit value.  Only
     threads that were created with ‘call-with-new-thread’ or
     ‘scm_spawn_thread’ can be joinable; attempting to join a foreign
     thread will raise an error.

     When TIMEOUT is given, it specifies a point in time where the
     waiting should be aborted.  It can be either an integer as returned
     by ‘current-time’ or a pair as returned by ‘gettimeofday’.  When
     the waiting is aborted, TIMEOUTVAL is returned (if it is specified;
     ‘#f’ is returned otherwise).

 -- Scheme Procedure: thread-exited? thread
 -- C Function: scm_thread_exited_p (thread)
     Return ‘#t’ if THREAD has exited, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: yield
 -- C Function: scm_yield (thread)
     If one or more threads are waiting to execute, calling yield forces
     an immediate context switch to one of them.  Otherwise, yield has
     no effect.

 -- Scheme Procedure: cancel-thread thread . values
 -- C Function: scm_cancel_thread (thread)
     Asynchronously interrupt THREAD and ask it to terminate.
     ‘dynamic-wind’ post thunks will run, but throw handlers will not.
     If THREAD has already terminated or been signaled to terminate,
     this function is a no-op.  Calling ‘join-thread’ on the thread will
     return the given VALUES, if the cancel succeeded.

     Under the hood, thread cancellation uses ‘system-async-mark’ and
     ‘abort-to-prompt’.  *Note* Asyncs:: for more on asynchronous
     interrupts.

 -- macro: make-thread proc arg ...
     Apply PROC to ARG ... in a new thread formed by
     ‘call-with-new-thread’ using a default error handler that displays
     the error to the current error port.  The ARG ... expressions are
     evaluated in the new thread.

 -- macro: begin-thread expr1 expr2 ...
     Evaluate forms EXPR1 EXPR2 ... in a new thread formed by
     ‘call-with-new-thread’ using a default error handler that displays
     the error to the current error port.

   One often wants to limit the number of threads running to be
proportional to the number of available processors.  These interfaces
are therefore exported by (ice-9 threads) as well.

 -- Scheme Procedure: total-processor-count
 -- C Function: scm_total_processor_count ()
     Return the total number of processors of the machine, which is
     guaranteed to be at least 1.  A “processor” here is a thread
     execution unit, which can be either:

        • an execution core in a (possibly multi-core) chip, in a
          (possibly multi- chip) module, in a single computer, or
        • a thread execution unit inside a core in the case of
          “hyper-threaded” CPUs.

     Which of the two definitions is used, is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: current-processor-count
 -- C Function: scm_current_processor_count ()
     Like ‘total-processor-count’, but return the number of processors
     available to the current process.  See ‘setaffinity’ and
     ‘getaffinity’ for more information.


File: guile.info,  Node: Thread Local Variables,  Next: Asyncs,  Prev: Threads,  Up: Scheduling

6.22.2 Thread-Local Variables
-----------------------------

Sometimes you want to establish a variable binding that is only valid
for a given thread: a “thread-local variable”.

   You would think that fluids or parameters would be Guile’s answer for
thread-local variables, since establishing a new fluid binding doesn’t
affect bindings in other threads.  *Note* Fluids and Dynamic States::, or
*Note* Parameters::.  However, new threads inherit the fluid bindings
that were in place in their creator threads.  In this way, a binding
established using a fluid (or a parameter) in a thread can escape to
other threads, which might not be what you want.  Or, it might escape
via explicit reification via ‘current-dynamic-state’.

   Of course, this dynamic scoping might be exactly what you want;
that’s why fluids and parameters work this way, and is what you want for
for many common parameters such as the current input and output ports,
the current locale conversion parameters, and the like.  Perhaps this is
the case for most parameters, even.  If your use case for thread-local
bindings comes from a desire to isolate a binding from its setting in
unrelated threads, then fluids and parameters apply nicely.

   On the other hand, if your use case is to prevent concurrent access
to a value from multiple threads, then using vanilla fluids or
parameters is not appropriate.  For this purpose, Guile has
“thread-local fluids”.  A fluid created with ‘make-thread-local-fluid’
won’t be captured by ‘current-dynamic-state’ and won’t be propagated to
new threads.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-thread-local-fluid [dflt]
 -- C Function: scm_make_thread_local_fluid (dflt)
     Return a newly created fluid, whose initial value is DFLT, or ‘#f’
     if DFLT is not given.  Unlike fluids made with ‘make-fluid’, thread
     local fluids are not captured by ‘make-dynamic-state’.  Similarly,
     a newly spawned child thread does not inherit thread-local fluid
     values from the parent thread.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fluid-thread-local? fluid
 -- C Function: scm_fluid_thread_local_p (fluid)
     Return ‘#t’ if the fluid FLUID is is thread-local, or ‘#f’
     otherwise.

   For example:

     (define %thread-local (make-thread-local-fluid))

     (with-fluids ((%thread-local (compute-data)))
       ... (fluid-ref %thread-local) ...)

   You can also make a thread-local parameter out of a thread-local
fluid using the normal ‘fluid->parameter’:

     (define param (fluid->parameter (make-thread-local-fluid)))

     (parameterize ((param (compute-data)))
       ... (param) ...)

6.22.3 Asynchronous Interrupts
------------------------------

Every Guile thread can be interrupted.  Threads running Guile code will
periodically check if there are pending interrupts and run them if
necessary.  To interrupt a thread, call ‘system-async-mark’ on that
thread.

 -- Scheme Procedure: system-async-mark proc [thread]
 -- C Function: scm_system_async_mark (proc)
 -- C Function: scm_system_async_mark_for_thread (proc, thread)
     Enqueue PROC (a procedure with zero arguments) for future execution
     in THREAD.  When PROC has already been enqueued for THREAD but has
     not been executed yet, this call has no effect.  When THREAD is
     omitted, the thread that called ‘system-async-mark’ is used.

   Note that ‘scm_system_async_mark_for_thread’ is not
“async-signal-safe” and so cannot be called from a C signal handler.
(Indeed in general, ‘libguile’ functions are not safe to call from C
signal handlers.)

   Though an interrupt procedure can have any side effect permitted to
Guile code, asynchronous interrupts are generally used either for
profiling or for prematurely cancelling a computation.  The former case
is mostly transparent to the program being run, by design, but the
latter case can introduce bugs.  Like finalizers (*note* Foreign Object
Memory Management::), asynchronous interrupts introduce concurrency in a
program.  An asyncronous interrupt can run in the middle of some
mutex-protected operation, for example, and potentially corrupt the
program’s state.

   If some bit of Guile code needs to temporarily inhibit interrupts, it
can use ‘call-with-blocked-asyncs’.  This function works by temporarily
increasing the _async blocking level_ of the current thread while a
given procedure is running.  The blocking level starts out at zero, and
whenever a safe point is reached, a blocking level greater than zero
will prevent the execution of queued asyncs.

   Analogously, the procedure ‘call-with-unblocked-asyncs’ will
temporarily decrease the blocking level of the current thread.  You can
use it when you want to disable asyncs by default and only allow them
temporarily.

   In addition to the C versions of ‘call-with-blocked-asyncs’ and
‘call-with-unblocked-asyncs’, C code can use ‘scm_dynwind_block_asyncs’
and ‘scm_dynwind_unblock_asyncs’ inside a “dynamic context” (*note*
Dynamic Wind::) to block or unblock asyncs temporarily.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-blocked-asyncs proc
 -- C Function: scm_call_with_blocked_asyncs (proc)
     Call PROC and block the execution of asyncs by one level for the
     current thread while it is running.  Return the value returned by
     PROC.  For the first two variants, call PROC with no arguments; for
     the third, call it with DATA.

 -- C Function: void * scm_c_call_with_blocked_asyncs (void * (*proc)
          (void *data), void *data)
     The same but with a C function PROC instead of a Scheme thunk.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-unblocked-asyncs proc
 -- C Function: scm_call_with_unblocked_asyncs (proc)
     Call PROC and unblock the execution of asyncs by one level for the
     current thread while it is running.  Return the value returned by
     PROC.  For the first two variants, call PROC with no arguments; for
     the third, call it with DATA.

 -- C Function: void * scm_c_call_with_unblocked_asyncs (void *(*proc)
          (void *data), void *data)
     The same but with a C function PROC instead of a Scheme thunk.

 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_block_asyncs ()
     During the current dynwind context, increase the blocking of asyncs
     by one level.  This function must be used inside a pair of calls to
     ‘scm_dynwind_begin’ and ‘scm_dynwind_end’ (*note* Dynamic Wind::).

 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_unblock_asyncs ()
     During the current dynwind context, decrease the blocking of asyncs
     by one level.  This function must be used inside a pair of calls to
     ‘scm_dynwind_begin’ and ‘scm_dynwind_end’ (*note* Dynamic Wind::).

   Sometimes you want to interrupt a thread that might be waiting for
something to happen, for example on a file descriptor or a condition
variable.  In that case you can inform Guile of how to interrupt that
wait using the following procedures:

 -- C Function: int scm_c_prepare_to_wait_on_fd (int fd)
     Inform Guile that the current thread is about to sleep, and that if
     an asynchronous interrupt is signalled on this thread, Guile should
     wake up the thread by writing a zero byte to FD.  Returns zero if
     the prepare succeeded, or nonzero if the thread already has a
     pending async and that it should avoid waiting.

 -- C Function: int scm_c_prepare_to_wait_on_cond (scm_i_pthread_mutex_t
          *mutex, scm_i_pthread_cond_t *cond)
     Inform Guile that the current thread is about to sleep, and that if
     an asynchronous interrupt is signalled on this thread, Guile should
     wake up the thread by acquiring MUTEX and signalling COND.  The
     caller must already hold MUTEX and only drop it as part of the
     ‘pthread_cond_wait’ call.  Returns zero if the prepare succeeded,
     or nonzero if the thread already has a pending async and that it
     should avoid waiting.

 -- C Function: void scm_c_wait_finished (void)
     Inform Guile that the current thread has finished waiting, and that
     asynchronous interrupts no longer need any special wakeup action;
     the current thread will periodically poll its internal queue
     instead.

   Guile’s own interface to ‘sleep’, ‘wait-condition-variable’,
‘select’, and so on all call the above routines as appropriate.

   Finally, note that threads can also be interrupted via POSIX signals.
*Note* Signals::.  As an implementation detail, signal handlers will
effectively call ‘system-async-mark’ in a signal-safe way, eventually
running the signal handler using the same async mechanism.  In this way
you can temporarily inhibit signal handlers from running using the above
interfaces.

6.22.4 Atomics
--------------

When accessing data in parallel from multiple threads, updates made by
one thread are not generally guaranteed to be visible by another thread.
It could be that your hardware requires special instructions to be
emitted to propagate a change from one CPU core to another.  Or, it
could be that your hardware updates values with a sequence of
instructions, and a parallel thread could see a value that is in the
process of being updated but not fully updated.

   Atomic references solve this problem.  Atomics are a standard,
primitive facility to allow for concurrent access and update of mutable
variables from multiple threads with guaranteed forward-progress and
well-defined intermediate states.

   Atomic references serve not only as a hardware memory barrier but
also as a compiler barrier.  Normally a compiler might choose to reorder
or elide certain memory accesses due to optimizations like common
subexpression elimination.  Atomic accesses however will not be
reordered relative to each other, and normal memory accesses will not be
reordered across atomic accesses.

   As an implementation detail, currently all atomic accesses and
updates use the sequential consistency memory model from C11.  We may
relax this in the future to the acquire/release semantics, which still
issues a memory barrier so that non-atomic updates are not reordered
across atomic accesses or updates.

   To use Guile’s atomic operations, load the ‘(ice-9 atomic)’ module:

     (use-modules (ice-9 atomic))

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-atomic-box init
     Return an atomic box initialized to value INIT.

 -- Scheme Procedure: atomic-box? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is an atomic-box object, else return ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: atomic-box-ref box
     Fetch the value stored in the atomic box BOX and return it.

 -- Scheme Procedure: atomic-box-set! box val
     Store VAL into the atomic box BOX.

 -- Scheme Procedure: atomic-box-swap! box val
     Store VAL into the atomic box BOX, and return the value that was
     previously stored in the box.

 -- Scheme Procedure: atomic-box-compare-and-swap! box expected desired
     If the value of the atomic box BOX is the same as, EXPECTED (in the
     sense of ‘eq?’), replace the contents of the box with DESIRED.
     Otherwise does not update the box.  Returns the previous value of
     the box in either case, so you can know if the swap worked by
     checking if the return value is ‘eq?’ to EXPECTED.

6.22.5 Mutexes and Condition Variables
--------------------------------------

Mutexes are low-level primitives used to coordinate concurrent access to
mutable data.  Short for “mutual exclusion”, the name “mutex” indicates
that only one thread at a time can acquire access to data that is
protected by a mutex – threads are excluded from accessing data at the
same time.  If one thread has locked a mutex, then another thread
attempting to lock that same mutex will wait until the first thread is
done.

   Mutexes can be used to build robust multi-threaded programs that take
advantage of multiple cores.  However, they provide very low-level
functionality and are somewhat dangerous; usually you end up wanting to
acquire multiple mutexes at the same time to perform a multi-object
access, but this can easily lead to deadlocks if the program is not
carefully written.  For example, if objects A and B are protected by
associated mutexes M and N, respectively, then to access both of them
then you need to acquire both mutexes.  But what if one thread acquires
M first and then N, at the same time that another thread acquires N them
M? You can easily end up in a situation where one is waiting for the
other.

   There’s no easy way around this problem on the language level.  A
function A that uses mutexes does not necessarily compose nicely with a
function B that uses mutexes.  For this reason we suggest using atomic
variables when you can (*note* Atomics::), as they do not have this
problem.

   Still, if you as a programmer are responsible for a whole system,
then you can use mutexes as a primitive to provide safe concurrent
abstractions to your users.  (For example, given all locks in a system,
if you establish an order such that M is consistently acquired before N,
you can avoid the “deadly-embrace” deadlock described above.  The
problem is enumerating all mutexes and establishing this order from a
system perspective.)  Guile gives you the low-level facilities to build
such systems.

   In Guile there are additional considerations beyond the usual ones in
other programming languages: non-local control flow and asynchronous
interrupts.  What happens if you hold a mutex, but somehow you cause an
exception to be thrown?  There is no one right answer.  You might want
to keep the mutex locked to prevent any other code from ever entering
that critical section again.  Or, your critical section might be fine if
you unlock the mutex “on the way out”, via an exception handler or
‘dynamic-wind’.  *Note* Exceptions::, and *Note* Dynamic Wind::.

   But if you arrange to unlock the mutex when leaving a dynamic extent
via ‘dynamic-wind’, what to do if control re-enters that dynamic extent
via a continuation invocation?  Surely re-entering the dynamic extent
without the lock is a bad idea, so there are two options on the table:
either prevent re-entry via ‘with-continuation-barrier’ or similar, or
reacquire the lock in the entry thunk of a ‘dynamic-wind’.

   You might think that because you don’t use continuations, that you
don’t have to think about this, and you might be right.  If you control
the whole system, you can reason about continuation use globally.  Or,
if you know all code that can be called in a dynamic extent, and none of
that code can call continuations, then you don’t have to worry about
re-entry, and you might not have to worry about early exit either.

   However, do consider the possibility of asynchronous interrupts
(*note* Asyncs::).  If the user interrupts your code interactively, that
can cause an exception; or your thread might be cancelled, which does
the same; or the user could be running your code under some pre-emptive
system that periodically causes lightweight task switching.  (Guile does
not currently include such a system, but it’s possible to implement as a
library.)  Probably you also want to defer asynchronous interrupt
processing while you hold the mutex, and probably that also means that
you should not hold the mutex for very long.

   All of these additional Guile-specific considerations mean that from
a system perspective, you would do well to avoid these hazards if you
can by not requiring mutexes.  Instead, work with immutable data that
can be shared between threads without hazards, or use persistent data
structures with atomic updates based on the atomic variable library
(*note* Atomics::).

   There are three types of mutexes in Guile: “standard”, “recursive”,
and “unowned”.

   Calling ‘make-mutex’ with no arguments makes a standard mutex.  A
standard mutex can only be locked once.  If you try to lock it again
from the thread that locked it to begin with (the "owner" thread), it
throws an error.  It can only be unlocked from the thread that locked it
in the first place.

   Calling ‘make-mutex’ with the symbol ‘recursive’ as the argument, or
calling ‘make-recursive-mutex’, will give you a recursive mutex.  A
recursive mutex can be locked multiple times by its owner.  It then has
to be unlocked the corresponding number of times, and like standard
mutexes can only be unlocked by the owner thread.

   Finally, calling ‘make-mutex’ with the symbol ‘allow-external-unlock’
creates an unowned mutex.  An unowned mutex is like a standard mutex,
except that it can be unlocked by any thread.  A corollary of this
behavior is that a thread’s attempt to lock a mutex that it already owns
will block instead of signalling an error, as it could be that some
other thread unlocks the mutex, allowing the owner thread to proceed.
This kind of mutex is a bit strange and is here for use by SRFI-18.

   The mutex procedures in Guile can operate on all three kinds of
mutexes.

   To use these facilities, load the ‘(ice-9 threads)’ module.

     (use-modules (ice-9 threads))


 -- Scheme Procedure: make-mutex [kind]
 -- C Function: scm_make_mutex ()
 -- C Function: scm_make_mutex_with_kind (SCM kind)
     Return a new mutex.  It will be a standard non-recursive mutex,
     unless the ‘recursive’ symbol is passed as the optional KIND
     argument, in which case it will be recursive.  It’s also possible
     to pass ‘unowned’ for semantics tailored to SRFI-18’s use case; see
     above for details.

 -- Scheme Procedure: mutex? obj
 -- C Function: scm_mutex_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a mutex; otherwise, return ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-recursive-mutex
 -- C Function: scm_make_recursive_mutex ()
     Create a new recursive mutex.  It is initially unlocked.  Calling
     this function is equivalent to calling ‘make-mutex’ with the
     ‘recursive’ kind.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lock-mutex mutex [timeout]
 -- C Function: scm_lock_mutex (mutex)
 -- C Function: scm_timed_lock_mutex (mutex, timeout)
     Lock MUTEX and return ‘#t’.  If the mutex is already locked, then
     block and return only when MUTEX has been acquired.

     When TIMEOUT is given, it specifies a point in time where the
     waiting should be aborted.  It can be either an integer as returned
     by ‘current-time’ or a pair as returned by ‘gettimeofday’.  When
     the waiting is aborted, ‘#f’ is returned.

     For standard mutexes (‘make-mutex’), an error is signalled if the
     thread has itself already locked MUTEX.

     For a recursive mutex (‘make-recursive-mutex’), if the thread has
     itself already locked MUTEX, then a further ‘lock-mutex’ call
     increments the lock count.  An additional ‘unlock-mutex’ will be
     required to finally release.

     When an asynchronous interrupt (*note* Asyncs::) is scheduled for a
     thread blocked in ‘lock-mutex’, Guile will interrupt the wait, run
     the interrupts, and then resume the wait.

 -- C Function: void scm_dynwind_lock_mutex (SCM mutex)
     Arrange for MUTEX to be locked whenever the current dynwind context
     is entered and to be unlocked when it is exited.

 -- Scheme Procedure: try-mutex mx
 -- C Function: scm_try_mutex (mx)
     Try to lock MUTEX and return ‘#t’ if successful, or ‘#f’ otherwise.
     This is like calling ‘lock-mutex’ with an expired timeout.

 -- Scheme Procedure: unlock-mutex mutex
 -- C Function: scm_unlock_mutex (mutex)
     Unlock MUTEX.  An error is signalled if MUTEX is not locked.

     “Standard” and “recursive” mutexes can only be unlocked by the
     thread that locked them; Guile detects this situation and signals
     an error.  “Unowned” mutexes can be unlocked by any thread.

 -- Scheme Procedure: mutex-owner mutex
 -- C Function: scm_mutex_owner (mutex)
     Return the current owner of MUTEX, in the form of a thread or ‘#f’
     (indicating no owner).  Note that a mutex may be unowned but still
     locked.

 -- Scheme Procedure: mutex-level mutex
 -- C Function: scm_mutex_level (mutex)
     Return the current lock level of MUTEX.  If MUTEX is currently
     unlocked, this value will be 0; otherwise, it will be the number of
     times MUTEX has been recursively locked by its current owner.

 -- Scheme Procedure: mutex-locked? mutex
 -- C Function: scm_mutex_locked_p (mutex)
     Return ‘#t’ if MUTEX is locked, regardless of ownership; otherwise,
     return ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-condition-variable
 -- C Function: scm_make_condition_variable ()
     Return a new condition variable.

 -- Scheme Procedure: condition-variable? obj
 -- C Function: scm_condition_variable_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a condition variable; otherwise, return ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: wait-condition-variable condvar mutex [time]
 -- C Function: scm_wait_condition_variable (condvar, mutex, time)
     Wait until CONDVAR has been signalled.  While waiting, MUTEX is
     atomically unlocked (as with ‘unlock-mutex’) and is locked again
     when this function returns.  When TIME is given, it specifies a
     point in time where the waiting should be aborted.  It can be
     either a integer as returned by ‘current-time’ or a pair as
     returned by ‘gettimeofday’.  When the waiting is aborted, ‘#f’ is
     returned.  When the condition variable has in fact been signalled,
     ‘#t’ is returned.  The mutex is re-locked in any case before
     ‘wait-condition-variable’ returns.

     When an async is activated for a thread that is blocked in a call
     to ‘wait-condition-variable’, the waiting is interrupted, the mutex
     is locked, and the async is executed.  When the async returns, the
     mutex is unlocked again and the waiting is resumed.  When the
     thread block while re-acquiring the mutex, execution of asyncs is
     blocked.

 -- Scheme Procedure: signal-condition-variable condvar
 -- C Function: scm_signal_condition_variable (condvar)
     Wake up one thread that is waiting for CONDVAR.

 -- Scheme Procedure: broadcast-condition-variable condvar
 -- C Function: scm_broadcast_condition_variable (condvar)
     Wake up all threads that are waiting for CONDVAR.

   Guile also includes some higher-level abstractions for working with
mutexes.

 -- macro: with-mutex mutex body1 body2 ...
     Lock MUTEX, evaluate the body BODY1 BODY2 ..., then unlock MUTEX.
     The return value is that returned by the last body form.

     The lock, body and unlock form the branches of a ‘dynamic-wind’
     (*note* Dynamic Wind::), so MUTEX is automatically unlocked if an
     error or new continuation exits the body, and is re-locked if the
     body is re-entered by a captured continuation.

 -- macro: monitor body1 body2 ...
     Evaluate the body form BODY1 BODY2 ... with a mutex locked so only
     one thread can execute that code at any one time.  The return value
     is the return from the last body form.

     Each ‘monitor’ form has its own private mutex and the locking and
     evaluation is as per ‘with-mutex’ above.  A standard mutex
     (‘make-mutex’) is used, which means the body must not recursively
     re-enter the ‘monitor’ form.

     The term “monitor” comes from operating system theory, where it
     means a particular bit of code managing access to some resource and
     which only ever executes on behalf of one process at any one time.

6.22.6 Blocking in Guile Mode
-----------------------------

Up to Guile version 1.8, a thread blocked in guile mode would prevent
the garbage collector from running.  Thus threads had to explicitly
leave guile mode with ‘scm_without_guile ()’ before making a potentially
blocking call such as a mutex lock, a ‘select ()’ system call, etc.  The
following functions could be used to temporarily leave guile mode or to
perform some common blocking operations in a supported way.

   Starting from Guile 2.0, blocked threads no longer hinder garbage
collection.  Thus, the functions below are not needed anymore.  They can
still be used to inform the GC that a thread is about to block, giving
it a (small) optimization opportunity for “stop the world” garbage
collections, should they occur while the thread is blocked.

 -- C Function: void * scm_without_guile (void *(*func) (void *), void
          *data)
     Leave guile mode, call FUNC on DATA, enter guile mode and return
     the result of calling FUNC.

     While a thread has left guile mode, it must not call any libguile
     functions except ‘scm_with_guile’ or ‘scm_without_guile’ and must
     not use any libguile macros.  Also, local variables of type ‘SCM’
     that are allocated while not in guile mode are not protected from
     the garbage collector.

     When used from non-guile mode, calling ‘scm_without_guile’ is still
     allowed: it simply calls FUNC.  In that way, you can leave guile
     mode without having to know whether the current thread is in guile
     mode or not.

 -- C Function: int scm_pthread_mutex_lock (pthread_mutex_t *mutex)
     Like ‘pthread_mutex_lock’, but leaves guile mode while waiting for
     the mutex.

 -- C Function: int scm_pthread_cond_wait (pthread_cond_t *cond,
          pthread_mutex_t *mutex)
 -- C Function: int scm_pthread_cond_timedwait (pthread_cond_t *cond,
          pthread_mutex_t *mutex, struct timespec *abstime)
     Like ‘pthread_cond_wait’ and ‘pthread_cond_timedwait’, but leaves
     guile mode while waiting for the condition variable.

 -- C Function: int scm_std_select (int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set
          *writefds, fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout)
     Like ‘select’ but leaves guile mode while waiting.  Also, the
     delivery of an async causes this function to be interrupted with
     error code ‘EINTR’.

 -- C Function: unsigned int scm_std_sleep (unsigned int seconds)
     Like ‘sleep’, but leaves guile mode while sleeping.  Also, the
     delivery of an async causes this function to be interrupted.

 -- C Function: unsigned long scm_std_usleep (unsigned long usecs)
     Like ‘usleep’, but leaves guile mode while sleeping.  Also, the
     delivery of an async causes this function to be interrupted.


File: guile.info,  Node: Futures,  Next: Parallel Forms,  Prev: Blocking,  Up: Scheduling

6.22.7 Futures
--------------

The ‘(ice-9 futures)’ module provides “futures”, a construct for
fine-grain parallelism.  A future is a wrapper around an expression
whose computation may occur in parallel with the code of the calling
thread, and possibly in parallel with other futures.  Like promises,
futures are essentially proxies that can be queried to obtain the value
of the enclosed expression:

     (touch (future (+ 2 3)))
     ⇒ 5

   However, unlike promises, the expression associated with a future may
be evaluated on another CPU core, should one be available.  This
supports “fine-grain parallelism”, because even relatively small
computations can be embedded in futures.  Consider this sequential code:

     (define (find-prime lst1 lst2)
       (or (find prime? lst1)
           (find prime? lst2)))

   The two arms of ‘or’ are potentially computation-intensive.  They are
independent of one another, yet, they are evaluated sequentially when
the first one returns ‘#f’.  Using futures, one could rewrite it like
this:

     (define (find-prime lst1 lst2)
       (let ((f (future (find prime? lst2))))
         (or (find prime? lst1)
             (touch f))))

   This preserves the semantics of ‘find-prime’.  On a multi-core
machine, though, the computation of ‘(find prime? lst2)’ may be done in
parallel with that of the other ‘find’ call, which can reduce the
execution time of ‘find-prime’.

   Futures may be nested: a future can itself spawn and then ‘touch’
other futures, leading to a directed acyclic graph of futures.  Using
this facility, a parallel ‘map’ procedure can be defined along these
lines:

     (use-modules (ice-9 futures) (ice-9 match))

     (define (par-map proc lst)
       (match lst
         (()
          '())
         ((head tail ...)
          (let ((tail (future (par-map proc tail)))
                (head (proc head)))
            (cons head (touch tail))))))

   Note that futures are intended for the evaluation of purely
functional expressions.  Expressions that have side-effects or rely on
I/O may require additional care, such as explicit synchronization (*note*
Mutexes and Condition Variables::).

   Guile’s futures are implemented on top of POSIX threads (*note*
Threads::).  Internally, a fixed-size pool of threads is used to
evaluate futures, such that offloading the evaluation of an expression
to another thread doesn’t incur thread creation costs.  By default, the
pool contains one thread per available CPU core, minus one, to account
for the main thread.  The number of available CPU cores is determined
using ‘current-processor-count’ (*note* Processes::).

   When a thread touches a future that has not completed yet, it
processes any pending future while waiting for it to complete, or just
waits if there are no pending futures.  When ‘touch’ is called from
within a future, the execution of the calling future is suspended,
allowing its host thread to process other futures, and resumed when the
touched future has completed.  This suspend/resume is achieved by
capturing the calling future’s continuation, and later reinstating it
(*note* delimited continuations: Prompts.).

 -- Scheme Syntax: future exp
     Return a future for expression EXP.  This is equivalent to:

          (make-future (lambda () exp))

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-future thunk
     Return a future for THUNK, a zero-argument procedure.

     This procedure returns immediately.  Execution of THUNK may begin
     in parallel with the calling thread’s computations, if idle CPU
     cores are available, or it may start when ‘touch’ is invoked on the
     returned future.

     If the execution of THUNK throws an exception, that exception will
     be re-thrown when ‘touch’ is invoked on the returned future.

 -- Scheme Procedure: future? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a future.

 -- Scheme Procedure: touch f
     Return the result of the expression embedded in future F.

     If the result was already computed in parallel, ‘touch’ returns
     instantaneously.  Otherwise, it waits for the computation to
     complete, if it already started, or initiates it.  In the former
     case, the calling thread may process other futures in the meantime.

6.22.8 Parallel forms
---------------------

The functions described in this section are available from

     (use-modules (ice-9 threads))

   They provide high-level parallel constructs.  The following functions
are implemented in terms of futures (*note* Futures::).  Thus they are
relatively cheap as they re-use existing threads, and portable, since
they automatically use one thread per available CPU core.

 -- syntax: parallel expr ...
     Evaluate each EXPR expression in parallel, each in its own thread.
     Return the results of N expressions as a set of N multiple values
     (*note* Multiple Values::).

 -- syntax: letpar ((var expr) ...) body1 body2 ...
     Evaluate each EXPR in parallel, each in its own thread, then bind
     the results to the corresponding VAR variables, and then evaluate
     BODY1 BODY2 ...

     ‘letpar’ is like ‘let’ (*note* Local Bindings::), but all the
     expressions for the bindings are evaluated in parallel.

 -- Scheme Procedure: par-map proc lst1 lst2 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: par-for-each proc lst1 lst2 ...
     Call PROC on the elements of the given lists.  ‘par-map’ returns a
     list comprising the return values from PROC.  ‘par-for-each’
     returns an unspecified value, but waits for all calls to complete.

     The PROC calls are ‘(PROC ELEM1 ELEM2 ...)’, where each ELEM is
     from the corresponding LST .  Each LST must be the same length.
     The calls are potentially made in parallel, depending on the number
     of CPU cores available.

     These functions are like ‘map’ and ‘for-each’ (*note* List
     Mapping::), but make their PROC calls in parallel.

   Unlike those above, the functions described below take a number of
threads as an argument.  This makes them inherently non-portable since
the specified number of threads may differ from the number of available
CPU cores as returned by ‘current-processor-count’ (*note* Processes::).
In addition, these functions create the specified number of threads when
they are called and terminate them upon completion, which makes them
quite expensive.

   Therefore, they should be avoided.

 -- Scheme Procedure: n-par-map n proc lst1 lst2 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: n-par-for-each n proc lst1 lst2 ...
     Call PROC on the elements of the given lists, in the same way as
     ‘par-map’ and ‘par-for-each’ above, but use no more than N threads
     at any one time.  The order in which calls are initiated within
     that threads limit is unspecified.

     These functions are good for controlling resource consumption if
     PROC calls might be costly, or if there are many to be made.  On a
     dual-CPU system for instance N=4 might be enough to keep the CPUs
     utilized, and not consume too much memory.

 -- Scheme Procedure: n-for-each-par-map n sproc pproc lst1 lst2 ...
     Apply PPROC to the elements of the given lists, and apply SPROC to
     each result returned by PPROC.  The final return value is
     unspecified, but all calls will have been completed before
     returning.

     The calls made are ‘(SPROC (PPROC ELEM1 ... ELEMN))’, where each
     ELEM is from the corresponding LST.  Each LST must have the same
     number of elements.

     The PPROC calls are made in parallel, in separate threads.  No more
     than N threads are used at any one time.  The order in which PPROC
     calls are initiated within that limit is unspecified.

     The SPROC calls are made serially, in list element order, one at a
     time.  PPROC calls on later elements may execute in parallel with
     the SPROC calls.  Exactly which thread makes each SPROC call is
     unspecified.

     This function is designed for individual calculations that can be
     done in parallel, but with results needing to be handled serially,
     for instance to write them to a file.  The N limit on threads
     controls system resource usage when there are many calculations or
     when they might be costly.

     It will be seen that ‘n-for-each-par-map’ is like a combination of
     ‘n-par-map’ and ‘for-each’,

          (for-each sproc (n-par-map n pproc lst1 ... lstN))

     But the actual implementation is more efficient since each SPROC
     call, in turn, can be initiated once the relevant PPROC call has
     completed, it doesn’t need to wait for all to finish.

6.23 Configuration, Features and Runtime Options
================================================

Why is my Guile different from your Guile?  There are three kinds of
possible variation:

   • build differences — different versions of the Guile source code,
     installation directories, configuration flags that control pieces
     of functionality being included or left out, etc.

   • differences in dynamically loaded code — behaviour and features
     provided by modules that can be dynamically loaded into a running
     Guile

   • different runtime options — some of the options that are provided
     for controlling Guile’s behaviour may be set differently.

   Guile provides “introspective” variables and procedures to query all
of these possible variations at runtime.  For runtime options, it also
provides procedures to change the settings of options and to obtain
documentation on what the options mean.

* Menu:

* Build Config::                Build and installation configuration.
* Feature Tracking::            Available features in the Guile process.
* Runtime Options::             Controlling Guile’s runtime behaviour.


File: guile.info,  Node: Build Config,  Next: Feature Tracking,  Up: Options and Config

6.23.1 Configuration, Build and Installation
--------------------------------------------

The following procedures and variables provide information about how
Guile was configured, built and installed on your system.

 -- Scheme Procedure: version
 -- Scheme Procedure: effective-version
 -- Scheme Procedure: major-version
 -- Scheme Procedure: minor-version
 -- Scheme Procedure: micro-version
 -- C Function: scm_version ()
 -- C Function: scm_effective_version ()
 -- C Function: scm_major_version ()
 -- C Function: scm_minor_version ()
 -- C Function: scm_micro_version ()
     Return a string describing Guile’s full version number, effective
     version number, major, minor or micro version number, respectively.
     The ‘effective-version’ function returns the version name that
     should remain unchanged during a stable series.  Currently that
     means that it omits the micro version.  The effective version
     should be used for items like the versioned share directory name
     i.e. ‘/usr/share/guile/3.0/’

          (version) ⇒ "3.0.0"
          (effective-version) ⇒ "3.0"
          (major-version) ⇒ "3"
          (minor-version) ⇒ "0"
          (micro-version) ⇒ "0"

 -- Scheme Procedure: %package-data-dir
 -- C Function: scm_sys_package_data_dir ()
     Return the name of the directory under which Guile Scheme files in
     general are stored.  On Unix-like systems, this is usually
     ‘/usr/local/share/guile’ or ‘/usr/share/guile’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: %library-dir
 -- C Function: scm_sys_library_dir ()
     Return the name of the directory where the Guile Scheme files that
     belong to the core Guile installation (as opposed to files from a
     3rd party package) are installed.  On Unix-like systems this is
     usually ‘/usr/local/share/guile/GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION’ or
     ‘/usr/share/guile/GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION’;

     for example ‘/usr/local/share/guile/3.0’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: %site-dir
 -- C Function: scm_sys_site_dir ()
     Return the name of the directory where Guile Scheme files specific
     to your site should be installed.  On Unix-like systems, this is
     usually ‘/usr/local/share/guile/site’ or ‘/usr/share/guile/site’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: %site-ccache-dir
 -- C Function: scm_sys_site_ccache_dir ()
     Return the directory where users should install compiled ‘.go’
     files for use with this version of Guile.  Might look something
     like ‘/usr/lib/guile/3.0/site-ccache’.

 -- Variable: %guile-build-info
     Alist of information collected during the building of a particular
     Guile.  Entries can be grouped into one of several categories:
     directories, env vars, and versioning info.

     Briefly, here are the keys in ‘%guile-build-info’, by group:

     directories
          srcdir, top_srcdir, prefix, exec_prefix, bindir, sbindir,
          libexecdir, datadir, sysconfdir, sharedstatedir,
          localstatedir, libdir, infodir, mandir, includedir,
          pkgdatadir, pkglibdir, pkgincludedir
     env vars
          LIBS
     versioning info
          guileversion, libguileinterface, buildstamp

     Values are all strings.  The value for ‘LIBS’ is typically found
     also as a part of ‘pkg-config --libs guile-3.0’ output.  The value
     for ‘guileversion’ has form X.Y.Z, and should be the same as
     returned by ‘(version)’.  The value for ‘libguileinterface’ is
     libtool compatible and has form CURRENT:REVISION:AGE (*note* Library
     interface versions: (libtool)Versioning.).  The value for
     ‘buildstamp’ is the output of the command ‘date -u +'%Y-%m-%d %T'’
     (UTC).

     In the source, ‘%guile-build-info’ is initialized from
     libguile/libpath.h, which is completely generated, so deleting this
     file before a build guarantees up-to-date values for that build.

 -- Variable: %host-type
     The canonical host type (GNU triplet) of the host Guile was
     configured for, e.g., ‘"x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"’ (*note*
     (autoconf)Canonicalizing::).

6.23.2 Feature Tracking
-----------------------

Guile has a Scheme level variable ‘*features*’ that keeps track to some
extent of the features that are available in a running Guile.
‘*features*’ is a list of symbols, for example ‘threads’, each of which
describes a feature of the running Guile process.

 -- Variable: *features*
     A list of symbols describing available features of the Guile
     process.

   You shouldn’t modify the ‘*features*’ variable directly using ‘set!’.
Instead, see the procedures that are provided for this purpose in the
following subsection.

* Menu:

* Feature Manipulation::        Checking for and advertising features.
* Common Feature Symbols::      Commonly available features.


File: guile.info,  Node: Feature Manipulation,  Next: Common Feature Symbols,  Up: Feature Tracking

### 6.23.2.1 Feature Manipulation
.............................

To check whether a particular feature is available, use the ‘provided?’
procedure:

 -- Scheme Procedure: provided? feature
 -- Deprecated Scheme Procedure: feature? feature
     Return ‘#t’ if the specified FEATURE is available, otherwise ‘#f’.

   To advertise a feature from your own Scheme code, you can use the
‘provide’ procedure:

 -- Scheme Procedure: provide feature
     Add FEATURE to the list of available features in this Guile
     process.

   For C code, the equivalent function takes its feature name as a ‘char
*’ argument for convenience:

 -- C Function: void scm_add_feature (const char *str)
     Add a symbol with name STR to the list of available features in
     this Guile process.


File: guile.info,  Node: Common Feature Symbols,  Prev: Feature Manipulation,  Up: Feature Tracking

### 6.23.2.2 Common Feature Symbols
...............................

In general, a particular feature may be available for one of two
reasons.  Either because the Guile library was configured and compiled
with that feature enabled — i.e. the feature is built into the library
on your system.  Or because some C or Scheme code that was dynamically
loaded by Guile has added that feature to the list.

   In the first category, here are the features that the current version
of Guile may define (depending on how it is built), and what they mean.

‘array’
     Indicates support for arrays (*note* Arrays::).

‘array-for-each’
     Indicates availability of ‘array-for-each’ and other array mapping
     procedures (*note* Arrays::).

‘char-ready?’
     Indicates that the ‘char-ready?’ function is available (*note*
     Venerable Port Interfaces::).

‘complex’
     Indicates support for complex numbers.

‘current-time’
     Indicates availability of time-related functions: ‘times’,
     ‘get-internal-run-time’ and so on (*note* Time::).

‘debug-extensions’
     Indicates that the debugging evaluator is available, together with
     the options for controlling it.

‘delay’
     Indicates support for promises (*note* Delayed Evaluation::).

‘EIDs’
     Indicates that the ‘geteuid’ and ‘getegid’ really return effective
     user and group IDs (*note* Processes::).

‘inexact’
     Indicates support for inexact numbers.

‘i/o-extensions’
     Indicates availability of the following extended I/O procedures:
     ‘ftell’, ‘redirect-port’, ‘dup->fdes’, ‘dup2’, ‘fileno’, ‘isatty?’,
     ‘fdopen’, ‘primitive-move->fdes’ and ‘fdes->ports’ (*note* Ports and
     File Descriptors::).

‘net-db’
     Indicates availability of network database functions:
     ‘scm_gethost’, ‘scm_getnet’, ‘scm_getproto’, ‘scm_getserv’,
     ‘scm_sethost’, ‘scm_setnet’, ‘scm_setproto’, ‘scm_setserv’, and
     their ‘byXXX’ variants (*note* Network Databases::).

‘posix’
     Indicates support for POSIX functions: ‘pipe’, ‘getgroups’, ‘kill’,
     ‘execl’ and so on (*note* POSIX::).

‘fork’
     Indicates support for the POSIX ‘fork’ function (*note*
     ‘primitive-fork’: Processes.).

‘popen’
     Indicates support for ‘open-pipe’ in the ‘(ice-9 popen)’ module
     (*note* Pipes::).

‘random’
     Indicates availability of random number generation functions:
     ‘random’, ‘copy-random-state’, ‘random-uniform’ and so on (*note*
     Random::).

‘reckless’
     Indicates that Guile was built with important checks omitted — you
     should never see this!

‘regex’
     Indicates support for POSIX regular expressions using
     ‘make-regexp’, ‘regexp-exec’ and friends (*note* Regexp
     Functions::).

‘socket’
     Indicates availability of socket-related functions: ‘socket’,
     ‘bind’, ‘connect’ and so on (*note* Network Sockets and
     Communication::).

‘sort’
     Indicates availability of sorting and merging functions (*note*
     Sorting::).

‘system’
     Indicates that the ‘system’ function is available (*note*
     Processes::).

‘threads’
     Indicates support for multithreading (*note* Threads::).

‘values’
     Indicates support for multiple return values using ‘values’ and
     ‘call-with-values’ (*note* Multiple Values::).

   Available features in the second category depend, by definition, on
what additional code your Guile process has loaded in.  The following
table lists features that you might encounter for this reason.

‘defmacro’
     Indicates that the ‘defmacro’ macro is available (*note* Macros::).

‘describe’
     Indicates that the ‘(oop goops describe)’ module has been loaded,
     which provides a procedure for describing the contents of GOOPS
     instances.

‘readline’
     Indicates that Guile has loaded in Readline support, for command
     line editing (*note* Readline Support::).

‘record’
     Indicates support for record definition using ‘make-record-type’
     and friends (*note* Records::).

   Although these tables may seem exhaustive, it is probably unwise in
practice to rely on them, as the correspondences between feature symbols
and available procedures/behaviour are not strictly defined.  If you are
writing code that needs to check for the existence of some procedure, it
is probably safer to do so directly using the ‘defined?’ procedure than
to test for the corresponding feature using ‘provided?’.

6.23.3 Runtime Options
----------------------

There are a number of runtime options available for paramaterizing
built-in procedures, like ‘read’, and built-in behavior, like what
happens on an uncaught error.

   For more information on reader options, *Note* Scheme Read::.

   For more information on print options, *Note* Scheme Write::.

   Finally, for more information on debugger options, *Note* Debug
Options::.

### 6.23.3.1 Examples of option use
...............................

Here is an example of a session in which some read and debug option
handling procedures are used.  In this example, the user

  1. Notices that the symbols ‘abc’ and ‘aBc’ are not the same
  2. Examines the ‘read-options’, and sees that ‘case-insensitive’ is
     set to “no”.
  3. Enables ‘case-insensitive’
  4. Quits the recursive prompt
  5. Verifies that now ‘aBc’ and ‘abc’ are the same

     scheme@(guile-user)> (define abc "hello")
     scheme@(guile-user)> abc
     $1 = "hello"
     scheme@(guile-user)> aBc
     <unknown-location>: warning: possibly unbound variable `aBc'
     ERROR: In procedure module-lookup:
     ERROR: Unbound variable: aBc
     Entering a new prompt.  Type `,bt' for a backtrace or `,q' to continue.
     scheme@(guile-user) [1]> (read-options 'help)
     copy              no    Copy source code expressions.
     positions         yes   Record positions of source code expressions.
     case-insensitive  no    Convert symbols to lower case.
     keywords          #f    Style of keyword recognition: #f, 'prefix or 'postfix.
     r6rs-hex-escapes  no    Use R6RS variable-length character and string hex escapes.
     square-brackets   yes   Treat `[' and `]' as parentheses, for R6RS compatibility.
     hungry-eol-escapes no   In strings, consume leading whitespace after an
                             escaped end-of-line.
     curly-infix       no    Support SRFI-105 curly infix expressions.
     scheme@(guile-user) [1]> (read-enable 'case-insensitive)
     $2 = (square-brackets keywords #f case-insensitive positions)
     scheme@(guile-user) [1]> ,q
     scheme@(guile-user)> aBc
     $3 = "hello"

6.24 Support for Other Languages
================================

In addition to Scheme, a user may write a Guile program in an increasing
number of other languages.  Currently supported languages include Emacs
Lisp and ECMAScript.

   Guile is still fundamentally a Scheme, but it tries to support a wide
variety of language building-blocks, so that other languages can be
implemented on top of Guile.  This allows users to write or extend
applications in languages other than Scheme, too.  This section
describes the languages that have been implemented.

   (For details on how to implement a language, *Note* Compiling to the
Virtual Machine::.)

* Menu:

* Using Other Languages::       How to use other languages.
* Emacs Lisp::                  The dialect of Lisp used in Emacs.
* ECMAScript::                  As seen on television.


File: guile.info,  Node: Using Other Languages,  Next: Emacs Lisp,  Up: Other Languages

6.24.1 Using Other Languages
----------------------------

There are currently only two ways to access other languages from within
Guile: at the REPL, and programmatically, via ‘compile’,
‘read-and-compile’, and ‘compile-file’.

   The REPL is Guile’s command prompt (*note* Using Guile
Interactively::).  The REPL has a concept of the “current language”,
which defaults to Scheme.  The user may change that language, via the
meta-command ‘,language’.

   For example, the following meta-command enables Emacs Lisp input:

     scheme@(guile-user)> ,language elisp
     Happy hacking with Emacs Lisp!  To switch back, type `,L scheme'.
     elisp@(guile-user)> (eq 1 2)
     $1 = #nil

   Each language has its short name: for example, ‘elisp’, for Elisp.
The same short name may be used to compile source code programmatically,
via ‘compile’:

     elisp@(guile-user)> ,L scheme
     Happy hacking with Guile Scheme!  To switch back, type `,L elisp'.
     scheme@(guile-user)> (compile '(eq 1 2) #:from 'elisp)
     $2 = #nil

   Granted, as the input to ‘compile’ is a datum, this works best for
Lispy languages, which have a straightforward datum representation.
Other languages that need more parsing are better dealt with as strings.

   The easiest way to deal with syntax-heavy language is with files, via
‘compile-file’ and friends.  However it is possible to invoke a
language’s reader on a port, and then compile the resulting expression
(which is a datum at that point).  For more information, *Note*
Compilation::.

   For more details on introspecting aspects of different languages,
*Note* Compiler Tower::.

6.24.2 Emacs Lisp
-----------------

Emacs Lisp (Elisp) is a dynamically-scoped Lisp dialect used in the
Emacs editor.  *Note* Overview: (elisp)top, for more information on Emacs
Lisp.

   We hope that eventually Guile’s implementation of Elisp will be good
enough to replace Emacs’ own implementation of Elisp.  For that reason,
we have thought long and hard about how to support the various features
of Elisp in a performant and compatible manner.

   Readers familiar with Emacs Lisp might be curious about how exactly
these various Elisp features are supported in Guile.  The rest of this
section focuses on addressing these concerns of the Elisp elect.

* Menu:

* Nil::                         A third boolean.
* Dynamic Binding::             Threadsafe bindings with fluids.
* Other Elisp Features::        Miscellany.


File: guile.info,  Node: Nil,  Next: Dynamic Binding,  Up: Emacs Lisp

### 6.24.2.1 Nil
............

‘nil’ in ELisp is an amalgam of Scheme’s ‘#f’ and ‘'()’.  It is false,
and it is the end-of-list; thus it is a boolean, and a list as well.

   Guile has chosen to support ‘nil’ as a separate value, distinct from
‘#f’ and ‘'()’.  This allows existing Scheme and Elisp code to maintain
their current semantics.  ‘nil’, which in Elisp would just be written
and read as ‘nil’, in Scheme has the external representation ‘#nil’.

   In Elisp code, ‘#nil’, ‘#f’, and ‘'()’ behave like ‘nil’, in the
sense that they are all interpreted as ‘nil’ by Elisp ‘if’, ‘cond’,
‘when’, ‘not’, ‘null’, etc.  To test whether Elisp would interpret an
object as ‘nil’ from within Scheme code, use ‘nil?’:

 -- Scheme Procedure: nil? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ would be interpreted as ‘nil’ by Emacs Lisp
     code, else return ‘#f’.

          (nil? #nil) ⇒ #t
          (nil? #f)   ⇒ #t
          (nil? '())  ⇒ #t
          (nil? 3)    ⇒ #f

   This decision to have ‘nil’ as a low-level distinct value facilitates
interoperability between the two languages.  Guile has chosen to have
Scheme deal with ‘nil’ as follows:

     (boolean? #nil) ⇒ #t
     (not #nil) ⇒ #t
     (null? #nil) ⇒ #t

   And in C, one has:

     scm_is_bool (SCM_ELISP_NIL) ⇒ 1
     scm_is_false (SCM_ELISP_NIL) ⇒ 1
     scm_is_null (SCM_ELISP_NIL) ⇒ 1

   In this way, a version of ‘fold’ written in Scheme can correctly fold
a function written in Elisp (or in fact any other language) over a
nil-terminated list, as Elisp makes.  The converse holds as well; a
version of ‘fold’ written in Elisp can fold over a ‘'()’-terminated
list, as made by Scheme.

   On a low level, the bit representations for ‘#f’, ‘#t’, ‘nil’, and
‘'()’ are made in such a way that they differ by only one bit, and so a
test for, for example, ‘#f’-or-‘nil’ may be made very efficiently.  See
‘libguile/boolean.h’, for more information.

Equality
........

Since Scheme’s ‘equal?’ must be transitive, and ‘'()’ is not ‘equal?’ to
‘#f’, to Scheme ‘nil’ is not ‘equal?’ to ‘#f’ or ‘'()’.

     (eq? #f '()) ⇒ #f
     (eq? #nil '()) ⇒ #f
     (eq? #nil #f) ⇒ #f
     (eqv? #f '()) ⇒ #f
     (eqv? #nil '()) ⇒ #f
     (eqv? #nil #f) ⇒ #f
     (equal? #f '()) ⇒ #f
     (equal? #nil '()) ⇒ #f
     (equal? #nil #f) ⇒ #f

   However, in Elisp, ‘'()’, ‘#f’, and ‘nil’ are all ‘equal’ (though not
‘eq’).

     (defvar f (make-scheme-false))
     (defvar eol (make-scheme-null))
     (eq f eol) ⇒ nil
     (eq nil eol) ⇒ nil
     (eq nil f) ⇒ nil
     (equal f eol) ⇒ t
     (equal nil eol) ⇒ t
     (equal nil f) ⇒ t

   These choices facilitate interoperability between Elisp and Scheme
code, but they are not perfect.  Some code that is correct standard
Scheme is not correct in the presence of a second false and null value.
For example:

     (define (truthiness x)
       (if (eq? x #f)
           #f
           #t))

   This code seems to be meant to test a value for truth, but now that
there are two false values, ‘#f’ and ‘nil’, it is no longer correct.

   Similarly, there is the loop:

     (define (my-length l)
       (let lp ((l l) (len 0))
         (if (eq? l '())
             len
             (lp (cdr l) (1+ len)))))

   Here, ‘my-length’ will raise an error if L is a ‘nil’-terminated
list.

   Both of these examples are correct standard Scheme, but, depending on
what they really want to do, they are not correct Guile Scheme.
Correctly written, they would test the _properties_ of falsehood or
nullity, not the individual members of that set.  That is to say, they
should use ‘not’ or ‘null?’ to test for falsehood or nullity, not ‘eq?’
or ‘memv’ or the like.

   Fortunately, using ‘not’ and ‘null?’ is in good style, so all
well-written standard Scheme programs are correct, in Guile Scheme.

   Here are correct versions of the above examples:

     (define (truthiness* x)
       (if (not x)
           #f
           #t))
     ;; or: (define (t* x) (not (not x)))
     ;; or: (define (t** x) x)

     (define (my-length* l)
       (let lp ((l l) (len 0))
         (if (null? l)
             len
             (lp (cdr l) (1+ len)))))

   This problem has a mirror-image case in Elisp:

     (defun my-falsep (x)
       (if (eq x nil)
           t
           nil))

   Guile can warn when compiling code that has equality comparisons with
‘#f’, ‘'()’, or ‘nil’.  *Note* Compilation::, for details.

In contrast to Scheme, which uses “lexical scoping”, Emacs Lisp scopes
its variables dynamically.  Guile supports dynamic scoping with its
“fluids” facility.  *Note* Fluids and Dynamic States::, for more

6.24.3 ECMAScript
-----------------

ECMAScript
(http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf)
was not the first non-Schemey language implemented by Guile, but it was
the first implemented for Guile’s bytecode compiler.  The goal was to
support ECMAScript version 3.1, a relatively small language, but the
implementor was completely irresponsible and got distracted by other
things before finishing the standard library, and even some bits of the
syntax.  So, ECMAScript does deserve a mention in the manual, but it
doesn’t deserve an endorsement until its implementation is completed,
perhaps by some more responsible hacker.

   In the meantime, the charitable user might investigate such
invocations as ‘,L ecmascript’ and ‘cat
test-suite/tests/ecmascript.test’.

6.25 Support for Internationalization
=====================================

Guile provides internationalization(1) support for Scheme programs in
two ways.  First, procedures to manipulate text and data in a way that
conforms to particular cultural conventions (i.e., in a
“locale-dependent” way) are provided in the ‘(ice-9 i18n)’.  Second,
Guile allows the use of GNU ‘gettext’ to translate program message
strings.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For concision and style, programmers often like to refer to
internationalization as “i18n”.


File: guile.info,  Node: i18n Introduction,  Next: Text Collation,  Prev: Internationalization,  Up: Internationalization

6.25.1 Internationalization with Guile
--------------------------------------

In order to make use of the functions described thereafter, the ‘(ice-9
i18n)’ module must be imported in the usual way:

     (use-modules (ice-9 i18n))

   The ‘(ice-9 i18n)’ module provides procedures to manipulate text and
other data in a way that conforms to the cultural conventions chosen by
the user.  Each region of the world or language has its own customs to,
for instance, represent real numbers, classify characters, collate text,
etc.  All these aspects comprise the so-called “cultural conventions” of
that region or language.

   Computer systems typically refer to a set of cultural conventions as
a “locale”.  For each particular aspect that comprise those cultural
conventions, a “locale category” is defined.  For instance, the way
characters are classified is defined by the ‘LC_CTYPE’ category, while
the language in which program messages are issued to the user is defined
by the ‘LC_MESSAGES’ category (*note* General Locale Information:
Locales. for details).

   The procedures provided by this module allow the development of
programs that adapt automatically to any locale setting.  As we will see
later, many of these procedures can optionally take a “locale object”
argument.  This additional argument defines the locale settings that
must be followed by the invoked procedure.  When it is omitted, then the
current locale settings of the process are followed (*note* ‘setlocale’:
Locales.).

   The following procedures allow the manipulation of such locale
objects.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-locale category-list locale-name
          [base-locale]
 -- C Function: scm_make_locale (category_list, locale_name,
          base_locale)
     Return a reference to a data structure representing a set of locale
     datasets.  LOCALE-NAME should be a string denoting a particular
     locale (e.g., ‘"aa_DJ"’) and CATEGORY-LIST should be either a list
     of locale categories or a single category as used with ‘setlocale’
     (*note* ‘setlocale’: Locales.).  Optionally, if ‘base-locale’ is
     passed, it should be a locale object denoting settings for
     categories not listed in CATEGORY-LIST.

     The following invocation creates a locale object that combines the
     use of Swedish for messages and character classification with the
     default settings for the other categories (i.e., the settings of
     the default ‘C’ locale which usually represents conventions in use
     in the USA):

          (make-locale (list LC_MESSAGES LC_CTYPE) "sv_SE")

     The following example combines the use of Esperanto messages and
     conventions with monetary conventions from Croatia:

          (make-locale LC_MONETARY "hr_HR"
                       (make-locale LC_ALL "eo_EO"))

     A ‘system-error’ exception (*note* Handling Errors::) is raised by
     ‘make-locale’ when LOCALE-NAME does not match any of the locales
     compiled on the system.  Note that on non-GNU systems, this error
     may be raised later, when the locale object is actually used.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale? obj
 -- C Function: scm_locale_p (obj)
     Return true if OBJ is a locale object.

 -- Scheme Variable: %global-locale
 -- C Variable: scm_global_locale
     This variable is bound to a locale object denoting the current
     process locale as installed using ‘setlocale ()’ (*note* Locales::).
     It may be used like any other locale object, including as a third
     argument to ‘make-locale’, for instance.

6.25.2 Text Collation
---------------------

The following procedures provide support for text collation, i.e.,
locale-dependent string and character sorting.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-locale<? s1 s2 [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_string_locale_lt (s1, s2, locale)
 -- Scheme Procedure: string-locale>? s1 s2 [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_string_locale_gt (s1, s2, locale)
 -- Scheme Procedure: string-locale-ci<? s1 s2 [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_string_locale_ci_lt (s1, s2, locale)
 -- Scheme Procedure: string-locale-ci>? s1 s2 [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_string_locale_ci_gt (s1, s2, locale)
     Compare strings S1 and S2 in a locale-dependent way.  If LOCALE is
     provided, it should be locale object (as returned by ‘make-locale’)
     and will be used to perform the comparison; otherwise, the current
     system locale is used.  For the ‘-ci’ variants, the comparison is
     made in a case-insensitive way.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-locale-ci=? s1 s2 [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_string_locale_ci_eq (s1, s2, locale)
     Compare strings S1 and S2 in a case-insensitive, and
     locale-dependent way.  If LOCALE is provided, it should be a locale
     object (as returned by ‘make-locale’) and will be used to perform
     the comparison; otherwise, the current system locale is used.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-locale<? c1 c2 [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_char_locale_lt (c1, c2, locale)
 -- Scheme Procedure: char-locale>? c1 c2 [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_char_locale_gt (c1, c2, locale)
 -- Scheme Procedure: char-locale-ci<? c1 c2 [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_char_locale_ci_lt (c1, c2, locale)
 -- Scheme Procedure: char-locale-ci>? c1 c2 [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_char_locale_ci_gt (c1, c2, locale)
     Compare characters C1 and C2 according to either LOCALE (a locale
     object as returned by ‘make-locale’) or the current locale.  For
     the ‘-ci’ variants, the comparison is made in a case-insensitive
     way.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-locale-ci=? c1 c2 [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_char_locale_ci_eq (c1, c2, locale)
     Return true if character C1 is equal to C2, in a case insensitive
     way according to LOCALE or to the current locale.

6.25.3 Character Case Mapping
-----------------------------

The procedures below provide support for “character case mapping”, i.e.,
to convert characters or strings to their upper-case or lower-case
equivalent.  Note that SRFI-13 provides procedures that look similar
(*note* Alphabetic Case Mapping::).  However, the SRFI-13 procedures are
locale-independent.  Therefore, they do not take into account
specificities of the customs in use in a particular language or region
of the world.  For instance, while most languages using the Latin
alphabet map lower-case letter “i” to upper-case letter “I”, Turkish
maps lower-case “i” to “Latin capital letter I with dot above”.  The
following procedures allow programmers to provide idiomatic character
mapping.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-locale-downcase chr [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_char_locale_upcase (chr, locale)
     Return the lowercase character that corresponds to CHR according to
     either LOCALE or the current locale.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-locale-upcase chr [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_char_locale_downcase (chr, locale)
     Return the uppercase character that corresponds to CHR according to
     either LOCALE or the current locale.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-locale-titlecase chr [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_char_locale_titlecase (chr, locale)
     Return the titlecase character that corresponds to CHR according to
     either LOCALE or the current locale.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-locale-upcase str [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_string_locale_upcase (str, locale)
     Return a new string that is the uppercase version of STR according
     to either LOCALE or the current locale.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-locale-downcase str [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_string_locale_downcase (str, locale)
     Return a new string that is the down-case version of STR according
     to either LOCALE or the current locale.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-locale-titlecase str [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_string_locale_titlecase (str, locale)
     Return a new string that is the titlecase version of STR according
     to either LOCALE or the current locale.

6.25.4 Number Input and Output
------------------------------

The following procedures allow programs to read and write numbers
written according to a particular locale.  As an example, in English,
“ten thousand and a half” is usually written ‘10,000.5’ while in French
it is written ‘10 000,5’.  These procedures allow such differences to be
taken into account.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-string->integer str [base [locale]]
 -- C Function: scm_locale_string_to_integer (str, base, locale)
     Convert string STR into an integer according to either LOCALE (a
     locale object as returned by ‘make-locale’) or the current process
     locale.  If BASE is specified, then it determines the base of the
     integer being read (e.g., ‘16’ for an hexadecimal number, ‘10’ for
     a decimal number); by default, decimal numbers are read.  Return
     two values (*note* Multiple Values::): an integer (on success) or
     ‘#f’, and the number of characters read from STR (‘0’ on failure).

     This function is based on the C library’s ‘strtol’ function (*note*
     ‘strtol’: (libc)Parsing of Integers.).

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-string->inexact str [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_locale_string_to_inexact (str, locale)
     Convert string STR into an inexact number according to either
     LOCALE (a locale object as returned by ‘make-locale’) or the
     current process locale.  Return two values (*note* Multiple
     Values::): an inexact number (on success) or ‘#f’, and the number
     of characters read from STR (‘0’ on failure).

     This function is based on the C library’s ‘strtod’ function (*note*
     ‘strtod’: (libc)Parsing of Floats.).

 -- Scheme Procedure: number->locale-string number [fraction-digits
          [locale]]
     Convert NUMBER (an inexact) into a string according to the cultural
     conventions of either LOCALE (a locale object) or the current
     locale.  By default, print as many fractional digits as necessary,
     up to an upper bound.  Optionally, FRACTION-DIGITS may be bound to
     an integer specifying the number of fractional digits to be
     displayed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: monetary-amount->locale-string amount intl?
          [locale]
     Convert AMOUNT (an inexact denoting a monetary amount) into a
     string according to the cultural conventions of either LOCALE (a
     locale object) or the current locale.  If INTL? is true, then the
     international monetary format for the given locale is used (*note*
     international and locale monetary formats: (libc)Currency Symbol.).

6.25.5 Accessing Locale Information
-----------------------------------

It is sometimes useful to obtain very specific information about a
locale such as the word it uses for days or months, its format for
representing floating-point figures, etc.  The ‘(ice-9 i18n)’ module
provides support for this in a way that is similar to the libc functions
‘nl_langinfo ()’ and ‘localeconv ()’ (*note* accessing locale information
from C: (libc)Locale Information.).  The available functions are listed
below.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-encoding [locale]
     Return the name of the encoding (a string whose interpretation is
     system-dependent) of either LOCALE or the current locale.

   The following functions deal with dates and times.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-day day [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-day-short day [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-month month [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-month-short month [locale]
     Return the word (a string) used in either LOCALE or the current
     locale to name the day (or month) denoted by DAY (or MONTH), an
     integer between 1 and 7 (or 1 and 12).  The ‘-short’ variants
     provide an abbreviation instead of a full name.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-am-string [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-pm-string [locale]
     Return a (potentially empty) string that is used to denote ante
     meridiem (or post meridiem) hours in 12-hour format.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-date+time-format [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-date-format [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-time-format [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-time+am/pm-format [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-era-date-format [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-era-date+time-format [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-era-time-format [locale]
     These procedures return format strings suitable to ‘strftime’
     (*note* Time::) that may be used to display (part of) a date/time
     according to certain constraints and to the conventions of either
     LOCALE or the current locale (*note* the ‘nl_langinfo ()’ items:
     (libc)The Elegant and Fast Way.).

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-era [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-era-year [locale]
     These functions return, respectively, the era and the year of the
     relevant era used in LOCALE or the current locale.  Most locales do
     not define this value.  In this case, the empty string is returned.
     An example of a locale that does define this value is the Japanese
     one.

   The following procedures give information about number
representation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-decimal-point [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-thousands-separator [locale]
     These functions return a string denoting the representation of the
     decimal point or that of the thousand separator (respectively) for
     either LOCALE or the current locale.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-digit-grouping [locale]
     Return a (potentially circular) list of integers denoting how
     digits of the integer part of a number are to be grouped, starting
     at the decimal point and going to the left.  The list contains
     integers indicating the size of the successive groups, from right
     to left.  If the list is non-circular, then no grouping occurs for
     digits beyond the last group.

     For instance, if the returned list is a circular list that contains
     only ‘3’ and the thousand separator is ‘","’ (as is the case with
     English locales), then the number ‘12345678’ should be printed
     ‘12,345,678’.

   The following procedures deal with the representation of monetary
amounts.  Some of them take an additional INTL? argument (a boolean)
that tells whether the international or local monetary conventions for
the given locale are to be used.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-monetary-decimal-point [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-monetary-thousands-separator [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-monetary-grouping [locale]
     These are the monetary counterparts of the above procedures.  These
     procedures apply to monetary amounts.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-currency-symbol intl? [locale]
     Return the currency symbol (a string) of either LOCALE or the
     current locale.

     The following example illustrates the difference between the local
     and international monetary formats:

          (define us (make-locale LC_MONETARY "en_US"))
          (locale-currency-symbol #f us)
          ⇒ "-$"
          (locale-currency-symbol #t us)
          ⇒ "USD "

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-monetary-fractional-digits intl? [locale]
     Return the number of fractional digits to be used when printing
     monetary amounts according to either LOCALE or the current locale.
     If the locale does not specify it, then ‘#f’ is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-currency-symbol-precedes-positive? intl?
          [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-currency-symbol-precedes-negative? intl?
          [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-positive-separated-by-space? intl? [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-negative-separated-by-space? intl? [locale]
     These procedures return a boolean indicating whether the currency
     symbol should precede a positive/negative number, and whether a
     whitespace should be inserted between the currency symbol and a
     positive/negative amount.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-monetary-positive-sign [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-monetary-negative-sign [locale]
     Return a string denoting the positive (respectively negative) sign
     that should be used when printing a monetary amount.

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-positive-sign-position
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-negative-sign-position
     These functions return a symbol telling where a sign of a
     positive/negative monetary amount is to appear when printing it.
     The possible values are:

     ‘parenthesize’
          The currency symbol and quantity should be surrounded by
          parentheses.
     ‘sign-before’
          Print the sign string before the quantity and currency symbol.
     ‘sign-after’
          Print the sign string after the quantity and currency symbol.
     ‘sign-before-currency-symbol’
          Print the sign string right before the currency symbol.
     ‘sign-after-currency-symbol’
          Print the sign string right after the currency symbol.
     ‘unspecified’
          Unspecified.  We recommend you print the sign after the
          currency symbol.

   Finally, the two following procedures may be helpful when programming
user interfaces:

 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-yes-regexp [locale]
 -- Scheme Procedure: locale-no-regexp [locale]
     Return a string that can be used as a regular expression to
     recognize a positive (respectively, negative) response to a yes/no
     question.  For the C locale, the default values are typically
     ‘"^[yY]"’ and ‘"^[nN]"’, respectively.

     Here is an example:

          (use-modules (ice-9 rdelim))
          (format #t "Does Guile rock?~%")
          (let lp ((answer (read-line)))
            (cond ((string-match (locale-yes-regexp) answer)
                   (format #t "High fives!~%"))
                  ((string-match (locale-no-regexp) answer)
                   (format #t "How about now? Does it rock yet?~%")
                   (lp (read-line)))
                  (else
                   (format #t "What do you mean?~%")
                   (lp (read-line)))))

     For an internationalized yes/no string output, ‘gettext’ should be
     used (*note* Gettext Support::).

   Example uses of some of these functions are the implementation of the
‘number->locale-string’ and ‘monetary-amount->locale-string’ procedures
(*note* Number Input and Output::), as well as that the SRFI-19 date and
time conversion to/from strings (*note* SRFI-19::).

6.25.6 Gettext Support
----------------------

Guile provides an interface to GNU ‘gettext’ for translating message
strings (*note* (gettext)Introduction::).

   Messages are collected in domains, so different libraries and
programs maintain different message catalogues.  The DOMAIN parameter in
the functions below is a string (it becomes part of the message catalog
filename).

   When ‘gettext’ is not available, or if Guile was configured
‘--without-nls’, dummy functions doing no translation are provided.
When ‘gettext’ support is available in Guile, the ‘i18n’ feature is
provided (*note* Feature Tracking::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: gettext msg [domain [category]]
 -- C Function: scm_gettext (msg, domain, category)
     Return the translation of MSG in DOMAIN.  DOMAIN is optional and
     defaults to the domain set through ‘textdomain’ below.  CATEGORY is
     optional and defaults to ‘LC_MESSAGES’ (*note* Locales::).

     Normal usage is for MSG to be a literal string.  ‘xgettext’ can
     extract those from the source to form a message catalogue ready for
     translators (*note* Invoking the ‘xgettext’ Program:
     (gettext)xgettext Invocation.).

          (display (gettext "You are in a maze of twisty passages."))

     It is conventional to use ‘G_’ as a shorthand for ‘gettext’.(1)
     Libraries can define ‘G_’ in such a way to look up translations
     using its specific DOMAIN, allowing different parts of a program to
     have different translation sources.

          (define (G_ msg) (gettext msg "mylibrary"))
          (display (G_ "File not found."))

     ‘G_’ is also a good place to perhaps strip disambiguating extra
     text from the message string, as for instance in *note* How to use
     ‘gettext’ in GUI programs: (gettext)GUI program problems.

 -- Scheme Procedure: ngettext msg msgplural n [domain [category]]
 -- C Function: scm_ngettext (msg, msgplural, n, domain, category)
     Return the translation of MSG/MSGPLURAL in DOMAIN, with a plural
     form chosen appropriately for the number N.  DOMAIN is optional and
     defaults to the domain set through ‘textdomain’ below.  CATEGORY is
     optional and defaults to ‘LC_MESSAGES’ (*note* Locales::).

     MSG is the singular form, and MSGPLURAL the plural.  When no
     translation is available, MSG is used if N = 1, or MSGPLURAL
     otherwise.  When translated, the message catalogue can have a
     different rule, and can have more than two possible forms.

     As per ‘gettext’ above, normal usage is for MSG and MSGPLURAL to be
     literal strings, since ‘xgettext’ can extract them from the source
     to build a message catalogue.  For example,

          (define (done n)
            (format #t (ngettext "~a file processed\n"
                                 "~a files processed\n" n)
                       n))

          (done 1) ⊣ 1 file processed
          (done 3) ⊣ 3 files processed

     It’s important to use ‘ngettext’ rather than plain ‘gettext’ for
     plurals, since the rules for singular and plural forms in English
     are not the same in other languages.  Only ‘ngettext’ will allow
     translators to give correct forms (*note* Additional functions for
     plural forms: (gettext)Plural forms.).

 -- Scheme Procedure: textdomain [domain]
 -- C Function: scm_textdomain (domain)
     Get or set the default gettext domain.  When called with no
     parameter the current domain is returned.  When called with a
     parameter, DOMAIN is set as the current domain, and that new value
     returned.  For example,

          (textdomain "myprog")
          ⇒ "myprog"

 -- Scheme Procedure: bindtextdomain domain [directory]
 -- C Function: scm_bindtextdomain (domain, directory)
     Get or set the directory under which to find message files for
     DOMAIN.  When called without a DIRECTORY the current setting is
     returned.  When called with a DIRECTORY, DIRECTORY is set for
     DOMAIN and that new setting returned.  For example,

          (bindtextdomain "myprog" "/my/tree/share/locale")
          ⇒ "/my/tree/share/locale"

     When using Autoconf/Automake, an application should arrange for the
     configured ‘localedir’ to get into the program (by substituting, or
     by generating a config file) and set that for its domain.  This
     ensures the catalogue can be found even when installed in a
     non-standard location.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bind-textdomain-codeset domain [encoding]
 -- C Function: scm_bind_textdomain_codeset (domain, encoding)
     Get or set the text encoding to be used by ‘gettext’ for messages
     from DOMAIN.  ENCODING is a string, the name of a coding system,
     for instance "8859_1".  (On a Unix/POSIX system the ‘iconv’ program
     can list all available encodings.)

     When called without an ENCODING the current setting is returned, or
     ‘#f’ if none yet set.  When called with an ENCODING, it is set for
     DOMAIN and that new setting returned.  For example,

          (bind-textdomain-codeset "myprog")
          ⇒ #f
          (bind-textdomain-codeset "myprog" "latin-9")
          ⇒ "latin-9"

     The encoding requested can be different from the translated data
     file, messages will be recoded as necessary.  But note that when
     there is no translation, ‘gettext’ returns its MSG unchanged, ie.
     without any recoding.  For that reason source message strings are
     best as plain ASCII.

     Currently Guile has no understanding of multi-byte characters, and
     string functions won’t recognise character boundaries in multi-byte
     strings.  An application will at least be able to pass such strings
     through to some output though.  Perhaps this will change in the
     future.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Users of ‘gettext’ might be a bit surprised that ‘G_’ is the
conventional abbreviation for ‘gettext’.  In most other languages, the
conventional shorthand is ‘_’.  Guile uses ‘G_’ because ‘_’ is already
taken, as it is bound to a syntactic keyword used by ‘syntax-rules’,
‘match’, and other macros.

6.26 Debugging Infrastructure
=============================

In order to understand Guile’s debugging facilities, you first need to
understand a little about how Guile represents the Scheme control stack.
With that in place we explain the low level trap calls that the virtual
machine can be configured to make, and the trap and breakpoint
infrastructure that builds on top of those calls.

6.26.1 Evaluation and the Scheme Stack
--------------------------------------

The idea of the Scheme stack is central to a lot of debugging.  The
Scheme stack is a reified representation of the pending function returns
in an expression’s continuation.  As Guile implements function calls
using a stack, this reification takes the form of a number of nested
stack frames, each of which corresponds to the application of a
procedure to a set of arguments.

   A Scheme stack always exists implicitly, and can be summoned into
concrete existence as a first-class Scheme value by the ‘make-stack’
call, so that an introspective Scheme program – such as a debugger – can
present it in some way and allow the user to query its details.  The
first thing to understand, therefore, is how Guile’s function call
convention creates the stack.

   Broadly speaking, Guile represents all control flow on a stack.
Calling a function involves pushing an empty frame on the stack, then
evaluating the procedure and its arguments, then fixing up the new frame
so that it points to the old one.  Frames on the stack are thus linked
together.  A tail call is the same, except it reuses the existing frame
instead of pushing on a new one.

   In this way, the only frames that are on the stack are “active”
frames, frames which need to do some work before the computation is
complete.  On the other hand, a function that has tail-called another
function will not be on the stack, as it has no work left to do.

   Therefore, when an error occurs in a running program, or the program
hits a breakpoint, or in fact at any point that the programmer chooses,
its state at that point can be represented by a “stack” of all the
procedure applications that are logically in progress at that time, each
of which is known as a “frame”.  The programmer can learn more about the
program’s state at that point by inspecting the stack and its frames.

* Stacks::                      Accessors for the stack data type.

### 6.26.1.1 Stack Capture
......................

A Scheme program can use the ‘make-stack’ primitive anywhere in its
code, with first arg ‘#t’, to construct a Scheme value that describes
the Scheme stack at that point.

     (make-stack #t)
     ⇒
     #<stack 25205a0>

   Use ‘start-stack’ to limit the stack extent captured by future
‘make-stack’ calls.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-stack obj arg ...
 -- C Function: scm_make_stack (obj, args)
     Create a new stack.  If OBJ is ‘#t’, the current evaluation stack
     is used for creating the stack frames, otherwise the frames are
     taken from OBJ (which must be a continuation or a frame object).

     ARG ... can be any combination of integer, procedure, address
     range, and prompt tag values.

     These values specify various ways of cutting away uninteresting
     stack frames from the top and bottom of the stack that ‘make-stack’
     returns.  They come in pairs like this: ‘(INNER_CUT_1 OUTER_CUT_1
     INNER_CUT_2 OUTER_CUT_2 ...)’.

     Each INNER_CUT_I can be an integer, a procedure, an address range,
     or a prompt tag.  An integer means to cut away exactly that number
     of frames.  A procedure means to cut away all frames up to but
     excluding the frame whose procedure matches the specified one.  An
     address range is a pair of integers indicating the low and high
     addresses of a procedure’s code, and is the same as cutting away to
     a procedure (though with less work).  Anything else is interpreted
     as a prompt tag which cuts away all frames that are inside a prompt
     with the given tag.

     Each OUTER_CUT_I can likewise be an integer, a procedure, an
     address range, or a prompt tag.  An integer means to cut away that
     number of frames.  A procedure means to cut away frames down to but
     excluding the frame whose procedure matches the specified one.  An
     address range is the same, but with the procedure’s code specified
     as an address range.  Anything else is taken to be a prompt tag,
     which cuts away all frames that are outside a prompt with the given
     tag.

     If the OUTER_CUT_I of the last pair is missing, it is taken as 0.

 -- Scheme Syntax: start-stack id exp
     Evaluate EXP on a new calling stack with identity ID.  If EXP is
     interrupted during evaluation, backtraces will not display frames
     farther back than EXP’s top-level form.  This macro is a way of
     artificially limiting backtraces and stack procedures, largely as a
     convenience to the user.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stack? obj
 -- C Function: scm_stack_p (obj)
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a calling stack.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stack-id stack
 -- C Function: scm_stack_id (stack)
     Return the identifier given to STACK by ‘start-stack’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stack-length stack

 -- C Function: scm_display_backtrace_with_highlights (stack, port,
          first, depth, highlights)
 -- C Function: scm_display_backtrace (stack, port, first, depth)
     Display a backtrace to the output port PORT.  STACK is the stack to
     take the backtrace from, FIRST specifies where in the stack to
     start and DEPTH how many frames to display.  FIRST and DEPTH can be
     ‘#f’, which means that default values will be used.  If HIGHLIGHTS
     is given it should be a list; the elements of this list will be
     highlighted wherever they appear in the backtrace.

 -- Scheme Procedure: frame-previous frame
 -- C Function: scm_frame_previous (frame)
     Return the previous frame of FRAME, or ‘#f’ if FRAME is the first
     frame in its stack.

 -- Scheme Procedure: frame-procedure-name frame
 -- C Function: scm_frame_procedure_name (frame)

     Accessors for the three saved VM registers in a frame: the previous
     frame pointer, the single-value return address, and the
     multiple-value return address.  *Note* Stack Layout::, for more
     information.

 -- Scheme Procedure: frame-bindings frame
     Return a list of binding records indicating the local variables
     that are live in a frame.

 -- Scheme Procedure: frame-lookup-binding frame var
     Fetch the bindings in FRAME, and return the first one whose name is
     VAR, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: binding-index binding
 -- Scheme Procedure: binding-name binding
 -- Scheme Procedure: binding-slot binding
 -- Scheme Procedure: binding-representation binding
     Accessors for the various fields in a binding.  The implicit
     “callee” argument is index 0, the first argument is index 1, and so
     on to the end of the arguments.  After that are temporary
     variables.  Note that if a variable is dead, it might not be
     available.

 -- Scheme Procedure: binding-ref binding
 -- Scheme Procedure: binding-set! binding val
     Accessors for the values of local variables in a frame.

 -- Scheme Procedure: display-application frame [port [indent]]
 -- C Function: scm_display_application (frame, port, indent)
     Display a procedure application FRAME to the output port PORT.
     INDENT specifies the indentation of the output.

   Additionally, the ‘(system vm frame)’ module defines a number of
higher-level introspective procedures, for example to retrieve the names
of local variables, and the source location to correspond to a frame.
See its source code for more details.

6.26.2 Source Properties
------------------------

How best to associate source locations with datums parsed from a port?
The right way to do this is to annotate all components of each parsed
datum.  *Note* Annotated Scheme Read::, for more on ‘read-syntax’.

   Guile only switched to use ‘read-syntax’ in 2021, however.  For the
previous thirty years, it used a mechanism known as “source properties”.

   As Guile reads in Scheme code from file or from standard input, it
can record the file name, line number and column number where each
expression begins in a side table.

   The way that this side table associates datums with source properties
has a limitation, however: Guile can only associate source properties
with freshly allocated objects.  This notably excludes individual
symbols, keywords, characters, booleans, or small integers.  This
limitation finally motivated the switch to ‘read-syntax’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: supports-source-properties? obj
 -- C Function: scm_supports_source_properties_p (obj)
     Return #t if source properties can be associated with OBJ,
     otherwise return #f.

   The recording of source properties is controlled by the read option
named “positions” (*note* Scheme Read::).  This option is switched _on_
by default.  Now that ‘read-syntax’ is available, however, Guile may
change the default for this flag to off in the future.

   The following procedures can be used to access and set the source
properties of read expressions.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-source-properties! obj alist
 -- C Function: scm_set_source_properties_x (obj, alist)
     Install the association list ALIST as the source property list for
     OBJ.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-source-property! obj key datum
 -- C Function: scm_set_source_property_x (obj, key, datum)
     Set the source property of object OBJ, which is specified by KEY to
     DATUM.  Normally, the key will be a symbol.

 -- Scheme Procedure: source-properties obj
 -- C Function: scm_source_properties (obj)
     Return the source property association list of OBJ.

 -- Scheme Procedure: source-property obj key
 -- C Function: scm_source_property (obj, key)
     Return the property specified by KEY from OBJ’s source properties.

   If the ‘positions’ reader option is enabled, supported expressions
will have values set for the ‘filename’, ‘line’ and ‘column’ properties.

   Source properties are also associated with syntax objects.
Procedural macros can get at the source location of their input using
the ‘syntax-source’ accessor.  *Note* Syntax Transformer Helpers::, for
more.

   Guile also defines a couple of convenience macros built on
‘syntax-source’:

 -- Scheme Syntax: current-source-location
     Expands to the source properties corresponding to the location of
     the ‘(current-source-location)’ form.

 -- Scheme Syntax: current-filename
     Expands to the current filename: the filename that the
     ‘(current-filename)’ form appears in.  Expands to ‘#f’ if this
     information is unavailable.

   If you’re stuck with defmacros (*note* Defmacros::), and want to
preserve source information, the following helper function might be
useful to you:

 -- Scheme Procedure: cons-source xorig x y
 -- C Function: scm_cons_source (xorig, x, y)
     Create and return a new pair whose car and cdr are X and Y.  Any
     source properties associated with XORIG are also associated with
     the new pair.

6.26.3 Programmatic Error Handling
----------------------------------

For better or for worse, all programs have bugs, and dealing with bugs
is part of programming.  This section deals with that class of bugs that
causes an exception to be raised – from your own code, from within a
library, or from Guile itself.

File: guile.info,  Node: Catching Exceptions,  Next: Pre-Unwind Debugging,  Up: Programmatic Error Handling

### 6.26.3.1 Catching Exceptions
............................

A common requirement is to be able to show as much useful context as
possible when a Scheme program hits an error.  The most immediate
information about an error is the kind of error that it is – such as
“division by zero” – and any parameters that the code which signalled
the error chose explicitly to provide.  This information originates with
the ‘error’ or ‘raise-exception’ call (or their C code equivalents, if
the error is detected by C code) that signals the error, and is passed
automatically to the handler procedure of the innermost applicable
exception handler.

   Therefore, to catch errors that occur within a chunk of Scheme code,
and to intercept basic information about those errors, you need to
execute that code inside the dynamic context of a
‘with-exception-handler’, or the equivalent in C.

   For example, to print out a message and return #f when an error
occurs, you might use:

     (define (catch-all thunk)
       (with-exception-handler
         (lambda (exn)
           (format (current-error-port)
                   "Uncaught exception: ~s\n" exn)
           #f)
         thunk
         #:unwind? #t))

     (catch-all
      (lambda () (error "Not a vegetable: tomato")))
     ⊣ Uncaught exception: #<&exception-with-kind-and-args ...>
     ⇒ #f

   *Note* Exceptions::, for full details.


File: guile.info,  Node: Pre-Unwind Debugging,  Next: Standard Error Handling,  Prev: Catching Exceptions,  Up: Programmatic Error Handling

### 6.26.3.2 Pre-Unwind Debugging
.............................

Sometimes when something goes wrong, what you want is not just a
representation of the exceptional situation, but the context that
brought about that situation.  The example in the previous section
passed ‘#:unwind #t’ to ‘with-exception-handler’, indicating that
‘raise-exception’ should unwind the stack before invoking the exception
handler.  However if you don’t take this approach and instead let the
exception handler be invoked in the context of the ‘raise-exception’,
you can print a backtrace, launch a recursive debugger, or take other
“pre-unwind” actions.

   The most basic idea would be to simply print a backtrace:

     (define (call-with-backtrace thunk)
       (with-exception-handler
         (lambda (exn)
           (backtrace)
           (raise-exception exn))
         thunk))

   Here we use the built-in ‘backtrace’ procedure to print the
backtrace.

 -- Scheme Procedure: backtrace [highlights]
 -- C Function: scm_backtrace_with_highlights (highlights)
 -- C Function: scm_backtrace ()
     Display a backtrace of the current stack to the current output
     port.  If HIGHLIGHTS is given it should be a list; the elements of
     this list will be highlighted wherever they appear in the
     backtrace.

   By re-raising the exception, ‘call-with-backtrace’ doesn’t actually
handle the error.  We could define a version that instead aborts the
computation:

     (use-modules (ice-9 control))
     (define (call-with-backtrace thunk)
       (let/ec cancel
         (with-exception-handler
           (lambda (exn)
             (backtrace)
             (cancel #f))
           thunk)))

   In this second example, we use an escape continuation to abort the
computation after printing the backtrace, returning ‘#f’ instead.

   It could be that you want to only print a limited backtrace.  In that
case, use ‘start-stack’:

     (use-modules (ice-9 control))
     (define (call-with-backtrace thunk)
       (let/ec cancel
         (start-stack 'stack-with-backtrace
           (with-exception-handler
             (lambda (exn)
               (backtrace)
               (cancel #f))
             thunk))))

   There are also more powerful, programmatic ways to walk the stack
using ‘make-stack’ and friends; see the API described in *note* Stacks::
and *note* Frames::.


File: guile.info,  Node: Standard Error Handling,  Next: Stack Overflow,  Prev: Pre-Unwind Debugging,  Up: Programmatic Error Handling

### 6.26.3.3 call-with-error-handling
.................................

The Guile REPL code (in ‘system/repl/repl.scm’ and related files) uses a
‘catch’ with a pre-unwind handler to capture the stack when an error
occurs in an expression that was typed into the REPL, and debug that
stack interactively in the context of the error.

   These procedures are available for use by user programs, in the
‘(system repl error-handling)’ module.

     (use-modules (system repl error-handling))

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-error-handling thunk [#:on-error
          on-error='debug] [#:post-error post-error='catch] [#:pass-keys
          pass-keys='(quit)] [#:report-keys
          report-keys='(stack-overflow)] [#:trap-handler
          trap-handler='debug]
     Call a thunk in a context in which errors are handled.

     Note that this function was written when ‘throw’/‘catch’ were the
     fundamental exception handling primitives in Guile, and so exposes
     some aspects of that interface (notably in the form of the
     procedural handlers).  Guile will probably replace this function
     with a ‘call-with-standard-exception-handling’ in the future.

     There are five keyword arguments:

     ON-ERROR
          Specifies what to do before the stack is unwound.

          Valid options are ‘debug’ (the default), which will enter a
          debugger; ‘pass’, in which case nothing is done, and the
          exception is rethrown; or a procedure, which will be the
          pre-unwind handler.

     POST-ERROR
          Specifies what to do after the stack is unwound.

          Valid options are ‘catch’ (the default), which will silently
          catch errors, returning the unspecified value; ‘report’, which
          prints out a description of the error (via ‘display-error’),
          and then returns the unspecified value; or a procedure, which
          will be the catch handler.

     TRAP-HANDLER
          Specifies a trap handler: what to do when a breakpoint is hit.

          Valid options are ‘debug’, which will enter the debugger;
          ‘pass’, which does nothing; or ‘disabled’, which disables
          traps entirely.  *Note* Traps::, for more information.

     PASS-KEYS
          A set of keys to ignore, as a list.

     REPORT-KEYS
          A set of keys to always report even if the post-error handler
          is ‘catch’, as a list.

### 6.26.3.4 Stack Overflow
.......................

Every time a Scheme program makes a call that is not in tail position,
it pushes a new frame onto the stack.  Returning a value from a function
pops the top frame off the stack.  Stack frames take up memory, and as
nobody has an infinite amount of memory, deep recursion could cause
Guile to run out of memory.  Running out of stack memory is called
“stack overflow”.

### Stack Limits
............

Most languages have a terrible stack overflow story.  For example, in C,
if you use too much stack, your program will exhibit “undefined
behavior”, which if you are lucky means that it will crash.  It’s
especially bad in C, as you neither know ahead of time how much stack
your functions use, nor the stack limit imposed by the user’s system,
and the stack limit is often quite small relative to the total memory
size.

   Managed languages like Python have a better error story, as they are
defined to raise an exception on stack overflow – but like C, Python and
most dynamic languages still have a fixed stack size limit that is
usually much smaller than the heap.

   Arbitrary stack limits would have an unfortunate effect on Guile
programs.  For example, the following implementation of the inner loop
of ‘map’ is clean and elegant:

     (define (map f l)
       (if (pair? l)
           (cons (f (car l))
                 (map f (cdr l)))
           '()))

   However, if there were a stack limit, that would limit the size of
lists that can be processed with this ‘map’.  Eventually, you would have
to rewrite it to use iteration with an accumulator:

     (define (map f l)
       (let lp ((l l) (out '()))
         (if (pair? l)
             (lp (cdr l) (cons (f (car l)) out))
             (reverse out))))

   This second version is sadly not as clear, and it also allocates more
heap memory (once to build the list in reverse, and then again to
reverse the list).  You would be tempted to use the destructive
‘reverse!’ to save memory and time, but then your code would not be
continuation-safe – if F returned again after the map had finished, it
would see an OUT list that had already been reversed.  The recursive
‘map’ has none of these problems.

   Guile has no stack limit for Scheme code.  When a thread makes its
first Guile call, a small stack is allocated – just one page of memory.
Whenever that memory limit would be reached, Guile arranges to grow the
stack by a factor of two.  When garbage collection happens, Guile
arranges to return the unused part of the stack to the operating system,
but without causing the stack to shrink.  In this way, the stack can
grow to consume up to all memory available to the Guile process, and
when the recursive computation eventually finishes, that stack memory is
returned to the system.

### Exceptional Situations
......................

Of course, it’s still possible to run out of stack memory.  The most
common cause of this is program bugs that cause unbounded recursion, as
in:

     (define (faulty-map f l)
       (if (pair? l)
           (cons (f (car l)) (faulty-map f l))
           '()))

   Did you spot the bug?  The recursive call to ‘faulty-map’ recursed on
L, not ‘(cdr L)’.  Running this program would cause Guile to use up all
memory in your system, and eventually Guile would fail to grow the
stack.  At that point you have a problem: Guile needs to raise an
exception to unwind the stack and return memory to the system, but the
user might have exception handlers in place (*note* Raising and Handling
Exceptions::) that want to run before the stack is unwound, and we don’t
have any stack in which to run them.

   Therefore in this case, Guile raises an unwind-only exception that
does not run pre-unwind handlers.  Because this is such an odd case,
Guile prints out a message on the console, in case the user was
expecting to be able to get a backtrace from any pre-unwind handler.

### Runaway Recursion
.................

Still, this failure mode is not so nice.  If you are running an
environment in which you are interactively building a program while it
is running, such as at a REPL, you might want to impose an artificial
stack limit on the part of your program that you are building to detect
accidental runaway recursion.  For that purpose, there is
‘call-with-stack-overflow-handler’, from ‘(system vm vm)’.

     (use-module (system vm vm))

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-stack-overflow-handler limit thunk
          handler
     Call THUNK in an environment in which the stack limit has been
     reduced to LIMIT additional words.  If the limit is reached,
     HANDLER (a thunk) will be invoked in the dynamic environment of the
     error.  For the extent of the call to HANDLER, the stack limit and
     handler are restored to the values that were in place when
     ‘call-with-stack-overflow-handler’ was called.

     Usually, HANDLER should raise an exception or abort to an outer
     prompt.  However if HANDLER does return, it should return a number
     of additional words of stack space to allow to the inner
     environment.

   A stack overflow handler may only ever “credit” the inner thunk with
stack space that was available when the handler was instated.  When
Guile first starts, there is no stack limit in place, so the outer
handler may allow the inner thunk an arbitrary amount of space, but any
nested stack overflow handler will not be able to consume more than its
limit.

   Unlike the unwind-only exception that is thrown if Guile is unable to
grow its stack, any exception thrown by a stack overflow handler might
invoke pre-unwind handlers.  Indeed, the stack overflow handler is
itself a pre-unwind handler of sorts.  If the code imposing the stack
limit wants to protect itself against malicious pre-unwind handlers from
the inner thunk, it should abort to a prompt of its own making instead
of throwing an exception that might be caught by the inner thunk.

### C Stack Usage
.............

It is also possible for Guile to run out of space on the C stack.  If
you call a primitive procedure which then calls a Scheme procedure in a
loop, you will consume C stack space.  Guile tries to detect excessive
consumption of C stack space, throwing an error when you have hit 80% of
the process’ available stack (as allocated by the operating system), or
160 kilowords in the absence of a strict limit.

   For example, looping through ‘call-with-vm’, a primitive that calls a
thunk, gives us the following:

     scheme@(guile-user)> (use-modules (system vm vm))
     scheme@(guile-user)> (let lp () (call-with-vm lp))
     ERROR: Stack overflow

   Unfortunately, that’s all the information we get.  Overrunning the C
stack will throw an unwind-only exception, because it’s not safe to do
very much when you are close to the C stack limit.

   If you get an error like this, you can either try rewriting your code
to use less stack space, or increase the maximum stack size.  To
increase the maximum stack size, use ‘debug-set!’, for example:

     (debug-set! stack 200000)

   The next section describes ‘debug-set!’ more thoroughly.  Of course
the best thing is to have your code operate without so much resource
consumption by avoiding loops through C trampolines.

                             base names, while `#t' displays full names.
     warn-deprecated no      Warn when deprecated features are used.

   The boolean options may be toggled with ‘debug-enable’ and
‘debug-disable’.  The non-boolean options must be set using
‘debug-set!’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: debug-enable option-name
 -- Scheme Procedure: debug-disable option-name
 -- Scheme Syntax: debug-set! option-name value
     Modify the debug options.  ‘debug-enable’ should be used with
     boolean options and switches them on, ‘debug-disable’ switches them
     off.

     ‘debug-set!’ can be used to set an option to a specific value.  Due
     to historical oddities, it is a macro that expects an unquoted
     option name.

6.26.4 Traps
------------

Guile’s virtual machine can be configured to call out at key points to
arbitrary user-specified procedures.

   In principle, these “hooks” allow Scheme code to implement any model
it chooses for examining the evaluation stack as program execution
proceeds, and for suspending execution to be resumed later.

   VM hooks are very low-level, though, and so Guile also has a library
of higher-level “traps” on top of the VM hooks.  A trap is an execution
condition that, when fulfilled, will fire a handler.  For example, Guile
defines a trap that fires when control reaches a certain source
location.

   Finally, Guile also defines a third level of abstractions: per-thread
“trap states”.  A trap state exists to give names to traps, and to hold
on to the set of traps so that they can be enabled, disabled, or
removed.  The trap state infrastructure defines the most useful
abstractions for most cases.  For example, Guile’s REPL uses trap state
functions to set breakpoints and tracepoints.

   The following subsections describe all this in detail, for both the
user wanting to use traps, and the developer interested in understanding
how the interface hangs together.

* Menu:

* VM Hooks::                Modifying Guile’s virtual machine.

### 6.26.4.1 VM Hooks
.................

Everything that runs in Guile runs on its virtual machine, a C program
that defines a number of operations that Scheme programs can perform.

   Note that there are multiple VM “engines” for Guile.  Only some of
them have support for hooks compiled in.  Normally the deal is that you
get hooks if you are running interactively, and otherwise they are
disabled, as they do have some overhead (about 10 or 20 percent).

   To ensure that you are running with hooks, pass ‘--debug’ to Guile
when running your program, or otherwise use the ‘call-with-vm’ and
‘set-vm-engine!’ procedures to ensure that you are running in a VM with
the ‘debug’ engine.

   To digress, Guile’s VM has 4 different hooks that can be fired at
different times.  For implementation reasons, these hooks are not
actually implemented with first-class Scheme hooks (*note* Hooks::); they
are managed using an ad-hoc interface.

   VM hooks are called with one argument: the current frame.  *Note*
Frames::.  Since these hooks may be fired very frequently, Guile does a
terrible thing: it allocates the frames on the C stack instead of the
garbage-collected heap.

   The upshot here is that the frames are only valid within the dynamic
extent of the call to the hook.  If a hook procedure keeps a reference
to the frame outside the extent of the hook, bad things will happen.

   The interface to hooks is provided by the ‘(system vm vm)’ module:

     (use-modules (system vm vm))

All of these functions implicitly act on the VM for the current thread
only.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vm-add-next-hook! f
     Arrange to call F when before an instruction is retired (and
     executed).

 -- Scheme Procedure: vm-add-apply-hook! f
     Arrange to call F whenever a procedure is applied.  The frame
     locals will be the callee, followed by the arguments to the call.

     Note that procedure application is somewhat orthogonal to
     continuation pushes and pops.  To know whether a call is a tail
     call or not, with respect to the frame previously in place, check
     the value of the frame pointer compared the previous frame pointer.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vm-add-return-hook! f
     Arrange to call F before returning from a frame.  The values in the
     frame will be the frame’s return values.

     Note that it’s possible to return from an “inner” frame: one that
     was not immediately proceeded by a call with that frame pointer.
     In that case, it corresponds to a non-local control flow jump,
     either because of applying a composable continuation or because of
     restoring a saved undelimited continuation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vm-add-abort-hook!
     Arrange to call F after aborting to a prompt.  *Note* Prompts::.

     Unfortunately, the values passed to the prompt handler are not
     easily available to F.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vm-remove-next-hook! f
 -- Scheme Procedure: vm-remove-apply-hook! f
 -- Scheme Procedure: vm-remove-return-hook! f
 -- Scheme Procedure: vm-remove-abort-hook! f
     Remove F from the corresponding VM hook for the current thread.

   These hooks do impose a performance penalty, if they are on.
Obviously, the ‘vm-next-hook’ has quite an impact, performance-wise.
Therefore Guile exposes a single, heavy-handed knob to turn hooks on or
off, the “VM trace level”.  If the trace level is positive, hooks run;
otherwise they don’t.

   For convenience, when the VM fires a hook, it does so with the trap
level temporarily set to 0.  That way the hooks don’t fire while you’re
handling a hook.  The trace level is restored to whatever it was once
the hook procedure finishes.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vm-trace-level
     Retrieve the “trace level” of the VM. If positive, the trace hooks
     associated with VM will be run.  The initial trace level is 0.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-vm-trace-level! level
     Set the “trace level” of the VM.

virtual machine.

### 6.26.4.2 Trap Interface
.......................

The capabilities provided by hooks are great, but hooks alone rarely
correspond to what users want to do.

   For example, if a user wants to break when and if control reaches a
certain source location, how do you do it?  If you install a “next”
hook, you get unacceptable overhead for the execution of the entire
program.  It would be possible to install an “apply” hook, then if the
procedure encompasses those source locations, install a “next” hook, but
already you’re talking about one concept that might be implemented by a
varying number of lower-level concepts.

   It’s best to be clear about things and define one abstraction for all
such conditions: the “trap”.

   Considering the myriad capabilities offered by the hooks though,
there is only a minimum of functionality shared by all traps.  Guile’s
current take is to reduce this to the absolute minimum, and have the
only standard interface of a trap be “turn yourself on” or “turn
yourself off”.

   This interface sounds a bit strange, but it is useful to procedurally
compose higher-level traps from lower-level building blocks.  For
example, Guile defines a trap that calls one handler when control enters
a procedure, and another when control leaves the procedure.  Given that
trap, one can define a trap that adds to the next-hook only when within
a given procedure.  Building further, one can define a trap that fires
when control reaches particular instructions within a procedure.

   Or of course you can stop at any of these intermediate levels.  For
example, one might only be interested in calls to a given procedure.
But the point is that a simple enable/disable interface is all the
commonality that exists between the various kinds of traps, and
furthermore that such an interface serves to allow “higher-level” traps
to be composed from more primitive ones.

   Specifically, a trap, in Guile, is a procedure.  When a trap is
created, by convention the trap is enabled; therefore, the procedure
that is the trap will, when called, disable the trap, and return a
procedure that will enable the trap, and so on.

   Trap procedures take one optional argument: the current frame.  (A
trap may want to add to different sets of hooks depending on the frame
that is current at enable-time.)

   If this all sounds very complicated, it’s because it is.  Some of it
is essential, but probably most of it is not.  The advantage of using
this minimal interface is that composability is more lexically apparent
than when, for example, using a stateful interface based on GOOPS. But
perhaps this reflects the cognitive limitations of the programmer who
made the current interface more than anything else.

### 6.26.4.3 Low-Level Traps
........................

To summarize the last sections, traps are enabled or disabled, and when
they are enabled, they add to various VM hooks.

   Note, however, that _traps do not increase the VM trace level_.  So
if you create a trap, it will be enabled, but unless something else
increases the VM’s trace level (*note* VM Hooks::), the trap will not
fire.  It turns out that getting the VM trace level right is tricky
without a global view of what traps are enabled.  *Note* Trap States::,
for Guile’s answer to this problem.

   Traps are created by calling procedures.  Most of these procedures
share a set of common keyword arguments, so rather than document them
separately, we discuss them all together here:

‘#:vm’
     The VM to instrument.  Defaults to the current thread’s VM.
‘#:current-frame’
     For traps that enable more hooks depending on their dynamic
     context, this argument gives the current frame that the trap is
     running in.  Defaults to ‘#f’.

   To have access to these procedures, you’ll need to have imported the
‘(system vm traps)’ module:

     (use-modules (system vm traps))

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-at-procedure-call proc handler [#:vm]
     A trap that calls HANDLER when PROC is applied.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-in-procedure proc enter-handler exit-handler
          [#:current-frame] [#:vm]
     A trap that calls ENTER-HANDLER when control enters PROC, and
     EXIT-HANDLER when control leaves PROC.

     Control can enter a procedure via:
        • A procedure call.
        • A return to a procedure’s frame on the stack.
        • A continuation returning directly to an application of this
          procedure.

     Control can leave a procedure via:
        • A normal return from the procedure.
        • An application of another procedure.
        • An invocation of a continuation.
        • An abort.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-instructions-in-procedure proc next-handler
          exit-handler [#:current-frame] [#:vm]
     A trap that calls NEXT-HANDLER for every instruction executed in
     PROC, and EXIT-HANDLER when execution leaves PROC.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-at-procedure-ip-in-range proc range handler
          [#:current-frame] [#:vm]
     A trap that calls HANDLER when execution enters a range of
     instructions in PROC.  RANGE is a simple of pairs, ‘((START . END)
     ...)’.  The START addresses are inclusive, and END addresses are
     exclusive.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-at-source-location file user-line handler
          [#:current-frame] [#:vm]
     A trap that fires when control reaches a given source location.
     The USER-LINE parameter is one-indexed, as a user counts lines,
     instead of zero-indexed, as Guile counts lines.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-frame-finish frame return-handler
          abort-handler [#:vm]
     A trap that fires when control leaves the given frame.  FRAME
     should be a live frame in the current continuation.  RETURN-HANDLER
     will be called on a normal return, and ABORT-HANDLER on a nonlocal
     exit.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-in-dynamic-extent proc enter-handler
          return-handler abort-handler [#:vm]
     A more traditional dynamic-wind trap, which fires ENTER-HANDLER
     when control enters PROC, RETURN-HANDLER on a normal return, and
     ABORT-HANDLER on a nonlocal exit.

     Note that rewinds are not handled, so there is no rewind handler.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-calls-in-dynamic-extent proc apply-handler
          return-handler [#:current-frame] [#:vm]
     A trap that calls APPLY-HANDLER every time a procedure is applied,
     and RETURN-HANDLER for returns, but only during the dynamic extent
     of an application of PROC.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-instructions-in-dynamic-extent proc
          next-handler [#:current-frame] [#:vm]
     A trap that calls NEXT-HANDLER for all retired instructions within
     the dynamic extent of a call to PROC.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-calls-to-procedure proc apply-handler
          return-handler [#:vm]
     A trap that calls APPLY-HANDLER whenever PROC is applied, and
     RETURN-HANDLER when it returns, but with an additional argument,
     the call depth.

     That is to say, the handlers will get two arguments: the frame in
     question, and the call depth (a non-negative integer).

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-matching-instructions frame-pred handler
          [#:vm]
     A trap that calls FRAME-PRED at every instruction, and if
     FRAME-PRED returns a true value, calls HANDLER on the frame.

### 6.26.4.4 Tracing Traps
......................

The ‘(system vm trace)’ module defines a number of traps for tracing of
procedure applications.  When a procedure is “traced”, it means that
every call to that procedure is reported to the user during a program
run.  The idea is that you can mark a collection of procedures for
tracing, and Guile will subsequently print out a line of the form

     |  |  (PROCEDURE ARGS ...)

   whenever a marked procedure is about to be applied to its arguments.
This can help a programmer determine whether a function is being called
at the wrong time or with the wrong set of arguments.

   In addition, the indentation of the output is useful for
demonstrating how the traced applications are or are not tail recursive
with respect to each other.  Thus, a trace of a non-tail recursive
factorial implementation looks like this:

     scheme@(guile-user)> (define (fact1 n)
                            (if (zero? n) 1
                                (* n (fact1 (1- n)))))
     scheme@(guile-user)> ,trace (fact1 4)
     trace: (fact1 4)
     trace: |  (fact1 3)
     trace: |  |  (fact1 2)
     trace: |  |  |  (fact1 1)
     trace: |  |  |  |  (fact1 0)
     trace: |  |  |  |  1
     trace: |  |  |  1
     trace: |  |  2
     trace: |  6
     trace: 24

   While a typical tail recursive implementation would look more like
this:

     scheme@(guile-user)> (define (facti acc n)
                            (if (zero? n) acc
                                (facti (* n acc) (1- n))))
     scheme@(guile-user)> (define (fact2 n) (facti 1 n))
     scheme@(guile-user)> ,trace (fact2 4)
     trace: (fact2 4)
     trace: (facti 1 4)
     trace: (facti 4 3)
     trace: (facti 12 2)
     trace: (facti 24 1)
     trace: (facti 24 0)
     trace: 24

   The low-level traps below (*note* Low-Level Traps::) share some common
options:

‘#:width’
     The maximum width of trace output.  Trace printouts will try not to
     exceed this column, but for highly nested procedure calls, it may
     be unavoidable.  Defaults to 80.
‘#:vm’
     The VM on which to add the traps.  Defaults to the current thread’s
     VM.
‘#:prefix’
     A string to print out before each trace line.  As seen above in the
     examples, defaults to ‘"trace: "’.

   To have access to these procedures, you’ll need to have imported the
‘(system vm trace)’ module:

     (use-modules (system vm trace))

 -- Scheme Procedure: trace-calls-to-procedure proc [#:width] [#:vm]
          [#:prefix]
     Print a trace at applications of and returns from PROC.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trace-calls-in-procedure proc [#:width] [#:vm]
          [#:prefix]
     Print a trace at all applications and returns within the dynamic
     extent of calls to PROC.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trace-instructions-in-procedure proc [#:width]
          [#:vm]
     Print a trace at all instructions executed in the dynamic extent of
     calls to PROC.

   In addition, Guile defines a procedure to call a thunk, tracing all
procedure calls and returns within the thunk.

 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-trace thunk [#:calls?=#t]
          [#:instructions?=#f] [#:width=80]
     Call THUNK, tracing all execution within its dynamic extent.

     If CALLS? is true, Guile will print a brief report at each
     procedure call and return, as given above.

     If INSTRUCTIONS? is true, Guile will also print a message each time
     an instruction is executed.  This is a lot of output, but it is
     sometimes useful when doing low-level optimization.

     Note that because this procedure manipulates the VM trace level
     directly, it doesn’t compose well with traps at the REPL.

   *Note* Profile Commands::, for more information on tracing at the
REPL.

### 6.26.4.5 Trap States
....................

When multiple traps are present in a system, we begin to have a
bookkeeping problem.  How are they named?  How does one disable, enable,
or delete them?

   Guile’s answer to this is to keep an implicit per-thread “trap
state”.  The trap state object is not exposed to the user; rather, API
that works on trap states fetches the current trap state from the
dynamic environment.

   Traps are identified by integers.  A trap can be enabled, disabled,
or removed, and can have an associated user-visible name.

   These procedures have their own module:

     (use-modules (system vm trap-state))

 -- Scheme Procedure: add-trap! trap name
     Add a trap to the current trap state, associating the given NAME
     with it.  Returns a fresh trap identifier (an integer).

     Note that usually the more specific functions detailed in *note*
     High-Level Traps:: are used in preference to this one.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-traps
     List the current set of traps, both enabled and disabled.  Returns
     a list of integers.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-name idx
     Returns the name associated with trap IDX, or ‘#f’ if there is no
     such trap.

 -- Scheme Procedure: trap-enabled? idx
     Returns ‘#t’ if trap IDX is present and enabled, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: enable-trap! idx
     Enables trap IDX.

 -- Scheme Procedure: disable-trap! idx
     Disables trap IDX.

 -- Scheme Procedure: delete-trap! idx
     Removes trap IDX, disabling it first, if necessary.


File: guile.info,  Node: High-Level Traps,  Prev: Trap States,  Up: Traps

### 6.26.4.6 High-Level Traps
.........................

The low-level trap API allows one to make traps that call procedures,
and the trap state API allows one to keep track of what traps are there.
But neither of these APIs directly helps you when you want to set a
breakpoint, because it’s unclear what to do when the trap fires.  Do you
enter a debugger, or mail a summary of the situation to your great-aunt,
or what?

   So for the common case in which you just want to install breakpoints,
and then have them all result in calls to one parameterizable procedure,
we have the high-level trap interface.

   Perhaps we should have started this section with this interface, as
it’s clearly the one most people should use.  But as its capabilities
and limitations proceed from the lower layers, we felt that the
character-building exercise of building a mental model might be helpful.

   These procedures share a module with trap states:

     (use-modules (system vm trap-state))

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-default-trap-handler handler thunk
     Call THUNK in a dynamic context in which HANDLER is the current
     trap handler.

     Additionally, during the execution of THUNK, the VM trace level
     (*note* VM Hooks::) is set to the number of enabled traps.  This
     ensures that traps will in fact fire.

     HANDLER may be ‘#f’, in which case VM hooks are not enabled as they
     otherwise would be, as there is nothing to handle the traps.

   The trace-level-setting behavior of ‘with-default-trap-handler’ is
one of its more useful aspects, but if you are willing to forgo that,
and just want to install a global trap handler, there’s a function for
that too:

 -- Scheme Procedure: install-trap-handler! handler
     Set the current thread’s trap handler to HANDLER.

   Trap handlers are called when traps installed by procedures from this
module fire.  The current “consumer” of this API is Guile’s REPL, but
one might easily imagine other trap handlers being used to integrate
with other debugging tools.

 -- Scheme Procedure: add-trap-at-procedure-call! proc
     Install a trap that will fire when PROC is called.

     This is a breakpoint.

 -- Scheme Procedure: add-trace-at-procedure-call! proc
     Install a trap that will print a tracing message when PROC is
     called.  *Note* Tracing Traps::, for more information.

     This is a tracepoint.

 -- Scheme Procedure: add-trap-at-source-location! file user-line
     Install a trap that will fire when control reaches the given source
     location.  USER-LINE is one-indexed, as users count lines, instead
     of zero-indexed, as Guile counts lines.

     This is a source breakpoint.

 -- Scheme Procedure: add-ephemeral-trap-at-frame-finish! frame handler
     Install a trap that will call HANDLER when FRAME finishes
     executing.  The trap will be removed from the trap state after
     firing, or on nonlocal exit.

     This is a finish trap, used to implement the “finish” REPL command.

 -- Scheme Procedure: add-ephemeral-stepping-trap! frame handler
          [#:into?] [#:instruction?]
     Install a trap that will call HANDLER after stepping to a different
     source line or instruction.  The trap will be removed from the trap
     state after firing, or on nonlocal exit.

     If INSTRUCTION? is false (the default), the trap will fire when
     control reaches a new source line.  Otherwise it will fire when
     control reaches a new instruction.

     Additionally, if INTO? is false (not the default), the trap will
     only fire for frames at or prior to the given frame.  If INTO? is
     true (the default), the trap may step into nested procedure
     invocations.

     This is a stepping trap, used to implement the “step”, “next”,
     “step-instruction”, and “next-instruction” REPL commands.

6.26.5 GDB Support
------------------

Sometimes, you may find it necessary to debug Guile applications at the
C level.  Doing so can be tedious, in particular because the debugger is
oblivious to Guile’s ‘SCM’ type, and thus unable to display ‘SCM’ values
in any meaningful way:

     (gdb) frame
     #0  scm_display (obj=0xf04310, port=0x6f9f30) at print.c:1437

   To address that, Guile comes with an extension of the GNU Debugger
(GDB) that contains a “pretty-printer” for ‘SCM’ values.  With this GDB
extension, the C frame in the example above shows up like this:

     (gdb) frame
     #0  scm_display (obj=("hello" GDB!), port=#<port file 6f9f30>) at print.c:1437

Here GDB was able to decode the list pointed to by OBJ, and to print it
using Scheme’s read syntax.

   That extension is a ‘.scm’ file installed alongside the ‘libguile’
shared library.  When GDB 7.8 or later is installed and compiled with
support for extensions written in Guile, the extension is automatically
loaded when debugging a program linked against ‘libguile’ (*note*
(gdb)Auto-loading::).  Note that the directory where ‘libguile’ is
installed must be among GDB’s auto-loading “safe directories” (*note*
(gdb)Auto-loading safe path::).


File: guile.info,  Node: Code Coverage,  Prev: Debugging,  Up: API Reference

6.27 Code Coverage Reports
==========================

When writing a test suite for a program or library, it is desirable to
know what part of the code is “covered” by the test suite.  The ‘(system
vm coverage)’ module provides tools to gather code coverage data and to
present them, as detailed below.

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-code-coverage thunk
     Run THUNK, a zero-argument procedure, while instrumenting Guile’s
     virtual machine to collect code coverage data.  Return code
     coverage data and the values returned by THUNK.

 -- Scheme Procedure: coverage-data? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a “coverage data” object as returned by
     ‘with-code-coverage’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: coverage-data->lcov data port #:key modules
     Traverse code coverage information DATA, as obtained with
     ‘with-code-coverage’, and write coverage information to port in the
     ‘.info’ format used by LCOV
     (http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php).  The report will
     include all of MODULES (or, by default, all the currently loaded
     modules) even if their code was not executed.

     The generated data can be fed to LCOV’s ‘genhtml’ command to
     produce an HTML report, which aids coverage data visualization.

   Here’s an example use:

     (use-modules (system vm coverage)
                  (system vm vm))

     (call-with-values (lambda ()
                         (with-code-coverage
                           (lambda ()
                             (do-something-tricky))))
       (lambda (data result)
         (let ((port (open-output-file "lcov.info")))
           (coverage-data->lcov data port)
           (close port))))

   In addition, the module provides low-level procedures that would make
it possible to write other user interfaces to the coverage data.

 -- Scheme Procedures: instrumented-source-files data
     Return the list of “instrumented” source files, i.e., source files
     whose code was loaded at the time DATA was collected.

 -- Scheme Procedures: line-execution-counts data file
     Return a list of line number/execution count pairs for FILE, or
     ‘#f’ if FILE is not among the files covered by DATA.  This includes
     lines with zero count.

 -- Scheme Procedures: instrumented/executed-lines data file
     Return the number of instrumented and the number of executed source
     lines in FILE according to DATA.

 -- Scheme Procedures: procedure-execution-count data proc
     Return the number of times PROC’s code was executed, according to
     DATA, or ‘#f’ if PROC was not executed.  When PROC is a closure,
     the number of times its code was executed is returned, not the
     number of times this code associated with this particular closure
     was executed.

7.1 SLIB
========

SLIB is a portable library of Scheme packages which can be used with
Guile and other Scheme implementations.  SLIB is not included in the
Guile distribution, but can be installed separately (*note* SLIB
installation::).  It is available from
<http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/SLIB.html>.

   After SLIB is installed, the following Scheme expression must be
executed before the SLIB facilities can be used:

     (use-modules (ice-9 slib))

‘require’ can then be used in the usual way (*note* (slib)Require::).
For example,

     (use-modules (ice-9 slib))
     (require 'primes)
     (prime? 13)
     ⇒ #t

   A few Guile core functions are overridden by the SLIB setups; for
example the SLIB version of ‘delete-file’ returns a boolean indicating
success or failure, whereas the Guile core version throws an error for
failure.  In general (and as might be expected) when SLIB is loaded it’s
the SLIB specifications that are followed.

7.1.1 SLIB installation
-----------------------

The following procedure works, e.g., with SLIB version 3a3 (*note* SLIB
installation: (slib)Installation.):

  1. Unpack SLIB and install it using ‘make install’ from its directory.
     By default, this will install SLIB in ‘/usr/local/lib/slib/’.
     Running ‘make install-info’ installs its documentation, by default
     under ‘/usr/local/info/’.

  2. Define the ‘SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH’ environment variable:

          $ SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/slib/
          $ export SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH

     Alternatively, you can create a symlink in the Guile directory to
     SLIB, e.g.:

          ln -s /usr/local/lib/slib /usr/local/share/guile/3.0/slib

  3. Use Guile to create the catalog file, e.g.,:

          # guile
          guile> (use-modules (ice-9 slib))
          guile> (require 'new-catalog)
          guile> (quit)

     The catalog data should now be in
     ‘/usr/local/share/guile/3.0/slibcat’.

     If instead you get an error such as:

          Unbound variable: scheme-implementation-type

     then a solution is to get a newer version of Guile, or to modify
     ‘ice-9/slib.scm’ to use ‘define-public’ for the offending
     variables.

7.2.1 POSIX Interface Conventions
---------------------------------

These interfaces provide access to operating system facilities.  They
provide a simple wrapping around the underlying C interfaces to make
usage from Scheme more convenient.  They are also used to implement the
Guile port of scsh (*note* The Scheme shell (scsh)::).

   Generally there is a single procedure for each corresponding Unix
facility.  There are some exceptions, such as procedures implemented for
speed and convenience in Scheme with no primitive Unix equivalent, e.g.
‘copy-file’.

   The interfaces are intended as far as possible to be portable across
different versions of Unix.  In some cases procedures which can’t be
implemented on particular systems may become no-ops, or perform limited
actions.  In other cases they may throw errors.

   General naming conventions are as follows:

   • The Scheme name is often identical to the name of the underlying
     Unix facility.
   • Underscores in Unix procedure names are converted to hyphens.
   • Procedures which destructively modify Scheme data have exclamation
     marks appended, e.g., ‘recv!’.
   • Predicates (returning only ‘#t’ or ‘#f’) have question marks
     appended, e.g., ‘access?’.
   • Some names are changed to avoid conflict with dissimilar interfaces
     defined by scsh, e.g., ‘primitive-fork’.
   • Unix preprocessor names such as ‘EPERM’ or ‘R_OK’ are converted to
     Scheme variables of the same name (underscores are not replaced
     with hyphens).

   Unexpected conditions are generally handled by raising exceptions.
There are a few procedures which return a special value if they don’t
succeed, e.g., ‘getenv’ returns ‘#f’ if it the requested string is not
found in the environment.  These cases are noted in the documentation.

   For ways to deal with exceptions, see *note* Exceptions::.

   Errors which the C library would report by returning a null pointer
or through some other means are reported by raising a ‘system-error’
exception with ‘scm-error’ (*note* Error Reporting::).  The DATA
parameter is a list containing the Unix ‘errno’ value (an integer).  For
example,

     (define (my-handler key func fmt fmtargs data)
       (display key) (newline)
       (display func) (newline)
       (apply format #t fmt fmtargs) (newline)
       (display data) (newline))

     (catch 'system-error
       (lambda () (dup2 -123 -456))
       my-handler)

     ⊣
     system-error
     dup2
     Bad file descriptor
     (9)


 -- Function: system-error-errno arglist
     Return the ‘errno’ value from a list which is the arguments to an
     exception handler.  If the exception is not a ‘system-error’, then
     the return is ‘#f’.  For example,

          (catch
           'system-error
           (lambda ()
             (mkdir "/this-ought-to-fail-if-I'm-not-root"))
           (lambda stuff
             (let ((errno (system-error-errno stuff)))
               (cond
                ((= errno EACCES)
                 (display "You're not allowed to do that."))
                ((= errno EEXIST)
                 (display "Already exists."))
                (#t
                 (display (strerror errno))))
               (newline))))


File: guile.info,  Node: Ports and File Descriptors,  Next: File System,  Prev: Conventions,  Up: POSIX

7.2.2 Ports and File Descriptors
--------------------------------

Conventions generally follow those of scsh, *note* The Scheme shell
(scsh)::.

   Each open file port has an associated operating system file
descriptor.  File descriptors are generally not useful in Scheme
programs; however they may be needed when interfacing with foreign code
and the Unix environment.

   A file descriptor can be extracted from a port and a new port can be
created from a file descriptor.  However a file descriptor is just an
integer and the garbage collector doesn’t recognize it as a reference to
the port.  If all other references to the port were dropped, then it’s
likely that the garbage collector would free the port, with the
side-effect of closing the file descriptor prematurely.

   To assist the programmer in avoiding this problem, each port has an
associated “revealed count” which can be used to keep track of how many
times the underlying file descriptor has been stored in other places.
If a port’s revealed count is greater than zero, the file descriptor
will not be closed when the port is garbage collected.  A programmer can
therefore ensure that the revealed count will be greater than zero if
the file descriptor is needed elsewhere.

   For the simple case where a file descriptor is “imported” once to
become a port, it does not matter if the file descriptor is closed when
the port is garbage collected.  There is no need to maintain a revealed
count.  Likewise when “exporting” a file descriptor to the external
environment, setting the revealed count is not required provided the
port is kept open (i.e., is pointed to by a live Scheme binding) while
the file descriptor is in use.

   To correspond with traditional Unix behaviour, three file descriptors
(0, 1, and 2) are automatically imported when a program starts up and
assigned to the initial values of the current/standard input, output,
and error ports, respectively.  The revealed count for each is initially
set to one, so that dropping references to one of these ports will not
result in its garbage collection: it could be retrieved with ‘fdopen’ or
‘fdes->ports’.

   Guile’s ports can be buffered.  This means that writing a byte to a
file port goes to the internal buffer first, and only when the buffer is
full (or the user invokes ‘force-output’ on the port) is the data
actually written to the file descriptor.  Likewise on input, bytes are
read in from the file descriptor in blocks and placed in a buffer.
Reading a character via ‘read-char’ first goes to the buffer, filling it
as needed.  Usually read buffering is more or less transparent, but
write buffering can sometimes cause writes to be delayed unexpectedly,
if you forget to call ‘force-output’.  *Note* Buffering::, for more on
how to control port buffers.

   Note however that some procedures (e.g., ‘recv!’) will accept ports
as arguments, but will actually operate directly on the file descriptor
underlying the port.  Any port buffering is ignored, including the
buffer which implements ‘peek-char’ and ‘unread-char’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-revealed port
 -- C Function: scm_port_revealed (port)
     Return the revealed count for PORT.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-port-revealed! port rcount
 -- C Function: scm_set_port_revealed_x (port, rcount)
     Sets the revealed count for a PORT to RCOUNT.  The return value is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fileno port
 -- C Function: scm_fileno (port)
     Return the integer file descriptor underlying PORT.  Does not
     change its revealed count.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port->fdes port
     Returns the integer file descriptor underlying PORT.  As a side
     effect the revealed count of PORT is incremented.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fdopen fdes modes
 -- C Function: scm_fdopen (fdes, modes)
     Return a new port based on the file descriptor FDES.  Modes are
     given by the string MODES.  The revealed count of the port is
     initialized to zero.  The MODES string is the same as that accepted
     by ‘open-file’ (*note* open-file: File Ports.).

 -- Scheme Procedure: fdes->ports fdes
 -- C Function: scm_fdes_to_ports (fdes)
     Return a list of existing ports which have FDES as an underlying
     file descriptor, without changing their revealed counts.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fdes->inport fdes
     Returns an existing input port which has FDES as its underlying
     file descriptor, if one exists, and increments its revealed count.
     Otherwise, returns a new input port with a revealed count of 1.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fdes->outport fdes
     Returns an existing output port which has FDES as its underlying
     file descriptor, if one exists, and increments its revealed count.
     Otherwise, returns a new output port with a revealed count of 1.

 -- Scheme Procedure: primitive-move->fdes port fdes
 -- C Function: scm_primitive_move_to_fdes (port, fdes)
     Moves the underlying file descriptor for PORT to the integer value
     FDES without changing the revealed count of PORT.  Any other ports
     already using this descriptor will be automatically shifted to new
     descriptors and their revealed counts reset to zero.  The return
     value is ‘#f’ if the file descriptor already had the required value
     or ‘#t’ if it was moved.

 -- Scheme Procedure: move->fdes port fdes
     Moves the underlying file descriptor for PORT to the integer value
     FDES and sets its revealed count to one.  Any other ports already
     using this descriptor will be automatically shifted to new
     descriptors and their revealed counts reset to zero.  The return
     value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: release-port-handle port
     Decrements the revealed count for a port.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fsync port_or_fd
 -- C Function: scm_fsync (port_or_fd)
     Copies any unwritten data for the specified output file descriptor
     to disk.  If PORT_OR_FD is a port, its buffer is flushed before the
     underlying file descriptor is fsync’d.  The return value is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: open path flags [mode]
 -- C Function: scm_open (path, flags, mode)
     Open the file named by PATH for reading and/or writing.  FLAGS is
     an integer specifying how the file should be opened.  MODE is an
     integer specifying the permission bits of the file, if it needs to
     be created, before the umask (*note* Processes::) is applied.  The
     default is 666 (Unix itself has no default).

     FLAGS can be constructed by combining variables using ‘logior’.
     Basic flags are:

      -- Variable: O_RDONLY
          Open the file read-only.
      -- Variable: O_WRONLY
          Open the file write-only.
      -- Variable: O_RDWR
          Open the file read/write.
      -- Variable: O_APPEND
          Append to the file instead of truncating.
      -- Variable: O_CREAT
          Create the file if it does not already exist.

     *Note* (libc)File Status Flags::, for additional flags.

 -- Scheme Procedure: openat dir path flags [mode]
 -- C Function: scm_openat (dir, path, flags, mode)
     Similar to ‘open’, but resolve the file name PATH relative to the
     directory referred to by the file port DIR instead.

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-fdes path flags [mode]
 -- C Function: scm_open_fdes (path, flags, mode)
     Similar to ‘open’ but return a file descriptor instead of a port.

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-fdes-at dir path flags [mode]
 -- C Function: scm_open_fdes_at (dir, path, flags, mode)
     Similar to ‘openat’, but return a file descriptor instead of a
     port.

 -- Scheme Procedure: close fd_or_port
 -- C Function: scm_close (fd_or_port)
     Similar to ‘close-port’ (*note* close-port: Ports.), but also works
     on file descriptors.  A side effect of closing a file descriptor is
     that any ports using that file descriptor are moved to a different
     file descriptor and have their revealed counts set to zero.

 -- Scheme Procedure: close-fdes fd
 -- C Function: scm_close_fdes (fd)
     A simple wrapper for the ‘close’ system call.  Close file
     descriptor FD, which must be an integer.  Unlike ‘close’, the file
     descriptor will be closed even if a port is using it.  The return
     value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pipe [flags]
 -- C Function: scm_pipe ()
     Return a newly created pipe: a pair of ports which are linked
     together on the local machine.  The CAR is the input port and the
     CDR is the output port.  Data written (and flushed) to the output
     port can be read from the input port.  Pipes are commonly used for
     communication with a newly forked child process.  The need to flush
     the output port can be avoided by making it unbuffered using
     ‘setvbuf’ (*note* Buffering::).

     Optionally, on systems that support it such as GNU/Linux and
     GNU/Hurd, FLAGS can specify a bitwise-or of the following
     constants:

     ‘O_CLOEXEC’
          Mark the returned file descriptors as close-on-exec;
     ‘O_DIRECT’
          Create a pipe that performs input/output in “packet" mode—see
          ‘man 2 pipe’ for details;
     ‘O_NONBLOCK’
          Set the ‘O_NONBLOCK’ status flag (non-blocking input and
          output) on the file descriptors.

     On systems that do _not_ support it, passing a non-zero FLAGS value
     triggers a ‘system-error’ exception.

      -- Variable: PIPE_BUF
          A write of up to ‘PIPE_BUF’ many bytes to a pipe is atomic,
          meaning when done it goes into the pipe instantaneously and as
          a contiguous block (*note* Atomicity of Pipe I/O: (libc)Pipe
          Atomicity.).

     Note that the output port is likely to block if too much data has
     been written but not yet read from the input port.  Typically the
     capacity is ‘PIPE_BUF’ bytes.

   The next group of procedures perform a ‘dup2’ system call, if NEWFD
(an integer) is supplied, otherwise a ‘dup’.  The file descriptor to be
duplicated can be supplied as an integer or contained in a port.  The
type of value returned varies depending on which procedure is used.

   All procedures also have the side effect when performing ‘dup2’ that
any ports using NEWFD are moved to a different file descriptor and have
their revealed counts set to zero.

 -- Scheme Procedure: dup->fdes fd_or_port [fd]
 -- C Function: scm_dup_to_fdes (fd_or_port, fd)
     Return a new integer file descriptor referring to the open file
     designated by FD_OR_PORT, which must be either an open file port or
     a file descriptor.

 -- Scheme Procedure: dup->inport port/fd [newfd]
     Returns a new input port using the new file descriptor.

 -- Scheme Procedure: dup->outport port/fd [newfd]
     Returns a new output port using the new file descriptor.

 -- Scheme Procedure: dup port/fd [newfd]
     Returns a new port if PORT/FD is a port, with the same mode as the
     supplied port, otherwise returns an integer file descriptor.

 -- Scheme Procedure: dup->port port/fd mode [newfd]
     Returns a new port using the new file descriptor.  MODE supplies a
     mode string for the port (*note* open-file: File Ports.).

 -- Scheme Procedure: duplicate-port port modes
     Returns a new port which is opened on a duplicate of the file
     descriptor underlying PORT, with mode string MODES as for *note*
     open-file: File Ports.  The two ports will share a file position
     and file status flags.

     Unexpected behaviour can result if both ports are subsequently used
     and the original and/or duplicate ports are buffered.  The mode
     string can include ‘0’ to obtain an unbuffered duplicate port.

     This procedure is equivalent to ‘(dup->port PORT MODES)’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: redirect-port old_port new_port
 -- C Function: scm_redirect_port (old_port, new_port)
     This procedure takes two ports and duplicates the underlying file
     descriptor from OLD_PORT into NEW_PORT.  The current file
     descriptor in NEW_PORT will be closed.  After the redirection the
     two ports will share a file position and file status flags.

     The return value is unspecified.

     Unexpected behaviour can result if both ports are subsequently used
     and the original and/or duplicate ports are buffered.

     This procedure does not have any side effects on other ports or
     revealed counts.

 -- Scheme Procedure: dup2 oldfd newfd
 -- C Function: scm_dup2 (oldfd, newfd)
     A simple wrapper for the ‘dup2’ system call.  Copies the file
     descriptor OLDFD to descriptor number NEWFD, replacing the previous
     meaning of NEWFD.  Both OLDFD and NEWFD must be integers.  Unlike
     for ‘dup->fdes’ or ‘primitive-move->fdes’, no attempt is made to
     move away ports which are using NEWFD.  The return value is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-for-each proc
 -- C Function: scm_port_for_each (SCM proc)
 -- C Function: scm_c_port_for_each (void (*proc)(void *, SCM), void
          *data)
     Apply PROC to each port in the Guile port table (FIXME: what is the
     Guile port table?)  in turn.  The return value is unspecified.
     More specifically, PROC is applied exactly once to every port that
     exists in the system at the time ‘port-for-each’ is invoked.
     Changes to the port table while ‘port-for-each’ is running have no
     effect as far as ‘port-for-each’ is concerned.

     The C function ‘scm_port_for_each’ takes a Scheme procedure encoded
     as a ‘SCM’ value, while ‘scm_c_port_for_each’ takes a pointer to a
     C function and passes along a arbitrary DATA cookie.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fcntl port/fd cmd [value]
 -- C Function: scm_fcntl (object, cmd, value)
     Apply CMD on PORT/FD, either a port or file descriptor.  The VALUE
     argument is used by the ‘SET’ commands described below, it’s an
     integer value.

     Values for CMD are:

      -- Variable: F_DUPFD
          Duplicate the file descriptor, the same as ‘dup->fdes’ above
          does.

      -- Variable: F_GETFD
      -- Variable: F_SETFD
          Get or set flags associated with the file descriptor.  The
          only flag is the following,

           -- Variable: FD_CLOEXEC
               “Close on exec”, meaning the file descriptor will be
               closed on an ‘exec’ call (a successful such call).  For
               example to set that flag,

                    (fcntl port F_SETFD FD_CLOEXEC)

               Or better, set it but leave any other possible future
               flags unchanged,

                    (fcntl port F_SETFD (logior FD_CLOEXEC
                                                (fcntl port F_GETFD)))

      -- Variable: F_GETFL
      -- Variable: F_SETFL
          Get or set flags associated with the open file.  These flags
          are ‘O_RDONLY’ etc described under ‘open’ above.

          A common use is to set ‘O_NONBLOCK’ on a network socket.  The
          following sets that flag, and leaves other flags unchanged.

               (fcntl sock F_SETFL (logior O_NONBLOCK
                                           (fcntl sock F_GETFL)))

      -- Variable: F_GETOWN
      -- Variable: F_SETOWN
          Get or set the process ID of a socket’s owner, for ‘SIGIO’
          signals.

 -- Scheme Procedure: flock file operation
 -- C Function: scm_flock (file, operation)
     Apply or remove an advisory lock on an open file.  OPERATION
     specifies the action to be done:

      -- Variable: LOCK_SH
          Shared lock.  More than one process may hold a shared lock for
          a given file at a given time.
      -- Variable: LOCK_EX
          Exclusive lock.  Only one process may hold an exclusive lock
          for a given file at a given time.
      -- Variable: LOCK_UN
          Unlock the file.
      -- Variable: LOCK_NB
          Don’t block when locking.  This is combined with one of the
          other operations using ‘logior’ (*note* Bitwise Operations::).
          If ‘flock’ would block an ‘EWOULDBLOCK’ error is thrown (*note*
          Conventions::).

     The return value is not specified.  FILE may be an open file
     descriptor or an open file descriptor port.

     Note that ‘flock’ does not lock files across NFS.

 -- Scheme Procedure: select reads writes excepts [secs [usecs]]
 -- C Function: scm_select (reads, writes, excepts, secs, usecs)
     This procedure has a variety of uses: waiting for the ability to
     provide input, accept output, or the existence of exceptional
     conditions on a collection of ports or file descriptors, or waiting
     for a timeout to occur.

     When an error occurs, this procedure throws a ‘system-error’
     exception (*note* ‘system-error’: Conventions.).  Note that ‘select’
     may return early for other reasons, for example due to pending
     interrupts.  *Note* Asyncs::, for more on interrupts.

     READS, WRITES and EXCEPTS can be lists or vectors, with each member
     a port or a file descriptor.  The value returned is a list of three
     corresponding lists or vectors containing only the members which
     meet the specified requirement.  The ability of port buffers to
     provide input or accept output is taken into account.  Ordering of
     the input lists or vectors is not preserved.

     The optional arguments SECS and USECS specify the timeout.  Either
     SECS can be specified alone, as either an integer or a real number,
     or both SECS and USECS can be specified as integers, in which case
     USECS is an additional timeout expressed in microseconds.  If SECS
     is omitted or is ‘#f’ then select will wait for as long as it takes
     for one of the other conditions to be satisfied.

     The scsh version of ‘select’ differs as follows: Only vectors are
     accepted for the first three arguments.  The USECS argument is not
     supported.  Multiple values are returned instead of a list.
     Duplicates in the input vectors appear only once in output.  An
     additional ‘select!’ interface is provided.

   While it is sometimes necessary to operate at the level of file
descriptors, this is an operation whose correctness can only be
considered as part of a whole program.  So for example while the effects
of ‘(string-set! x 34 #\y)’ are limited to the bits of code that can
access X, ‘(close-fdes 34)’ mutates the state of the entire process.  In
particular if another thread is using file descriptor 34 then their
state might be corrupted; and another thread which opens a file might
cause file descriptor 34 to be re-used, so that corruption could
manifest itself in a strange way.

   However when working with file descriptors, it’s common to want to
associate information with the file descriptor, perhaps in a side table.
To support this use case and to allow user code to remove an association
when a file descriptor is closed, Guile offers “fdes finalizers”.

   As the name indicates, fdes finalizers are finalizers – they can run
in response to garbage collection, and they can also run in response to
explicit calls to ‘close-port’, ‘close-fdes’, or the like.  As such they
inherit many of the pitfalls of finalizers: they may be invoked from
concurrent threads, or not at all.  *Note* Foreign Object Memory
Management::, for more on finalizers.

   To use fdes finalizers, import their module;

     (use-modules (ice-9 fdes-finalizers))

 -- Scheme Procedure: add-fdes-finalizer! fdes finalizer
 -- Scheme Procedure: remove-fdes-finalizer! fdes finalizer
     Add or remove a finalizer for FDES.  A finalizer is a procedure
     that is called by Guile when a file descriptor is closed.  The file
     descriptor being closed is passed as the one argument to the
     finalizer.  If a finalizer has been added multiple times to a file
     descriptor, to remove it would require that number of calls to
     ‘remove-fdes-finalizer!’.

     The finalizers added to a file descriptor are called by Guile in an
     unspecified order, and their return values are ignored.

7.2.3 File System
-----------------

These procedures allow querying and setting file system attributes (such
as owner, permissions, sizes and types of files); deleting, copying,
renaming and linking files; creating and removing directories and
querying their contents; syncing the file system and creating special
files.

 -- Scheme Procedure: access? path how
 -- C Function: scm_access (path, how)
     Test accessibility of a file under the real UID and GID of the
     calling process.  The return is ‘#t’ if PATH exists and the
     permissions requested by HOW are all allowed, or ‘#f’ if not.

     HOW is an integer which is one of the following values, or a
     bitwise-OR (‘logior’) of multiple values.

      -- Variable: R_OK
          Test for read permission.
      -- Variable: W_OK
          Test for write permission.
      -- Variable: X_OK
          Test for execute permission.
      -- Variable: F_OK
          Test for existence of the file.  This is implied by each of
          the other tests, so there’s no need to combine it with them.

     It’s important to note that ‘access?’ does not simply indicate what
     will happen on attempting to read or write a file.  In normal
     circumstances it does, but in a set-UID or set-GID program it
     doesn’t because ‘access?’ tests the real ID, whereas an open or
     execute attempt uses the effective ID.

     A program which will never run set-UID/GID can ignore the
     difference between real and effective IDs, but for maximum
     generality, especially in library functions, it’s best not to use
     ‘access?’ to predict the result of an open or execute, instead
     simply attempt that and catch any exception.

     The main use for ‘access?’ is to let a set-UID/GID program
     determine what the invoking user would have been allowed to do,
     without the greater (or perhaps lesser) privileges afforded by the
     effective ID. For more on this, see *note* (libc)Testing File
     Access::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stat object [exception-on-error?]
 -- C Function: scm_stat (object, exception_on_error)
     Return an object containing various information about the file
     determined by OBJECT.  OBJECT can be a string containing a file
     name or a port or integer file descriptor which is open on a file
     (in which case ‘fstat’ is used as the underlying system call).

     If the optional EXCEPTION_ON_ERROR argument is true, which is the
     default, an exception will be raised if the underlying system call
     returns an error, for example if the file is not found or is not
     readable.  Otherwise, an error will cause ‘stat’ to return ‘#f’.

     The object returned by ‘stat’ can be passed as a single parameter
     to the following procedures, all of which return integers:

      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:dev st
          The device number containing the file.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:ino st
          The file serial number, which distinguishes this file from all
          other files on the same device.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:mode st
          The mode of the file.  This is an integer which incorporates
          file type information and file permission bits.  See also
          ‘stat:type’ and ‘stat:perms’ below.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:nlink st
          The number of hard links to the file.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:uid st
          The user ID of the file’s owner.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:gid st
          The group ID of the file.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:rdev st
          Device ID; this entry is defined only for character or block
          special files.  On some systems this field is not available at
          all, in which case ‘stat:rdev’ returns ‘#f’.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:size st
          The size of a regular file in bytes.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:atime st
          The last access time for the file, in seconds.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:mtime st
          The last modification time for the file, in seconds.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:ctime st
          The last modification time for the attributes of the file, in
          seconds.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:atimensec st
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:mtimensec st
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:ctimensec st
          The fractional part of a file’s access, modification, or
          attribute modification time, in nanoseconds.  Nanosecond
          timestamps are only available on some operating systems and
          file systems.  If Guile cannot retrieve nanosecond-level
          timestamps for a file, these fields will be set to 0.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:blksize st
          The optimal block size for reading or writing the file, in
          bytes.  On some systems this field is not available, in which
          case ‘stat:blksize’ returns a sensible suggested block size.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:blocks st
          The amount of disk space that the file occupies measured in
          units of 512 byte blocks.  On some systems this field is not
          available, in which case ‘stat:blocks’ returns ‘#f’.

     In addition, the following procedures return the information from
     ‘stat:mode’ in a more convenient form:

      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:type st
          A symbol representing the type of file.  Possible values are
          ‘regular’, ‘directory’, ‘symlink’, ‘block-special’,
          ‘char-special’, ‘fifo’, ‘socket’, and ‘unknown’.
      -- Scheme Procedure: stat:perms st
          An integer representing the access permission bits.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lstat path
 -- C Function: scm_lstat (path)
     Similar to ‘stat’, but does not follow symbolic links, i.e., it
     will return information about a symbolic link itself, not the file
     it points to.  PATH must be a string.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statat dir filename [flags]
 -- C Function: scm_statat dir filename flags
     Like ‘stat’, but resolve FILENAME relative to the directory
     referred to by the file port DIR instead.  The optional argument
     FLAGS argument can be ‘AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW’, in which case FILENAME
     will not be dereferenced even if it is a symbolic link.

 -- Scheme Procedure: readlink path
 -- C Function: scm_readlink (path)
     Return the value of the symbolic link named by PATH (a string, or a
     port if supported by the system), i.e., the file that the link
     points to.

     To read a symbolic link represented by a port, the symbolic link
     must have been opened with the ‘O_NOFOLLOW’ and ‘O_PATH’ flags.
     ‘(provided? 'readlink-port)’ reports whether ports are supported.

 -- Scheme Procedure: chown object owner group
 -- C Function: scm_chown (object, owner, group)
     Change the ownership and group of the file referred to by OBJECT to
     the integer values OWNER and GROUP.  OBJECT can be a string
     containing a file name or, if the platform supports ‘fchown’ (*note*
     (libc)File Owner::), a port or integer file descriptor which is
     open on the file.  The return value is unspecified.

     If OBJECT is a symbolic link, either the ownership of the link or
     the ownership of the referenced file will be changed depending on
     the operating system (lchown is unsupported at present).  If OWNER
     or GROUP is specified as ‘-1’, then that ID is not changed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: chownat dir name owner group [flags]
 -- C Function: scm_chownat (dir, name, owner, group, flags)
     Like ‘chown’, but modify the owner and/or group of the file named
     NAME in the directory referred to by the file port DIR instead.
     The optional argument FLAGS is a bitmask.  If ‘AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW’
     is present, then NAME will not be dereferenced if it is a symbolic
     link.

 -- Scheme Procedure: chmod object mode
 -- C Function: scm_chmod (object, mode)
     Changes the permissions of the file referred to by OBJECT.  OBJECT
     can be a string containing a file name or a port or integer file
     descriptor which is open on a file (in which case ‘fchmod’ is used
     as the underlying system call).  MODE specifies the new permissions
     as a decimal number, e.g., ‘(chmod "foo" #o755)’.  The return value
     is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: utime object [actime [modtime [actimens [modtimens
          [flags]]]]]
 -- C Function: scm_utime (object, actime, modtime, actimens, modtimens,
          flags)
     ‘utime’ sets the access and modification times for the file named
     by OBJECT.  If ACTIME or MODTIME is not supplied, then the current
     time is used.  ACTIME and MODTIME must be integer time values as
     returned by the ‘current-time’ procedure.

     OBJECT must be a file name or a port (if supported by the system).

     The optional ACTIMENS and MODTIMENS are nanoseconds to add ACTIME
     and MODTIME.  Nanosecond precision is only supported on some
     combinations of file systems and operating systems.
          (utime "foo" (- (current-time) 3600))
     will set the access time to one hour in the past and the
     modification time to the current time.

     Last, FLAGS may be either ‘0’ or the ‘AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW’
     constant, to set the time of OBJECT even if it is a symbolic link.

   On GNU/Linux systems, at least when using the Linux kernel 5.10.46,
if OBJECT is a port, it may not be a symbolic link, even if
‘AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW’ is set.  This is either a bug in Linux or Guile’s
wrappers.  The exact cause is unclear.

 -- Scheme Procedure: delete-file str
 -- C Function: scm_delete_file (str)
     Deletes (or “unlinks”) the file whose path is specified by STR.

 -- Scheme Procedure: delete-file-at dir str [flags]
 -- C Function: scm_delete_file_at (dir, str, flags)
     Like ‘unlink’, but resolve STR relative to the directory referred
     to by the file port DIR instead.

     The optional FLAGS argument can be ‘AT_REMOVEDIR’, in which case
     ‘delete-file-at’ will act like ‘rmdir’ instead of ‘delete-file’.
     Why doesn’t POSIX have a ‘rmdirat’ function for this instead?  No
     idea!

 -- Scheme Procedure: copy-file oldfile newfile
 -- C Function: scm_copy_file (oldfile, newfile)
     Copy the file specified by OLDFILE to NEWFILE.  The return value is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sendfile out in count [offset]
 -- C Function: scm_sendfile (out, in, count, offset)
     Send COUNT bytes from IN to OUT, both of which must be either open
     file ports or file descriptors.  When OFFSET is omitted, start
     reading from IN’s current position; otherwise, start reading at
     OFFSET.  Return the number of bytes actually sent.

     When IN is a port, it is often preferable to specify OFFSET,
     because IN’s offset as a port may be different from the offset of
     its underlying file descriptor.

     On systems that support it, such as GNU/Linux, this procedure uses
     the ‘sendfile’ libc function, which usually corresponds to a system
     call.  This is faster than doing a series of ‘read’ and ‘write’
     system calls.  A typical application is to send a file over a
     socket.

     In some cases, the ‘sendfile’ libc function may return ‘EINVAL’ or
     ‘ENOSYS’.  In that case, Guile’s ‘sendfile’ procedure automatically
     falls back to doing a series of ‘read’ and ‘write’ calls.

     In other cases, the libc function may send fewer bytes than
     COUNT—for instance because OUT is a slow or limited device, such as
     a pipe.  When that happens, Guile’s ‘sendfile’ automatically
     retries until exactly COUNT bytes were sent or an error occurs.

 -- Scheme Procedure: rename-file oldname newname
 -- C Function: scm_rename (oldname, newname)
     Renames the file specified by OLDNAME to NEWNAME.  The return value
     is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: rename-file-at olddir oldname newdir newname
 -- C Function: scm_renameat (olddir, oldname, newdir, newname)
     Like ‘rename-file’, but when OLDDIR or NEWDIR is true, resolve
     OLDNAME or NEWNAME relative to the directory specified by the file
     port OLDDIR or NEWDIR instead of the current working directory.

 -- Scheme Procedure: link oldpath newpath
 -- C Function: scm_link (oldpath, newpath)
     Creates a new name NEWPATH in the file system for the file named by
     OLDPATH.  If OLDPATH is a symbolic link, the link may or may not be
     followed depending on the system.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symlink oldpath newpath
 -- C Function: scm_symlink (oldpath, newpath)
     Create a symbolic link named NEWPATH with the value (i.e., pointing
     to) OLDPATH.  The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symlinkat dir oldpath newpath
 -- C Function: scm_symlinkat (dir, oldpath, newpath)
     Like ‘symlink’, but resolve NEWPATH relative to the directory
     referred to by the file port DIR.

 -- Scheme Procedure: mkdir path [mode]
 -- C Function: scm_mkdir (path, mode)
     Create a new directory named by PATH.  If MODE is omitted then the
     permissions of the directory are set to ‘#o777’ masked with the
     current umask (*note* ‘umask’: Processes.).  Otherwise they are set
     to the value specified with MODE masked with the current umask.
     The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: mkdirat dir path [mode]
 -- C Function: scm_mkdirat (dir, path, mode)
     Like ‘mkdir’, but resolve PATH relative to the directory referred
     to by the file port DIR instead.

 -- Scheme Procedure: rmdir path
 -- C Function: scm_rmdir (path)
     Remove the existing directory named by PATH.  The directory must be
     empty for this to succeed.  The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: opendir dirname
 -- C Function: scm_opendir (dirname)
     Open the directory specified by DIRNAME and return a directory
     stream.

     Before using this and the procedures below, make sure to see the
     higher-level procedures for directory traversal that are available
     (*note* File Tree Walk::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: directory-stream? object
 -- C Function: scm_directory_stream_p (object)
     Return a boolean indicating whether OBJECT is a directory stream as
     returned by ‘opendir’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: readdir stream
 -- C Function: scm_readdir (stream)
     Return (as a string) the next directory entry from the directory
     stream STREAM.  If there is no remaining entry to be read then the
     end of file object is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: rewinddir stream
 -- C Function: scm_rewinddir (stream)
     Reset the directory port STREAM so that the next call to ‘readdir’
     will return the first directory entry.

 -- Scheme Procedure: closedir stream
 -- C Function: scm_closedir (stream)
     Close the directory stream STREAM.  The return value is
     unspecified.

   Here is an example showing how to display all the entries in a
directory:

     (define dir (opendir "/usr/lib"))
     (do ((entry (readdir dir) (readdir dir)))
         ((eof-object? entry))
       (display entry)(newline))
     (closedir dir)

 -- Scheme Procedure: sync
 -- C Function: scm_sync ()
     Flush the operating system disk buffers.  The return value is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: mknod path type perms dev
 -- C Function: scm_mknod (path, type, perms, dev)
     Creates a new special file, such as a file corresponding to a
     device.  PATH specifies the name of the file.  TYPE should be one
     of the following symbols: ‘regular’, ‘directory’, ‘symlink’,
     ‘block-special’, ‘char-special’, ‘fifo’, or ‘socket’.  PERMS (an
     integer) specifies the file permissions.  DEV (an integer)
     specifies which device the special file refers to.  Its exact
     interpretation depends on the kind of special file being created.

     E.g.,
          (mknod "/dev/fd0" 'block-special #o660 (+ (* 2 256) 2))

     The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: tmpnam
 -- C Function: scm_tmpnam ()
     Return an auto-generated name of a temporary file, a file which
     doesn’t already exist.  The name includes a path, it’s usually in
     ‘/tmp’ but that’s system dependent.

     Care must be taken when using ‘tmpnam’.  In between choosing the
     name and creating the file another program might use that name, or
     an attacker might even make it a symlink pointing at something
     important and causing you to overwrite that.

     The safe way is to create the file using ‘open’ with ‘O_EXCL’ to
     avoid any overwriting.  A loop can try again with another name if
     the file exists (error ‘EEXIST’).  ‘mkstemp’ below does that.

 -- Scheme Procedure: mkstemp tmpl [mode]
     Create a new unique file in the file system and return a new
     buffered port open for reading and writing to the file.

     TMPL is a string specifying where the file should be created: it
     must end with ‘XXXXXX’.  The name of the newly created file will be
     the same as TMPL, but with those ‘X’s changed, and can be
     determined by calling ‘port-filename’ on the returned port.

     Note that the newly created file is not deleted automatically by
     Guile; probably the caller should arrange to call ‘delete-file’
     when the file is no longer needed.

     POSIX doesn’t specify the permissions mode of the file.  On GNU and
     most systems it’s ‘#o600’; an application can use ‘chmod’ to relax
     that if desired.  For example ‘#o666’ less ‘umask’, which is usual
     for ordinary file creation,

          (let ((port (mkstemp "/tmp/myfile-XXXXXX")))
            (chmod port (logand #o666 (lognot (umask))))
            ...)

     The optional MODE argument specifies a mode with which to open the
     new file, as a string in the same format that ‘open-file’ takes.
     It defaults to ‘"w+"’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: tmpfile
 -- C Function: scm_tmpfile ()
     Return an input/output port to a unique temporary file named using
     the path prefix ‘P_tmpdir’ defined in ‘stdio.h’.  The file is
     automatically deleted when the port is closed or the program
     terminates.

 -- Scheme Procedure: mkdtemp tmpl
 -- C Function: scm_mkdtemp (tmpl)
     Create a new directory named in accordance with the template string
     TMPL.

     TMPL is a string specifying the directory’s name.  The last six
     characters of TMPL must be ‘XXXXXX’.  Upon successful execution,
     the name of the new directory is returned which has the same form
     as TMPL but with the ‘XXXXXX’ characters modified to ensure the
     directory name is unique.

     The permissions of the directory created are OS dependent, but, are
     usually ‘#o700’.

     An error may be thrown if the template has the wrong format or if
     the directory cannot be created.

 -- Scheme Procedure: dirname filename
 -- C Function: scm_dirname (filename)
     Return the directory name component of the file name FILENAME.  If
     FILENAME does not contain a directory component, ‘.’ is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: basename filename [suffix]
 -- C Function: scm_basename (filename, suffix)
     Return the base name of the file name FILENAME.  The base name is
     the file name without any directory components.  If SUFFIX is
     provided, and is equal to the end of BASENAME, it is removed also.

          (basename "/tmp/test.xml" ".xml")
          ⇒ "test"

 -- Scheme Procedure: canonicalize-path path
 -- C Function: scm_canonicalize_path (path)
     Return the canonical (absolute) path of PATH.  A canonical path has
     no ‘.’ or ‘..’ components, nor any repeated path separators (‘/’)
     nor symlinks.

     Raises an error if any component of PATH does not exist.

          (canonicalize-path "test.xml")
          ⇒ "/tmp/test.xml"

 -- Scheme Procedure: file-exists? filename
     Return ‘#t’ if the file named FILENAME exists, ‘#f’ if not.

   Many operating systems, such as GNU, use ‘/’ (forward slash) to
separate the components of a file name; any file name starting with ‘/’
is considered an “absolute file name”.  These conventions are specified
by the POSIX Base Definitions, which refer to conforming file names as
“pathnames”.  Some operating systems use a different convention; in
particular, Windows uses ‘\’ (backslash) as the file name separator, and
also has the notion of “volume names” like ‘C:\’ for absolute file
names.  The following procedures and variables provide support for
portable file name manipulations.

 -- Scheme Procedure: system-file-name-convention
     Return either ‘posix’ or ‘windows’, depending on what kind of
     system this Guile is running on.

 -- Scheme Procedure: file-name-separator? c
     Return true if character C is a file name separator on the host
     platform.

 -- Scheme Procedure: absolute-file-name? file-name
     Return true if FILE-NAME denotes an absolute file name on the host
     platform.

 -- Scheme Variable: file-name-separator-string
     The preferred file name separator.

     Note that on MinGW builds for Windows, both ‘/’ and ‘\’ are valid
     separators.  Thus, programs should not assume that
     ‘file-name-separator-string’ is the _only_ file name
     separator—e.g., when extracting the components of a file name.

7.2.4 User Information
----------------------

The facilities in this section provide an interface to the user and
group database.  They should be used with care since they are not
reentrant.

   The following functions accept an object representing user
information and return a selected component:

 -- Scheme Procedure: passwd:name pw
     The name of the userid.
 -- Scheme Procedure: passwd:passwd pw
     The encrypted passwd.
 -- Scheme Procedure: passwd:uid pw
     The user id number.
 -- Scheme Procedure: passwd:gid pw
     The group id number.
 -- Scheme Procedure: passwd:gecos pw
     The full name.
 -- Scheme Procedure: passwd:dir pw
     The home directory.

     The login shell.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getpwuid uid
     Look up an integer userid in the user database.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getpwnam name
     Look up a user name string in the user database.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setpwent
     Initializes a stream used by ‘getpwent’ to read from the user
     database.  The next use of ‘getpwent’ will return the first entry.
     The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getpwent
     Read the next entry in the user database stream.  The return is a
     passwd user object as above, or ‘#f’ when no more entries.

 -- Scheme Procedure: endpwent
     Closes the stream used by ‘getpwent’.  The return value is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setpw [arg]
 -- C Function: scm_setpwent (arg)
     If called with a true argument, initialize or reset the password
     data stream.  Otherwise, close the stream.  The ‘setpwent’ and
     ‘endpwent’ procedures are implemented on top of this.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getpw [user]
 -- C Function: scm_getpwuid (user)
     Look up an entry in the user database.  USER can be an integer, a
     string, or omitted, giving the behaviour of getpwuid, getpwnam or
     getpwent respectively.

   The following functions accept an object representing group
information and return a selected component:

 -- Scheme Procedure: group:name gr
     The group name.
 -- Scheme Procedure: group:passwd gr
     The encrypted group password.
 -- Scheme Procedure: group:gid gr
     The group id number.
 -- Scheme Procedure: group:mem gr
     A list of userids which have this group as a supplementary group.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getgrgid gid
     Look up an integer group id in the group database.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getgrnam name
     Look up a group name in the group database.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setgrent
     Initializes a stream used by ‘getgrent’ to read from the group
     database.  The next use of ‘getgrent’ will return the first entry.
     The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getgrent
     Return the next entry in the group database, using the stream set
     by ‘setgrent’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: endgrent
     Closes the stream used by ‘getgrent’.  The return value is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setgr [arg]
 -- C Function: scm_setgrent (arg)
     If called with a true argument, initialize or reset the group data
     stream.  Otherwise, close the stream.  The ‘setgrent’ and
     ‘endgrent’ procedures are implemented on top of this.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getgr [group]
 -- C Function: scm_getgrgid (group)
     Look up an entry in the group database.  GROUP can be an integer, a
     string, or omitted, giving the behaviour of getgrgid, getgrnam or
     getgrent respectively.

   In addition to the accessor procedures for the user database, the
following shortcut procedure is also available.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getlogin
 -- C Function: scm_getlogin ()
     Return a string containing the name of the user logged in on the
     controlling terminal of the process, or ‘#f’ if this information
     cannot be obtained.


File: guile.info,  Node: Time,  Next: Runtime Environment,  Prev: User Information,  Up: POSIX

7.2.5 Time
----------

 -- Scheme Procedure: current-time
 -- C Function: scm_current_time ()
     Return the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,
     excluding leap seconds.

 -- Scheme Procedure: gettimeofday
 -- C Function: scm_gettimeofday ()
     Return a pair containing the number of seconds and microseconds
     since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, excluding leap seconds.  Note:
     whether true microsecond resolution is available depends on the
     operating system.

   The following procedures either accept an object representing a
broken down time and return a selected component, or accept an object
representing a broken down time and a value and set the component to the
value.  The numbers in parentheses give the usual range.

 -- Scheme Procedure: tm:sec tm
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-tm:sec tm val
     Seconds (0-59).
 -- Scheme Procedure: tm:min tm
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-tm:min tm val
     Minutes (0-59).
 -- Scheme Procedure: tm:hour tm
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-tm:hour tm val
     Hours (0-23).
 -- Scheme Procedure: tm:mday tm
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-tm:mday tm val
     Day of the month (1-31).
 -- Scheme Procedure: tm:mon tm
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-tm:mon tm val
     Month (0-11).
 -- Scheme Procedure: tm:year tm
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-tm:year tm val
     Year (70-), the year minus 1900.
 -- Scheme Procedure: tm:wday tm
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-tm:wday tm val
     Day of the week (0-6) with Sunday represented as 0.
 -- Scheme Procedure: tm:yday tm
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-tm:yday tm val
     Day of the year (0-364, 365 in leap years).
 -- Scheme Procedure: tm:isdst tm
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-tm:isdst tm val
     Daylight saving indicator (0 for “no”, greater than 0 for “yes”,
     less than 0 for “unknown”).
 -- Scheme Procedure: tm:gmtoff tm
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-tm:gmtoff tm val
     Time zone offset in seconds west of UTC (-46800 to 43200).  For
     example on East coast USA (zone ‘EST+5’) this would be 18000 (ie.
     5*60*60) in winter, or 14400 (ie. 4*60*60) during daylight savings.

     Note ‘tm:gmtoff’ is not the same as ‘tm_gmtoff’ in the C ‘tm’
     structure.  ‘tm_gmtoff’ is seconds east and hence the negative of
     the value here.
 -- Scheme Procedure: tm:zone tm
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-tm:zone tm val
     Time zone label (a string), not necessarily unique.

 -- Scheme Procedure: localtime time [zone]
 -- C Function: scm_localtime (time, zone)
     Return an object representing the broken down components of TIME,
     an integer like the one returned by ‘current-time’.  The time zone
     for the calculation is optionally specified by ZONE (a string),
     otherwise the ‘TZ’ environment variable or the system default is
     used.

 -- Scheme Procedure: gmtime time
 -- C Function: scm_gmtime (time)
     Return an object representing the broken down components of TIME,
     an integer like the one returned by ‘current-time’.  The values are
     calculated for UTC.

 -- Scheme Procedure: mktime sbd-time [zone]
 -- C Function: scm_mktime (sbd_time, zone)
     For a broken down time object SBD-TIME, return a pair the ‘car’ of
     which is an integer time like ‘current-time’, and the ‘cdr’ of
     which is a new broken down time with normalized fields.

     ZONE is a timezone string, or the default is the ‘TZ’ environment
     variable or the system default (*note* Specifying the Time Zone with
     ‘TZ’: (libc)TZ Variable.).  SBD-TIME is taken to be in that ZONE.

     The following fields of SBD-TIME are used: ‘tm:year’, ‘tm:mon’,
     ‘tm:mday’, ‘tm:hour’, ‘tm:min’, ‘tm:sec’, ‘tm:isdst’.  The values
     can be outside their usual ranges.  For example ‘tm:hour’ normally
     goes up to 23, but a value say 33 would mean 9 the following day.

     ‘tm:isdst’ in SBD-TIME says whether the time given is with daylight
     savings or not.  This is ignored if ZONE doesn’t have any daylight
     savings adjustment amount.

     The broken down time in the return normalizes the values of
     SBD-TIME by bringing them into their usual ranges, and using the
     actual daylight savings rule for that time in ZONE (which may
     differ from what SBD-TIME had).  The easiest way to think of this
     is that SBD-TIME plus ZONE converts to the integer UTC time, then a
     ‘localtime’ is applied to get the normal presentation of that time,
     in ZONE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: tzset
 -- C Function: scm_tzset ()
     Initialize the timezone from the ‘TZ’ environment variable or the
     system default.  It’s not usually necessary to call this procedure
     since it’s done automatically by other procedures that depend on
     the timezone.

 -- Scheme Procedure: strftime format tm
 -- C Function: scm_strftime (format, tm)
     Return a string which is broken-down time structure TM formatted
     according to the given FORMAT string.

     FORMAT contains field specifications introduced by a ‘%’ character.
     See *note* (libc)Formatting Calendar Time::, or ‘man 3 strftime’,
     for the available formatting.

          (strftime "%c" (localtime (current-time)))
          ⇒ "Mon Mar 11 20:17:43 2002"

     If ‘setlocale’ has been called (*note* Locales::), month and day
     names are from the current locale and in the locale character set.

 -- Scheme Procedure: strptime format string
 -- C Function: scm_strptime (format, string)
     Performs the reverse action to ‘strftime’, parsing STRING according
     to the specification supplied in FORMAT.  The interpretation of
     month and day names is dependent on the current locale.  The value
     returned is a pair.  The CAR has an object with time components in
     the form returned by ‘localtime’ or ‘gmtime’, but the time zone
     components are not usefully set.  The CDR reports the number of
     characters from STRING which were used for the conversion.

 -- Variable: internal-time-units-per-second
     The value of this variable is the number of time units per second
     reported by the following procedures.

 -- Scheme Procedure: times
 -- C Function: scm_times ()
     Return an object with information about real and processor time.
     The following procedures accept such an object as an argument and
     return a selected component:

      -- Scheme Procedure: tms:clock tms
          The current real time, expressed as time units relative to an
          arbitrary base.
      -- Scheme Procedure: tms:utime tms
          The CPU time units used by the calling process.
      -- Scheme Procedure: tms:stime tms
          The CPU time units used by the system on behalf of the calling
          process.
      -- Scheme Procedure: tms:cutime tms
          The CPU time units used by terminated child processes of the
          calling process, whose status has been collected (e.g., using
          ‘waitpid’).
      -- Scheme Procedure: tms:cstime tms
          Similarly, the CPU times units used by the system on behalf of
          terminated child processes.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-internal-real-time
 -- C Function: scm_get_internal_real_time ()
     Return the number of time units since the interpreter was started.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-internal-run-time
 -- C Function: scm_get_internal_run_time ()
     Return the number of time units of processor time used by the
     interpreter.  Both _system_ and _user_ time are included but
     subprocesses are not.

7.2.6 Runtime Environment
-------------------------

 -- Scheme Procedure: program-arguments
 -- Scheme Procedure: command-line
 -- Scheme Procedure: set-program-arguments
 -- C Function: scm_program_arguments ()
 -- C Function: scm_set_program_arguments_scm (lst)
     Get the command line arguments passed to Guile, or set new
     arguments.

     The arguments are a list of strings, the first of which is the
     invoked program name.  This is just "guile" (or the executable
     path) when run interactively, or it’s the script name when running
     a script with ‘-s’ (*note* Invoking Guile::).

          guile -L /my/extra/dir -s foo.scm abc def

          (program-arguments) ⇒ ("foo.scm" "abc" "def")

     ‘set-program-arguments’ allows a library module or similar to
     modify the arguments, for example to strip options it recognises,
     leaving the rest for the mainline.

     The argument list is held in a fluid, which means it’s separate for
     each thread.  Neither the list nor the strings within it are copied
     at any point and normally should not be mutated.

     The two names ‘program-arguments’ and ‘command-line’ are an
     historical accident, they both do exactly the same thing.  The name
     ‘scm_set_program_arguments_scm’ has an extra ‘_scm’ on the end to
     avoid clashing with the C function below.

 -- C Function: void scm_set_program_arguments (int argc, char **argv,
          char *first)
     Set the list of command line arguments for ‘program-arguments’ and
     ‘command-line’ above.

     ARGV is an array of null-terminated strings, as in a C ‘main’
     function.  ARGC is the number of strings in ARGV, or if it’s
     negative then a ‘NULL’ in ARGV marks its end.

     FIRST is an extra string put at the start of the arguments, or
     ‘NULL’ for no such extra.  This is a convenient way to pass the
     program name after advancing ARGV to strip option arguments.  Eg.

          {
            char *progname = argv[0];
            for (argv++; argv[0] != NULL && argv[0][0] == '-'; argv++)
              {
                /* munch option ... */
              }
            /* remaining args for scheme level use */
            scm_set_program_arguments (-1, argv, progname);
          }

     This sort of thing is often done at startup under ‘scm_boot_guile’
     with options handled at the C level removed.  The given strings are
     all copied, so the C data is not accessed again once
     ‘scm_set_program_arguments’ returns.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getenv name
 -- C Function: scm_getenv (name)
     Looks up the string NAME in the current environment.  The return
     value is ‘#f’ unless a string of the form ‘NAME=VALUE’ is found, in
     which case the string ‘VALUE’ is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setenv name value
     Modifies the environment of the current process, which is also the
     default environment inherited by child processes.

     If VALUE is ‘#f’, then NAME is removed from the environment.
     Otherwise, the string NAME=VALUE is added to the environment,
     replacing any existing string with name matching NAME.

     The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: unsetenv name
     Remove variable NAME from the environment.  The name can not
     contain a ‘=’ character.

 -- Scheme Procedure: environ [env]
 -- C Function: scm_environ (env)
     If ENV is omitted, return the current environment (in the Unix
     sense) as a list of strings.  Otherwise set the current
     environment, which is also the default environment for child
     processes, to the supplied list of strings.  Each member of ENV
     should be of the form NAME=VALUE and values of NAME should not be
     duplicated.  If ENV is supplied then the return value is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: putenv str
 -- C Function: scm_putenv (str)
     Modifies the environment of the current process, which is also the
     default environment inherited by child processes.

     If STR is of the form ‘NAME=VALUE’ then it will be written directly
     into the environment, replacing any existing environment string
     with name matching ‘NAME’.  If STR does not contain an equal sign,
     then any existing string with name matching STR will be removed.

     The return value is unspecified.

7.2.7 Processes
---------------

 -- Scheme Procedure: chdir str
 -- C Function: scm_chdir (str)
     Change the current working directory to STR.  STR can be a string
     containing a file name, or a port if supported by the system.
     ‘(provided? 'chdir-port)’ reports whether ports are supported.  The
     return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getcwd
 -- C Function: scm_getcwd ()
     Return the name of the current working directory.

 -- Scheme Procedure: umask [mode]
 -- C Function: scm_umask (mode)
     If MODE is omitted, returns a decimal number representing the
     current file creation mask.  Otherwise the file creation mask is
     set to MODE and the previous value is returned.  *Note* Assigning
     File Permissions: (libc)Setting Permissions, for more on how to use
     umasks.

     E.g., ‘(umask #o022)’ sets the mask to octal 22/decimal 18.

 -- Scheme Procedure: chroot path
 -- C Function: scm_chroot (path)
     Change the root directory to that specified in PATH.  This
     directory will be used for path names beginning with ‘/’.  The root
     directory is inherited by all children of the current process.
     Only the superuser may change the root directory.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getpid
 -- C Function: scm_getpid ()
     Return an integer representing the current process ID.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getgroups
 -- C Function: scm_getgroups ()
     Return a vector of integers representing the current supplementary
     group IDs.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getppid
 -- C Function: scm_getppid ()
     Return an integer representing the process ID of the parent
     process.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getuid
 -- C Function: scm_getuid ()
     Return an integer representing the current real user ID.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getgid
 -- C Function: scm_getgid ()
     Return an integer representing the current real group ID.

 -- Scheme Procedure: geteuid
 -- C Function: scm_geteuid ()
     Return an integer representing the current effective user ID. If
     the system does not support effective IDs, then the real ID is
     returned.  ‘(provided? 'EIDs)’ reports whether the system supports
     effective IDs.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getegid
 -- C Function: scm_getegid ()
     Return an integer representing the current effective group ID. If
     the system does not support effective IDs, then the real ID is
     returned.  ‘(provided? 'EIDs)’ reports whether the system supports
     effective IDs.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setgroups vec
 -- C Function: scm_setgroups (vec)
     Set the current set of supplementary group IDs to the integers in
     the given vector VEC.  The return value is unspecified.

     Generally only the superuser can set the process group IDs (*note*
     Setting the Group IDs: (libc)Setting Groups.).

 -- Scheme Procedure: setuid id
 -- C Function: scm_setuid (id)
     Sets both the real and effective user IDs to the integer ID,
     provided the process has appropriate privileges.  The return value
     is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setgid id
 -- C Function: scm_setgid (id)
     Sets both the real and effective group IDs to the integer ID,
     provided the process has appropriate privileges.  The return value
     is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: seteuid id
 -- C Function: scm_seteuid (id)
     Sets the effective user ID to the integer ID, provided the process
     has appropriate privileges.  If effective IDs are not supported,
     the real ID is set instead—‘(provided? 'EIDs)’ reports whether the
     system supports effective IDs.  The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setegid id
 -- C Function: scm_setegid (id)
     Sets the effective group ID to the integer ID, provided the process
     has appropriate privileges.  If effective IDs are not supported,
     the real ID is set instead—‘(provided? 'EIDs)’ reports whether the
     system supports effective IDs.  The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getpgrp
 -- C Function: scm_getpgrp ()
     Return an integer representing the current process group ID. This
     is the POSIX definition, not BSD.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setpgid pid pgid
 -- C Function: scm_setpgid (pid, pgid)
     Move the process PID into the process group PGID.  PID or PGID must
     be integers: they can be zero to indicate the ID of the current
     process.  Fails on systems that do not support job control.  The
     return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setsid
 -- C Function: scm_setsid ()
     Creates a new session.  The current process becomes the session
     leader and is put in a new process group.  The process will be
     detached from its controlling terminal if it has one.  The return
     value is an integer representing the new process group ID.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getsid pid
 -- C Function: scm_getsid (pid)
     Returns the session ID of process PID.  (The session ID of a
     process is the process group ID of its session leader.)

 -- Scheme Procedure: waitpid pid [options]
 -- C Function: scm_waitpid (pid, options)
     This procedure collects status information from a child process
     which has terminated or (optionally) stopped.  Normally it will
     suspend the calling process until this can be done.  If more than
     one child process is eligible then one will be chosen by the
     operating system.

     The value of PID determines the behaviour:

     PID greater than 0
          Request status information from the specified child process.
     PID equal to -1 or ‘WAIT_ANY’
          Request status information for any child process.
     PID equal to 0 or ‘WAIT_MYPGRP’
          Request status information for any child process in the
          current process group.
     PID less than -1
          Request status information for any child process whose process
          group ID is −PID.

     The OPTIONS argument, if supplied, should be the bitwise OR of the
     values of zero or more of the following variables:

      -- Variable: WNOHANG
          Return immediately even if there are no child processes to be
          collected.

      -- Variable: WUNTRACED
          Report status information for stopped processes as well as
          terminated processes.

     The return value is a pair containing:

       1. The process ID of the child process, or 0 if ‘WNOHANG’ was
          specified and no process was collected.
       2. The integer status value (*note* (libc)Process Completion
          Status::).

   The following three functions can be used to decode the integer
status value returned by ‘waitpid’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: status:exit-val status
 -- C Function: scm_status_exit_val (status)
     Return the exit status value, as would be set if a process ended
     normally through a call to ‘exit’ or ‘_exit’, if any, otherwise
     ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: status:term-sig status
 -- C Function: scm_status_term_sig (status)
     Return the signal number which terminated the process, if any,
     otherwise ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: status:stop-sig status
 -- C Function: scm_status_stop_sig (status)
     Return the signal number which stopped the process, if any,
     otherwise ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: system [cmd]
 -- C Function: scm_system (cmd)
     Execute CMD using the operating system’s “command processor”.
     Under Unix this is usually the default shell ‘sh’.  The value
     returned is CMD’s exit status as returned by ‘waitpid’, which can
     be interpreted using the functions above.

     If ‘system’ is called without arguments, return a boolean
     indicating whether the command processor is available.

 -- Scheme Procedure: system* arg1 arg2 ...
 -- C Function: scm_system_star (args)
     Execute the command indicated by ARG1 ARG2 ....  The first element
     must be a string indicating the command to be executed, and the
     remaining items must be strings representing each of the arguments
     to that command.

     This function returns the exit status of the command as provided by
     ‘waitpid’.  This value can be handled with ‘status:exit-val’ and
     the related functions.

     ‘system*’ is similar to ‘system’, but accepts only one string
     per-argument, and performs no shell interpretation.  The command is
     executed using fork and execlp.  Accordingly this function may be
     safer than ‘system’ in situations where shell interpretation is not
     required.

     Example: (system* "echo" "foo" "bar")

 -- Scheme Procedure: quit [status]
 -- Scheme Procedure: exit [status]
     Terminate the current process with proper unwinding of the Scheme
     stack.  The exit status zero if STATUS is not supplied.  If STATUS
     is supplied, and it is an integer, that integer is used as the exit
     status.  If STATUS is ‘#t’ or ‘#f’, the exit status is EXIT_SUCCESS
     or EXIT_FAILURE, respectively.

     The procedure ‘exit’ is an alias of ‘quit’.  They have the same
     functionality.

 -- Scheme Variable: EXIT_SUCCESS
 -- Scheme Variable: EXIT_FAILURE
     These constants represent the standard exit codes for success
     (zero) or failure (one.)

 -- Scheme Procedure: primitive-exit [status]
 -- Scheme Procedure: primitive-_exit [status]
 -- C Function: scm_primitive_exit (status)
 -- C Function: scm_primitive__exit (status)
     Terminate the current process without unwinding the Scheme stack.
     The exit status is STATUS if supplied, otherwise zero.

     ‘primitive-exit’ uses the C ‘exit’ function and hence runs usual C
     level cleanups (flush output streams, call ‘atexit’ functions, etc,
     see *note* (libc)Normal Termination::)).

     ‘primitive-_exit’ is the ‘_exit’ system call (*note*
     (libc)Termination Internals::).  This terminates the program
     immediately, with neither Scheme-level nor C-level cleanups.

     The typical use for ‘primitive-_exit’ is from a child process
     created with ‘primitive-fork’.  For example in a Gdk program the
     child process inherits the X server connection and a C-level
     ‘atexit’ cleanup which will close that connection.  But closing in
     the child would upset the protocol in the parent, so
     ‘primitive-_exit’ should be used to exit without that.

 -- Scheme Procedure: execl filename arg ...
 -- C Function: scm_execl (filename, args)
     Executes the file named by FILENAME as a new process image.  The
     remaining arguments are supplied to the process; from a C program
     they are accessible as the ‘argv’ argument to ‘main’.
     Conventionally the first ARG is the same as FILENAME.  All
     arguments must be strings.

     If ARG is missing, FILENAME is executed with a null argument list,
     which may have system-dependent side-effects.

     This procedure is currently implemented using the ‘execv’ system
     call, but we call it ‘execl’ because of its Scheme calling
     interface.

 -- Scheme Procedure: execlp filename arg ...
 -- C Function: scm_execlp (filename, args)
     Similar to ‘execl’, however if FILENAME does not contain a slash
     then the file to execute will be located by searching the
     directories listed in the ‘PATH’ environment variable.

     This procedure is currently implemented using the ‘execvp’ system
     call, but we call it ‘execlp’ because of its Scheme calling
     interface.

 -- Scheme Procedure: execle filename env arg ...
 -- C Function: scm_execle (filename, env, args)
     Similar to ‘execl’, but the environment of the new process is
     specified by ENV, which must be a list of strings as returned by
     the ‘environ’ procedure.

     This procedure is currently implemented using the ‘execve’ system
     call, but we call it ‘execle’ because of its Scheme calling
     interface.

 -- Scheme Procedure: primitive-fork
 -- C Function: scm_fork ()
     Creates a new “child” process by duplicating the current “parent”
     process.  In the child the return value is 0.  In the parent the
     return value is the integer process ID of the child.

     Note that it is unsafe to fork a process that has multiple threads
     running, as only the thread that calls ‘primitive-fork’ will
     persist in the child.  Any resources that other threads held, such
     as locked mutexes or open file descriptors, are lost.  Indeed,
     POSIX specifies that only async-signal-safe procedures are safe to
     call after a multithreaded fork, which is a very limited set.
     Guile issues a warning if it detects a fork from a multi-threaded
     program.

          Note: If you are looking to spawn a process with some pipes
          set up, using the ‘spawn’ procedure described below will be
          more robust (in particular in multi-threaded contexts), more
          portable, and usually more efficient than the combination of
          ‘primitive-fork’ and ‘execl’.

     This procedure has been renamed from ‘fork’ to avoid a naming
     conflict with the scsh fork.

 -- Scheme Procedure: spawn PROGRAM ARGUMENTS [#:environment=(environ)]
          [#:input=(current-input-port)]
          [#:output=(current-output-port)]
          [#:error=(current-error-port)] [#:search-path?=#t]
     Spawn a new child process executing PROGRAM with the given
     ARGUMENTS, a list of one or more strings (by convention, the first
     argument is typically PROGRAM), and return its PID. Raise a
     ‘system-error’ exception if PROGRAM could not be found or could not
     be executed.

     If the keyword argument ‘#:search-path?’ is true, it selects
     whether the ‘PATH’ environment variable should be inspected to find
     PROGRAM.  It is true by default.

     The ‘#:environment’ keyword parameter specifies the list of
     environment variables of the child process.  It defaults to
     ‘(environ)’.

     The keyword arguments ‘#:input’, ‘#:output’, and ‘#:error’ specify
     the port or file descriptor for the child process to use as
     standard input, standard output, and standard error.  No other file
     descriptors are inherited from the parent process.

   The example below shows how to spawn the ‘uname’ program with the
‘-o’ option (*note* (coreutils)uname invocation::), redirect its standard
output to a pipe, and read from it:

     (use-modules (rnrs io ports))

     (let* ((input+output (pipe))
            (pid (spawn "uname" '("uname" "-o")
                         #:output (cdr input+output))))
       (close-port (cdr input+output))
       (format #t "read ~s~%" (get-string-all (car input+output)))
       (close-port (car input+output))
       (waitpid pid))

     ⊣ read "GNU/Linux\n"
     ⇒ (1234 . 0)

 -- Scheme Procedure: nice incr
 -- C Function: scm_nice (incr)
     Increment the priority of the current process by INCR.  A higher
     priority value means that the process runs less often.  The return
     value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setpriority which who prio
 -- C Function: scm_setpriority (which, who, prio)
     Set the scheduling priority of the process, process group or user,
     as indicated by WHICH and WHO.  WHICH is one of the variables
     ‘PRIO_PROCESS’, ‘PRIO_PGRP’ or ‘PRIO_USER’, and WHO is interpreted
     relative to WHICH (a process identifier for ‘PRIO_PROCESS’, process
     group identifier for ‘PRIO_PGRP’, and a user identifier for
     ‘PRIO_USER’.  A zero value of WHO denotes the current process,
     process group, or user.  PRIO is a value in the range [−20,20].
     The default priority is 0; lower priorities (in numerical terms)
     cause more favorable scheduling.  Sets the priority of all of the
     specified processes.  Only the super-user may lower priorities.
     The return value is not specified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getpriority which who
 -- C Function: scm_getpriority (which, who)
     Return the scheduling priority of the process, process group or
     user, as indicated by WHICH and WHO.  WHICH is one of the variables
     ‘PRIO_PROCESS’, ‘PRIO_PGRP’ or ‘PRIO_USER’, and WHO should be
     interpreted depending on WHICH (a process identifier for
     ‘PRIO_PROCESS’, process group identifier for ‘PRIO_PGRP’, and a
     user identifier for ‘PRIO_USER’).  A zero value of WHO denotes the
     current process, process group, or user.  Return the highest
     priority (lowest numerical value) of any of the specified
     processes.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getaffinity pid
 -- C Function: scm_getaffinity (pid)
     Return a bitvector representing the CPU affinity mask for process
     PID.  Each CPU the process has affinity with has its corresponding
     bit set in the returned bitvector.  The number of bits set is a
     good estimate of how many CPUs Guile can use without stepping on
     other processes’ toes.

     Currently this procedure is only defined on GNU variants (*note*
     ‘sched_getaffinity’: (libc)CPU Affinity.).

 -- Scheme Procedure: setaffinity pid mask
 -- C Function: scm_setaffinity (pid, mask)
     Install the CPU affinity mask MASK, a bitvector, for the process or
     thread with ID PID.  The return value is unspecified.

     Currently this procedure is only defined on GNU variants (*note*
     ‘sched_setaffinity’: (libc)CPU Affinity.).

   *Note* Threads::, for information on how get the number of processors
available on a system.

7.2.8 Signals
-------------

The following procedures raise, handle and wait for signals.

   Scheme code signal handlers are run via an async (*note* Asyncs::), so
they’re called in the handler’s thread at the next safe opportunity.
Generally this is after any currently executing primitive procedure
finishes (which could be a long time for primitives that wait for an
external event).

 -- Scheme Procedure: kill pid sig
 -- C Function: scm_kill (pid, sig)
     Sends a signal to the specified process or group of processes.

     PID specifies the processes to which the signal is sent:

     PID greater than 0
          The process whose identifier is PID.
     PID equal to 0
          All processes in the current process group.
     PID less than -1
          The process group whose identifier is -PID
     PID equal to -1
          If the process is privileged, all processes except for some
          special system processes.  Otherwise, all processes with the
          current effective user ID.

     SIG should be specified using a variable corresponding to the Unix
     symbolic name, e.g.,

      -- Variable: SIGHUP
          Hang-up signal.

      -- Variable: SIGINT
          Interrupt signal.

     A full list of signals on the GNU system may be found in *note*
     (libc)Standard Signals::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: raise sig
 -- C Function: scm_raise (sig)
     Sends a specified signal SIG to the current process, where SIG is
     as described for the ‘kill’ procedure.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sigaction signum [handler [flags [thread]]]
 -- C Function: scm_sigaction (signum, handler, flags)
 -- C Function: scm_sigaction_for_thread (signum, handler, flags,
          thread)
     Install or report the signal handler for a specified signal.

     SIGNUM is the signal number, which can be specified using the value
     of variables such as ‘SIGINT’.

     If HANDLER is omitted, ‘sigaction’ returns a pair: the CAR is the
     current signal hander, which will be either an integer with the
     value ‘SIG_DFL’ (default action) or ‘SIG_IGN’ (ignore), or the
     Scheme procedure which handles the signal, or ‘#f’ if a non-Scheme
     procedure handles the signal.  The CDR contains the current
     ‘sigaction’ flags for the handler.

     If HANDLER is provided, it is installed as the new handler for
     SIGNUM.  HANDLER can be a Scheme procedure taking one argument, or
     the value of ‘SIG_DFL’ (default action) or ‘SIG_IGN’ (ignore), or
     ‘#f’ to restore whatever signal handler was installed before
     ‘sigaction’ was first used.  When a scheme procedure has been
     specified, that procedure will run in the given THREAD.  When no
     thread has been given, the thread that made this call to
     ‘sigaction’ is used.

     FLAGS is a ‘logior’ (*note* Bitwise Operations::) of the following
     (where provided by the system), or ‘0’ for none.

      -- Variable: SA_NOCLDSTOP
          By default, ‘SIGCHLD’ is signalled when a child process stops
          (ie. receives ‘SIGSTOP’), and when a child process terminates.
          With the ‘SA_NOCLDSTOP’ flag, ‘SIGCHLD’ is only signalled for
          termination, not stopping.

          ‘SA_NOCLDSTOP’ has no effect on signals other than ‘SIGCHLD’.

      -- Variable: SA_RESTART
          If a signal occurs while in a system call, deliver the signal
          then restart the system call (as opposed to returning an
          ‘EINTR’ error from that call).

     Guile handles signals asynchronously.  When it receives a signal,
     the synchronous signal handler just records the fact that a signal
     was received and sets a flag to tell the relevant Guile thread that
     it has a pending signal.  When the Guile thread checks the
     pending-interrupt flag, it will arrange to run the asynchronous
     part of the signal handler, which is the handler attached by
     ‘sigaction’.

     This strategy has some perhaps-unexpected interactions with the
     ‘SA_RESTART’ flag, though: because the synchronous handler doesn’t
     do very much, and notably it doesn’t run the Guile handler, it’s
     impossible to interrupt a thread stuck in a long-running system
     call via a signal handler that is installed with ‘SA_RESTART’: the
     synchronous handler just records the pending interrupt, but then
     the system call resumes and Guile doesn’t have a chance to actually
     check the flag and run the asynchronous handler.  That’s just how
     it is.

     The return value is a pair with information about the old handler
     as described above.

     This interface does not provide access to the “signal blocking”
     facility.  Maybe this is not needed, since the thread support may
     provide solutions to the problem of consistent access to data
     structures.

 -- Scheme Procedure: restore-signals
 -- C Function: scm_restore_signals ()
     Return all signal handlers to the values they had before any call
     to ‘sigaction’ was made.  The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: alarm i
 -- C Function: scm_alarm (i)
     Set a timer to raise a ‘SIGALRM’ signal after the specified number
     of seconds (an integer).  It’s advisable to install a signal
     handler for ‘SIGALRM’ beforehand, since the default action is to
     terminate the process.

     The return value indicates the time remaining for the previous
     alarm, if any.  The new value replaces the previous alarm.  If
     there was no previous alarm, the return value is zero.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pause
 -- C Function: scm_pause ()
     Pause the current process (thread?)  until a signal arrives whose
     action is to either terminate the current process or invoke a
     handler procedure.  The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sleep secs
 -- Scheme Procedure: usleep usecs
 -- C Function: scm_sleep (secs)
 -- C Function: scm_usleep (usecs)
     Wait the given period SECS seconds or USECS microseconds (both
     integers).  If a signal arrives the wait stops and the return value
     is the time remaining, in seconds or microseconds respectively.  If
     the period elapses with no signal the return is zero.

     On most systems the process scheduler is not microsecond accurate
     and the actual period slept by ‘usleep’ might be rounded to a
     system clock tick boundary, which might be 10 milliseconds for
     instance.

     See ‘scm_std_sleep’ and ‘scm_std_usleep’ for equivalents at the C
     level (*note* Blocking::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: getitimer which_timer
 -- Scheme Procedure: setitimer which_timer interval_seconds
          interval_microseconds value_seconds value_microseconds
 -- C Function: scm_getitimer (which_timer)
 -- C Function: scm_setitimer (which_timer, interval_seconds,
          interval_microseconds, value_seconds, value_microseconds)
     Get or set the periods programmed in certain system timers.

     These timers have two settings.  The first setting, the interval,
     is the value at which the timer will be reset when the current
     timer expires.  The second is the current value of the timer,
     indicating when the next expiry will be signalled.

     WHICH_TIMER is one of the following values:

      -- Variable: ITIMER_REAL
          A real-time timer, counting down elapsed real time.  At zero
          it raises ‘SIGALRM’.  This is like ‘alarm’ above, but with a
          higher resolution period.

      -- Variable: ITIMER_VIRTUAL
          A virtual-time timer, counting down while the current process
          is actually using CPU. At zero it raises ‘SIGVTALRM’.

      -- Variable: ITIMER_PROF
          A profiling timer, counting down while the process is running
          (like ‘ITIMER_VIRTUAL’) and also while system calls are
          running on the process’s behalf.  At zero it raises a
          ‘SIGPROF’.

          This timer is intended for profiling where a program is
          spending its time (by looking where it is when the timer goes
          off).

     ‘getitimer’ returns the restart timer value and its current value,
     as a list containing two pairs.  Each pair is a time in seconds and
     microseconds: ‘((INTERVAL_SECS . INTERVAL_USECS) (VALUE_SECS .
     VALUE_USECS))’.

     ‘setitimer’ sets the timer values similarly, in seconds and
     microseconds (which must be integers).  The interval value can be
     zero to have the timer run down just once.  The return value is the
     timer’s previous setting, in the same form as ‘getitimer’ returns.

          (setitimer ITIMER_REAL
                     5 500000     ;; Raise SIGALRM every 5.5 seconds
                     2 0)         ;; with the first SIGALRM in 2 seconds

     Although the timers are programmed in microseconds, the actual
     accuracy might not be that high.

     Note that ‘ITIMER_PROF’ and ‘ITIMER_VIRTUAL’ are not functional on
     all platforms and may always error when called.  ‘(provided?
     'ITIMER_PROF)’ and ‘(provided? 'ITIMER_VIRTUAL)’ can be used to
     test if the those itimers are supported on the given host.
     ‘ITIMER_REAL’ is supported on all platforms that support
     ‘setitimer’.

7.2.9 Terminals and Ptys
------------------------

 -- Scheme Procedure: isatty? port
 -- C Function: scm_isatty_p (port)
     Return ‘#t’ if PORT is using a serial non–file device, otherwise
     ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: ttyname port
 -- C Function: scm_ttyname (port)
     Return a string with the name of the serial terminal device
     underlying PORT.

 -- Scheme Procedure: ctermid
 -- C Function: scm_ctermid ()
     Return a string containing the file name of the controlling
     terminal for the current process.

 -- Scheme Procedure: tcgetpgrp port
 -- C Function: scm_tcgetpgrp (port)
     Return the process group ID of the foreground process group
     associated with the terminal open on the file descriptor underlying
     PORT.

     If there is no foreground process group, the return value is a
     number greater than 1 that does not match the process group ID of
     any existing process group.  This can happen if all of the
     processes in the job that was formerly the foreground job have
     terminated, and no other job has yet been moved into the
     foreground.

 -- Scheme Procedure: tcsetpgrp port pgid
 -- C Function: scm_tcsetpgrp (port, pgid)
     Set the foreground process group ID for the terminal used by the
     file descriptor underlying PORT to the integer PGID.  The calling
     process must be a member of the same session as PGID and must have
     the same controlling terminal.  The return value is unspecified.

7.2.10 Pipes
------------

The following procedures are similar to the ‘popen’ and ‘pclose’ system
routines.  The code is in a separate “popen” module(1):

     (use-modules (ice-9 popen))

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-pipe command mode
 -- Scheme Procedure: open-pipe* mode prog [args...]
     Execute a command in a subprocess, with a pipe to it or from it, or
     with pipes in both directions.

     ‘open-pipe’ runs the shell COMMAND using ‘/bin/sh -c’.
     ‘open-pipe*’ executes PROG directly, with the optional ARGS
     arguments (all strings).

     MODE should be one of the following values.  ‘OPEN_READ’ is an
     input pipe, ie. to read from the subprocess.  ‘OPEN_WRITE’ is an
     output pipe, ie. to write to it.

      -- Variable: OPEN_READ
      -- Variable: OPEN_WRITE
      -- Variable: OPEN_BOTH

     For an input pipe, the child’s standard output is the pipe and
     standard input is inherited from ‘current-input-port’.  For an
     output pipe, the child’s standard input is the pipe and standard
     output is inherited from ‘current-output-port’.  In all cases the
     child’s standard error is inherited from ‘current-error-port’
     (*note* Default Ports::).

     If those ‘current-X-ports’ are not files of some kind, and hence
     don’t have file descriptors for the child, then ‘/dev/null’ is used
     instead.

     Care should be taken with ‘OPEN_BOTH’, a deadlock will occur if
     both parent and child are writing, and waiting until the write
     completes before doing any reading.  Each direction has ‘PIPE_BUF’
     bytes of buffering (*note* Buffering::), which will be enough for
     small writes, but not for say putting a big file through a filter.

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-input-pipe command
     Equivalent to ‘open-pipe’ with mode ‘OPEN_READ’.

          (let* ((port (open-input-pipe "date --utc"))
                 (str  (read-line port))) ; from (ice-9 rdelim)
            (close-pipe port)
            str)
          ⇒ "Mon Mar 11 20:10:44 UTC 2002"

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-output-pipe command
     Equivalent to ‘open-pipe’ with mode ‘OPEN_WRITE’.

          (let ((port (open-output-pipe "lpr")))
            (display "Something for the line printer.\n" port)
            (if (not (eqv? 0 (status:exit-val (close-pipe port))))
                (error "Cannot print")))

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-input-output-pipe command
     Equivalent to ‘open-pipe’ with mode ‘OPEN_BOTH’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: close-pipe port
     Close a pipe created by ‘open-pipe’, wait for the process to
     terminate, and return the wait status code.  The status is as per
     ‘waitpid’ and can be decoded with ‘status:exit-val’ etc (*note*
     Processes::)


   ‘waitpid WAIT_ANY’ should not be used when pipes are open, since it
can reap a pipe’s child process, causing an error from a subsequent
‘close-pipe’.

   ‘close-port’ (*note* Ports::) can close a pipe, but it doesn’t reap
the child process.

   The garbage collector will close a pipe no longer in use, and reap
the child process with ‘waitpid’.  If the child hasn’t yet terminated
the garbage collector doesn’t block, but instead checks again in the
next GC.

   Many systems have per-user and system-wide limits on the number of
processes, and a system-wide limit on the number of pipes, so pipes
should be closed explicitly when no longer needed, rather than letting
the garbage collector pick them up at some later time.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pipeline COMMANDS
     Execute a pipeline of COMMANDS, where each command is a list of a
     program and its arguments as strings, returning an input port to
     the end of the pipeline, an output port to the beginning of the
     pipeline and a list of PIDs of the processes executing the
     COMMANDS.

          (let ((commands '(("git" "ls-files")
                            ("tar" "-cf-" "-T-")
                            ("sha1sum" "-")))
                (success? (lambda (pid)
                            (zero?
                             (status:exit-val (cdr (waitpid pid)))))))
            (receive (from to pids) (pipeline commands)
              (let* ((sha1 (read-delimited " " from))
                     (index (list-index (negate success?) (reverse pids))))
                (close to)
                (close from)
                (if (not index)
                    sha1
                    (string-append "pipeline failed in command: "
                                   (string-join (list-ref commands index)))))))
          ⇒ "52f99d234503fca8c84ef94b1005a3a28d8b3bc1"

### 7.2.11.1 Network Address Conversion
...................................

This section describes procedures which convert internet addresses
between numeric and string formats.

### IPv4 Address Conversion
.......................

An IPv4 Internet address is a 4-byte value, represented in Guile as an
integer in host byte order, so that say “0.0.0.1” is 1, or “1.0.0.0” is
16777216.

   Some underlying C functions use network byte order for addresses,
Guile converts as necessary so that at the Scheme level its host byte
order everywhere.

 -- Variable: INADDR_ANY
     For a server, this can be used with ‘bind’ (*note* Network Sockets
     and Communication::) to allow connections from any interface on the
     machine.

 -- Variable: INADDR_BROADCAST
     The broadcast address on the local network.

 -- Variable: INADDR_LOOPBACK
     The address of the local host using the loopback device, ie.
     ‘127.0.0.1’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: inet-netof address
 -- C Function: scm_inet_netof (address)
     Return the network number part of the given IPv4 Internet address.
     E.g.,

          (inet-netof 2130706433) ⇒ 127

 -- Scheme Procedure: inet-lnaof address
 -- C Function: scm_lnaof (address)
     Return the local-address-with-network part of the given IPv4
     Internet address, using the obsolete class A/B/C system.  E.g.,

          (inet-lnaof 2130706433) ⇒ 1

 -- Scheme Procedure: inet-makeaddr net lna
 -- C Function: scm_inet_makeaddr (net, lna)
     Make an IPv4 Internet address by combining the network number NET
     with the local-address-within-network number LNA.  E.g.,

          (inet-makeaddr 127 1) ⇒ 2130706433

### IPv6 Address Conversion
.......................

An IPv6 Internet address is a 16-byte value, represented in Guile as an
integer in host byte order, so that say “::1” is 1.  The following
constants are defined for convenience.

 -- Variable: IN6ADDR_ANY
     For a server, this can be used with ‘bind’ (*note* Network Sockets
     and Communication::) to allow connections from any IPv6 interface
     on the machine.

 -- Variable: IN6ADDR_LOOPBACK
     The address of the local host using the loopback device, ie. ‘::1’.

   The procedures below convert an IPv6 _or_ an IPv4 address to and from
its textual representation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: inet-ntop family address
 -- C Function: scm_inet_ntop (family, address)
     Convert a network address from an integer to a printable string.
     FAMILY can be ‘AF_INET’ or ‘AF_INET6’.  E.g.,

          (inet-ntop AF_INET 2130706433) ⇒ "127.0.0.1"
          (inet-ntop AF_INET6 (- (expt 2 128) 1))
            ⇒ "ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff"

 -- Scheme Procedure: inet-pton family address
 -- C Function: scm_inet_pton (family, address)
     Convert a string containing a printable network address to an
     integer address.  FAMILY can be ‘AF_INET’ or ‘AF_INET6’.  E.g.,

          (inet-pton AF_INET "127.0.0.1") ⇒ 2130706433
          (inet-pton AF_INET6 "::1") ⇒ 1

### 7.2.11.2 Network Databases
..........................

This section describes procedures which query various network databases.
Care should be taken when using the database routines since they are not
reentrant.

### ‘getaddrinfo’
.............

The ‘getaddrinfo’ procedure maps host and service names to socket
addresses and associated information in a protocol-independent way.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getaddrinfo name service [hint_flags [hint_family
          [hint_socktype [hint_protocol]]]]
 -- C Function: scm_getaddrinfo (name, service, hint_flags, hint_family,
          hint_socktype, hint_protocol)
     Return a list of ‘addrinfo’ structures containing a socket address
     and associated information for host NAME and/or SERVICE to be used
     in creating a socket with which to address the specified service.

          (let* ((ai (car (getaddrinfo "www.gnu.org" "http")))
                 (s  (socket (addrinfo:fam ai) (addrinfo:socktype ai)
                             (addrinfo:protocol ai))))
            (connect s (addrinfo:addr ai))
            s)

     When SERVICE is omitted or is ‘#f’, return network-level addresses
     for NAME.  When NAME is ‘#f’ SERVICE must be provided and service
     locations local to the caller are returned.

     Additional hints can be provided.  When specified, HINT_FLAGS
     should be a bitwise-or of zero or more constants among the
     following:

     ‘AI_PASSIVE’
          Socket address is intended for ‘bind’.

     ‘AI_CANONNAME’
          Request for canonical host name, available via
          ‘addrinfo:canonname’.  This makes sense mainly when DNS
          lookups are involved.

     ‘AI_NUMERICHOST’
          Specifies that NAME is a numeric host address string (e.g.,
          ‘"127.0.0.1"’), meaning that name resolution will not be used.

     ‘AI_NUMERICSERV’
          Likewise, specifies that SERVICE is a numeric port string
          (e.g., ‘"80"’).

     ‘AI_ADDRCONFIG’
          Return only addresses configured on the local system It is
          highly recommended to provide this flag when the returned
          socket addresses are to be used to make connections;
          otherwise, some of the returned addresses could be unreachable
          or use a protocol that is not supported.

     ‘AI_V4MAPPED’
          When looking up IPv6 addresses, return mapped IPv4 addresses
          if there is no IPv6 address available at all.

     ‘AI_ALL’
          If this flag is set along with ‘AI_V4MAPPED’ when looking up
          IPv6 addresses, return all IPv6 addresses as well as all IPv4
          addresses, the latter mapped to IPv6 format.

     When given, HINT_FAMILY should specify the requested address
     family, e.g., ‘AF_INET6’.  Similarly, HINT_SOCKTYPE should specify
     the requested socket type (e.g., ‘SOCK_DGRAM’), and HINT_PROTOCOL
     should specify the requested protocol (its value is interpreted as
     in calls to ‘socket’).

     On error, an exception with key ‘getaddrinfo-error’ is thrown, with
     an error code (an integer) as its argument:

          (catch 'getaddrinfo-error
            (lambda ()
              (getaddrinfo "www.gnu.org" "gopher"))
            (lambda (key errcode)
              (cond ((= errcode EAI_SERVICE)
               (display "doesn't know about Gopher!\n"))
              ((= errcode EAI_NONAME)
               (display "www.gnu.org not found\\n"))
              (else
               (format #t "something wrong: ~a\n"
                  (gai-strerror errcode))))))

     Error codes are:

     ‘EAI_AGAIN’
          The name or service could not be resolved at this time.
          Future attempts may succeed.

     ‘EAI_BADFLAGS’
          HINT_FLAGS contains an invalid value.

     ‘EAI_FAIL’
          A non-recoverable error occurred when attempting to resolve
          the name.

     ‘EAI_FAMILY’
          HINT_FAMILY was not recognized.

     ‘EAI_NONAME’
          Either NAME does not resolve for the supplied parameters, or
          neither NAME nor SERVICE were supplied.

     ‘EAI_NODATA’
          This non-POSIX error code can be returned on some systems (GNU
          and Darwin, at least), for example when NAME is known but
          requests that were made turned out no data.  Error handling
          code should be prepared to handle it when it is defined.

     ‘EAI_SERVICE’
          SERVICE was not recognized for the specified socket type.

     ‘EAI_SOCKTYPE’
          HINT_SOCKTYPE was not recognized.

     ‘EAI_SYSTEM’
          A system error occurred.  In C, the error code can be found in
          ‘errno’; this value is not accessible from Scheme, but in
          practice it provides little information about the actual error
          cause.

     Users are encouraged to read the "POSIX specification
     (http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getaddrinfo.html)
     for more details.

   The following procedures take an ‘addrinfo’ object as returned by
‘getaddrinfo’:

 -- Scheme Procedure: addrinfo:flags ai
     Return flags for AI as a bitwise or of ‘AI_’ values (see above).

 -- Scheme Procedure: addrinfo:fam ai
     Return the address family of AI (a ‘AF_’ value).

 -- Scheme Procedure: addrinfo:socktype ai
     Return the socket type for AI (a ‘SOCK_’ value).

 -- Scheme Procedure: addrinfo:protocol ai
     Return the protocol of AI.

 -- Scheme Procedure: addrinfo:addr ai
     Return the socket address associated with AI as a ‘sockaddr’ object
     (*note* Network Socket Address::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: addrinfo:canonname ai
     Return a string for the canonical name associated with AI if the
     ‘AI_CANONNAME’ flag was supplied.

### The Host Database
.................

A “host object” is a structure that represents what is known about a
network host, and is the usual way of representing a system’s network
identity inside software.

   The following functions accept a host object and return a selected
component:

 -- Scheme Procedure: hostent:name host
     The “official” hostname for HOST.
 -- Scheme Procedure: hostent:aliases host
     A list of aliases for HOST.
 -- Scheme Procedure: hostent:addrtype host
     The host address type, one of the ‘AF’ constants, such as ‘AF_INET’
     or ‘AF_INET6’.
 -- Scheme Procedure: hostent:length host
     The length of each address for HOST, in bytes.
 -- Scheme Procedure: hostent:addr-list host
     The list of network addresses associated with HOST.  For ‘AF_INET’
     these are integer IPv4 address (*note* Network Address
     Conversion::).

   The following procedures can be used to search the host database.
However, ‘getaddrinfo’ should be preferred over them since it’s more
generic and thread-safe.

 -- Scheme Procedure: gethost [host]
 -- Scheme Procedure: gethostbyname hostname
 -- Scheme Procedure: gethostbyaddr address
 -- C Function: scm_gethost (host)
     Look up a host by name or address, returning a host object.  The
     ‘gethost’ procedure will accept either a string name or an integer
     address; if given no arguments, it behaves like ‘gethostent’ (see
     below).  If a name or address is supplied but the address can not
     be found, an error will be thrown to one of the keys:
     ‘host-not-found’, ‘try-again’, ‘no-recovery’ or ‘no-data’,
     corresponding to the equivalent ‘h_error’ values.  Unusual
     conditions may result in errors thrown to the ‘system-error’ or
     ‘misc_error’ keys.

          (gethost "www.gnu.org")
          ⇒ #("www.gnu.org" () 2 4 (3353880842))

          (gethostbyname "www.emacs.org")
          ⇒ #("emacs.org" ("www.emacs.org") 2 4 (1073448978))

   The following procedures may be used to step through the host
database from beginning to end.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sethostent [stayopen]
     Initialize an internal stream from which host objects may be read.
     This procedure must be called before any calls to ‘gethostent’, and
     may also be called afterward to reset the host entry stream.  If
     STAYOPEN is supplied and is not ‘#f’, the database is not closed by
     subsequent ‘gethostbyname’ or ‘gethostbyaddr’ calls, possibly
     giving an efficiency gain.

 -- Scheme Procedure: gethostent
     Return the next host object from the host database, or ‘#f’ if
     there are no more hosts to be found (or an error has been
     encountered).  This procedure may not be used before ‘sethostent’
     has been called.

 -- Scheme Procedure: endhostent
     Close the stream used by ‘gethostent’.  The return value is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sethost [stayopen]
 -- C Function: scm_sethost (stayopen)
     If STAYOPEN is omitted, this is equivalent to ‘endhostent’.
     Otherwise it is equivalent to ‘sethostent stayopen’.

### The Network Database
....................

The following functions accept an object representing a network and
return a selected component:

 -- Scheme Procedure: netent:name net
     The “official” network name.
 -- Scheme Procedure: netent:aliases net
     A list of aliases for the network.
 -- Scheme Procedure: netent:addrtype net
     The type of the network number.  Currently, this returns only
     ‘AF_INET’.
 -- Scheme Procedure: netent:net net
     The network number.

   The following procedures are used to search the network database:

 -- Scheme Procedure: getnet [net]
 -- Scheme Procedure: getnetbyname net-name
 -- Scheme Procedure: getnetbyaddr net-number
 -- C Function: scm_getnet (net)
     Look up a network by name or net number in the network database.
     The NET-NAME argument must be a string, and the NET-NUMBER argument
     must be an integer.  ‘getnet’ will accept either type of argument,
     behaving like ‘getnetent’ (see below) if no arguments are given.

   The following procedures may be used to step through the network
database from beginning to end.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setnetent [stayopen]
     Initialize an internal stream from which network objects may be
     read.  This procedure must be called before any calls to
     ‘getnetent’, and may also be called afterward to reset the net
     entry stream.  If STAYOPEN is supplied and is not ‘#f’, the
     database is not closed by subsequent ‘getnetbyname’ or
     ‘getnetbyaddr’ calls, possibly giving an efficiency gain.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getnetent
     Return the next entry from the network database.

 -- Scheme Procedure: endnetent
     Close the stream used by ‘getnetent’.  The return value is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setnet [stayopen]
 -- C Function: scm_setnet (stayopen)
     If STAYOPEN is omitted, this is equivalent to ‘endnetent’.
     Otherwise it is equivalent to ‘setnetent stayopen’.

### The Protocol Database
.....................

The following functions accept an object representing a protocol and
return a selected component:

 -- Scheme Procedure: protoent:name protocol
     The “official” protocol name.
 -- Scheme Procedure: protoent:aliases protocol
     A list of aliases for the protocol.
 -- Scheme Procedure: protoent:proto protocol
     The protocol number.

   The following procedures are used to search the protocol database:

 -- Scheme Procedure: getproto [protocol]
 -- Scheme Procedure: getprotobyname name
 -- Scheme Procedure: getprotobynumber number
 -- C Function: scm_getproto (protocol)
     Look up a network protocol by name or by number.  ‘getprotobyname’
     takes a string argument, and ‘getprotobynumber’ takes an integer
     argument.  ‘getproto’ will accept either type, behaving like
     ‘getprotoent’ (see below) if no arguments are supplied.

   The following procedures may be used to step through the protocol
database from beginning to end.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setprotoent [stayopen]
     Initialize an internal stream from which protocol objects may be
     read.  This procedure must be called before any calls to
     ‘getprotoent’, and may also be called afterward to reset the
     protocol entry stream.  If STAYOPEN is supplied and is not ‘#f’,
     the database is not closed by subsequent ‘getprotobyname’ or
     ‘getprotobynumber’ calls, possibly giving an efficiency gain.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getprotoent
     Return the next entry from the protocol database.

 -- Scheme Procedure: endprotoent
     Close the stream used by ‘getprotoent’.  The return value is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setproto [stayopen]
 -- C Function: scm_setproto (stayopen)
     If STAYOPEN is omitted, this is equivalent to ‘endprotoent’.
     Otherwise it is equivalent to ‘setprotoent stayopen’.

### The Service Database
....................

The following functions accept an object representing a service and
return a selected component:

 -- Scheme Procedure: servent:name serv
     The “official” name of the network service.
 -- Scheme Procedure: servent:aliases serv
     A list of aliases for the network service.
 -- Scheme Procedure: servent:port serv
     The Internet port used by the service.
 -- Scheme Procedure: servent:proto serv
     The protocol used by the service.  A service may be listed many
     times in the database under different protocol names.

   The following procedures are used to search the service database:

 -- Scheme Procedure: getserv [name [protocol]]
 -- Scheme Procedure: getservbyname name protocol
 -- Scheme Procedure: getservbyport port protocol
 -- C Function: scm_getserv (name, protocol)
     Look up a network service by name or by service number, and return
     a network service object.  The PROTOCOL argument specifies the name
     of the desired protocol; if the protocol found in the network
     service database does not match this name, a system error is
     signalled.

     The ‘getserv’ procedure will take either a service name or number
     as its first argument; if given no arguments, it behaves like
     ‘getservent’ (see below).

          (getserv "imap" "tcp")
          ⇒ #("imap2" ("imap") 143 "tcp")

          (getservbyport 88 "udp")
          ⇒ #("kerberos" ("kerberos5" "krb5") 88 "udp")

   The following procedures may be used to step through the service
database from beginning to end.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setservent [stayopen]
     Initialize an internal stream from which service objects may be
     read.  This procedure must be called before any calls to
     ‘getservent’, and may also be called afterward to reset the service
     entry stream.  If STAYOPEN is supplied and is not ‘#f’, the
     database is not closed by subsequent ‘getservbyname’ or
     ‘getservbyport’ calls, possibly giving an efficiency gain.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getservent
     Return the next entry from the services database.

 -- Scheme Procedure: endservent
     Close the stream used by ‘getservent’.  The return value is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: setserv [stayopen]
 -- C Function: scm_setserv (stayopen)
     If STAYOPEN is omitted, this is equivalent to ‘endservent’.
     Otherwise it is equivalent to ‘setservent stayopen’.

### 7.2.11.3 Network Socket Address
...............................

A “socket address” object identifies a socket endpoint for
communication.  In the case of ‘AF_INET’ for instance, the socket
address object comprises the host address (or interface on the host) and
a port number which specifies a particular open socket in a running
client or server process.  A socket address object can be created with,

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-socket-address AF_INET ipv4addr port
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-socket-address AF_INET6 ipv6addr port
          [flowinfo [scopeid]]
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-socket-address AF_UNIX path
 -- C Function: scm_make_socket_address (family, address, arglist)
     Return a new socket address object.  The first argument is the
     address family, one of the ‘AF’ constants, then the arguments vary
     according to the family.

     For ‘AF_INET’ the arguments are an IPv4 network address number
     (*note* Network Address Conversion::), and a port number.

     For ‘AF_INET6’ the arguments are an IPv6 network address number and
     a port number.  Optional FLOWINFO and SCOPEID arguments may be
     given (both integers, default 0).

     For ‘AF_UNIX’ the argument is a filename (a string).

     The C function ‘scm_make_socket_address’ takes the FAMILY and
     ADDRESS arguments directly, then ARGLIST is a list of further
     arguments, being the port for IPv4, port and optional flowinfo and
     scopeid for IPv6, or the empty list ‘SCM_EOL’ for Unix domain.

The following functions access the fields of a socket address object,

 -- Scheme Procedure: sockaddr:fam sa
     Return the address family from socket address object SA.  This is
     one of the ‘AF’ constants (e.g. ‘AF_INET’).

 -- Scheme Procedure: sockaddr:path sa
     For an ‘AF_UNIX’ socket address object SA, return the filename.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sockaddr:addr sa
     For an ‘AF_INET’ or ‘AF_INET6’ socket address object SA, return the
     network address number.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sockaddr:port sa
     For an ‘AF_INET’ or ‘AF_INET6’ socket address object SA, return the
     port number.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sockaddr:flowinfo sa
     For an ‘AF_INET6’ socket address object SA, return the flowinfo
     value.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sockaddr:scopeid sa
     For an ‘AF_INET6’ socket address object SA, return the scope ID
     value.

   The functions below convert to and from the C ‘struct sockaddr’
(*note* (libc)Address Formats::).  That structure is a generic type, an
application can cast to or from ‘struct sockaddr_in’, ‘struct
sockaddr_in6’ or ‘struct sockaddr_un’ according to the address family.

   In a ‘struct sockaddr’ taken or returned, the byte ordering in the
fields follows the C conventions (*note* Byte Order Conversion:
(libc)Byte Order.).  This means network byte order for ‘AF_INET’ host
address (‘sin_addr.s_addr’) and port number (‘sin_port’), and ‘AF_INET6’
port number (‘sin6_port’).  But at the Scheme level these values are
taken or returned in host byte order, so the port is an ordinary
integer, and the host address likewise is an ordinary integer (as
described in *note* Network Address Conversion::).

 -- C Function: struct sockaddr * scm_c_make_socket_address (SCM family,
          SCM address, SCM args, size_t *outsize)
     Return a newly-‘malloc’ed ‘struct sockaddr’ created from arguments
     like those taken by ‘scm_make_socket_address’ above.

     The size (in bytes) of the ‘struct sockaddr’ return is stored into
     ‘*OUTSIZE’.  An application must call ‘free’ to release the
     returned structure when no longer required.

 -- C Function: SCM scm_from_sockaddr (const struct sockaddr *address,
          unsigned address_size)
     Return a Scheme socket address object from the C ADDRESS structure.
     ADDRESS_SIZE is the size in bytes of ADDRESS.

 -- C Function: struct sockaddr * scm_to_sockaddr (SCM address, size_t
          *address_size)
     Return a newly-‘malloc’ed ‘struct sockaddr’ from a Scheme level
     socket address object.

     The size (in bytes) of the ‘struct sockaddr’ return is stored into
     ‘*OUTSIZE’.  An application must call ‘free’ to release the
     returned structure when no longer required.

### 7.2.11.4 Network Sockets and Communication
..........................................

Socket ports can be created using ‘socket’ and ‘socketpair’.  The ports
are initially unbuffered, to make reading and writing to the same port
more reliable.  A buffer can be added to the port using ‘setvbuf’ (*note*
Buffering::).

   Most systems have limits on how many files and sockets can be open,
so it’s strongly recommended that socket ports be closed explicitly when
no longer required (*note* Ports::).

   Some of the underlying C functions take values in network byte order,
but the convention in Guile is that at the Scheme level everything is
ordinary host byte order and conversions are made automatically where
necessary.

 -- Scheme Procedure: socket family style proto
 -- C Function: scm_socket (family, style, proto)
     Return a new socket port of the type specified by FAMILY, STYLE and
     PROTO.  All three parameters are integers.  The possible values for
     FAMILY are as follows, where supported by the system,

      -- Variable: PF_UNIX
      -- Variable: PF_INET
      -- Variable: PF_INET6

     The possible values for STYLE are as follows, again where supported
     by the system,

      -- Variable: SOCK_STREAM
      -- Variable: SOCK_DGRAM
      -- Variable: SOCK_RAW
      -- Variable: SOCK_RDM
      -- Variable: SOCK_SEQPACKET

     PROTO can be obtained from a protocol name using ‘getprotobyname’
     (*note* Network Databases::).  A value of zero means the default
     protocol, which is usually right.

     A socket cannot by used for communication until it has been
     connected somewhere, usually with either ‘connect’ or ‘accept’
     below.

 -- Scheme Procedure: socketpair family style proto
 -- C Function: scm_socketpair (family, style, proto)
     Return a pair, the ‘car’ and ‘cdr’ of which are two unnamed socket
     ports connected to each other.  The connection is full-duplex, so
     data can be transferred in either direction between the two.

     FAMILY, STYLE and PROTO are as per ‘socket’ above.  But many
     systems only support socket pairs in the ‘PF_UNIX’ family.  Zero is
     likely to be the only meaningful value for PROTO.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getsockopt sock level optname
 -- Scheme Procedure: setsockopt sock level optname value
 -- C Function: scm_getsockopt (sock, level, optname)
 -- C Function: scm_setsockopt (sock, level, optname, value)
     Get or set an option on socket port SOCK.  ‘getsockopt’ returns the
     current value.  ‘setsockopt’ sets a value and the return is
     unspecified.

     LEVEL is an integer specifying a protocol layer, either
     ‘SOL_SOCKET’ for socket level options, or a protocol number from
     the ‘IPPROTO’ constants or ‘getprotoent’ (*note* Network
     Databases::).

      -- Variable: SOL_SOCKET
      -- Variable: IPPROTO_IP
      -- Variable: IPPROTO_IPV6
      -- Variable: IPPROTO_TCP
      -- Variable: IPPROTO_UDP

     OPTNAME is an integer specifying an option within the protocol
     layer.

     For ‘SOL_SOCKET’ level the following OPTNAMEs are defined (when
     provided by the system).  For their meaning see *note*
     (libc)Socket-Level Options::, or ‘man 7 socket’.

      -- Variable: SO_DEBUG
      -- Variable: SO_REUSEADDR
      -- Variable: SO_STYLE
      -- Variable: SO_TYPE
      -- Variable: SO_ERROR
      -- Variable: SO_DONTROUTE
      -- Variable: SO_BROADCAST
      -- Variable: SO_SNDBUF
      -- Variable: SO_RCVBUF
      -- Variable: SO_KEEPALIVE
      -- Variable: SO_OOBINLINE
      -- Variable: SO_NO_CHECK
      -- Variable: SO_PRIORITY
      -- Variable: SO_REUSEPORT
      -- Variable: SO_RCVTIMEO
      -- Variable: SO_SNDTIMEO
          The VALUE taken or returned is an integer.

      -- Variable: SO_LINGER
          The VALUE taken or returned is a pair of integers ‘(ENABLE .
          TIMEOUT)’.  On old systems without timeout support (ie.
          without ‘struct linger’), only ENABLE has an effect but the
          value in Guile is always a pair.

     For IP level (‘IPPROTO_IP’) the following OPTNAMEs are defined
     (when provided by the system).  See ‘man ip’ for what they mean.

      -- Variable: IP_MULTICAST_IF
          This sets the source interface used by multicast traffic.

      -- Variable: IP_MULTICAST_TTL
          This sets the default TTL for multicast traffic.  This
          defaults to 1 and should be increased to allow traffic to pass
          beyond the local network.

      -- Variable: IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP
      -- Variable: IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP
          These can be used only with ‘setsockopt’, not ‘getsockopt’.
          VALUE is a pair ‘(MULTIADDR . INTERFACEADDR)’ of integer IPv4
          addresses (*note* Network Address Conversion::).  MULTIADDR is
          a multicast address to be added to or dropped from the
          interface INTERFACEADDR.  INTERFACEADDR can be ‘INADDR_ANY’ to
          have the system select the interface.  INTERFACEADDR can also
          be an interface index number, on systems supporting that.

     Last, for IPv6 level (‘IPPROTO_IPV6’), the following OPTNAMEs are
     defined.  See ‘man 7 ipv6’ for details.

      -- Variable: IPV6_V6ONLY
          Determines whether an ‘AF_INET6’ socket is restricted to
          transmitting IPv6 packets only, or whether it can also
          transmit packets for an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.

   For ‘IPPROTO_TCP’ level the following OPTNAMEs are defined (when
provided by the system).  For their meaning see ‘man 7 tcp’.

 -- Variable: TCP_NODELAY
 -- Variable: TCP_CORK
     The VALUE taken or returned is an integer.

 -- Scheme Procedure: shutdown sock how
 -- C Function: scm_shutdown (sock, how)
     Sockets can be closed simply by using ‘close-port’.  The ‘shutdown’
     procedure allows reception or transmission on a connection to be
     shut down individually, according to the parameter HOW:

     0
          Stop receiving data for this socket.  If further data arrives,
          reject it.
     1
          Stop trying to transmit data from this socket.  Discard any
          data waiting to be sent.  Stop looking for acknowledgement of
          data already sent; don’t retransmit it if it is lost.
     2
          Stop both reception and transmission.

     The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: connect sock sockaddr
 -- Scheme Procedure: connect sock AF_INET ipv4addr port
 -- Scheme Procedure: connect sock AF_INET6 ipv6addr port [flowinfo
          [scopeid]]
 -- Scheme Procedure: connect sock AF_UNIX path
 -- C Function: scm_connect (sock, fam, address, args)
     Initiate a connection on socket port SOCK to a given address.  The
     destination is either a socket address object, or arguments the
     same as ‘make-socket-address’ would take to make such an object
     (*note* Network Socket Address::).  Return true unless the socket
     was configured as non-blocking and the connection could not be made
     immediately.

          (connect sock AF_INET INADDR_LOOPBACK 23)
          (connect sock (make-socket-address AF_INET INADDR_LOOPBACK 23))

 -- Scheme Procedure: bind sock sockaddr
 -- Scheme Procedure: bind sock AF_INET ipv4addr port
 -- Scheme Procedure: bind sock AF_INET6 ipv6addr port [flowinfo
          [scopeid]]
 -- Scheme Procedure: bind sock AF_UNIX path
 -- C Function: scm_bind (sock, fam, address, args)
     Bind socket port SOCK to the given address.  The address is either
     a socket address object, or arguments the same as
     ‘make-socket-address’ would take to make such an object (*note*
     Network Socket Address::).  The return value is unspecified.

     Generally a socket is only explicitly bound to a particular address
     when making a server, i.e. to listen on a particular port.  For an
     outgoing connection the system will assign a local address
     automatically, if not already bound.

          (bind sock AF_INET INADDR_ANY 12345)
          (bind sock (make-socket-address AF_INET INADDR_ANY 12345))

 -- Scheme Procedure: listen sock backlog
 -- C Function: scm_listen (sock, backlog)
     Enable SOCK to accept connection requests.  BACKLOG is an integer
     specifying the maximum length of the queue for pending connections.
     If the queue fills, new clients will fail to connect until the
     server calls ‘accept’ to accept a connection from the queue.

     The return value is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: accept sock [flags]
 -- C Function: scm_accept (sock)
     Accept a connection from socket port SOCK which has been enabled
     for listening with ‘listen’ above.

     If there are no incoming connections in the queue, there are two
     possible behaviors, depending on whether SOCK has been configured
     for non-blocking operation or not:

        • If there is no connection waiting and the socket was set to
          non-blocking mode with the ‘O_NONBLOCK’ port option (*note*
          ‘fcntl’: Ports and File Descriptors.), return ‘#f’ directly.

        • Otherwise wait until a connection is available.

     The return value is a pair.  The ‘car’ is a new socket port,
     connected and ready to communicate.  The ‘cdr’ is a socket address
     object (*note* Network Socket Address::) which is where the remote
     connection is from (like ‘getpeername’ below).

     FLAGS, if given, may include ‘SOCK_CLOEXEC’ or ‘SOCK_NONBLOCK’,
     which like ‘O_CLOEXEC’ and ‘O_NONBLOCK’ apply to the newly accepted
     socket.

     All communication takes place using the new socket returned.  The
     given SOCK remains bound and listening, and ‘accept’ may be called
     on it again to get another incoming connection when desired.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getsockname sock
 -- C Function: scm_getsockname (sock)
     Return a socket address object which is the where SOCK is bound
     locally.  SOCK may have obtained its local address from ‘bind’
     (above), or if a ‘connect’ is done with an otherwise unbound socket
     (which is usual) then the system will have assigned an address.

     Note that on many systems the address of a socket in the ‘AF_UNIX’
     namespace cannot be read.

 -- Scheme Procedure: getpeername sock
 -- C Function: scm_getpeername (sock)
     Return a socket address object which is where SOCK is connected to,
     i.e. the remote endpoint.

     Note that on many systems the address of a socket in the ‘AF_UNIX’
     namespace cannot be read.

 -- Scheme Procedure: recv! sock buf [flags]
 -- C Function: scm_recv (sock, buf, flags)
     Receive data from a socket port.  SOCK must already be bound to the
     address from which data is to be received.  BUF is a bytevector
     into which the data will be written.  The size of BUF limits the
     amount of data which can be received: in the case of packet
     protocols, if a packet larger than this limit is encountered then
     some data will be irrevocably lost.

     The optional FLAGS argument is a value or bitwise OR of ‘MSG_OOB’,
     ‘MSG_PEEK’, ‘MSG_DONTROUTE’ etc.

     The value returned is the number of bytes read from the socket.

     Note that the data is read directly from the socket file
     descriptor: any unread buffered port data is ignored.

 -- Scheme Procedure: send sock message [flags]
 -- C Function: scm_send (sock, message, flags)
     Transmit bytevector MESSAGE on socket port SOCK.  SOCK must already
     be bound to a destination address.  The value returned is the
     number of bytes transmitted—it’s possible for this to be less than
     the length of MESSAGE if the socket is set to be non-blocking.  The
     optional FLAGS argument is a value or bitwise OR of ‘MSG_OOB’,
     ‘MSG_PEEK’, ‘MSG_DONTROUTE’ etc.

     Note that the data is written directly to the socket file
     descriptor: any unflushed buffered port data is ignored.

 -- Scheme Procedure: recvfrom! sock buf [flags [start [end]]]
 -- C Function: scm_recvfrom (sock, buf, flags, start, end)
     Receive data from socket port SOCK, returning the originating
     address as well as the data.  This function is usually for datagram
     sockets, but can be used on stream-oriented sockets too.

     The data received is stored in bytevector BUF, using either the
     whole bytevector or just the region between the optional START and
     END positions.  The size of BUF limits the amount of data that can
     be received.  For datagram protocols if a packet larger than this
     is received then excess bytes are irrevocably lost.

     The return value is a pair.  The ‘car’ is the number of bytes read.
     The ‘cdr’ is a socket address object (*note* Network Socket
     Address::) which is where the data came from, or ‘#f’ if the origin
     is unknown.

     The optional FLAGS argument is a or bitwise-OR (‘logior’) of
     ‘MSG_OOB’, ‘MSG_PEEK’, ‘MSG_DONTROUTE’ etc.

     Data is read directly from the socket file descriptor, any buffered
     port data is ignored.

     On a GNU/Linux system ‘recvfrom!’ is not multi-threading, all
     threads stop while a ‘recvfrom!’ call is in progress.  An
     application may need to use ‘select’, ‘O_NONBLOCK’ or
     ‘MSG_DONTWAIT’ to avoid this.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sendto sock message sockaddr [flags]
 -- Scheme Procedure: sendto sock message AF_INET ipv4addr port [flags]
 -- Scheme Procedure: sendto sock message AF_INET6 ipv6addr port
          [flowinfo [scopeid [flags]]]
 -- Scheme Procedure: sendto sock message AF_UNIX path [flags]
 -- C Function: scm_sendto (sock, message, fam, address, args_and_flags)
     Transmit bytevector MESSAGE as a datagram socket port SOCK.  The
     destination is specified either as a socket address object, or as
     arguments the same as would be taken by ‘make-socket-address’ to
     create such an object (*note* Network Socket Address::).

     The destination address may be followed by an optional FLAGS
     argument which is a ‘logior’ (*note* Bitwise Operations::) of
     ‘MSG_OOB’, ‘MSG_PEEK’, ‘MSG_DONTROUTE’ etc.

     The value returned is the number of bytes transmitted – it’s
     possible for this to be less than the length of MESSAGE if the
     socket is set to be non-blocking.  Note that the data is written
     directly to the socket file descriptor: any unflushed buffered port
     data is ignored.

### 7.2.11.5 Network Socket Examples
................................

The following give examples of how to use network sockets.

### Internet Socket Client Example
..............................

The following example demonstrates an Internet socket client.  It
connects to the HTTP daemon running on the local machine and returns the
contents of the root index URL.

     (let ((s (socket PF_INET SOCK_STREAM 0)))
       (connect s AF_INET (inet-pton AF_INET "127.0.0.1") 80)
       (display "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" s)

       (do ((line (read-line s) (read-line s)))
           ((eof-object? line))
         (display line)
         (newline)))

### Internet Socket Server Example
..............................

The following example shows a simple Internet server which listens on
port 2904 for incoming connections and sends a greeting back to the
client.

     (let ((s (socket PF_INET SOCK_STREAM 0)))
       (setsockopt s SOL_SOCKET SO_REUSEADDR 1)
       ;; Specific address?
       ;; (bind s AF_INET (inet-pton AF_INET "127.0.0.1") 2904)
       (bind s AF_INET INADDR_ANY 2904)
       (listen s 5)

       (simple-format #t "Listening for clients in pid: ~S" (getpid))
       (newline)

       (while #t
         (let* ((client-connection (accept s))
                (client-details (cdr client-connection))
                (client (car client-connection)))
           (simple-format #t "Got new client connection: ~S"
                          client-details)
           (newline)
           (simple-format #t "Client address: ~S"
                          (gethostbyaddr
                           (sockaddr:addr client-details)))
           (newline)
           ;; Send back the greeting to the client port
           (display "Hello client\r\n" client)
           (close client))))

information about the system it runs on.

 -- Scheme Procedure: uname
 -- C Function: scm_uname ()
     Return an object with some information about the computer system
     the program is running on.

     The following procedures accept an object as returned by ‘uname’
     and return a selected component (all of which are strings).

      -- Scheme Procedure: utsname:sysname un
          The name of the operating system.
      -- Scheme Procedure: utsname:nodename un
          The network name of the computer.
      -- Scheme Procedure: utsname:release un
          The current release level of the operating system
          implementation.
      -- Scheme Procedure: utsname:version un
          The current version level within the release of the operating
          system.
      -- Scheme Procedure: utsname:machine un
          A description of the hardware.

 -- Scheme Procedure: gethostname
 -- C Function: scm_gethostname ()
     Return the host name of the current processor.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sethostname name
 -- C Function: scm_sethostname (name)
     Set the host name of the current processor to NAME.  May only be
     used by the superuser.  The return value is not specified.


File: guile.info,  Node: Locales,  Next: Encryption,  Prev: System Identification,  Up: POSIX

7.2.13 Locales
--------------

 -- Scheme Procedure: setlocale category [locale]
 -- C Function: scm_setlocale (category, locale)
     Get or set the current locale, used for various
     internationalizations.  Locales are strings, such as ‘sv_SE’.

     If LOCALE is given then the locale for the given CATEGORY is set
     and the new value returned.  If LOCALE is not given then the
     current value is returned.  CATEGORY should be one of the following
     values (*note* Categories of Activities that Locales Affect:
     (libc)Locale Categories.):

      -- Variable: LC_ALL
      -- Variable: LC_COLLATE
      -- Variable: LC_CTYPE
      -- Variable: LC_MESSAGES
      -- Variable: LC_MONETARY
      -- Variable: LC_NUMERIC
      -- Variable: LC_TIME

     A common usage is ‘(setlocale LC_ALL "")’, which initializes all
     categories based on standard environment variables (‘LANG’ etc).
     For full details on categories and locale names *note* Locales and
     Internationalization: (libc)Locales.

     Note that ‘setlocale’ affects locale settings for the whole
     process.  *Note* locale objects and ‘make-locale’: i18n

File: guile.info,  Node: Encryption,  Prev: Locales,  Up: POSIX

7.2.14 Encryption
-----------------

Please note that the procedures in this section are not suited for
strong encryption, they are only interfaces to the well-known and common
system library functions of the same name.  They are just as good (or
bad) as the underlying functions, so you should refer to your system
documentation before using them (*note* Encrypting Passwords:
(libc)crypt.).

 -- Scheme Procedure: crypt key salt
 -- C Function: scm_crypt (key, salt)
     Encrypt KEY, with the addition of SALT (both strings), using the
     ‘crypt’ C library call.

   Although ‘getpass’ is not an encryption procedure per se, it appears
here because it is often used in combination with ‘crypt’:

 -- Scheme Procedure: getpass prompt
 -- C Function: scm_getpass (prompt)
     Display PROMPT to the standard error output and read a password
     from ‘/dev/tty’.  If this file is not accessible, it reads from
     standard input.  The password may be up to 127 characters in
     length.  Additional characters and the terminating newline
     character are discarded.  While reading the password, echoing and

7.3 HTTP, the Web, and All That
===============================

It has always been possible to connect computers together and share
information between them, but the rise of the World Wide Web over the
last couple of decades has made it much easier to do so.  The result is
a richly connected network of computation, in which Guile forms a part.

   By “the web”, we mean the HTTP protocol(1) as handled by servers,
clients, proxies, caches, and the various kinds of messages and message
components that can be sent and received by that protocol, notably HTML.

   On one level, the web is text in motion: the protocols themselves are
textual (though the payload may be binary), and it’s possible to create
a socket and speak text to the web.  But such an approach is obviously
primitive.  This section details the higher-level data types and
operations provided by Guile: URIs, HTTP request and response records,
and a conventional web server implementation.

   The material in this section is arranged in ascending order, in which
later concepts build on previous ones.  If you prefer to start with the
highest-level perspective, *note* Web Examples::, and work your way back.

7.3.1 Types and the Web
-----------------------

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a program with good use of
data types, will be free from many common bugs.  Unfortunately, the
common practice in web programming seems to ignore this maxim.  This
subsection makes the case for expressive data types in web programming.

   By “expressive data types”, we mean that the data types _say_
something about how a program solves a problem.  For example, if we
choose to represent dates using SRFI 19 date records (*note* SRFI-19::),
this indicates that there is a part of the program that will always have
valid dates.  Error handling for a number of basic cases, like invalid
dates, occurs on the boundary in which we produce a SRFI 19 date record
from other types, like strings.

   With regards to the web, data types are helpful in the two broad
phases of HTTP messages: parsing and generation.

   Consider a server, which has to parse a request, and produce a
response.  Guile will parse the request into an HTTP request object
(*note* Requests::), with each header parsed into an appropriate Scheme
data type.  This transition from an incoming stream of characters to
typed data is a state change in a program—the strings might parse, or
they might not, and something has to happen if they do not.  (Guile
throws an error in this case.)  But after you have the parsed request,
“client” code (code built on top of the Guile web framework) will not
have to check for syntactic validity.  The types already make this
information manifest.

   This state change on the parsing boundary makes programs more robust,
as they themselves are freed from the need to do a number of common
error checks, and they can use normal Scheme procedures to handle a
request instead of ad-hoc string parsers.

   The need for types on the response generation side (in a server) is
more subtle, though not less important.  Consider the example of a POST
handler, which prints out the text that a user submits from a form.
Such a handler might include a procedure like this:

     ;; First, a helper procedure
     (define (para . contents)
       (string-append "<p>" (string-concatenate contents) "</p>"))

     ;; Now the meat of our simple web application
     (define (you-said text)
       (para "You said: " text))

     (display (you-said "Hi!"))
     ⊣ <p>You said: Hi!</p>

   This is a perfectly valid implementation, provided that the incoming
text does not contain the special HTML characters ‘<’, ‘>’, or ‘&’.  But
this provision of a restricted character set is not reflected anywhere
in the program itself: we must _assume_ that the programmer understands
this, and performs the check elsewhere.

   Unfortunately, the short history of the practice of programming does
not bear out this assumption.  A “cross-site scripting” (XSS)
vulnerability is just such a common error in which unfiltered user input
is allowed into the output.  A user could submit a crafted comment to
your web site which results in visitors running malicious Javascript,
within the security context of your domain:

     (display (you-said "<script src=\"http://bad.com/nasty.js\" />"))
     ⊣ <p>You said: <script src="http://bad.com/nasty.js" /></p>

   The fundamental problem here is that both user data and the program
template are represented using strings.  This identity means that types
can’t help the programmer to make a distinction between these two, so
they get confused.

   There are a number of possible solutions, but perhaps the best is to
treat HTML not as strings, but as native s-expressions: as SXML. The
basic idea is that HTML is either text, represented by a string, or an
element, represented as a tagged list.  So ‘foo’ becomes ‘"foo"’, and
‘<b>foo</b>’ becomes ‘(b "foo")’.  Attributes, if present, go in a
tagged list headed by ‘@’, like ‘(img (@ (src
"http://example.com/foo.png")))’.  *Note* SXML::, for more information.

   The good thing about SXML is that HTML elements cannot be confused
with text.  Let’s make a new definition of ‘para’:

     (define (para . contents)
       `(p ,@contents))

     (use-modules (sxml simple))
     (sxml->xml (you-said "Hi!"))
     ⊣ <p>You said: Hi!</p>

     (sxml->xml (you-said "<i>Rats, foiled again!</i>"))
     ⊣ <p>You said: &lt;i&gt;Rats, foiled again!&lt;/i&gt;</p>

   So we see in the second example that HTML elements cannot be
unwittingly introduced into the output.  However it is now perfectly
acceptable to pass SXML to ‘you-said’; in fact, that is the big
advantage of SXML over everything-as-a-string.

     (sxml->xml (you-said (you-said "<Hi!>")))
     ⊣ <p>You said: <p>You said: &lt;Hi!&gt;</p></p>

   The SXML types allow procedures to _compose_.  The types make
manifest which parts are HTML elements, and which are text.  So you
needn’t worry about escaping user input; the type transition back to a
string handles that for you.  XSS vulnerabilities are a thing of the
past.

   Well.  That’s all very nice and opinionated and such, but how do I
use the thing?  Read on!

7.3.2 Universal Resource Identifiers
------------------------------------

Guile provides a standard data type for Universal Resource Identifiers
(URIs), as defined in RFC 3986.

   The generic URI syntax is as follows:

     URI-reference := [scheme ":"] ["//" [userinfo "@"] host [":" port]] path \
                      [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

   For example, in the URI, ‘http://www.gnu.org/help/’, the scheme is
‘http’, the host is ‘www.gnu.org’, the path is ‘/help/’, and there is no
userinfo, port, query, or fragment.

   Userinfo is something of an abstraction, as some legacy URI schemes
allowed userinfo of the form ‘USERNAME:PASSWD’.  But since passwords do
not belong in URIs, the RFC does not want to condone this practice, so
it calls anything before the ‘@’ sign “userinfo”.

     (use-modules (web uri))

   The following procedures can be found in the ‘(web uri)’ module.
Load it into your Guile, using a form like the above, to have access to
them.

   The most common way to build a URI from Scheme is with the
‘build-uri’ function.

 -- Scheme Procedure: build-uri scheme [#:userinfo=#f] [#:host=#f]
          [#:port=#f] [#:path=""] [#:query=#f] [#:fragment=#f]
          [#:validate?=#t]
     Construct a URI. SCHEME should be a symbol, PORT either a positive,
     exact integer or ‘#f’, and the rest of the fields are either
     strings or ‘#f’.  If VALIDATE? is true, also run some consistency
     checks to make sure that the constructed URI is valid.
 -- Scheme Procedure: uri? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a URI.

   Guile, URIs are represented as URI records, with a number of
associated accessors.

 -- Scheme Procedure: uri-scheme uri
 -- Scheme Procedure: uri-userinfo uri
 -- Scheme Procedure: uri-host uri
 -- Scheme Procedure: uri-port uri
 -- Scheme Procedure: uri-path uri
 -- Scheme Procedure: uri-query uri
 -- Scheme Procedure: uri-fragment uri
     Field accessors for the URI record type.  The URI scheme will be a
     symbol, or ‘#f’ if the object is a relative-ref (see below).  The
     port will be either a positive, exact integer or ‘#f’, and the rest
     of the fields will be either strings or ‘#f’ if not present.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string->uri string
     Parse STRING into a URI object.  Return ‘#f’ if the string could
     not be parsed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: uri->string uri [#:include-fragment?=#t]
     Serialize URI to a string.  If the URI has a port that is the
     default port for its scheme, the port is not included in the
     serialization.  If INCLUDE-FRAGMENT? is given as false, the
     resulting string will omit the fragment (if any).

 -- Scheme Procedure: declare-default-port! scheme port
     Declare a default port for the given URI scheme.

 -- Scheme Procedure: uri-decode str [#:encoding="utf-8"]
          [#:decode-plus-to-space? #t]
     Percent-decode the given STR, according to ENCODING, which should
     be the name of a character encoding.

     Note that this function should not generally be applied to a full
     URI string.  For paths, use ‘split-and-decode-uri-path’ instead.
     For query strings, split the query on ‘&’ and ‘=’ boundaries, and
     decode the components separately.

     Note also that percent-encoded strings encode _bytes_, not
     characters.  There is no guarantee that a given byte sequence is a
     valid string encoding.  Therefore this routine may signal an error
     if the decoded bytes are not valid for the given encoding.  Pass
     ‘#f’ for ENCODING if you want decoded bytes as a bytevector
     directly.  *Note* ‘set-port-encoding!’: Ports, for more information
     on character encodings.

     If DECODE-PLUS-TO-SPACE? is true, which is the default, also
     replace instances of the plus character ‘+’ with a space character.
     This is needed when parsing ‘application/x-www-form-urlencoded’
     data.

     Returns a string of the decoded characters, or a bytevector if
     ENCODING was ‘#f’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: uri-encode str [#:encoding="utf-8"]
          [#:unescaped-chars]
     Percent-encode any character not in the character set,
     UNESCAPED-CHARS.

     The default character set includes alphanumerics from ASCII, as
     well as the special characters ‘-’, ‘.’, ‘_’, and ‘~’.  Any other
     character will be percent-encoded, by writing out the character to
     a bytevector within the given ENCODING, then encoding each byte as
     ‘%HH’, where HH is the hexadecimal representation of the byte.

 -- Scheme Procedure: split-and-decode-uri-path path
     Split PATH into its components, and decode each component, removing
     empty components.

     For example, ‘"/foo/bar%20baz/"’ decodes to the two-element list,
     ‘("foo" "bar baz")’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: encode-and-join-uri-path parts
     URI-encode each element of PARTS, which should be a list of
     strings, and join the parts together with ‘/’ as a delimiter.

     For example, the list ‘("scrambled eggs" "biscuits&gravy")’ encodes
     as ‘"scrambled%20eggs/biscuits%26gravy"’.

### Subtypes of URI
...............

As we noted above, not all URI objects have a scheme.  You might have
noted in the “generic URI syntax” example that the left-hand side of
that grammar definition was URI-reference, not URI. A “URI-reference” is
a generalization of a URI where the scheme is optional.  If no scheme is
specified, it is taken to be relative to some other related URI. A
common use of URI references is when you want to be vague regarding the
choice of HTTP or HTTPS – serving a web page referring to ‘/foo.css’
will use HTTPS if loaded over HTTPS, or HTTP otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: build-uri-reference [#:scheme=#f] [#:userinfo=#f]
          [#:host=#f] [#:port=#f] [#:path=""] [#:query=#f]
          [#:fragment=#f] [#:validate?=#t]
     Like ‘build-uri’, but with an optional scheme.
 -- Scheme Procedure: uri-reference? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a URI-reference.  This is the most general
     URI predicate, as it includes not only full URIs that have schemes
     (those that match ‘uri?’) but also URIs without schemes.

   It’s also possible to build a “relative-ref”: a URI-reference that
explicitly lacks a scheme.

 -- Scheme Procedure: build-relative-ref [#:userinfo=#f] [#:host=#f]
          [#:port=#f] [#:path=""] [#:query=#f] [#:fragment=#f]
          [#:validate?=#t]
     Like ‘build-uri’, but with no scheme.
 -- Scheme Procedure: relative-ref? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a “relative-ref”: a URI-reference that has no
     scheme.  Every URI-reference will either match ‘uri?’ or
     ‘relative-ref?’ (but not both).

   In case it’s not clear from the above, the most general of these URI
types is the URI-reference, with ‘build-uri-reference’ as the most
general constructor.  ‘build-uri’ and ‘build-relative-ref’ enforce
enforce specific restrictions on the URI-reference.  The most generic
URI parser is then ‘string->uri-reference’, and there is also a parser
for when you know that you want a relative-ref.

   Note that ‘uri?’ will only return ‘#t’ for URI objects that have
schemes; that is, it rejects relative-refs.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string->uri-reference string
     Parse STRING into a URI object, while not requiring a scheme.
     Return ‘#f’ if the string could not be parsed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string->relative-ref string
     Parse STRING into a URI object, while asserting that no scheme is
     present.  Return ‘#f’ if the string could not be parsed.

7.3.3 The Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol
--------------------------------------

The initial motivation for including web functionality in Guile, rather
than rely on an external package, was to establish a standard base on
which people can share code.  To that end, we continue the focus on data
types by providing a number of low-level parsers and unparsers for
elements of the HTTP protocol.

   If you are want to skip the low-level details for now and move on to
web pages, *note* Web Client::, and *note* Web Server::.  Otherwise, load
the HTTP module, and read on.

     (use-modules (web http))

   The focus of the ‘(web http)’ module is to parse and unparse standard
HTTP headers, representing them to Guile as native data structures.  For
example, a ‘Date:’ header will be represented as a SRFI-19 date record
(*note* SRFI-19::), rather than as a string.

   Guile tries to follow RFCs fairly strictly—the road to perdition
being paved with compatibility hacks—though some allowances are made for
not-too-divergent texts.

   Header names are represented as lower-case symbols.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string->header name
     Parse NAME to a symbolic header name.

 -- Scheme Procedure: header->string sym
     Return the string form for the header named SYM.

   For example:

     (string->header "Content-Length")
     ⇒ content-length
     (header->string 'content-length)
     ⇒ "Content-Length"

     (string->header "FOO")
     ⇒ foo
     (header->string 'foo)
     ⇒ "Foo"

   Guile keeps a registry of known headers, their string names, and some
parsing and serialization procedures.  If a header is unknown, its
string name is simply its symbol name in title-case.

 -- Scheme Procedure: known-header? sym
     Return ‘#t’ if SYM is a known header, with associated parsers and
     serialization procedures, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: header-parser sym
     Return the value parser for headers named SYM.  The result is a
     procedure that takes one argument, a string, and returns the parsed
     value.  If the header isn’t known to Guile, a default parser is
     returned that passes through the string unchanged.

 -- Scheme Procedure: header-validator sym
     Return a predicate which returns ‘#t’ if the given value is valid
     for headers named SYM.  The default validator for unknown headers
     is ‘string?’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: header-writer sym
     Return a procedure that writes values for headers named SYM to a
     port.  The resulting procedure takes two arguments: a value and a
     port.  The default writer is ‘display’.

   For more on the set of headers that Guile knows about out of the box,
*note* HTTP Headers::.  To add your own, use the ‘declare-header!’
procedure:

 -- Scheme Procedure: declare-header! name parser validator writer
          [#:multiple?=#f]
     Declare a parser, validator, and writer for a given header.

   For example, let’s say you are running a web server behind some sort
of proxy, and your proxy adds an ‘X-Client-Address’ header, indicating
the IPv4 address of the original client.  You would like for the HTTP
request record to parse out this header to a Scheme value, instead of
leaving it as a string.  You could register this header with Guile’s
HTTP stack like this:

     (declare-header! "X-Client-Address"
       (lambda (str)
         (inet-pton AF_INET str))
       (lambda (ip)
         (and (integer? ip) (exact? ip) (<= 0 ip #xffffffff)))
       (lambda (ip port)
         (display (inet-ntop AF_INET ip) port)))

 -- Scheme Procedure: declare-opaque-header! name
     A specialised version of ‘declare-header!’ for the case in which
     you want a header’s value to be returned/written “as-is”.

 -- Scheme Procedure: valid-header? sym val
     Return a true value if VAL is a valid Scheme value for the header
     with name SYM, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

   Now that we have a generic interface for reading and writing headers,
we do just that.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-header port
     Read one HTTP header from PORT.  Return two values: the header name
     and the parsed Scheme value.  May raise an exception if the header
     was known but the value was invalid.

     Returns the end-of-file object for both values if the end of the
     message body was reached (i.e., a blank line).

 -- Scheme Procedure: parse-header name val
     Parse VAL, a string, with the parser for the header named NAME.
     Returns the parsed value.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-header name val port
     Write the given header name and value to PORT, using the writer
     from ‘header-writer’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-headers port
     Read the headers of an HTTP message from PORT, returning them as an
     ordered alist.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-headers headers port
     Write the given header alist to PORT.  Doesn’t write the final
     ‘\r\n’, as the user might want to add another header.

   The ‘(web http)’ module also has some utility procedures to read and
write request and response lines.

 -- Scheme Procedure: parse-http-method str [start] [end]
     Parse an HTTP method from STR.  The result is an upper-case symbol,
     like ‘GET’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: parse-http-version str [start] [end]
     Parse an HTTP version from STR, returning it as a major–minor pair.
     For example, ‘HTTP/1.1’ parses as the pair of integers, ‘(1 . 1)’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: parse-request-uri str [start] [end]
     Parse a URI from an HTTP request line.  Note that URIs in requests
     do not have to have a scheme or host name.  The result is a URI
     object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-request-line port
     Read the first line of an HTTP request from PORT, returning three
     values: the method, the URI, and the version.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-request-line method uri version port
     Write the first line of an HTTP request to PORT.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-response-line port
     Read the first line of an HTTP response from PORT, returning three
     values: the HTTP version, the response code, and the “reason
     phrase”.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-response-line version code reason-phrase
          port
     Write the first line of an HTTP response to PORT.

7.3.4 HTTP Headers
------------------

In addition to defining the infrastructure to parse headers, the ‘(web
http)’ module defines specific parsers and unparsers for all headers
defined in the HTTP/1.1 standard.

   For example, if you receive a header named ‘Accept-Language’ with a
value ‘en, es;q=0.8’, Guile parses it as a quality list (defined below):

     (parse-header 'accept-language "en, es;q=0.8")
     ⇒ ((1000 . "en") (800 . "es"))

   The format of the value for ‘Accept-Language’ headers is defined
below, along with all other headers defined in the HTTP standard.  (If
the header were unknown, the value would have been returned as a
string.)

   For brevity, the header definitions below are given in the form, TYPE
‘NAME’, indicating that values for the header ‘NAME’ will be of the
given TYPE.  Since Guile internally treats header names in lower case,
in this document we give types title-cased names.  A short description
of the each header’s purpose and an example follow.

   For full details on the meanings of all of these headers, see the
HTTP 1.1 standard, RFC 2616.

### 7.3.4.1 HTTP Header Types
.........................

Here we define the types that are used below, when defining headers.

 -- HTTP Header Type: Date
     A SRFI-19 date.

 -- HTTP Header Type: KVList
     A list whose elements are keys or key-value pairs.  Keys are parsed
     to symbols.  Values are strings by default.  Non-string values are
     the exception, and are mentioned explicitly below, as appropriate.

 -- HTTP Header Type: SList
     A list of strings.

 -- HTTP Header Type: Quality
     An exact integer between 0 and 1000.  Qualities are used to express
     preference, given multiple options.  An option with a quality of
     870, for example, is preferred over an option with quality 500.

     (Qualities are written out over the wire as numbers between 0.0 and
     1.0, but since the standard only allows three digits after the
     decimal, it’s equivalent to integers between 0 and 1000, so that’s
     what Guile uses.)

 -- HTTP Header Type: QList
     A quality list: a list of pairs, the car of which is a quality, and
     the cdr a string.  Used to express a list of options, along with
     their qualities.

 -- HTTP Header Type: ETag
     An entity tag, represented as a pair.  The car of the pair is an
     opaque string, and the cdr is ‘#t’ if the entity tag is a “strong”
     entity tag, and ‘#f’ otherwise.

### 7.3.4.2 General Headers
.......................

General HTTP headers may be present in any HTTP message.

 -- HTTP Header: KVList cache-control
     A key-value list of cache-control directives.  See RFC 2616, for
     more details.

     If present, parameters to ‘max-age’, ‘max-stale’, ‘min-fresh’, and
     ‘s-maxage’ are all parsed as non-negative integers.

     If present, parameters to ‘private’ and ‘no-cache’ are parsed as
     lists of header names, as symbols.

          (parse-header 'cache-control "no-cache,no-store"
          ⇒ (no-cache no-store)
          (parse-header 'cache-control "no-cache=\"Authorization,Date\",no-store"
          ⇒ ((no-cache . (authorization date)) no-store)
          (parse-header 'cache-control "no-cache=\"Authorization,Date\",max-age=10"
          ⇒ ((no-cache . (authorization date)) (max-age . 10))

 -- HTTP Header: List connection
     A list of header names that apply only to this HTTP connection, as
     symbols.  Additionally, the symbol ‘close’ may be present, to
     indicate that the server should close the connection after
     responding to the request.
          (parse-header 'connection "close")
          ⇒ (close)

 -- HTTP Header: Date date
     The date that a given HTTP message was originated.
          (parse-header 'date "Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT")
          ⇒ #<date ...>

 -- HTTP Header: KVList pragma
     A key-value list of implementation-specific directives.
          (parse-header 'pragma "no-cache, broccoli=tasty")
          ⇒ (no-cache (broccoli . "tasty"))

 -- HTTP Header: List trailer
     A list of header names which will appear after the message body,
     instead of with the message headers.
          (parse-header 'trailer "ETag")
          ⇒ (etag)

 -- HTTP Header: List transfer-encoding
     A list of transfer codings, expressed as key-value lists.  The only
     transfer coding defined by the specification is ‘chunked’.
          (parse-header 'transfer-encoding "chunked")
          ⇒ ((chunked))

 -- HTTP Header: List upgrade
     A list of strings, indicating additional protocols that a server
     could use in response to a request.
          (parse-header 'upgrade "WebSocket")
          ⇒ ("WebSocket")

   FIXME: parse out more fully?
 -- HTTP Header: List via
     A list of strings, indicating the protocol versions and hosts of
     intermediate servers and proxies.  There may be multiple ‘via’
     headers in one message.
          (parse-header 'via "1.0 venus, 1.1 mars")
          ⇒ ("1.0 venus" "1.1 mars")

 -- HTTP Header: List warning
     A list of warnings given by a server or intermediate proxy.  Each
     warning is a itself a list of four elements: a code, as an exact
     integer between 0 and 1000, a host as a string, the warning text as
     a string, and either ‘#f’ or a SRFI-19 date.

     There may be multiple ‘warning’ headers in one message.
          (parse-header 'warning "123 foo \"core breach imminent\"")
          ⇒ ((123 "foo" "core-breach imminent" #f))

### 7.3.4.3 Entity Headers
......................

Entity headers may be present in any HTTP message, and refer to the
resource referenced in the HTTP request or response.

 -- HTTP Header: List allow
     A list of allowed methods on a given resource, as symbols.
          (parse-header 'allow "GET, HEAD")
          ⇒ (GET HEAD)

 -- HTTP Header: List content-encoding
     A list of content codings, as symbols.
          (parse-header 'content-encoding "gzip")
          ⇒ (gzip)

 -- HTTP Header: List content-language
     The languages that a resource is in, as strings.
          (parse-header 'content-language "en")
          ⇒ ("en")

 -- HTTP Header: UInt content-length
     The number of bytes in a resource, as an exact, non-negative
     integer.
          (parse-header 'content-length "300")
          ⇒ 300

 -- HTTP Header: URI content-location
     The canonical URI for a resource, in the case that it is also
     accessible from a different URI.
          (parse-header 'content-location "http://example.com/foo")
          ⇒ #<<uri> ...>

 -- HTTP Header: String content-md5
     The MD5 digest of a resource.
          (parse-header 'content-md5 "ffaea1a79810785575e29e2bd45e2fa5")
          ⇒ "ffaea1a79810785575e29e2bd45e2fa5"

 -- HTTP Header: List content-range
     Range specification as a list of three elements: the symbol
     ‘bytes’, either the symbol ‘*’ or a pair of integers indicating the
     byte range, and either ‘*’ or an integer indicating the instance
     length.  Used to indicate that a response only includes part of a
     resource.
          (parse-header 'content-range "bytes 10-20/*")
          ⇒ (bytes (10 . 20) *)

 -- HTTP Header: List content-type
     The MIME type of a resource, as a symbol, along with any
     parameters.
          (parse-header 'content-type "text/plain")
          ⇒ (text/plain)
          (parse-header 'content-type "text/plain;charset=utf-8")
          ⇒ (text/plain (charset . "utf-8"))
     Note that the ‘charset’ parameter is something of a misnomer, and
     the HTTP specification admits this.  It specifies the _encoding_ of
     the characters, not the character set.

 -- HTTP Header: Date expires
     The date/time after which the resource given in a response is
     considered stale.
          (parse-header 'expires "Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT")
          ⇒ #<date ...>

 -- HTTP Header: Date last-modified
     The date/time on which the resource given in a response was last
     modified.
          (parse-header 'expires "Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT")
          ⇒ #<date ...>

### 7.3.4.4 Request Headers
.......................

Request headers may only appear in an HTTP request, not in a response.

 -- HTTP Header: List accept
     A list of preferred media types for a response.  Each element of
     the list is itself a list, in the same format as ‘content-type’.
          (parse-header 'accept "text/html,text/plain;charset=utf-8")
          ⇒ ((text/html) (text/plain (charset . "utf-8")))
     Preference is expressed with quality values:
          (parse-header 'accept "text/html;q=0.8,text/plain;q=0.6")
          ⇒ ((text/html (q . 800)) (text/plain (q . 600)))

 -- HTTP Header: QList accept-charset
     A quality list of acceptable charsets.  Note again that what HTTP
     calls a “charset” is what Guile calls a “character encoding”.
          (parse-header 'accept-charset "iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1;q=0.8")
          ⇒ ((1000 . "iso-8859-5") (800 . "unicode-1-1"))

          ⇒ ((1000 . "cn") (750 . "en"))

 -- HTTP Header: Pair authorization
     Authorization credentials.  The car of the pair indicates the
     authentication scheme, like ‘basic’.  For basic authentication, the
     cdr of the pair will be the base64-encoded ‘USER:PASS’ string.  For
     other authentication schemes, like ‘digest’, the cdr will be a
     key-value list of credentials.
          (parse-header 'authorization "Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ=="
          ⇒ (basic . "QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==")

 -- HTTP Header: List expect
     A list of expectations that a client has of a server.  The
     expectations are key-value lists.
          (parse-header 'expect "100-continue")
          ⇒ ((100-continue))

 -- HTTP Header: String from
     The email address of a user making an HTTP request.

          ⇒ ("gnu.org" . 80)
          (parse-header 'host "gnu.org")
          ⇒ ("gnu.org" . #f)

 -- HTTP Header: *|List if-match
     A set of etags, indicating that the request should proceed if and
     only if the etag of the resource is in that set.  Either the symbol
     ‘*’, indicating any etag, or a list of entity tags.
          (parse-header 'if-match "*")
          ⇒ *
          (parse-header 'if-match "asdfadf")
          ⇒ (("asdfadf" . #t))
          (parse-header 'if-match W/"asdfadf")
          ⇒ (("asdfadf" . #f))

 -- HTTP Header: Date if-modified-since
     Indicates that a response should proceed if and only if the
     resource has been modified since the given date.

          ⇒ #<date ...>

 -- HTTP Header: *|List if-none-match
     A set of etags, indicating that the request should proceed if and
     only if the etag of the resource is not in the set.  Either the
     symbol ‘*’, indicating any etag, or a list of entity tags.
          (parse-header 'if-none-match "*")
          ⇒ *

 -- HTTP Header: ETag|Date if-range
     Indicates that the range request should proceed if and only if the
     resource matches a modification date or an etag.  Either an entity
     tag, or a SRFI-19 date.
          (parse-header 'if-range "\"original-etag\"")
          ⇒ ("original-etag" . #t)

 -- HTTP Header: Date if-unmodified-since
     Indicates that a response should proceed if and only if the
     resource has not been modified since the given date.
          (parse-header 'if-not-modified-since "Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT")
          ⇒ #<date ...>

 -- HTTP Header: UInt max-forwards
     The maximum number of proxy or gateway hops that a request should
     be subject to.
          (parse-header 'max-forwards "10")
          ⇒ 10

 -- HTTP Header: Pair proxy-authorization
     Authorization credentials for a proxy connection.  See the
     documentation for ‘authorization’ above for more information on the
     format.
          (parse-header 'proxy-authorization "Digest foo=bar,baz=qux"
          ⇒ (digest (foo . "bar") (baz . "qux"))

 -- HTTP Header: Pair range
     A range request, indicating that the client wants only part of a
     resource.  The car of the pair is the symbol ‘bytes’, and the cdr
     is a list of pairs.  Each element of the cdr indicates a range; the
     car is the first byte position and the cdr is the last byte
     position, as integers, or ‘#f’ if not given.
          (parse-header 'range "bytes=10-30,50-")
          ⇒ (bytes (10 . 30) (50 . #f))

 -- HTTP Header: URI referer
     The URI of the resource that referred the user to this resource.
     The name of the header is a misspelling, but we are stuck with it.
          (parse-header 'referer "http://www.gnu.org/")
          ⇒ #<uri ...>

 -- HTTP Header: List te
     A list of transfer codings, expressed as key-value lists.  A common
     transfer coding is ‘trailers’.
          (parse-header 'te "trailers")
          ⇒ ((trailers))

 -- HTTP Header: String user-agent
     A string indicating the user agent making the request.  The
     specification defines a structured format for this header, but it
     is widely disregarded, so Guile does not attempt to parse strictly.
          (parse-header 'user-agent "Mozilla/5.0")
          ⇒ "Mozilla/5.0"

### 7.3.4.5 Response Headers
........................

 -- HTTP Header: List accept-ranges
     A list of range units that the server supports, as symbols.
          (parse-header 'accept-ranges "bytes")

 -- HTTP Header: UInt age
     The age of a cached response, in seconds.
          (parse-header 'age "3600")
          ⇒ 3600

 -- HTTP Header: ETag etag
     The entity-tag of the resource.
          (parse-header 'etag "\"foo\"")
          ⇒ ("foo" . #t)

 -- HTTP Header: URI-reference location
     A URI reference on which a request may be completed.  Used in
     combination with a redirecting status code to perform client-side
     redirection.
          (parse-header 'location "http://example.com/other")
          ⇒ #<uri ...>

 -- HTTP Header: List proxy-authenticate
     A list of challenges to a proxy, indicating the need for
     authentication.
          (parse-header 'proxy-authenticate "Basic realm=\"foo\"")
          ⇒ ((basic (realm . "foo")))

 -- HTTP Header: UInt|Date retry-after
     Used in combination with a server-busy status code, like 503, to
     indicate that a client should retry later.  Either a number of
     seconds, or a date.
          (parse-header 'retry-after "60")
          ⇒ 60

 -- HTTP Header: String server
     A string identifying the server.
          (parse-header 'server "My first web server")
          ⇒ "My first web server"

 -- HTTP Header: *|List vary
     A set of request headers that were used in computing this response.
     Used to indicate that server-side content negotiation was
     performed, for example in response to the ‘accept-language’ header.
     Can also be the symbol ‘*’, indicating that all headers were
     considered.
          (parse-header 'vary "Accept-Language, Accept")
          ⇒ (accept-language accept)

 -- HTTP Header: List www-authenticate
     A list of challenges to a user, indicating the need for
     authentication.

7.3.5 Transfer Codings
----------------------

HTTP 1.1 allows for various transfer codings to be applied to message
bodies.  These include various types of compression, and HTTP chunked
encoding.  Currently, only chunked encoding is supported by guile.

   Chunked coding is an optional coding that may be applied to message
bodies, to allow messages whose length is not known beforehand to be
returned.  Such messages can be split into chunks, terminated by a final
zero length chunk.

   In order to make dealing with encodings more simple, guile provides
procedures to create ports that “wrap” existing ports, applying
transformations transparently under the hood.

   These procedures are in the ‘(web http)’ module.

     (use-modules (web http))

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-chunked-input-port port [#:keep-alive?=#f]
     Returns a new port, that transparently reads and decodes
     chunk-encoded data from PORT.  If no more chunk-encoded data is
     available, it returns the end-of-file object.  When the port is
     closed, PORT will also be closed, unless KEEP-ALIVE? is true.

     If the chunked input ends prematurely, a
     ‘&chunked-input-ended-promaturely’ exception will be raised.

     (use-modules (ice-9 rdelim))

     (define s "5\r\nFirst\r\nA\r\n line\n Sec\r\n8\r\nond line\r\n0\r\n")
     (define p (make-chunked-input-port (open-input-string s)))
     (read-line s)
     ⇒ "First line"
     (read-line s)
     ⇒ "Second line"

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-chunked-output-port port [#:keep-alive?=#f]
     Returns a new port, which transparently encodes data as
     chunk-encoded before writing it to PORT.  Whenever a write occurs
     on this port, it buffers it, until the port is flushed, at which
     point it writes a chunk containing all the data written so far.
     When the port is closed, the data remaining is written to PORT, as
     is the terminating zero chunk.  It also causes PORT to be closed,
     unless KEEP-ALIVE? is true.

     Note.  Forcing a chunked output port when there is no data is
     buffered does not write a zero chunk, as this would cause the data
     to be interpreted incorrectly by the client.

     (call-with-output-string
       (lambda (out)
         (define out* (make-chunked-output-port out #:keep-alive? #t))
         (display "first chunk" out*)
         (force-output out*)
         (force-output out*) ; note this does not write a zero chunk
         (display "second chunk" out*)
         (close-port out*)))
     ⇒ "b\r\nfirst chunk\r\nc\r\nsecond chunk\r\n0\r\n"

7.3.6 HTTP Requests
-------------------

     (use-modules (web request))

   The request module contains a data type for HTTP requests.

### 7.3.6.1 An Important Note on Character Sets
...........................................

HTTP requests consist of two parts: the request proper, consisting of a
request line and a set of headers, and (optionally) a body.  The body
might have a binary content-type, and even in the textual case its
length is specified in bytes, not characters.

   Therefore, HTTP is a fundamentally binary protocol.  However the
request line and headers are specified to be in a subset of ASCII, so
they can be treated as text, provided that the port’s encoding is set to
an ASCII-compatible one-byte-per-character encoding.  ISO-8859-1
(latin-1) is just such an encoding, and happens to be very efficient for
Guile.

   So what Guile does when reading requests from the wire, or writing
them out, is to set the port’s encoding to latin-1, and treating the
request headers as text.

   The request body is another issue.  For binary data, the data is
probably in a bytevector, so we use the R6RS binary output procedures to
write out the binary payload.  Textual data usually has to be written
out to some character encoding, usually UTF-8, and then the resulting
bytevector is written out to the port.

   In summary, Guile reads and writes HTTP over latin-1 sockets, without
any loss of generality.

### 7.3.6.2 Request API
...................

 -- Scheme Procedure: request? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-method request
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-uri request
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-version request
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-headers request
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-meta request
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-port request
     A predicate and field accessors for the request type.  The fields
     are as follows:
     ‘method’
          The HTTP method, for example, ‘GET’.
     ‘uri’
          The URI as a URI record.
     ‘version’
          The HTTP version pair, like ‘(1 . 1)’.
     ‘headers’
          The request headers, as an alist of parsed values.
     ‘meta’
          An arbitrary alist of other data, for example information
          returned in the ‘sockaddr’ from ‘accept’ (*note* Network
          Sockets and Communication::).
     ‘port’
          The port on which to read or write a request body, if any.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-request port [meta='()]
     Read an HTTP request from PORT, optionally attaching the given
     metadata, META.

     As a side effect, sets the encoding on PORT to ISO-8859-1
     (latin-1), so that reading one character reads one byte.  See the
     discussion of character sets above, for more information.

     Note that the body is not part of the request.  Once you have read
     a request, you may read the body separately, and likewise for
     writing requests.

 -- Scheme Procedure: build-request uri [#:method='GET] [#:version='(1 .
          1)] [#:headers='()] [#:port=#f] [#:meta='()]
          [#:validate-headers?=#t]
     Construct an HTTP request object.  If VALIDATE-HEADERS? is true,
     the headers are each run through their respective validators.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-request r port
     Write the given HTTP request to PORT.

     Return a new request, whose ‘request-port’ will continue writing on
     PORT, perhaps using some transfer encoding.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-request-body r
     Reads the request body from R, as a bytevector.  Return ‘#f’ if
     there was no request body.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-request-body r bv
     Write BV, a bytevector, to the port corresponding to the HTTP
     request R.

   The various headers that are typically associated with HTTP requests
may be accessed with these dedicated accessors.  *Note* HTTP Headers::,
for more information on the format of parsed headers.

 -- Scheme Procedure: request-accept request [default='()]
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-accept-charset request [default='()]
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-accept-encoding request [default='()]
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-accept-language request [default='()]
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-allow request [default='()]

 -- Scheme Procedure: request-upgrade request [default='()]
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-user-agent request [default=#f]
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-via request [default='()]
 -- Scheme Procedure: request-warning request [default='()]
     Return the given request header, or DEFAULT if none was present.

 -- Scheme Procedure: request-absolute-uri r [default-host=#f]
          [default-port=#f] [default-scheme=#f]
     A helper routine to determine the absolute URI of a request, using
     the ‘host’ header and the default scheme, host and port.  If there
     is no default scheme and the URI is not itself absolute, an error
     is signalled.

7.3.7 HTTP Responses
--------------------

     (use-modules (web response))

   As with requests (*note* Requests::), Guile offers a data type for
HTTP responses.  Again, the body is represented separately from the
request.

 -- Scheme Procedure: response? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: response-version response
 -- Scheme Procedure: response-code response
 -- Scheme Procedure: response-reason-phrase response
 -- Scheme Procedure: response-headers response
 -- Scheme Procedure: response-port response
     A predicate and field accessors for the response type.  The fields
     are as follows:
     ‘version’
          The HTTP version pair, like ‘(1 . 1)’.
     ‘code’
          The HTTP response code, like ‘200’.
     ‘reason-phrase’
          The reason phrase, or the standard reason phrase for the
          response’s code.
     ‘headers’
          The response headers, as an alist of parsed values.
     ‘port’
          The port on which to read or write a response body, if any.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-response port
     Read an HTTP response from PORT.

     As a side effect, sets the encoding on PORT to ISO-8859-1
     (latin-1), so that reading one character reads one byte.  See the
     discussion of character sets in *note* Responses::, for more
     information.

 -- Scheme Procedure: build-response [#:version='(1 . 1)] [#:code=200]
          [#:reason-phrase=#f] [#:headers='()] [#:port=#f]
          [#:validate-headers?=#t]
     Construct an HTTP response object.  If VALIDATE-HEADERS? is true,
     the headers are each run through their respective validators.

 -- Scheme Procedure: adapt-response-version response version
     Adapt the given response to a different HTTP version.  Return a new
     HTTP response.

     The idea is that many applications might just build a response for
     the default HTTP version, and this method could handle a number of
     programmatic transformations to respond to older HTTP versions (0.9
     and 1.0).  But currently this function is a bit heavy-handed, just
     updating the version field.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-response r port
     Write the given HTTP response to PORT.

     Return a new response, whose ‘response-port’ will continue writing
     on PORT, perhaps using some transfer encoding.

 -- Scheme Procedure: response-must-not-include-body? r
     Some responses, like those with status code 304, are specified as
     never having bodies.  This predicate returns ‘#t’ for those
     responses.

     Note also, though, that responses to ‘HEAD’ requests must also not
     have a body.

 -- Scheme Procedure: response-body-port r [#:decode?=#t]
          [#:keep-alive?=#t]
     Return an input port from which the body of R can be read.  The
     encoding of the returned port is set according to R’s
     ‘content-type’ header, when it’s textual, except if DECODE? is
     ‘#f’.  Return ‘#f’ when no body is available.

     When KEEP-ALIVE? is ‘#f’, closing the returned port also closes R’s
     response port.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-response-body r
     Read the response body from R, as a bytevector.  Returns ‘#f’ if
     there was no response body.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-response-body r bv
     Write BV, a bytevector, to the port corresponding to the HTTP
     response R.

   As with requests, the various headers that are typically associated
with HTTP responses may be accessed with these dedicated accessors.
*Note* HTTP Headers::, for more information on the format of parsed
headers.

 -- Scheme Procedure: response-accept-ranges response [default=#f]
 -- Scheme Procedure: response-age response [default='()]
 -- Scheme Procedure: response-allow response [default='()]
 -- Scheme Procedure: response-cache-control response [default='()]
 -- Scheme Procedure: response-connection response [default='()]

     Return the given response header, or DEFAULT if none was present.

 -- Scheme Procedure: text-content-type? TYPE
     Return ‘#t’ if TYPE, a symbol as returned by
     ‘response-content-type’, represents a textual type such as
     ‘text/plain’.

7.3.8 Web Client
----------------

‘(web client)’ provides a simple, synchronous HTTP client, built on the
lower-level HTTP, request, and response modules.

     (use-modules (web client))

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-socket-for-uri uri [#:verify-certificate? #t]
     Return an open input/output port for a connection to URI. Guile
     dynamically loads Guile-GnuTLS for HTTPS support.

     See the Web site of Guile-GnuTLS
     (https://gitlab.com/gnutls/guile/), and *note* how to install the
     GnuTLS bindings for Guile: (gnutls-guile)Guile Preparations, for
     more information.

     When VERIFY-CERTIFICATE? is true, verify the server’s X.509
     certificates against those read from ‘x509-certificate-directory’.
     When an error occurs—e.g., the server’s certificate has expired, or
     its host name does not match—raise a ‘tls-certificate-error’
     exception.  The arguments to the ‘tls-certificate-error’ exception
     are:

       1. a symbol indicating the failure cause, ‘host-mismatch’ if the
          certificate’s host name does not match the server’s host name,
          and ‘invalid-certificate’ for other causes;

       2. the server’s X.509 certificate (*note* GnuTLS Guile reference:
          (gnutls-guile)Guile Reference.);

       3. the server’s host name (a string);

       4. in the case of ‘invalid-certificate’ errors, a list of GnuTLS
          certificate status values—one of the ‘certificate-status/’
          constants, such as ‘certificate-status/signer-not-found’ or
          ‘certificate-status/revoked’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: http-request URI ARG...

     Connect to the server corresponding to URI and make a request over
     HTTP, using METHOD (‘GET’, ‘HEAD’, ‘POST’, etc.).

     The following keyword arguments allow you to modify the requests in
     various ways, for example attaching a body to the request, or
     setting specific headers.  The following table lists the keyword
     arguments and their default values.

     ‘#:method 'GET’
     ‘#:body #f’
     ‘#:verify-certificate? #t’
     ‘#:port (open-socket-for-uri URI #:verify-certificate? VERIFY-CERTIFICATE?)’
     ‘#:version '(1 . 1)’
     ‘#:keep-alive? #f’
     ‘#:headers '()’
     ‘#:decode-body? #t’
     ‘#:streaming? #f’

     If you already have a port open, pass it as PORT.  Otherwise, a
     connection will be opened to the server corresponding to URI.  Any
     extra headers in the alist HEADERS will be added to the request.

     If BODY is not ‘#f’, a message body will also be sent with the HTTP
     request.  If BODY is a string, it is encoded according to the
     content-type in HEADERS, defaulting to UTF-8.  Otherwise BODY
     should be a bytevector, or ‘#f’ for no body.  Although a message
     body may be sent with any request, usually only ‘POST’ and ‘PUT’
     requests have bodies.

     If DECODE-BODY? is true, as is the default, the body of the
     response will be decoded to string, if it is a textual
     content-type.  Otherwise it will be returned as a bytevector.

     However, if STREAMING? is true, instead of eagerly reading the
     response body from the server, this function only reads off the
     headers.  The response body will be returned as a port on which the
     data may be read.

     Unless KEEP-ALIVE? is true, the port will be closed after the full
     response body has been read.

     If PORT is false, URI denotes an HTTPS URL, and VERIFY-CERTIFICATE?
     is true, verify X.509 certificates against those available in
     ‘x509-certificate-directory’.

     Returns two values: the response read from the server, and the
     response body as a string, bytevector, #f value, or as a port (if
     STREAMING? is true).

 -- Scheme Procedure: http-get URI ARG...
 -- Scheme Procedure: http-head URI ARG...
 -- Scheme Procedure: http-post URI ARG...
 -- Scheme Procedure: http-put URI ARG...
 -- Scheme Procedure: http-delete URI ARG...
 -- Scheme Procedure: http-trace URI ARG...
 -- Scheme Procedure: http-options URI ARG...
     Connect to the server corresponding to URI and make a request over
     HTTP, using the appropriate method (‘GET’, ‘HEAD’, ‘POST’, etc.).

     These procedures are variants of ‘http-request’ specialized with a
     specific METHOD argument, and have the same prototype: a URI
     followed by an optional sequence of keyword arguments.  *Note*
     http-request::, for full documentation on the various keyword
     arguments.

 -- Scheme Parameter: x509-certificate-directory
     This parameter gives the name of the directory where X.509
     certificates for HTTPS connections should be looked for.

     Its default value is one of:

        • the value of the ‘GUILE_TLS_CERTIFICATE_DIRECTORY’ environment
          variable;

        • or the value of the ‘SSL_CERT_DIR’ environment variable (also
          honored by the OpenSSL library);

        • or, as a last resort, ‘"/etc/ssl/certs"’.

     X.509 certificates are used when authenticating the identity of a
     remote site, when the ‘#:verify-certificate?’ argument to
     ‘open-socket-for-uri’, to ‘http-request’, or to related procedures
     is true.

   ‘http-get’ is useful for making one-off requests to web sites.  If
you are writing a web spider or some other client that needs to handle a
number of requests in parallel, it’s better to build an event-driven URL
fetcher, similar in structure to the web server (*note* Web Server::).

   Another option, good but not as performant, would be to use threads,
possibly via par-map or futures.

 -- Scheme Parameter: current-http-proxy
 -- Scheme Parameter: current-https-proxy
     Either ‘#f’ or a non-empty string containing the URL of the HTTP or
     HTTPS proxy server to be used by the procedures in the ‘(web
     client)’ module, including ‘open-socket-for-uri’.  Its initial
     value is based on the ‘http_proxy’ and ‘https_proxy’ environment
     variables.

          (current-http-proxy) ⇒ "http://localhost:8123/"
          (parameterize ((current-http-proxy #f))
            (http-get "http://example.com/"))  ; temporarily bypass proxy
          (current-http-proxy) ⇒ "http://localhost:8123/"

7.3.9 Web Server
----------------

‘(web server)’ is a generic web server interface, along with a main loop
implementation for web servers controlled by Guile.

     (use-modules (web server))

   The lowest layer is the ‘<server-impl>’ object, which defines a set
of hooks to open a server, read a request from a client, write a
response to a client, and close a server.  These hooks – ‘open’, ‘read’,
‘write’, and ‘close’, respectively – are bound together in a
‘<server-impl>’ object.  Procedures in this module take a
‘<server-impl>’ object, if needed.

   A ‘<server-impl>’ may also be looked up by name.  If you pass the
‘http’ symbol to ‘run-server’, Guile looks for a variable named ‘http’
in the ‘(web server http)’ module, which should be bound to a
‘<server-impl>’ object.  Such a binding is made by instantiation of the
‘define-server-impl’ syntax.  In this way the run-server loop can
automatically load other backends if available.

   The life cycle of a server goes as follows:

  1. The ‘open’ hook is called, to open the server.  ‘open’ takes zero
     or more arguments, depending on the backend, and returns an opaque
     server socket object, or signals an error.

  2. The ‘read’ hook is called, to read a request from a new client.
     The ‘read’ hook takes one argument, the server socket.  It should
     return three values: an opaque client socket, the request, and the
     request body.  The request should be a ‘<request>’ object, from
     ‘(web request)’.  The body should be a string or a bytevector, or
     ‘#f’ if there is no body.

     If the read failed, the ‘read’ hook may return #f for the client
     socket, request, and body.

  3. A user-provided handler procedure is called, with the request and
     body as its arguments.  The handler should return two values: the
     response, as a ‘<response>’ record from ‘(web response)’, and the
     response body as bytevector, or ‘#f’ if not present.

     The respose and response body are run through ‘sanitize-response’,
     documented below.  This allows the handler writer to take some
     convenient shortcuts: for example, instead of a ‘<response>’, the
     handler can simply return an alist of headers, in which case a
     default response object is constructed with those headers.  Instead
     of a bytevector for the body, the handler can return a string,
     which will be serialized into an appropriate encoding; or it can
     return a procedure, which will be called on a port to write out the
     data.  See the ‘sanitize-response’ documentation, for more.

  4. The ‘write’ hook is called with three arguments: the client socket,
     the response, and the body.  The ‘write’ hook returns no values.

  5. At this point the request handling is complete.  For a loop, we
     loop back and try to read a new request.

  6. If the user interrupts the loop, the ‘close’ hook is called on the
     server socket.

   A user may define a server implementation with the following form:

 -- Scheme Syntax: define-server-impl name open read write close
     Make a ‘<server-impl>’ object with the hooks OPEN, READ, WRITE, and
     CLOSE, and bind it to the symbol NAME in the current module.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lookup-server-impl impl
     Look up a server implementation.  If IMPL is a server
     implementation already, it is returned directly.  If it is a
     symbol, the binding named IMPL in the ‘(web server IMPL)’ module is
     looked up.  Otherwise an error is signaled.

     Currently a server implementation is a somewhat opaque type, useful
     only for passing to other procedures in this module, like
     ‘read-client’.

   The ‘(web server)’ module defines a number of routines that use
‘<server-impl>’ objects to implement parts of a web server.  Given that
we don’t expose the accessors for the various fields of a
‘<server-impl>’, indeed these routines are the only procedures with any
access to the impl objects.

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-server impl open-params
     Open a server for the given implementation.  Return one value, the
     new server object.  The implementation’s ‘open’ procedure is
     applied to OPEN-PARAMS, which should be a list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: read-client impl server
     Read a new client from SERVER, by applying the implementation’s
     ‘read’ procedure to the server.  If successful, return three
     values: an object corresponding to the client, a request object,
     and the request body.  If any exception occurs, return ‘#f’ for all
     three values.

 -- Scheme Procedure: handle-request handler request body state
     Handle a given request, returning the response and body.

     The response and response body are produced by calling the given
     HANDLER with REQUEST and BODY as arguments.

     The elements of STATE are also passed to HANDLER as arguments, and
     may be returned as additional values.  The new STATE, collected
     from the HANDLER’s return values, is then returned as a list.  The
     idea is that a server loop receives a handler from the user, along
     with whatever state values the user is interested in, allowing the
     user’s handler to explicitly manage its state.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sanitize-response request response body
     “Sanitize” the given response and body, making them appropriate for
     the given request.

     As a convenience to web handler authors, RESPONSE may be given as
     an alist of headers, in which case it is used to construct a
     default response.  Ensures that the response version corresponds to
     the request version.  If BODY is a string, encodes the string to a
     bytevector, in an encoding appropriate for RESPONSE.  Adds a
     ‘content-length’ and ‘content-type’ header, as necessary.

     If BODY is a procedure, it is called with a port as an argument,
     and the output collected as a bytevector.  In the future we might
     try to instead use a compressing, chunk-encoded port, and call this
     procedure later, in the write-client procedure.  Authors are
     advised not to rely on the procedure being called at any particular
     time.

 -- Scheme Procedure: write-client impl server client response body
     Write an HTTP response and body to CLIENT.  If the server and
     client support persistent connections, it is the implementation’s
     responsibility to keep track of the client thereafter, presumably
     by attaching it to the SERVER argument somehow.

 -- Scheme Procedure: close-server impl server
     Release resources allocated by a previous invocation of
     ‘open-server’.

   Given the procedures above, it is a small matter to make a web
server:

 -- Scheme Procedure: serve-one-client handler impl server state
     Read one request from SERVER, call HANDLER on the request and body,
     and write the response to the client.  Return the new state
     produced by the handler procedure.

 -- Scheme Procedure: run-server handler [impl='http] [open-params='()]
          arg ...
     Run Guile’s built-in web server.

     HANDLER should be a procedure that takes two or more arguments, the
     HTTP request and request body, and returns two or more values, the
     response and response body.

     For examples, skip ahead to the next section, *note* Web Examples::.

     The response and body will be run through ‘sanitize-response’
     before sending back to the client.

     Additional arguments to HANDLER are taken from ARG ....  These
     arguments comprise a “state”.  Additional return values are
     accumulated into a new state, which will be used for subsequent
     requests.  In this way a handler can explicitly manage its state.

   The default web server implementation is ‘http’, which binds to a
socket, listening for request on that port.

 -- HTTP Implementation: http [#:host=#f] [#:family=AF_INET]
          [#:addr=INADDR_LOOPBACK] [#:port 8080] [#:socket]
     The default HTTP implementation.  We document it as a function with
     keyword arguments, because that is precisely the way that it is –
     all of the OPEN-PARAMS to ‘run-server’ get passed to the
     implementation’s open function.

          ;; The defaults: localhost:8080
          (run-server handler)
          ;; Same thing
          (run-server handler 'http '())
          ;; On a different port
          (run-server handler 'http '(#:port 8081))
          ;; IPv6
          (run-server handler 'http '(#:family AF_INET6 #:port 8081))
          ;; Custom socket
          (run-server handler 'http `(#:socket ,(sudo-make-me-a-socket)))

7.3.10 Web Examples
-------------------

Well, enough about the tedious internals.  Let’s make a web application!

### 7.3.10.1 Hello, World!
......................

The first program we have to write, of course, is “Hello, World!”.  This
means that we have to implement a web handler that does what we want.

   Now we define a handler, a function of two arguments and two return
values:

     (define (handler request request-body)
       (values RESPONSE RESPONSE-BODY))

   In this first example, we take advantage of a short-cut, returning an
alist of headers instead of a proper response object.  The response body
is our payload:

     (define (hello-world-handler request request-body)
       (values '((content-type . (text/plain)))
               "Hello World!"))

   Now let’s test it, by running a server with this handler.  Load up
the web server module if you haven’t yet done so, and run a server with
this handler:

     (use-modules (web server))
     (run-server hello-world-handler)

   By default, the web server listens for requests on ‘localhost:8080’.
Visit that address in your web browser to test.  If you see the string,
‘Hello World!’, sweet!

### 7.3.10.2 Inspecting the Request
...............................

The Hello World program above is a general greeter, responding to all
URIs.  To make a more exclusive greeter, we need to inspect the request
object, and conditionally produce different results.  So let’s load up
the request, response, and URI modules, and do just that.

     (use-modules (web server)) ; you probably did this already
     (use-modules (web request)
                  (web response)
                  (web uri))

     (define (request-path-components request)
       (split-and-decode-uri-path (uri-path (request-uri request))))

     (define (hello-hacker-handler request body)
       (if (equal? (request-path-components request)
                   '("hacker"))
           (values '((content-type . (text/plain)))
                   "Hello hacker!")
           (not-found request)))

     (run-server hello-hacker-handler)

   Here we see that we have defined a helper to return the components of
the URI path as a list of strings, and used that to check for a request
to ‘/hacker/’.  Then the success case is just as before – visit
‘http://localhost:8080/hacker/’ in your browser to check.

   You should always match against URI path components as decoded by
‘split-and-decode-uri-path’.  The above example will work for
‘/hacker/’, ‘//hacker///’, and ‘/h%61ck%65r’.

   But we forgot to define ‘not-found’!  If you are pasting these
examples into a REPL, accessing any other URI in your web browser will
drop your Guile console into the debugger:

     <unnamed port>:38:7: In procedure module-lookup:
     <unnamed port>:38:7: Unbound variable: not-found

     Entering a new prompt.  Type `,bt' for a backtrace or `,q' to continue.
     scheme@(guile-user) [1]>

   So let’s define the function, right there in the debugger.  As you
probably know, we’ll want to return a 404 response.

     ;; Paste this in your REPL
     (define (not-found request)
       (values (build-response #:code 404)
               (string-append "Resource not found: "
                              (uri->string (request-uri request)))))

     ;; Now paste this to let the web server keep going:
     ,continue

   Now if you access ‘http://localhost/foo/’, you get this error
message.  (Note that some popular web browsers won’t show
server-generated 404 messages, showing their own instead, unless the 404
message body is long enough.)

### 7.3.10.3 Higher-Level Interfaces
................................

The web handler interface is a common baseline that all kinds of Guile
web applications can use.  You will usually want to build something on
top of it, however, especially when producing HTML. Here is a simple
example that builds up HTML output using SXML (*note* SXML::).

   First, load up the modules:

     (use-modules (web server)
                  (web request)
                  (web response)
                  (sxml simple))

   Now we define a simple templating function that takes a list of HTML
body elements, as SXML, and puts them in our super template:

     (define (templatize title body)
       `(html (head (title ,title))
              (body ,@body)))

   For example, the simplest Hello HTML can be produced like this:

     (sxml->xml (templatize "Hello!" '((b "Hi!"))))
     ⊣
     <html><head><title>Hello!</title></head><body><b>Hi!</b></body></html>

   Much better to work with Scheme data types than to work with HTML as
strings.  Now we define a little response helper:

     (define* (respond #:optional body #:key
                       (status 200)
                       (title "Hello hello!")
                       (doctype "<!DOCTYPE html>\n")
                       (content-type-params '((charset . "utf-8")))
                       (content-type 'text/html)
                       (extra-headers '())
                       (sxml (and body (templatize title body))))
       (values (build-response
                #:code status
                #:headers `((content-type
                             . (,content-type ,@content-type-params))
                            ,@extra-headers))
               (lambda (port)
                 (if sxml
                     (begin
                       (if doctype (display doctype port))
                       (sxml->xml sxml port))))))

   Here we see the power of keyword arguments with default initializers.
By the time the arguments are fully parsed, the ‘sxml’ local variable
will hold the templated SXML, ready for sending out to the client.

   Also, instead of returning the body as a string, ‘respond’ gives a
procedure, which will be called by the web server to write out the
response to the client.

   Now, a simple example using this responder, which lays out the
incoming headers in an HTML table.

     (define (debug-page request body)
       (respond
        `((h1 "hello world!")
          (table
           (tr (th "header") (th "value"))
           ,@(map (lambda (pair)
                    `(tr (td (tt ,(with-output-to-string

### 7.3.10.4 Conclusion
...................

Well, this is about as far as Guile’s built-in web support goes, for
now.  There are many ways to make a web application, but hopefully by
standardizing the most fundamental data types, users will be able to
choose the approach that suits them best, while also being able to
switch between implementations of the server.  This is a relatively new
part of Guile, so if you have feedback, let us know, and we can take it
into account.  Happy hacking on the web!

7.4 The (ice-9 getopt-long) Module
==================================

The ‘(ice-9 getopt-long)’ facility is designed to help parse arguments
that are passed to Guile programs on the command line, and is modelled
after the C library’s facility of the same name (*note* (libc)Getopt::).
For a more low-level interface to command-line argument parsing, *Note*
SRFI-37::.

   The ‘(ice-9 getopt-long)’ module exports two procedures:
‘getopt-long’ and ‘option-ref’.

   • ‘getopt-long’ takes a list of strings — the command line arguments
     — an “option specification”, and some optional keyword parameters.
     It parses the command line arguments according to the option
     specification and keyword parameters, and returns a data structure
     that encapsulates the results of the parsing.

   • ‘option-ref’ then takes the parsed data structure and a specific
     option’s name, and returns information about that option in
     particular.

   To make these procedures available to your Guile script, include the
expression ‘(use-modules (ice-9 getopt-long))’ somewhere near the top,
before the first usage of ‘getopt-long’ or ‘option-ref’.

7.4.1 A Short getopt-long Example
---------------------------------

This section illustrates how ‘getopt-long’ is used by presenting and
dissecting a simple example.  The first thing that we need is an “option
specification” that tells ‘getopt-long’ how to parse the command line.
This specification is an association list with the long option name as
the key.  Here is how such a specification might look:

     (define option-spec
       '((version (single-char #\v) (value #f))
         (help    (single-char #\h) (value #f))))

   This alist tells ‘getopt-long’ that it should accept two long
options, called _version_ and _help_, and that these options can also be
selected by the single-letter abbreviations _v_ and _h_, respectively.
The ‘(value #f)’ clauses indicate that neither of the options accepts a
value.

   With this specification we can use ‘getopt-long’ to parse a given
command line:

     (define options (getopt-long (command-line) option-spec))

   After this call, ‘options’ contains the parsed command line and is
ready to be examined by ‘option-ref’.  ‘option-ref’ is called like this:

     (option-ref options 'help #f)

It expects the parsed command line, a symbol indicating the option to
examine, and a default value.  The default value is returned if the
option was not present in the command line, or if the option was present
but without a value; otherwise the value from the command line is
returned.  Usually ‘option-ref’ is called once for each possible option
that a script supports.

   The following example shows a main program which puts all this
together to parse its command line and figure out what the user wanted.

     (define (main args)
       (let* ((option-spec '((version (single-char #\v) (value #f))
                             (help    (single-char #\h) (value #f))))
              (options (getopt-long args option-spec))
              (help-wanted (option-ref options 'help #f))
              (version-wanted (option-ref options 'version #f)))
         (if (or version-wanted help-wanted)
             (begin
               (if version-wanted
                   (display "getopt-long-example version 0.3\n"))
               (if help-wanted
                   (display "\
     getopt-long-example [options]
       -v, --version    Display version
       -h, --help       Display this help
     ")))
             (begin
               (display "Hello, World!") (newline)))))

7.4.2 How to Write an Option Specification
------------------------------------------

An option specification is an association list (*note* Association
Lists::) with one list element for each supported option.  The key of
each list element is a symbol that names the option, while the value is
a list of option properties:

     OPTION-SPEC ::=  '( (OPT-NAME1 (PROP-NAME PROP-VALUE) ...)
                         (OPT-NAME2 (PROP-NAME PROP-VALUE) ...)
                         (OPT-NAME3 (PROP-NAME PROP-VALUE) ...)
                         ...
                       )

   Each OPT-NAME specifies the long option name for that option.  For
example, a list element with OPT-NAME ‘background’ specifies an option
that can be specified on the command line using the long option
‘--background’.  Further information about the option — whether it takes
a value, whether it is required to be present in the command line, and
so on — is specified by the option properties.

   In the example of the preceding section, we already saw that a long
option name can have a equivalent “short option” character.  The
equivalent short option character can be set for an option by specifying
a ‘single-char’ property in that option’s property list.  For example, a
list element like ‘'(output (single-char #\o) ...)’ specifies an option
with long name ‘--output’ that can also be specified by the equivalent
short name ‘-o’.

   The ‘value’ property specifies whether an option requires or accepts
a value.  If the ‘value’ property is set to ‘#t’, the option requires a
value: ‘getopt-long’ will signal an error if the option name is present
without a corresponding value.  If set to ‘#f’, the option does not take
a value; in this case, a non-option word that follows the option name in
the command line will be treated as a non-option argument.  If set to
the symbol ‘optional’, the option accepts a value but does not require
one: a non-option word that follows the option name in the command line
will be interpreted as that option’s value.  If the option name for an
option with ‘'(value optional)’ is immediately followed in the command
line by _another_ option name, the value for the first option is
implicitly ‘#t’.

   The ‘required?’ property indicates whether an option is required to
be present in the command line.  If the ‘required?’ property is set to
‘#t’, ‘getopt-long’ will signal an error if the option is not specified.

   Finally, the ‘predicate’ property can be used to constrain the
possible values of an option.  If used, the ‘predicate’ property should
be set to a procedure that takes one argument — the proposed option
value as a string — and returns either ‘#t’ or ‘#f’ according as the
proposed value is or is not acceptable.  If the predicate procedure
returns ‘#f’, ‘getopt-long’ will signal an error.

   By default, options do not have single-character equivalents, are not
required, and do not take values.  Where the list element for an option
includes a ‘value’ property but no ‘predicate’ property, the option
values are unconstrained.

7.4.3 Expected Command Line Format
----------------------------------

In order for ‘getopt-long’ to correctly parse a command line, that
command line must conform to a standard set of rules for how command
line options are specified.  This section explains what those rules are.

   ‘getopt-long’ splits a given command line into several pieces.  All
elements of the argument list are classified to be either options or
normal arguments.  Options consist of two dashes and an option name
(so-called “long” options), or of one dash followed by a single letter
(“short” options).

   Options can behave as switches, when they are given without a value,
or they can be used to pass a value to the program.  The value for an
option may be specified using an equals sign, or else is simply the next
word in the command line, so the following two invocations are
equivalent:

     $ ./foo.scm --output=bar.txt
     $ ./foo.scm --output bar.txt

   Short options can be used instead of their long equivalents and can
be grouped together after a single dash.  For example, the following
commands are equivalent.

     $ ./foo.scm --version --help
     $ ./foo.scm -v --help
     $ ./foo.scm -vh

   If an option requires a value, it can only be grouped together with
other short options if it is the last option in the group; the value is
the next argument.  So, for example, with the following option
specification —

     ((apples    (single-char #\a))
      (blimps    (single-char #\b) (value #t))
      (catalexis (single-char #\c) (value #t)))

— the following command lines would all be acceptable:

     $ ./foo.scm -a -b bang -c couth
     $ ./foo.scm -ab bang -c couth
     $ ./foo.scm -ac couth -b bang

   But the next command line is an error, because ‘-b’ is not the last
option in its combination, and because a group of short options cannot
include two options that both require values:

     $ ./foo.scm -abc couth bang

   If an option’s value is optional, ‘getopt-long’ decides whether the
option has a value by looking at what follows it in the argument list.
If the next element is a string, and it does not appear to be an option
itself, then that string is the option’s value.

   If the option ‘--’ appears in the argument list, argument parsing
stops there and subsequent arguments are returned as ordinary arguments,
even if they resemble options.  So, with the command line

     $ ./foo.scm --apples "Granny Smith" -- --blimp Goodyear

‘getopt-long’ will recognize the ‘--apples’ option as having the value
"Granny Smith", but will not treat ‘--blimp’ as an option.  The strings
‘--blimp’ and ‘Goodyear’ will be returned as ordinary argument strings.

7.4.4 Reference Documentation for ‘getopt-long’
-----------------------------------------------

 -- Scheme Procedure: getopt-long args grammar
          [#:stop-at-first-non-option #f]
     Parse the command line given in ARGS (which must be a list of
     strings) according to the option specification GRAMMAR.

     The GRAMMAR argument is expected to be a list of this form:

     ‘((OPTION (PROPERTY VALUE) ...) ...)’

     where each OPTION is a symbol denoting the long option, but without
     the two leading dashes (e.g. ‘version’ if the option is called
     ‘--version’).

     For each option, there may be list of arbitrarily many
     property/value pairs.  The order of the pairs is not important, but
     every property may only appear once in the property list.  The
     following table lists the possible properties:

     ‘(single-char CHAR)’
          Accept ‘-CHAR’ as a single-character equivalent to ‘--OPTION’.
          This is how to specify traditional Unix-style flags.
     ‘(required? BOOL)’
          If BOOL is true, the option is required.  ‘getopt-long’ will
          raise an error if it is not found in ARGS.
     ‘(value BOOL)’
          If BOOL is ‘#t’, the option accepts a value; if it is ‘#f’, it
          does not; and if it is the symbol ‘optional’, the option may
          appear in ARGS with or without a value.
     ‘(predicate FUNC)’
          If the option accepts a value (i.e. you specified ‘(value #t)’
          for this option), then ‘getopt-long’ will apply FUNC to the
          value, and throw an exception if it returns ‘#f’.  FUNC should
          be a procedure which accepts a string and returns a boolean
          value; you may need to use quasiquotes to get it into GRAMMAR.

     The ‘#:stop-at-first-non-option’ keyword, if specified with any
     true value, tells ‘getopt-long’ to stop when it gets to the first
     non-option in the command line.  That is, at the first word which
     is neither an option itself, nor the value of an option.
     Everything in the command line from that word onwards will be
     returned as non-option arguments.

   ‘getopt-long’’s ARGS parameter is expected to be a list of strings
like the one returned by ‘command-line’, with the first element being
the name of the command.  Therefore ‘getopt-long’ ignores the first
element in ARGS and starts argument interpretation with the second
element.

   ‘getopt-long’ signals an error if any of the following conditions
hold.

   • The option grammar has an invalid syntax.

   • One of the options in the argument list was not specified by the
     grammar.

   • A required option is omitted.

   • An option which requires an argument did not get one.

   • An option that doesn’t accept an argument does get one (this can
     only happen using the long option ‘--opt=VALUE’ syntax).

   • An option predicate fails.

   ‘#:stop-at-first-non-option’ is useful for command line invocations
like ‘guild [--help | --version] [script [script-options]]’ and ‘cvs
[general-options] command [command-options]’, where there are options at
two levels: some generic and understood by the outer command, and some
that are specific to the particular script or command being invoked.  To
use ‘getopt-long’ in such cases, you would call it twice: firstly with
‘#:stop-at-first-non-option #t’, so as to parse any generic options and
identify the wanted script or sub-command; secondly, and after trimming
off the initial generic command words, with a script- or
sub-command-specific option grammar, so as to process those specific
options.

7.4.5 Reference Documentation for ‘option-ref’
----------------------------------------------

 -- Scheme Procedure: option-ref options key default
     Search OPTIONS for a command line option named KEY and return its
     value, if found.  If the option has no value, but was given, return
     ‘#t’.  If the option was not given, return DEFAULT.  OPTIONS must
     be the result of a call to ‘getopt-long’.

   ‘option-ref’ always succeeds, either by returning the requested
option value from the command line, or the default value.

   The special key ‘'()’ can be used to get a list of all non-option
arguments.

SRFI is an acronym for Scheme Request For Implementation.  The SRFI
documents define a lot of syntactic and procedure extensions to standard
Scheme as defined in R5RS.

   Guile has support for a number of SRFIs.  This chapter gives an
overview over the available SRFIs and some usage hints.  For complete

7.5.1 About SRFI Usage
----------------------

SRFI support in Guile is currently implemented partly in the core
library, and partly as add-on modules.  That means that some SRFIs are
automatically available when the interpreter is started, whereas the
other SRFIs require you to use the appropriate support module
explicitly.

   There are several reasons for this inconsistency.  First, the feature
checking syntactic form ‘cond-expand’ (*note* SRFI-0::) must be available
immediately, because it must be there when the user wants to check for
the Scheme implementation, that is, before she can know that it is safe
to use ‘use-modules’ to load SRFI support modules.  The second reason is
that some features defined in SRFIs had been implemented in Guile before
the developers started to add SRFI implementations as modules (for
example SRFI-13 (*note* SRFI-13::)).  In the future, it is possible that
SRFIs in the core library might be factored out into separate modules,
requiring explicit module loading when they are needed.  So you should
be prepared to have to use ‘use-modules’ someday in the future to access
SRFI-13 bindings.  If you want, you can do that already.  We have
included the module ‘(srfi srfi-13)’ in the distribution, which
currently does nothing, but ensures that you can write future-safe code.

   Generally, support for a specific SRFI is made available by using
modules named ‘(srfi srfi-NUMBER)’, where NUMBER is the number of the
SRFI needed.  Another possibility is to use the command line option
‘--use-srfi’, which will load the necessary modules automatically (*note*
Invoking Guile::).

7.5.2 SRFI-0 - cond-expand
--------------------------

This SRFI lets a portable Scheme program test for the presence of
certain features, and adapt itself by using different blocks of code, or
fail if the necessary features are not available.  There’s no module to
load, this is in the Guile core.

   A program designed only for Guile will generally not need this
mechanism, such a program can of course directly use the various
documented parts of Guile.

 -- syntax: cond-expand (feature body...) ...
     Expand to the BODY of the first clause whose FEATURE specification
     is satisfied.  It is an error if no FEATURE is satisfied.

     Features are symbols such as ‘srfi-1’, and a feature specification
     can use ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘not’ forms to test combinations.  The last
     clause can be an ‘else’, to be used if no other passes.

     For example, define a private version of ‘alist-cons’ if SRFI-1 is
     not available.

          (cond-expand (srfi-1
                        )
                       (else
                        (define (alist-cons key val alist)
                          (cons (cons key val) alist))))

     Or demand a certain set of SRFIs (list operations, string ports,
     ‘receive’ and string operations), failing if they’re not available.

          (cond-expand ((and srfi-1 srfi-6 srfi-8 srfi-13)
                        ))

The Guile core has the following features,

     guile
     guile-2   ;; starting from Guile 2.x
     guile-2.2 ;; starting from Guile 2.2
     guile-3   ;; starting from Guile 3.x
     guile-3.0 ;; starting from Guile 3.0
     r5rs
     r6rs
     r7rs
     exact-closed ieee-float full-unicode ratios ;; R7RS features
     srfi-0
     srfi-4
     srfi-6
     srfi-13
     srfi-14
     srfi-16
     srfi-23
     srfi-30

     srfi-55
     srfi-61
     srfi-62
     srfi-87
     srfi-105

   Other SRFI feature symbols are defined once their code has been
loaded with ‘use-modules’, since only then are their bindings available.

   The ‘--use-srfi’ command line option (*note* Invoking Guile::) is a
good way to load SRFIs to satisfy ‘cond-expand’ when running a portable
program.

   Testing the ‘guile’ feature allows a program to adapt itself to the
Guile module system, but still run on other Scheme systems.  For example
the following demands SRFI-8 (‘receive’), but also knows how to load it
with the Guile mechanism.

     (cond-expand (srfi-8
                   )
                  (guile
                   (use-modules (srfi srfi-8))))

   Likewise, testing the ‘guile-2’ feature allows code to be portable
between Guile 2.X and previous versions of Guile.  For instance, it
makes it possible to write code that accounts for Guile 2.X’s compiler,
yet be correctly interpreted on 1.8 and earlier versions:

     (cond-expand (guile-2 (eval-when (compile)
                             ;; This must be evaluated at compile time.
                             (fluid-set! current-reader my-reader)))
                  (guile
                           ;; Earlier versions of Guile do not have a
                           ;; separate compilation phase.
                           (fluid-set! current-reader my-reader)))

   It should be noted that ‘cond-expand’ is separate from the
‘*features*’ mechanism (*note* Feature Tracking::), feature symbols in
one are unrelated to those in the other.

7.5.3 SRFI-1 - List library
---------------------------

The list library defined in SRFI-1 contains a lot of useful list
processing procedures for construction, examining, destructuring and
manipulating lists and pairs.

   Since SRFI-1 also defines some procedures which are already contained
in R5RS and thus are supported by the Guile core library, some list and
pair procedures which appear in the SRFI-1 document may not appear in
this section.  So when looking for a particular list/pair processing
procedure, you should also have a look at the sections *note* Lists:: and
*note* Pairs::.

* Menu:

* SRFI-1 Constructors::         Constructing new lists.
* SRFI-1 Predicates::           Testing list for specific properties.
* SRFI-1 Selectors::            Selecting elements from lists.
* SRFI-1 Length Append etc::    Length calculation and list appending.
* SRFI-1 Fold and Map::         Higher-order list processing.
* SRFI-1 Filtering and Partitioning::  Filter lists based on predicates.
* SRFI-1 Searching::            Search for elements.
* SRFI-1 Deleting::             Delete elements from lists.
* SRFI-1 Association Lists::    Handle association lists.
* SRFI-1 Set Operations::       Use lists for representing sets.

### 7.5.3.1 Constructors
....................

New lists can be constructed by calling one of the following procedures.

 -- Scheme Procedure: xcons d a
     Like ‘cons’, but with interchanged arguments.  Useful mostly when
     passed to higher-order procedures.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-tabulate n init-proc
     Return an N-element list, where each list element is produced by
     applying the procedure INIT-PROC to the corresponding list index.
     The order in which INIT-PROC is applied to the indices is not
     specified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-copy lst
     Return a new list containing the elements of the list LST.

     This function differs from the core ‘list-copy’ (*note* List
     Constructors::) in accepting improper lists too.  And if LST is not
     a pair at all then it’s treated as the final tail of an improper
     list and simply returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: circular-list elt1 elt2 ...
     Return a circular list containing the given arguments ELT1 ELT2
     ....

 -- Scheme Procedure: iota count [start step]
     Return a list containing COUNT numbers, starting from START and
     adding STEP each time.  The default START is 0, the default STEP is
     1.  For example,

          (iota 6)        ⇒ (0 1 2 3 4 5)
          (iota 4 2.5 -2) ⇒ (2.5 0.5 -1.5 -3.5)

     This function takes its name from the corresponding primitive in
     the APL language.

### 7.5.3.2 Predicates
..................

The procedures in this section test specific properties of lists.

 -- Scheme Procedure: proper-list? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a proper list, or ‘#f’ otherwise.  This is
     the same as the core ‘list?’ (*note* List Predicates::).

     A proper list is a list which ends with the empty list ‘()’ in the
     usual way.  The empty list ‘()’ itself is a proper list too.

          (proper-list? '(1 2 3))  ⇒ #t
          (proper-list? '())       ⇒ #t

 -- Scheme Procedure: circular-list? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a circular list, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

     A circular list is a list where at some point the ‘cdr’ refers back
     to a previous pair in the list (either the start or some later
     point), so that following the ‘cdr’s takes you around in a circle,
     with no end.

          (define x (list 1 2 3 4))
          (set-cdr! (last-pair x) (cddr x))
          x ⇒ (1 2 3 4 3 4 3 4 ...)
          (circular-list? x)  ⇒ #t

 -- Scheme Procedure: dotted-list? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a dotted list, or ‘#f’ otherwise.

     A dotted list is a list where the ‘cdr’ of the last pair is not the
     empty list ‘()’.  Any non-pair OBJ is also considered a dotted
     list, with length zero.

          (dotted-list? '(1 2 . 3))  ⇒ #t
          (dotted-list? 99)          ⇒ #t

   It will be noted that any Scheme object passes exactly one of the
above three tests ‘proper-list?’, ‘circular-list?’ and ‘dotted-list?’.
Non-lists are ‘dotted-list?’, finite lists are either ‘proper-list?’ or
‘dotted-list?’, and infinite lists are ‘circular-list?’.


 -- Scheme Procedure: null-list? lst
     Return ‘#t’ if LST is the empty list ‘()’, ‘#f’ otherwise.  If
     something else than a proper or circular list is passed as LST, an
     error is signalled.  This procedure is recommended for checking for
     the end of a list in contexts where dotted lists are not allowed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: not-pair? obj
     Return ‘#t’ is OBJ is not a pair, ‘#f’ otherwise.  This is
     shorthand notation ‘(not (pair? OBJ))’ and is supposed to be used
     for end-of-list checking in contexts where dotted lists are
     allowed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list= elt= list1 ...
     Return ‘#t’ if all argument lists are equal, ‘#f’ otherwise.  List
     equality is determined by testing whether all lists have the same
     length and the corresponding elements are equal in the sense of the
     equality predicate ELT=.  If no or only one list is given, ‘#t’ is
     returned.

### 7.5.3.3 Selectors
.................

 -- Scheme Procedure: first pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: second pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: third pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: fourth pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: fifth pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: sixth pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: seventh pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: eighth pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: ninth pair
 -- Scheme Procedure: tenth pair
     These are synonyms for ‘car’, ‘cadr’, ‘caddr’, ....

 -- Scheme Procedure: car+cdr pair
     Return two values, the CAR and the CDR of PAIR.

     (car+cdr '(0 1 2 3))
     ⇒
     0
     (1 2 3)

 -- Scheme Procedure: take lst i
 -- Scheme Procedure: take! lst i
     Return a list containing the first I elements of LST.

     ‘take!’ may modify the structure of the argument list LST in order
     to produce the result.

 -- Scheme Procedure: drop lst i
     Return a list containing all but the first I elements of LST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: take-right lst i
     Return a list containing the I last elements of LST.  The return
     shares a common tail with LST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: drop-right lst i
 -- Scheme Procedure: drop-right! lst i
     Return a list containing all but the I last elements of LST.

     ‘drop-right’ always returns a new list, even when I is zero.
     ‘drop-right!’ may modify the structure of the argument list LST in
     order to produce the result.

 -- Scheme Procedure: split-at lst i
 -- Scheme Procedure: split-at! lst i
     Return two values, a list containing the first I elements of the
     list LST and a list containing the remaining elements.

     ‘split-at!’ may modify the structure of the argument list LST in
     order to produce the result.

 -- Scheme Procedure: last lst
     Return the last element of the non-empty, finite list LST.

### 7.5.3.4 Length, Append, Concatenate, etc.
.........................................

 -- Scheme Procedure: length+ lst
     Return the length of the argument list LST.  When LST is a circular
     list, ‘#f’ is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: concatenate list-of-lists
 -- Scheme Procedure: concatenate! list-of-lists
     Construct a list by appending all lists in LIST-OF-LISTS.

     ‘concatenate!’ may modify the structure of the given lists in order
     to produce the result.

     ‘concatenate’ is the same as ‘(apply append LIST-OF-LISTS)’.  It
     exists because some Scheme implementations have a limit on the
     number of arguments a function takes, which the ‘apply’ might
     exceed.  In Guile there is no such limit.

 -- Scheme Procedure: append-reverse rev-head tail
 -- Scheme Procedure: append-reverse! rev-head tail
     Reverse REV-HEAD, append TAIL to it, and return the result.  This
     is equivalent to ‘(append (reverse REV-HEAD) TAIL)’, but its
     implementation is more efficient.

          (append-reverse '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6)) ⇒ (3 2 1 4 5 6)

     ‘append-reverse!’ may modify REV-HEAD in order to produce the
     result.

 -- Scheme Procedure: zip lst1 lst2 ...
     Return a list as long as the shortest of the argument lists, where
     each element is a list.  The first list contains the first elements
     of the argument lists, the second list contains the second
     elements, and so on.

 -- Scheme Procedure: unzip1 lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: unzip2 lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: unzip3 lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: unzip4 lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: unzip5 lst
     ‘unzip1’ takes a list of lists, and returns a list containing the
     first elements of each list, ‘unzip2’ returns two lists, the first
     containing the first elements of each lists and the second
     containing the second elements of each lists, and so on.

 -- Scheme Procedure: count pred lst1 lst2 ...
     Return a count of the number of times PRED returns true when called
     on elements from the given lists.

     PRED is called with N parameters ‘(PRED ELEM1 ... ELEMN )’, each
     element being from the corresponding list.  The first call is with
     the first element of each list, the second with the second element
     from each, and so on.

     Counting stops when the end of the shortest list is reached.  At
     least one list must be non-circular.


File: guile.info,  Node: SRFI-1 Fold and Map,  Next: SRFI-1 Filtering and Partitioning,  Prev: SRFI-1 Length Append etc,  Up: SRFI-1

### 7.5.3.5 Fold, Unfold & Map
..........................

 -- Scheme Procedure: fold proc init lst1 lst2 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: fold-right proc init lst1 lst2 ...
     Apply PROC to the elements of LST1 LST2 ... to build a result, and
     return that result.

     Each PROC call is ‘(PROC ELEM1 ELEM2 ... PREVIOUS)’, where ELEM1 is
     from LST1, ELEM2 is from LST2, and so on.  PREVIOUS is the return
     from the previous call to PROC, or the given INIT for the first
     call.  If any list is empty, just INIT is returned.

     ‘fold’ works through the list elements from first to last.  The
     following shows a list reversal and the calls it makes,

          (fold cons '() '(1 2 3))

          (cons 1 '())
          (cons 2 '(1))
          (cons 3 '(2 1)
          ⇒ (3 2 1)

     ‘fold-right’ works through the list elements from last to first,
     ie. from the right.  So for example the following finds the longest
     string, and the last among equal longest,

          (fold-right (lambda (str prev)
                        (if (> (string-length str) (string-length prev))
                            str
                            prev))
                      ""
                      '("x" "abc" "xyz" "jk"))
          ⇒ "xyz"

     If LST1 LST2 ... have different lengths, ‘fold’ stops when the end
     of the shortest is reached; ‘fold-right’ commences at the last
     element of the shortest.  Ie. elements past the length of the
     shortest are ignored in the other LSTs.  At least one LST must be
     non-circular.

     ‘fold’ should be preferred over ‘fold-right’ if the order of
     processing doesn’t matter, or can be arranged either way, since
     ‘fold’ is a little more efficient.

     The way ‘fold’ builds a result from iterating is quite general, it
     can do more than other iterations like say ‘map’ or ‘filter’.  The
     following for example removes adjacent duplicate elements from a
     list,

          (define (delete-adjacent-duplicates lst)
            (fold-right (lambda (elem ret)
                          (if (equal? elem (first ret))
                              ret
                              (cons elem ret)))
                        (list (last lst))
                        lst))
          (delete-adjacent-duplicates '(1 2 3 3 4 4 4 5))
          ⇒ (1 2 3 4 5)

     Clearly the same sort of thing can be done with a ‘for-each’ and a
     variable in which to build the result, but a self-contained PROC
     can be re-used in multiple contexts, where a ‘for-each’ would have
     to be written out each time.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pair-fold proc init lst1 lst2 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: pair-fold-right proc init lst1 lst2 ...
     The same as ‘fold’ and ‘fold-right’, but apply PROC to the pairs of
     the lists instead of the list elements.

 -- Scheme Procedure: reduce proc default lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: reduce-right proc default lst
     ‘reduce’ is a variant of ‘fold’, where the first call to PROC is on
     two elements from LST, rather than one element and a given initial
     value.

     If LST is empty, ‘reduce’ returns DEFAULT (this is the only use for
     DEFAULT).  If LST has just one element then that’s the return
     value.  Otherwise PROC is called on the elements of LST.

     Each PROC call is ‘(PROC ELEM PREVIOUS)’, where ELEM is from LST
     (the second and subsequent elements of LST), and PREVIOUS is the
     return from the previous call to PROC.  The first element of LST is
     the PREVIOUS for the first call to PROC.

     For example, the following adds a list of numbers, the calls made
     to ‘+’ are shown.  (Of course ‘+’ accepts multiple arguments and
     can add a list directly, with ‘apply’.)

          (reduce + 0 '(5 6 7)) ⇒ 18

          (+ 6 5)  ⇒ 11
          (+ 7 11) ⇒ 18

     ‘reduce’ can be used instead of ‘fold’ where the INIT value is an
     “identity”, meaning a value which under PROC doesn’t change the
     result, in this case 0 is an identity since ‘(+ 5 0)’ is just 5.
     ‘reduce’ avoids that unnecessary call.

     ‘reduce-right’ is a similar variation on ‘fold-right’, working from
     the end (ie. the right) of LST.  The last element of LST is the
     PREVIOUS for the first call to PROC, and the ELEM values go from
     the second last.

     ‘reduce’ should be preferred over ‘reduce-right’ if the order of
     processing doesn’t matter, or can be arranged either way, since
     ‘reduce’ is a little more efficient.

 -- Scheme Procedure: unfold p f g seed [tail-gen]
     ‘unfold’ is defined as follows:

          (unfold p f g seed) =
             (if (p seed) (tail-gen seed)
                 (cons (f seed)
                       (unfold p f g (g seed))))

     P
          Determines when to stop unfolding.

     F
          Maps each seed value to the corresponding list element.

     G
          Maps each seed value to next seed value.

     SEED
          The state value for the unfold.

     TAIL-GEN
          Creates the tail of the list; defaults to ‘(lambda (x) '())’.

     G produces a series of seed values, which are mapped to list
     elements by F.  These elements are put into a list in left-to-right
     order, and P tells when to stop unfolding.

 -- Scheme Procedure: unfold-right p f g seed [tail]
     Construct a list with the following loop.

          (let lp ((seed seed) (lis tail))
             (if (p seed) lis
                 (lp (g seed)
                     (cons (f seed) lis))))

     P
          Determines when to stop unfolding.

     F
          Maps each seed value to the corresponding list element.

     G
          Maps each seed value to next seed value.

     SEED
          The state value for the unfold.

     TAIL
          The tail of the list; defaults to ‘'()’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: map f lst1 lst2 ...
     Map the procedure over the list(s) LST1, LST2, ... and return a
     list containing the results of the procedure applications.  This
     procedure is extended with respect to R5RS, because the argument
     lists may have different lengths.  The result list will have the
     same length as the shortest argument lists.  The order in which F
     will be applied to the list element(s) is not specified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: for-each f lst1 lst2 ...
     Apply the procedure F to each pair of corresponding elements of the
     list(s) LST1, LST2, ....  The return value is not specified.  This
     procedure is extended with respect to R5RS, because the argument
     lists may have different lengths.  The shortest argument list
     determines the number of times F is called.  F will be applied to
     the list elements in left-to-right order.

 -- Scheme Procedure: append-map f lst1 lst2 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: append-map! f lst1 lst2 ...
     Equivalent to

          (apply append (map f clist1 clist2 ...))

     and

          (apply append! (map f clist1 clist2 ...))

     Map F over the elements of the lists, just as in the ‘map’
     function.  However, the results of the applications are appended
     together to make the final result.  ‘append-map’ uses ‘append’ to
     append the results together; ‘append-map!’ uses ‘append!’.

     The dynamic order in which the various applications of F are made
     is not specified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: map! f lst1 lst2 ...
     Linear-update variant of ‘map’ – ‘map!’ is allowed, but not
     required, to alter the cons cells of LST1 to construct the result
     list.

     The dynamic order in which the various applications of F are made
     is not specified.  In the n-ary case, LST2, LST3, ... must have at
     least as many elements as LST1.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pair-for-each f lst1 lst2 ...
     Like ‘for-each’, but applies the procedure F to the pairs from
     which the argument lists are constructed, instead of the list
     elements.  The return value is not specified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: filter-map f lst1 lst2 ...
     Like ‘map’, but only results from the applications of F which are
     true are saved in the result list.

### 7.5.3.6 Filtering and Partitioning
..................................

Filtering means to collect all elements from a list which satisfy a
specific condition.  Partitioning a list means to make two groups of
list elements, one which contains the elements satisfying a condition,
and the other for the elements which don’t.

   The ‘filter’ and ‘filter!’ functions are implemented in the Guile
core, *Note* List Modification::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: partition pred lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: partition! pred lst
     Split LST into those elements which do and don’t satisfy the
     predicate PRED.

     The return is two values (*note* Multiple Values::), the first being
     a list of all elements from LST which satisfy PRED, the second a
     list of those which do not.

     The elements in the result lists are in the same order as in LST
     but the order in which the calls ‘(PRED elem)’ are made on the list
     elements is unspecified.

     ‘partition’ does not change LST, but one of the returned lists may
     share a tail with it.  ‘partition!’ may modify LST to construct its
     return.

 -- Scheme Procedure: remove pred lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: remove! pred lst
     Return a list containing all elements from LST which do not satisfy
     the predicate PRED.  The elements in the result list have the same
     order as in LST.  The order in which PRED is applied to the list
     elements is not specified.

     ‘remove!’ is allowed, but not required to modify the structure of
     the input list.

### 7.5.3.7 Searching
.................

The procedures for searching elements in lists either accept a predicate
or a comparison object for determining which elements are to be
searched.

 -- Scheme Procedure: find pred lst
     Return the first element of LST that satisfies the predicate PRED
     and ‘#f’ if no such element is found.

 -- Scheme Procedure: find-tail pred lst
     Return the first pair of LST whose CAR satisfies the predicate PRED
     and ‘#f’ if no such element is found.

 -- Scheme Procedure: take-while pred lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: take-while! pred lst
     Return the longest initial prefix of LST whose elements all satisfy
     the predicate PRED.

     ‘take-while!’ is allowed, but not required to modify the input list
     while producing the result.

 -- Scheme Procedure: drop-while pred lst
     Drop the longest initial prefix of LST whose elements all satisfy
     the predicate PRED.

 -- Scheme Procedure: span pred lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: span! pred lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: break pred lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: break! pred lst
     ‘span’ splits the list LST into the longest initial prefix whose
     elements all satisfy the predicate PRED, and the remaining tail.
     ‘break’ inverts the sense of the predicate.

     ‘span!’ and ‘break!’ are allowed, but not required to modify the
     structure of the input list LST in order to produce the result.

     Note that the name ‘break’ conflicts with the ‘break’ binding
     established by ‘while’ (*note* while do::).  Applications wanting to
     use ‘break’ from within a ‘while’ loop will need to make a new
     define under a different name.

 -- Scheme Procedure: any pred lst1 lst2 ...
     Test whether any set of elements from LST1 LST2 ... satisfies PRED.
     If so, the return value is the return value from the successful
     PRED call, or if not, the return value is ‘#f’.

     If there are n list arguments, then PRED must be a predicate taking
     n arguments.  Each PRED call is ‘(PRED ELEM1 ELEM2 ... )’ taking an
     element from each LST.  The calls are made successively for the
     first, second, etc.  elements of the lists, stopping when PRED
     returns non-‘#f’, or when the end of the shortest list is reached.

     The PRED call on the last set of elements (i.e., when the end of
     the shortest list has been reached), if that point is reached, is a
     tail call.

 -- Scheme Procedure: every pred lst1 lst2 ...
     Test whether every set of elements from LST1 LST2 ... satisfies
     PRED.  If so, the return value is the return from the final PRED
     call, or if not, the return value is ‘#f’.

     If there are n list arguments, then PRED must be a predicate taking
     n arguments.  Each PRED call is ‘(PRED ELEM1 ELEM2 ...)’ taking an
     element from each LST.  The calls are made successively for the
     first, second, etc.  elements of the lists, stopping if PRED
     returns ‘#f’, or when the end of any of the lists is reached.

     The PRED call on the last set of elements (i.e., when the end of
     the shortest list has been reached) is a tail call.

     If one of LST1 LST2 ...is empty then no calls to PRED are made, and
     the return value is ‘#t’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-index pred lst1 lst2 ...
     Return the index of the first set of elements, one from each of
     LST1 LST2 ..., which satisfies PRED.

     PRED is called as ‘(ELEM1 ELEM2 ...)’.  Searching stops when the
     end of the shortest LST is reached.  The return index starts from 0
     for the first set of elements.  If no set of elements pass, then
     the return value is ‘#f’.

          (list-index odd? '(2 4 6 9))      ⇒ 3
          (list-index = '(1 2 3) '(3 1 2))  ⇒ #f

 -- Scheme Procedure: member x lst [=]
     Return the first sublist of LST whose CAR is equal to X.  If X does
     not appear in LST, return ‘#f’.

     Equality is determined by ‘equal?’, or by the equality predicate =
     if given.  = is called ‘(= X elem)’, ie. with the given X first, so
     for example to find the first element greater than 5,

          (member 5 '(3 5 1 7 2 9) <) ⇒ (7 2 9)

     This version of ‘member’ extends the core ‘member’ (*note* List
     Searching::) by accepting an equality predicate.

### 7.5.3.8 Deleting
................

 -- Scheme Procedure: delete x lst [=]
 -- Scheme Procedure: delete! x lst [=]
     Return a list containing the elements of LST but with those equal
     to X deleted.  The returned elements will be in the same order as
     they were in LST.

     Equality is determined by the = predicate, or ‘equal?’ if not
     given.  An equality call is made just once for each element, but
     the order in which the calls are made on the elements is
     unspecified.

     The equality calls are always ‘(= x elem)’, ie. the given X is
     first.  This means for instance elements greater than 5 can be
     deleted with ‘(delete 5 lst <)’.

     ‘delete’ does not modify LST, but the return might share a common
     tail with LST.  ‘delete!’ may modify the structure of LST to
     construct its return.

     These functions extend the core ‘delete’ and ‘delete!’ (*note* List
     Modification::) in accepting an equality predicate.  See also
     ‘lset-difference’ (*note* SRFI-1 Set Operations::) for deleting
     multiple elements from a list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: delete-duplicates lst [=]
 -- Scheme Procedure: delete-duplicates! lst [=]
     Return a list containing the elements of LST but without
     duplicates.

     When elements are equal, only the first in LST is retained.  Equal
     elements can be anywhere in LST, they don’t have to be adjacent.
     The returned list will have the retained elements in the same order
     as they were in LST.

     Equality is determined by the = predicate, or ‘equal?’ if not
     given.  Calls ‘(= x y)’ are made with element X being before Y in
     LST.  A call is made at most once for each combination, but the
     sequence of the calls across the elements is unspecified.

     ‘delete-duplicates’ does not modify LST, but the return might share
     a common tail with LST.  ‘delete-duplicates!’ may modify the
     structure of LST to construct its return.

     In the worst case, this is an O(N^2) algorithm because it must
     check each element against all those preceding it.  For long lists
     it is more efficient to sort and then compare only adjacent
     elements.

### 7.5.3.9 Association Lists
.........................

Association lists are described in detail in section *note* Association
Lists::.  The present section only documents the additional procedures
for dealing with association lists defined by SRFI-1.

 -- Scheme Procedure: assoc key alist [=]
     Return the pair from ALIST which matches KEY.  This extends the
     core ‘assoc’ (*note* Retrieving Alist Entries::) by taking an
     optional = comparison procedure.

     The default comparison is ‘equal?’.  If an = parameter is given
     it’s called ‘(= KEY ALISTCAR)’, i.e. the given target KEY is the
     first argument, and a ‘car’ from ALIST is second.

     For example a case-insensitive string lookup,

          (assoc "yy" '(("XX" . 1) ("YY" . 2)) string-ci=?)
          ⇒ ("YY" . 2)

 -- Scheme Procedure: alist-cons key datum alist
     Cons a new association KEY and DATUM onto ALIST and return the
     result.  This is equivalent to

          (cons (cons KEY DATUM) ALIST)

     ‘acons’ (*note* Adding or Setting Alist Entries::) in the Guile core
     does the same thing.

 -- Scheme Procedure: alist-copy alist
     Return a newly allocated copy of ALIST, that means that the spine
     of the list as well as the pairs are copied.

 -- Scheme Procedure: alist-delete key alist [=]
 -- Scheme Procedure: alist-delete! key alist [=]
     Return a list containing the elements of ALIST but with those
     elements whose keys are equal to KEY deleted.  The returned
     elements will be in the same order as they were in ALIST.

     Equality is determined by the = predicate, or ‘equal?’ if not
     given.  The order in which elements are tested is unspecified, but
     each equality call is made ‘(= key alistkey)’, i.e. the given KEY
     parameter is first and the key from ALIST second.  This means for
     instance all associations with a key greater than 5 can be removed
     with ‘(alist-delete 5 alist <)’.

     ‘alist-delete’ does not modify ALIST, but the return might share a
     common tail with ALIST.  ‘alist-delete!’ may modify the list
     structure of ALIST to construct its return.

### 7.5.3.10 Set Operations on Lists
................................

Lists can be used to represent sets of objects.  The procedures in this
section operate on such lists as sets.

   Note that lists are not an efficient way to implement large sets.
The procedures here typically take time MxN when operating on M and N
element lists.  Other data structures like trees, bitsets (*note* Bit
Vectors::) or hash tables (*note* Hash Tables::) are faster.

   All these procedures take an equality predicate as the first
argument.  This predicate is used for testing the objects in the list
sets for sameness.  This predicate must be consistent with ‘eq?’ (*note*
Equality::) in the sense that if two list elements are ‘eq?’ then they
must also be equal under the predicate.  This simply means a given
object must be equal to itself.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lset<= = list ...
     Return ‘#t’ if each list is a subset of the one following it.
     I.e., LIST1 is a subset of LIST2, LIST2 is a subset of LIST3, etc.,
     for as many lists as given.  If only one list or no lists are
     given, the return value is ‘#t’.

     A list X is a subset of Y if each element of X is equal to some
     element in Y.  Elements are compared using the given = procedure,
     called as ‘(= xelem yelem)’.

          (lset<= eq?)                      ⇒ #t
          (lset<= eqv? '(1 2 3) '(1))       ⇒ #f
          (lset<= eqv? '(1 3 2) '(4 3 1 2)) ⇒ #t

 -- Scheme Procedure: lset= = list ...
     Return ‘#t’ if all argument lists are set-equal.  LIST1 is compared
     to LIST2, LIST2 to LIST3, etc., for as many lists as given.  If
     only one list or no lists are given, the return value is ‘#t’.

     Two lists X and Y are set-equal if each element of X is equal to
     some element of Y and conversely each element of Y is equal to some
     element of X.  The order of the elements in the lists doesn’t
     matter.  Element equality is determined with the given = procedure,
     called as ‘(= xelem yelem)’, but exactly which calls are made is
     unspecified.

          (lset= eq?)                      ⇒ #t
          (lset= eqv? '(1 2 3) '(3 2 1))   ⇒ #t
          (lset= string-ci=? '("a" "A" "b") '("B" "b" "a")) ⇒ #t

 -- Scheme Procedure: lset-adjoin = list elem ...
     Add to LIST any of the given ELEMs not already in the list.  ELEMs
     are ‘cons’ed onto the start of LIST (so the return value shares a
     common tail with LIST), but the order that the ELEMs are added is
     unspecified.

     The given = procedure is used for comparing elements, called as ‘(=
     listelem elem)’, i.e., the second argument is one of the given ELEM
     parameters.

          (lset-adjoin eqv? '(1 2 3) 4 1 5) ⇒ (5 4 1 2 3)

 -- Scheme Procedure: lset-union = list ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: lset-union! = list ...
     Return the union of the argument list sets.  The result is built by
     taking the union of LIST1 and LIST2, then the union of that with
     LIST3, etc., for as many lists as given.  For one list argument
     that list itself is the result, for no list arguments the result is
     the empty list.

     The union of two lists X and Y is formed as follows.  If X is empty
     then the result is Y.  Otherwise start with X as the result and
     consider each Y element (from first to last).  A Y element not
     equal to something already in the result is ‘cons’ed onto the
     result.

     The given = procedure is used for comparing elements, called as ‘(=
     relem yelem)’.  The first argument is from the result accumulated
     so far, and the second is from the list being union-ed in.  But
     exactly which calls are made is otherwise unspecified.

     Notice that duplicate elements in LIST1 (or the first non-empty
     list) are preserved, but that repeated elements in subsequent lists
     are only added once.

          (lset-union eqv?)                          ⇒ ()
          (lset-union eqv? '(1 2 3))                 ⇒ (1 2 3)
          (lset-union eqv? '(1 2 1 3) '(2 4 5) '(5)) ⇒ (5 4 1 2 1 3)

     ‘lset-union’ doesn’t change the given lists but the result may
     share a tail with the first non-empty list.  ‘lset-union!’ can
     modify all of the given lists to form the result.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lset-intersection = list1 list2 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: lset-intersection! = list1 list2 ...
     Return the intersection of LIST1 with the other argument lists,
     meaning those elements of LIST1 which are also in all of LIST2 etc.
     For one list argument, just that list is returned.

     The test for an element of LIST1 to be in the return is simply that
     it’s equal to some element in each of LIST2 etc.  Notice this means
     an element appearing twice in LIST1 but only once in each of LIST2
     etc will go into the return twice.  The return has its elements in
     the same order as they were in LIST1.

     The given = procedure is used for comparing elements, called as ‘(=
     elem1 elemN)’.  The first argument is from LIST1 and the second is
     from one of the subsequent lists.  But exactly which calls are made
     and in what order is unspecified.

          (lset-intersection eqv? '(x y))                        ⇒ (x y)
          (lset-intersection eqv? '(1 2 3) '(4 3 2))             ⇒ (2 3)
          (lset-intersection eqv? '(1 1 2 2) '(1 2) '(2 1) '(2)) ⇒ (2 2)

     The return from ‘lset-intersection’ may share a tail with LIST1.
     ‘lset-intersection!’ may modify LIST1 to form its result.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lset-difference = list1 list2 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: lset-difference! = list1 list2 ...
     Return LIST1 with any elements in LIST2, LIST3 etc removed (ie.
     subtracted).  For one list argument, just that list is returned.

     The given = procedure is used for comparing elements, called as ‘(=
     elem1 elemN)’.  The first argument is from LIST1 and the second
     from one of the subsequent lists.  But exactly which calls are made
     and in what order is unspecified.

          (lset-difference eqv? '(x y))             ⇒ (x y)
          (lset-difference eqv? '(1 2 3) '(3 1))    ⇒ (2)
          (lset-difference eqv? '(1 2 3) '(3) '(2)) ⇒ (1)

     The return from ‘lset-difference’ may share a tail with LIST1.
     ‘lset-difference!’ may modify LIST1 to form its result.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lset-diff+intersection = list1 list2 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: lset-diff+intersection! = list1 list2 ...
     Return two values (*note* Multiple Values::), the difference and
     intersection of the argument lists as per ‘lset-difference’ and
     ‘lset-intersection’ above.

     For two list arguments this partitions LIST1 into those elements of
     LIST1 which are in LIST2 and not in LIST2.  (But for more than two
     arguments there can be elements of LIST1 which are neither part of
     the difference nor the intersection.)

     One of the return values from ‘lset-diff+intersection’ may share a
     tail with LIST1.  ‘lset-diff+intersection!’ may modify LIST1 to
     form its results.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lset-xor = list ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: lset-xor! = list ...
     Return an XOR of the argument lists.  For two lists this means
     those elements which are in exactly one of the lists.  For more
     than two lists it means those elements which appear in an odd
     number of the lists.

     To be precise, the XOR of two lists X and Y is formed by taking
     those elements of X not equal to any element of Y, plus those
     elements of Y not equal to any element of X.  Equality is
     determined with the given = procedure, called as ‘(= e1 e2)’.  One
     argument is from X and the other from Y, but which way around is
     unspecified.  Exactly which calls are made is also unspecified, as
     is the order of the elements in the result.

          (lset-xor eqv? '(x y))             ⇒ (x y)
          (lset-xor eqv? '(1 2 3) '(4 3 2))  ⇒ (4 1)

     The return from ‘lset-xor’ may share a tail with one of the list
     arguments.  ‘lset-xor!’ may modify LIST1 to form its result.

7.5.4 SRFI-2 - and-let*
-----------------------

The following syntax can be obtained with

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-2))

   or alternatively

     (use-modules (ice-9 and-let-star))

 -- library syntax: and-let* (clause ...) body ...
     A combination of ‘and’ and ‘let*’.

     Each CLAUSE is evaluated in turn, and if ‘#f’ is obtained then
     evaluation stops and ‘#f’ is returned.  If all are non-‘#f’ then
     BODY is evaluated and the last form gives the return value, or if
     BODY is empty then the result is ‘#t’.  Each CLAUSE should be one
     of the following,

     ‘(symbol expr)’
          Evaluate EXPR, check for ‘#f’, and bind it to SYMBOL.  Like
          ‘let*’, that binding is available to subsequent clauses.
     ‘(expr)’
          Evaluate EXPR and check for ‘#f’.
     ‘symbol’
          Get the value bound to SYMBOL and check for ‘#f’.

     Notice that ‘(expr)’ has an “extra” pair of parentheses, for
     instance ‘((eq? x y))’.  One way to remember this is to imagine the
     ‘symbol’ in ‘(symbol expr)’ is omitted.

     ‘and-let*’ is good for calculations where a ‘#f’ value means
     termination, but where a non-‘#f’ value is going to be needed in
     subsequent expressions.

     The following illustrates this, it returns text between brackets
     ‘[...]’ in a string, or ‘#f’ if there are no such brackets (ie.
     either ‘string-index’ gives ‘#f’).

          (define (extract-brackets str)
            (and-let* ((start (string-index str #\[))
                       (end   (string-index str #\] start)))
              (substring str (1+ start) end)))

     The following shows plain variables and expressions tested too.
     ‘diagnostic-levels’ is taken to be an alist associating a
     diagnostic type with a level.  ‘str’ is printed only if the type is
     known and its level is high enough.

          (define (show-diagnostic type str)
            (and-let* (want-diagnostics
                       (level (assq-ref diagnostic-levels type))
                       ((>= level current-diagnostic-level)))
              (display str)))

     The advantage of ‘and-let*’ is that an extended sequence of
     expressions and tests doesn’t require lots of nesting as would
     arise from separate ‘and’ and ‘let*’, or from ‘cond’ with ‘=>’.

7.5.5 SRFI-4 - Homogeneous numeric vector datatypes
---------------------------------------------------

SRFI-4 provides an interface to uniform numeric vectors: vectors whose
elements are all of a single numeric type.  Guile offers uniform numeric
vectors for signed and unsigned 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit
integers, two sizes of floating point values, and, as an extension to
SRFI-4, complex floating-point numbers of these two sizes.

   The standard SRFI-4 procedures and data types may be included via
loading the appropriate module:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-4))

   This module is currently a part of the default Guile environment, but
it is a good practice to explicitly import the module.  In the future,
using SRFI-4 procedures without importing the SRFI-4 module will cause a
deprecation message to be printed.  (Of course, one may call the C
functions at any time.  Would that C had modules!)

* Menu:

* SRFI-4 Overview::             The warp and weft of uniform numeric vectors.
* SRFI-4 API::                  Uniform vectors, from Scheme and from C.
* SRFI-4 and Bytevectors::      SRFI-4 vectors are backed by bytevectors.

### 7.5.5.1 SRFI-4 - Overview
.........................

Uniform numeric vectors can be useful since they consume less memory
than the non-uniform, general vectors.  Also, since the types they can
store correspond directly to C types, it is easier to work with them
efficiently on a low level.  Consider image processing as an example,
where you want to apply a filter to some image.  While you could store
the pixels of an image in a general vector and write a general
convolution function, things are much more efficient with uniform
vectors: the convolution function knows that all pixels are unsigned
8-bit values (say), and can use a very tight inner loop.

   This is implemented in Scheme by having the compiler notice calls to
the SRFI-4 accessors, and inline them to appropriate compiled code.
From C you have access to the raw array; functions for efficiently
working with uniform numeric vectors from C are listed at the end of
this section.

   Uniform numeric vectors are the special case of one dimensional
uniform numeric arrays.

   There are 12 standard kinds of uniform numeric vectors, and they all
have their own complement of constructors, accessors, and so on.
Procedures that operate on a specific kind of uniform numeric vector
have a “tag” in their name, indicating the element type.

u8
     unsigned 8-bit integers

s8
     signed 8-bit integers

u16
     unsigned 16-bit integers

s16
     signed 16-bit integers

u32
     unsigned 32-bit integers

s32
     signed 32-bit integers

u64
     unsigned 64-bit integers

s64
     signed 64-bit integers

f32
     the C type ‘float’

f64
     the C type ‘double’

   In addition, Guile supports uniform arrays of complex numbers, with
the nonstandard tags:

c32
     complex numbers in rectangular form with the real and imaginary
     part being a ‘float’

c64
     complex numbers in rectangular form with the real and imaginary
     part being a ‘double’

   The external representation (ie. read syntax) for these vectors is
similar to normal Scheme vectors, but with an additional tag from the
tables above indicating the vector’s type.  For example,

     #u16(1 2 3)
     #f64(3.1415 2.71)

   Note that the read syntax for floating-point here conflicts with ‘#f’
for false.  In Standard Scheme one can write ‘(1 #f3)’ for a three
element list ‘(1 #f 3)’, but for Guile ‘(1 #f3)’ is invalid.  ‘(1 #f 3)’
is almost certainly what one should write anyway to make the intention
clear, so this is rarely a problem.

### 7.5.5.3 SRFI-4 - Relation to bytevectors
........................................

Guile implements SRFI-4 vectors using bytevectors (*note* Bytevectors::).
Often when you have a numeric vector, you end up wanting to write its
bytes somewhere, or have access to the underlying bytes, or read in
bytes from somewhere else.  Bytevectors are very good at this sort of
thing.  But the SRFI-4 APIs are nicer to use when doing
number-crunching, because they are addressed by element and not by byte.

   So as a compromise, Guile allows all bytevector functions to operate
on numeric vectors.  They address the underlying bytes in the native
endianness, as one would expect.

   Following the same reasoning, that it’s just bytes underneath, Guile
also allows uniform vectors of a given type to be accessed as if they
were of any type.  One can fill a u32vector, and access its elements
with u8vector-ref.  One can use f64vector-ref on bytevectors.  It’s all
the same to Guile.

   In this way, uniform numeric vectors may be written to and read from
input/output ports using the procedures that operate on bytevectors.

   *Note* Bytevectors::, for more information.

Guile defines some useful extensions to SRFI-4, which are not available
in the default Guile environment.  They may be imported by loading the
extensions module:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-4 gnu))

 -- Scheme Procedure: srfi-4-vector-type-size obj
     Return the size, in bytes, of each element of SRFI-4 vector OBJ.

     Copy a block of elements from SRC to DST, both of which must be
     vectors of the indicated type, starting in DST at AT and starting
     in SRC at START and ending at END.  It is an error for DST to have
     a length less than AT + (END - START).  AT and START default to 0
     and END defaults to the length of SRC.

     If source and destination overlap, copying takes place as if the
     source is first copied into a temporary vector and then into the
     destination.

     between START and END.  START defaults to 0 and END defaults to the
     length of SRC.

7.5.6 SRFI-6 - Basic String Ports
---------------------------------

SRFI-6 defines the procedures ‘open-input-string’, ‘open-output-string’
and ‘get-output-string’.  These procedures are included in the Guile
core, so using this module does not make any difference at the moment.
But it is possible that support for SRFI-6 will be factored out of the
core library in the future, so using this module does not hurt, after
all.

7.5.9 SRFI-10 - Hash-Comma Reader Extension
-------------------------------------------

This SRFI implements a reader extension ‘#,()’ called hash-comma.  It
allows the reader to give new kinds of objects, for use both in data and
as constants or literals in source code.  This feature is available with

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-10))

The new read syntax is of the form

     #,(TAG ARG...)

where TAG is a symbol and the ARGs are objects taken as parameters.
TAGs are registered with the following procedure.

 -- Scheme Procedure: define-reader-ctor tag proc
     Register PROC as the constructor for a hash-comma read syntax
     starting with symbol TAG, i.e. #,(TAG arg...).  PROC is called with
     the given arguments ‘(PROC arg...)’ and the object it returns is
     the result of the read.

For example, a syntax giving a list of N copies of an object.

     (define-reader-ctor 'repeat
       (lambda (obj reps)
         (make-list reps obj)))

     (display '#,(repeat 99 3))
     ⊣ (99 99 99)

   Notice the quote ’ when the #,( ) is used.  The ‘repeat’ handler
returns a list and the program must quote to use it literally, the same
as any other list.  Ie.

     (display '#,(repeat 99 3))
     ⇒
     (display '(99 99 99))

   When a handler returns an object which is self-evaluating, like a
number or a string, then there’s no need for quoting, just as there’s no
need when giving those directly as literals.  For example an addition,

     (define-reader-ctor 'sum
       (lambda (x y)
         (+ x y)))
     (display #,(sum 123 456)) ⊣ 579

   Once ‘(srfi srfi-10)’ has loaded, #,() is available globally, there’s
no need to use ‘(srfi srfi-10)’ in later modules.  Similarly the tags
registered are global and can be used anywhere once registered.

   We do not recommend #,() reader extensions, however, and for three
reasons.

   First of all, this SRFI is not modular: the tag is matched by name,
not as an identifier within a scope.  Defining a reader extension in one
part of a program can thus affect unrelated parts of a program because
the tag is not scoped.

   Secondly, reader extensions can be hard to manage from a time
perspective: when does the reader extension take effect?  *Note* Eval
When::, for more discussion.

   Finally, reader extensions can easily produce objects that can’t be
reified to an object file by the compiler.  For example if you define a
reader extension that makes a hash table (*note* Hash Tables::), then it
will work fine when run with the interpreter, and you think you have a
neat hack.  But then if you try to compile your program, after wrangling
with the ‘eval-when’ concerns mentioned above, the compiler will carp
that it doesn’t know how to serialize a hash table to disk.

   In the specific case of hash tables, it would be possible for Guile
to know how to pack hash tables into compiled files, but this doesn’t
work in general.  What if the object you produce is an instance of a
record type?  Guile would then have to serialize the record type to disk
too, and then what happens if the program independently loads the code
that defines the record type?  Does it define the same type or a
different type?  Guile’s record types are nominal, not structural, so
the answer is not clear at all.

   For all of these reasons we recommend macros over reader extensions.
Macros fulfill many of the same needs while preserving modular
composition, and their interaction with ‘eval-when’ is well-known.  If
you need brevity, instead use ‘read-hash-extend’ and make your reader
extension expand to a macro invocation.  In that way we preserve scoping

7.5.10 SRFI-11 - let-values
---------------------------

This module implements the binding forms for multiple values
‘let-values’ and ‘let*-values’.  These forms are similar to ‘let’ and
‘let*’ (*note* Local Bindings::), but they support binding of the values
returned by multiple-valued expressions.

   Write ‘(use-modules (srfi srfi-11))’ to make the bindings available.

     (let-values (((x y) (values 1 2))
                  ((z f) (values 3 4)))
        (+ x y z f))
     ⇒
     10

   ‘let-values’ performs all bindings simultaneously, which means that
no expression in the binding clauses may refer to variables bound in the
same clause list.  ‘let*-values’, on the other hand, performs the
bindings sequentially, just like ‘let*’ does for single-valued
expressions.

7.5.14 SRFI-17 - Generalized set!
---------------------------------

This SRFI implements a generalized ‘set!’, allowing some “referencing”
functions to be used as the target location of a ‘set!’.  This feature
is available from

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-17))

For example ‘vector-ref’ is extended so that

     (set! (vector-ref vec idx) new-value)

is equivalent to

     (vector-set! vec idx new-value)

   The idea is that a ‘vector-ref’ expression identifies a location,
which may be either fetched or stored.  The same form is used for the
location in both cases, encouraging visual clarity.  This is similar to
the idea of an “lvalue” in C.

   The mechanism for this kind of ‘set!’ is in the Guile core (*note*
Procedures with Setters::).  This module adds definitions of the
following functions as procedures with setters, allowing them to be
targets of a ‘set!’,

     car, cdr, caar, cadr, cdar, cddr, caaar, caadr, cadar, caddr,
     cdaar, cdadr, cddar, cdddr, caaaar, caaadr, caadar, caaddr, cadaar,
     cadadr, caddar, cadddr, cdaaar, cdaadr, cdadar, cdaddr, cddaar,
     cddadr, cdddar, cddddr

     string-ref, vector-ref

   The SRFI specifies ‘setter’ (*note* Procedures with Setters::) as a
procedure with setter, allowing the setter for a procedure to be
changed, eg. ‘(set! (setter foo) my-new-setter-handler)’.  Currently
Guile does not implement this, a setter can only be specified on
creation (‘getter-with-setter’ below).

 -- Function: getter-with-setter
     The same as the Guile core ‘make-procedure-with-setter’ (*note*
     Procedures with Setters::).

7.5.15 SRFI-18 - Multithreading support
---------------------------------------

This is an implementation of the SRFI-18 threading and synchronization
library.  The functions and variables described here are provided by

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-18))

   SRFI-18 defines facilities for threads, mutexes, condition variables,
time, and exception handling.  Because these facilities are at a higher
level than Guile’s primitives, they are implemented as a layer on top of
what Guile provides.  In particular this means that a Guile mutex is not
a SRFI-18 mutex, and a Guile thread is not a SRFI-18 thread, and so on.
Guile provides a set of primitives and SRFI-18 is one of the systems
built in terms of those primitives.

### 7.5.15.1 SRFI-18 Threads
........................

Threads created by SRFI-18 differ in two ways from threads created by
Guile’s built-in thread functions.  First, a thread created by SRFI-18
‘make-thread’ begins in a blocked state and will not start execution
until ‘thread-start!’ is called on it.  Second, SRFI-18 threads are
constructed with a top-level exception handler that captures any
exceptions that are thrown on thread exit.

   SRFI-18 threads are disjoint from Guile’s primitive threads.  *Note*
Threads::, for more on Guile’s primitive facility.

 -- Function: current-thread
     Returns the thread that called this function.  This is the same
     procedure as the same-named built-in procedure ‘current-thread’
     (*note* Threads::).

 -- Function: thread? obj
     Returns ‘#t’ if OBJ is a thread, ‘#f’ otherwise.  This is the same
     procedure as the same-named built-in procedure ‘thread?’ (*note*
     Threads::).

 -- Function: make-thread thunk [name]
     Call ‘thunk’ in a new thread and with a new dynamic state,
     returning the new thread and optionally assigning it the object
     name NAME, which may be any Scheme object.

     Note that the name ‘make-thread’ conflicts with the ‘(ice-9
     threads)’ function ‘make-thread’.  Applications wanting to use both
     of these functions will need to refer to them by different names.

 -- Function: thread-name thread
     Returns the name assigned to THREAD at the time of its creation, or
     ‘#f’ if it was not given a name.

 -- Function: thread-specific thread
 -- Function: thread-specific-set! thread obj
     Get or set the “object-specific” property of THREAD.  In Guile’s
     implementation of SRFI-18, this value is stored as an object
     property, and will be ‘#f’ if not set.

 -- Function: thread-start! thread
     Unblocks THREAD and allows it to begin execution if it has not done
     so already.

 -- Function: thread-yield!
     If one or more threads are waiting to execute, calling
     ‘thread-yield!’ forces an immediate context switch to one of them.
     Otherwise, ‘thread-yield!’ has no effect.  ‘thread-yield!’ behaves
     identically to the Guile built-in function ‘yield’.

 -- Function: thread-sleep! timeout
     The current thread waits until the point specified by the time
     object TIMEOUT is reached (*note* SRFI-18 Time::).  This blocks the
     thread only if TIMEOUT represents a point in the future.  it is an
     error for TIMEOUT to be ‘#f’.

 -- Function: thread-terminate! thread
     Causes an abnormal termination of THREAD.  If THREAD is not already
     terminated, all mutexes owned by THREAD become unlocked/abandoned.
     If THREAD is the current thread, ‘thread-terminate!’ does not
     return.  Otherwise ‘thread-terminate!’ returns an unspecified
     value; the termination of THREAD will occur before
     ‘thread-terminate!’ returns.  Subsequent attempts to join on THREAD
     will cause a “terminated thread exception” to be raised.

     ‘thread-terminate!’ is compatible with the thread cancellation
     procedures in the core threads API (*note* Threads::) in that if a
     cleanup handler has been installed for the target thread, it will
     be called before the thread exits and its return value (or
     exception, if any) will be stored for later retrieval via a call to
     ‘thread-join!’.

 -- Function: thread-join! thread [timeout [timeout-val]]
     Wait for THREAD to terminate and return its exit value.  When a
     time value TIMEOUT is given, it specifies a point in time where the
     waiting should be aborted.  When the waiting is aborted,
     TIMEOUT-VAL is returned if it is specified; otherwise, a
     ‘join-timeout-exception’ exception is raised (*note* SRFI-18
     Exceptions::).  Exceptions may also be raised if the thread was
     terminated by a call to ‘thread-terminate!’
     (‘terminated-thread-exception’ will be raised) or if the thread
     exited by raising an exception that was handled by the top-level
     exception handler (‘uncaught-exception’ will be raised; the
     original exception can be retrieved using
     ‘uncaught-exception-reason’).

### 7.5.15.2 SRFI-18 Mutexes
........................

SRFI-18 mutexes are disjoint from Guile’s primitive mutexes.  *Note*
Mutexes and Condition Variables::, for more on Guile’s primitive
facility.

 -- Function: make-mutex [name]
     Returns a new mutex, optionally assigning it the object name NAME,
     which may be any Scheme object.  The returned mutex will be created
     with the configuration described above.

 -- Function: mutex-name mutex
     Returns the name assigned to MUTEX at the time of its creation, or
     ‘#f’ if it was not given a name.

 -- Function: mutex-specific mutex
     Return the “object-specific” property of MUTEX, or ‘#f’ if none is
     set.

 -- Function: mutex-specific-set! mutex obj
     Set the “object-specific” property of MUTEX.

 -- Function: mutex-state mutex
     Returns information about the state of MUTEX.  Possible values are:
        • thread T: the mutex is in the locked/owned state and thread T
          is the owner of the mutex
        • symbol ‘not-owned’: the mutex is in the locked/not-owned state
        • symbol ‘abandoned’: the mutex is in the unlocked/abandoned
          state
        • symbol ‘not-abandoned’: the mutex is in the
          unlocked/not-abandoned state

 -- Function: mutex-lock! mutex [timeout [thread]]
     Lock MUTEX, optionally specifying a time object TIMEOUT after which
     to abort the lock attempt and a thread THREAD giving a new owner
     for MUTEX different than the current thread.

 -- Function: mutex-unlock! mutex [condition-variable [timeout]]
     Unlock MUTEX, optionally specifying a condition variable
     CONDITION-VARIABLE on which to wait, either indefinitely or,
     optionally, until the time object TIMEOUT has passed, to be
     signalled.

### 7.5.15.3 SRFI-18 Condition variables
....................................

SRFI-18 does not specify a “wait” function for condition variables.
Waiting on a condition variable can be simulated using the SRFI-18
‘mutex-unlock!’ function described in the previous section.

   SRFI-18 condition variables are disjoint from Guile’s primitive
condition variables.  *Note* Mutexes and Condition Variables::, for more
on Guile’s primitive facility.

 -- Function: condition-variable? obj
     Returns ‘#t’ if OBJ is a condition variable, ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Function: make-condition-variable [name]
     Returns a new condition variable, optionally assigning it the
     object name NAME, which may be any Scheme object.

 -- Function: condition-variable-name condition-variable
     Returns the name assigned to CONDITION-VARIABLE at the time of its
     creation, or ‘#f’ if it was not given a name.

 -- Function: condition-variable-specific condition-variable
     Return the “object-specific” property of CONDITION-VARIABLE, or
     ‘#f’ if none is set.

 -- Function: condition-variable-specific-set! condition-variable obj
     Set the “object-specific” property of CONDITION-VARIABLE.

 -- Function: condition-variable-signal! condition-variable
 -- Function: condition-variable-broadcast! condition-variable
     Wake up one thread that is waiting for CONDITION-VARIABLE, in the
     case of ‘condition-variable-signal!’, or all threads waiting for
     it, in the case of ‘condition-variable-broadcast!’.

### 7.5.15.4 SRFI-18 Time
.....................

The SRFI-18 time functions manipulate time in two formats: a “time
object” type that represents an absolute point in time in some
implementation-specific way; and the number of seconds since some
unspecified “epoch”.  In Guile’s implementation, the epoch is the Unix
epoch, 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970.

 -- Function: current-time
     Return the current time as a time object.  This procedure replaces
     the procedure of the same name in the core library, which returns
     the current time in seconds since the epoch.

 -- Function: time? obj
     Returns ‘#t’ if OBJ is a time object, ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Function: time->seconds time
 -- Function: seconds->time seconds
     Convert between time objects and numerical values representing the
     number of seconds since the epoch.  When converting from a time
     object to seconds, the return value is the number of seconds
     between TIME and the epoch.  When converting from seconds to a time
     object, the return value is a time object that represents a time
     SECONDS seconds after the epoch.

### 7.5.15.5 SRFI-18 Exceptions
...........................

SRFI-18 exceptions are identical to the exceptions provided by Guile’s
implementation of SRFI-34.  The behavior of exception handlers invoked
to handle exceptions thrown from SRFI-18 functions, however, differs
from the conventional behavior of SRFI-34 in that the continuation of
the handler is the same as that of the call to the function.  Handlers
are called in a tail-recursive manner; the exceptions do not “bubble
up”.

 -- Function: current-exception-handler
     Returns the current exception handler.

 -- Function: with-exception-handler handler thunk
     Installs HANDLER as the current exception handler and calls the
     procedure THUNK with no arguments, returning its value as the value
     of the exception.  HANDLER must be a procedure that accepts a
     single argument.  The current exception handler at the time this
     procedure is called will be restored after the call returns.

 -- Function: raise obj
     Raise OBJ as an exception.  This is the same procedure as the
     same-named procedure defined in SRFI 34.

 -- Function: join-timeout-exception? obj
     Returns ‘#t’ if OBJ is an exception raised as the result of
     performing a timed join on a thread that does not exit within the
     specified timeout, ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Function: abandoned-mutex-exception? obj
     Returns ‘#t’ if OBJ is an exception raised as the result of
     attempting to lock a mutex that has been abandoned by its owner
     thread, ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Function: terminated-thread-exception? obj
     Returns ‘#t’ if OBJ is an exception raised as the result of joining
     on a thread that exited as the result of a call to
     ‘thread-terminate!’.

 -- Function: uncaught-exception? obj
 -- Function: uncaught-exception-reason exc
     ‘uncaught-exception?’ returns ‘#t’ if OBJ is an exception thrown as
     the result of joining a thread that exited by raising an exception
     that was handled by the top-level exception handler installed by
     ‘make-thread’.  When this occurs, the original exception is
     preserved as part of the exception thrown by ‘thread-join!’ and can
     be accessed by calling ‘uncaught-exception-reason’ on that
     exception.  Note that because this exception-preservation mechanism
     is a side-effect of ‘make-thread’, joining on threads that exited
     as described above but were created by other means will not raise
     this ‘uncaught-exception’ error.

### 7.5.16.1 SRFI-19 Introduction
.............................

This module implements time and date representations and calculations,
in various time systems, including Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and
International Atomic Time (TAI).

   For those not familiar with these time systems, TAI is based on a
fixed length second derived from oscillations of certain atoms.  UTC
differs from TAI by an integral number of seconds, which is increased or
decreased at announced times to keep UTC aligned to a mean solar day
(the orbit and rotation of the earth are not quite constant).

   So far, only increases in the TAI <-> UTC difference have been
needed.  Such an increase is a “leap second”, an extra second of TAI
introduced at the end of a UTC day.  When working entirely within UTC
this is never seen, every day simply has 86400 seconds.  But when
converting from TAI to a UTC date, an extra 23:59:60 is present, where
normally a day would end at 23:59:59.  Effectively the UTC second from
23:59:59 to 00:00:00 has taken two TAI seconds.

   In the current implementation, the system clock is assumed to be UTC,
and a table of leap seconds in the code converts to TAI. See comments in
‘srfi-19.scm’ for how to update this table.

   Also, for those not familiar with the terminology, a “Julian Day”
represents a point in time as a real number of days since
-4713-11-24T12:00:00Z, i.e. midday UT on 24 November 4714 BC in the
proleptic Gregorian calendar (1 January 4713 BC in the proleptic Julian
calendar).

   A “Modified Julian Day” represents a point in time as a real number
of days since 1858-11-17T00:00:00Z, i.e. midnight UT on Wednesday 17
November AD 1858.  That time is julian day 2400000.5.

### 7.5.16.2 SRFI-19 Time
.....................

A “time” object has type, seconds and nanoseconds fields representing a
point in time starting from some epoch.  This is an arbitrary point in
time, not just a time of day.  Although times are represented in
nanoseconds, the actual resolution may be lower.

   The following variables hold the possible time types.  For instance
‘(current-time time-process)’ would give the current CPU process time.

 -- Variable: time-utc
     Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

 -- Variable: time-tai
     International Atomic Time (TAI).

 -- Variable: time-monotonic
     Monotonic time, meaning a monotonically increasing time starting
     from an unspecified epoch.

     Note that in the current implementation ‘time-monotonic’ is the
     same as ‘time-tai’, and unfortunately is therefore affected by
     adjustments to the system clock.  Perhaps this will change in the
     future.

 -- Variable: time-duration
     A duration, meaning simply a difference between two times.

 -- Variable: time-process
     CPU time spent in the current process, starting from when the
     process began.

 -- Variable: time-thread
     CPU time spent in the current thread.  Not currently implemented.


 -- Function: time? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a time object, or ‘#f’ if not.

 -- Function: make-time type nanoseconds seconds
     Create a time object with the given TYPE, SECONDS and NANOSECONDS.

 -- Function: time-type time
 -- Function: time-nanosecond time
 -- Function: time-second time
 -- Function: set-time-type! time type
 -- Function: set-time-nanosecond! time nsec
 -- Function: set-time-second! time sec
     Get or set the type, seconds or nanoseconds fields of a time
     object.

     ‘set-time-type!’ merely changes the field, it doesn’t convert the
     time value.  For conversions, see *note* SRFI-19 Time/Date
     conversions::.

 -- Function: copy-time time
     Return a new time object, which is a copy of the given TIME.

 -- Function: current-time [type]
     Return the current time of the given TYPE.  The default TYPE is
     ‘time-utc’.

     Note that the name ‘current-time’ conflicts with the Guile core
     ‘current-time’ function (*note* Time::) as well as the SRFI-18
     ‘current-time’ function (*note* SRFI-18 Time::).  Applications
     wanting to use more than one of these functions will need to refer
     to them by different names.

 -- Function: time-resolution [type]
     Return the resolution, in nanoseconds, of the given time TYPE.  The
     default TYPE is ‘time-utc’.

 -- Function: time<=? t1 t2
 -- Function: time<? t1 t2
 -- Function: time=? t1 t2
 -- Function: time>=? t1 t2
 -- Function: time>? t1 t2
     Return ‘#t’ or ‘#f’ according to the respective relation between
     time objects T1 and T2.  T1 and T2 must be the same time type.

 -- Function: time-difference t1 t2
 -- Function: time-difference! t1 t2
     Return a time object of type ‘time-duration’ representing the
     period between T1 and T2.  T1 and T2 must be the same time type.

     ‘time-difference’ returns a new time object, ‘time-difference!’ may
     modify T1 to form its return.

 -- Function: add-duration time duration
 -- Function: add-duration! time duration
 -- Function: subtract-duration time duration
 -- Function: subtract-duration! time duration
     Return a time object which is TIME with the given DURATION added or
     subtracted.  DURATION must be a time object of type
     ‘time-duration’.

     ‘add-duration’ and ‘subtract-duration’ return a new time object.
     ‘add-duration!’ and ‘subtract-duration!’ may modify the given TIME
     to form their return.

### 7.5.16.3 SRFI-19 Date
.....................

A “date” object represents a date in the Gregorian calendar and a time
of day on that date in some timezone.

   The fields are year, month, day, hour, minute, second, nanoseconds
and timezone.  A date object is immutable, its fields can be read but
they cannot be modified once the object is created.

   Historically, the Gregorian calendar was only used from the latter
part of the year 1582 onwards, and not until even later in many
countries.  Prior to that most countries used the Julian calendar.
SRFI-19 does not deal with the Julian calendar at all, and so does not
reflect this historical calendar reform.  Instead it projects the
Gregorian calendar back proleptically as far as necessary.  When dealing
with historical data, especially prior to the British Empire’s adoption
of the Gregorian calendar in 1752, one should be mindful of which
calendar is used in each context, and apply non-SRFI-19 facilities to
convert where necessary.

 -- Function: date? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a date object, or ‘#f’ if not.

 -- Function: make-date nsecs seconds minutes hours date month year
          zone-offset
     Create a new date object.

 -- Function: date-nanosecond date
     Nanoseconds, 0 to 999999999.

 -- Function: date-second date
     Seconds, 0 to 59, or 60 for a leap second.  60 is never seen when
     working entirely within UTC, it’s only when converting to or from
     TAI.

 -- Function: date-minute date
     Minutes, 0 to 59.

 -- Function: date-hour date
     Hour, 0 to 23.

 -- Function: date-day date
     Day of the month, 1 to 31 (or less, according to the month).

 -- Function: date-month date
     Month, 1 to 12.

 -- Function: date-year date
     Year, eg. 2003.  Dates B.C. are negative, eg. -46 is 46 B.C. There
     is no year 0, year -1 is followed by year 1.

 -- Function: date-zone-offset date
     Time zone, an integer number of seconds east of Greenwich.

 -- Function: date-year-day date
     Day of the year, starting from 1 for 1st January.

 -- Function: date-week-day date
     Day of the week, starting from 0 for Sunday.

 -- Function: date-week-number date dstartw
     Week of the year, ignoring a first partial week.  DSTARTW is the
     day of the week which is taken to start a week, 0 for Sunday, 1 for
     Monday, etc.

 -- Function: current-date [tz-offset]
     Return a date object representing the current date/time, in UTC
     offset by TZ-OFFSET.  TZ-OFFSET is seconds east of Greenwich and
     defaults to the local timezone.

 -- Function: current-julian-day
     Return the current Julian Day.

 -- Function: current-modified-julian-day
     Return the current Modified Julian Day.

     Convert between dates, times and days of the respective types.  For
     instance ‘time-tai->time-utc’ accepts a TIME object of type
     ‘time-tai’ and returns an object of type ‘time-utc’.

     The ‘!’ variants may modify their TIME argument to form their
     return.  The plain functions create a new object.

     For conversions to dates, TZ-OFFSET is seconds east of Greenwich.
     The default is the local timezone, at the given time, as provided
     by the system, using ‘localtime’ (*note* Time::).

     On 32-bit systems, ‘localtime’ is limited to a 32-bit ‘time_t’, so
     a default TZ-OFFSET is only available for times between Dec 1901
     and Jan 2038.  For prior dates an application might like to use the
     value in 1902, though some locations have zone changes prior to
     that.  For future dates an application might like to assume today’s
     rules extend indefinitely.  But for correct daylight savings
     transitions it will be necessary to take an offset for the same day
     and time but a year in range and which has the same starting
     weekday and same leap/non-leap (to support rules like last Sunday
     in October).

### 7.5.16.5 SRFI-19 Date to string
...............................

 -- Function: date->string date [format]
     Convert a date to a string under the control of a format.  FORMAT
     should be a string containing ‘~’ escapes, which will be expanded
     as per the following conversion table.  The default FORMAT is ‘~c’,
     a locale-dependent date and time.

     Many of these conversion characters are the same as POSIX
     ‘strftime’ (*note* Time::), but there are some extras and some
     variations.

     ~~     literal ~
     ~a     locale abbreviated weekday, eg. ‘Sun’
     ~A     locale full weekday, eg. ‘Sunday’
     ~b     locale abbreviated month, eg. ‘Jan’
     ~B     locale full month, eg. ‘January’
     ~c     locale date and time, eg.

            ‘999999999’
     ~p     locale AM or PM
     ~r     time, 12 hour clock, ‘~I:~M:~S ~p’
     ~s     number of full seconds since “the epoch” in UTC

            ‘53’
     ~w     day of week, 0 for Sunday, ‘0’ to ‘6’
     ~W     week of year, Monday first day of week, ‘00’ to
            ‘52’
            
     ~y     year, two digits, ‘00’ to ‘99’
     ~Y     year, full, eg. ‘2003’
     ~z     time zone, RFC-822 style
     ~Z     time zone symbol (not currently implemented)
     ~1     ISO-8601 date, ‘~Y-~m-~d’
     ~2     ISO-8601 time+zone, ‘~H:~M:~S~z’
     ~3     ISO-8601 time, ‘~H:~M:~S’
     ~4     ISO-8601 date/time+zone, ‘~Y-~m-~dT~H:~M:~S~z’
     ~5     ISO-8601 date/time, ‘~Y-~m-~dT~H:~M:~S’

   Conversions ‘~D’, ‘~x’ and ‘~X’ are not currently described here,
since the specification and reference implementation differ.

   Conversion is locale-dependent on systems that support it (*note*
Accessing Locale Information::).  *Note* ‘setlocale’: Locales, for
information on how to change the current locale.

### 7.5.16.6 SRFI-19 String to date
...............................

 -- Function: string->date input template
     Convert an INPUT string to a date under the control of a TEMPLATE
     string.  Return a newly created date object.

     Literal characters in TEMPLATE must match characters in INPUT and
     ‘~’ escapes must match the input forms described in the table
     below.  “Skip to” means characters up to one of the given type are
     ignored, or “no skip” for no skipping.  “Read” is what’s then read,
     and “Set” is the field affected in the date object.

     For example ‘~Y’ skips input characters until a digit is reached,
     at which point it expects a year and stores that to the year field
     of the date.

            Skip to            Read                        Set

     Notice that the weekday matching forms don’t affect the date object
     returned, instead the weekday will be derived from the day, month
     and year.

     Conversion is locale-dependent on systems that support it (*note*
     Accessing Locale Information::).  *Note* ‘setlocale’: Locales, for
     information on how to change the current locale.

7.5.17 SRFI-23 - Error Reporting
--------------------------------

The SRFI-23 ‘error’ procedure is always available.


File: guile.info,  Node: SRFI-26,  Next: SRFI-27,  Prev: SRFI-23,  Up: SRFI Support

7.5.18 SRFI-26 - specializing parameters
----------------------------------------

This SRFI provides a syntax for conveniently specializing selected
parameters of a function.  It can be used with,

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-26))

 -- library syntax: cut slot1 slot2 ...
 -- library syntax: cute slot1 slot2 ...
     Return a new procedure which will make a call (SLOT1 SLOT2 ...) but
     with selected parameters specialized to given expressions.

     An example will illustrate the idea.  The following is a
     specialization of ‘write’, sending output to ‘my-output-port’,

          (cut write <> my-output-port)
          ⇒
          (lambda (obj) (write obj my-output-port))

     The special symbol ‘<>’ indicates a slot to be filled by an
     argument to the new procedure.  ‘my-output-port’ on the other hand
     is an expression to be evaluated and passed, ie. it specializes the
     behaviour of ‘write’.

     <>
          A slot to be filled by an argument from the created procedure.
          Arguments are assigned to ‘<>’ slots in the order they appear
          in the ‘cut’ form, there’s no way to re-arrange arguments.

          The first argument to ‘cut’ is usually a procedure (or
          expression giving a procedure), but ‘<>’ is allowed there too.
          For example,

               (cut <> 1 2 3)
               ⇒
               (lambda (proc) (proc 1 2 3))

     <...>
          A slot to be filled by all remaining arguments from the new
          procedure.  This can only occur at the end of a ‘cut’ form.

          For example, a procedure taking a variable number of arguments
          like ‘max’ but in addition enforcing a lower bound,

               (define my-lower-bound 123)

               (cut max my-lower-bound <...>)
               ⇒
               (lambda arglist (apply max my-lower-bound arglist))

     For ‘cut’ the specializing expressions are evaluated each time the
     new procedure is called.  For ‘cute’ they’re evaluated just once,
     when the new procedure is created.  The name ‘cute’ stands for
     “‘cut’ with evaluated arguments”.  In all cases the evaluations
     take place in an unspecified order.

     The following illustrates the difference between ‘cut’ and ‘cute’,

          (cut format <> "the time is ~s" (current-time))
          ⇒
          (lambda (port) (format port "the time is ~s" (current-time)))

          (cute format <> "the time is ~s" (current-time))
          ⇒
          (let ((val (current-time)))
            (lambda (port) (format port "the time is ~s" val))

     (There’s no provision for a mixture of ‘cut’ and ‘cute’ where some
     expressions would be evaluated every time but others evaluated only
     once.)

     ‘cut’ is really just a shorthand for the sort of ‘lambda’ forms
     shown in the above examples.  But notice ‘cut’ avoids the need to
     name unspecialized parameters, and is more compact.  Use in
     functional programming style or just with ‘map’, ‘for-each’ or
     similar is typical.

          (map (cut * 2 <>) '(1 2 3 4))

          (for-each (cut write <> my-port) my-list)

7.5.19 SRFI-27 - Sources of Random Bits
---------------------------------------

This subsection is based on the specification of SRFI-27
(http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-27/srfi-27.html) written by Sebastian
Egner.

   This SRFI provides access to a (pseudo) random number generator; for
Guile’s built-in random number facilities, which SRFI-27 is implemented
upon, *Note* Random::.  With SRFI-27, random numbers are obtained from a
_random source_, which encapsulates a random number generation algorithm
and its state.

* Menu:

* SRFI-27 Default Random Source::    Obtaining random numbers
* SRFI-27 Random Sources::           Creating and manipulating random sources
* SRFI-27 Random Number Generators:: Obtaining random number generators

### 7.5.19.1 The Default Random Source
..................................

 -- Function: random-integer n
     Return a random number between zero (inclusive) and N (exclusive),
     using the default random source.  The numbers returned have a
     uniform distribution.

 -- Function: random-real
     Return a random number in (0,1), using the default random source.
     The numbers returned have a uniform distribution.

 -- Function: default-random-source
     A random source from which ‘random-integer’ and ‘random-real’ have
     been derived using ‘random-source-make-integers’ and
     ‘random-source-make-reals’ (*note* SRFI-27 Random Number
     Generators:: for those procedures).  Note that an assignment to
     ‘default-random-source’ does not change ‘random-integer’ or
     ‘random-real’; it is also strongly recommended not to assign a new
     value.

### 7.5.19.2 Random Sources
.......................

 -- Function: make-random-source
     Create a new random source.  The stream of random numbers obtained
     from each random source created by this procedure will be
     identical, unless its state is changed by one of the procedures
     below.

 -- Function: random-source? object
     Tests whether OBJECT is a random source.  Random sources are a
     disjoint type.

 -- Function: random-source-randomize! source
     Attempt to set the state of the random source to a truly random
     value.  The current implementation uses a seed based on the current
     system time.

 -- Function: random-source-pseudo-randomize! source i j
     Changes the state of the random source s into the initial state of
     the (I, J)-th independent random source, where I and J are
     non-negative integers.  This procedure provides a mechanism to
     obtain a large number of independent random sources (usually all
     derived from the same backbone generator), indexed by two integers.
     In contrast to ‘random-source-randomize!’, this procedure is
     entirely deterministic.

   The state associated with a random state can be obtained an
reinstated with the following procedures:

 -- Function: random-source-state-ref source
 -- Function: random-source-state-set! source state
     Get and set the state of a random source.  No assumptions should be
     made about the nature of the state object, besides it having an
     external representation (i.e. it can be passed to ‘write’ and
     subsequently ‘read’ back).

### 7.5.19.3 Obtaining random number generator procedures
.....................................................

 -- Function: random-source-make-integers source
     Obtains a procedure to generate random integers using the random
     source SOURCE.  The returned procedure takes a single argument N,
     which must be a positive integer, and returns the next uniformly
     distributed random integer from the interval {0, ..., N-1} by
     advancing the state of SOURCE.

     If an application obtains and uses several generators for the same
     random source SOURCE, a call to any of these generators advances
     the state of SOURCE.  Hence, the generators do not produce the same
     sequence of random integers each but rather share a state.  This
     also holds for all other types of generators derived from a fixed
     random sources.

     While the SRFI text specifies that “Implementations that support
     concurrency make sure that the state of a generator is properly
     advanced”, this is currently not the case in Guile’s implementation
     of SRFI-27, as it would cause a severe performance penalty.  So in
     multi-threaded programs, you either must perform locking on random
     sources shared between threads yourself, or use different random
     sources for multiple threads.

 -- Function: random-source-make-reals source
 -- Function: random-source-make-reals source unit
     Obtains a procedure to generate random real numbers 0 < x < 1 using
     the random source SOURCE.  The procedure rand is called without
     arguments.

     The optional parameter UNIT determines the type of numbers being
     produced by the returned procedure and the quantization of the
     output.  UNIT must be a number such that 0 < UNIT < 1.  The numbers
     created by the returned procedure are of the same numerical type as
     UNIT and the potential output values are spaced by at most UNIT.
     One can imagine rand to create numbers as X * UNIT where X is a
     random integer in {1, ..., floor(1/unit)-1}.  Note, however, that
     this need not be the way the values are actually created and that
     the actual resolution of rand can be much higher than unit.  In
     case UNIT is absent it defaults to a reasonably small value
     (related to the width of the mantissa of an efficient number
     format).

7.5.20 SRFI-28 - Basic Format Strings
-------------------------------------

SRFI-28 provides a basic ‘format’ procedure that provides only the ‘~a’,
‘~s’, ‘~%’, and ‘~~’ format specifiers.  You can import this procedure
by using:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-28))

 -- Scheme Procedure: format message arg ...
     Returns a formatted message, using MESSAGE as the format string,
     which can contain the following format specifiers:

     ‘~a’
          Insert the textual representation of the next ARG, as if
          printed by ‘display’.

     ‘~s’
          Insert the textual representation of the next ARG, as if
          printed by ‘write’.

     ‘~%’
          Insert a newline.

     ‘~~’
          Insert a tilde.

     This procedure is the same as calling ‘simple-format’ (*note* Simple
     Output::) with ‘#f’ as the destination.

7.5.22 SRFI-31 - A special form ‘rec’ for recursive evaluation
--------------------------------------------------------------

SRFI-31 defines a special form that can be used to create
self-referential expressions more conveniently.  The syntax is as
follows:

     <rec expression> --> (rec <variable> <expression>)
     <rec expression> --> (rec (<variable>+) <body>)

   The first syntax can be used to create self-referential expressions,
for example:

       guile> (define tmp (rec ones (cons 1 (delay ones))))

   The second syntax can be used to create anonymous recursive
functions:

       guile> (define tmp (rec (display-n item n)
                            (if (positive? n)
                                (begin (display n) (display-n (- n 1))))))
       guile> (tmp 42 3)
       424242

7.5.23 SRFI-34 - Exception handling for programs
------------------------------------------------

Guile provides an implementation of SRFI-34’s exception handling
mechanisms (http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-34/srfi-34.html) as an
alternative to its own built-in mechanisms (*note* Exceptions::).  It can
be made available as follows:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-34))

   *Note* Raising and Handling Exceptions::, for more on
‘with-exception-handler’ and ‘raise’ (known as ‘raise-exception’ in core
Guile).

   SRFI-34’s ‘guard’ form is syntactic sugar over
‘with-exception-handler’:

 -- Syntax: guard (var clause ...) body ...
     Evaluate BODY with an exception handler that binds the raised
     object to VAR and within the scope of that binding evaluates
     CLAUSE... as if they were the clauses of a cond expression.  That
     implicit cond expression is evaluated with the continuation and
     dynamic environment of the guard expression.

     If every CLAUSE’s test evaluates to false and there is no ‘else’
     clause, then ‘raise’ is re-invoked on the raised object within the
     dynamic environment of the original call to ‘raise’ except that the
     current exception handler is that of the ‘guard’ expression.

7.5.24 SRFI-35 - Conditions
---------------------------

SRFI-35 (http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-35/srfi-35.html) defines
“conditions”, a data structure akin to records designed to convey
information about exceptional conditions between parts of a program.  It
is normally used in conjunction with SRFI-34’s ‘raise’:

     (raise (condition (&message
                         (message "An error occurred"))))

   Users can define “condition types” containing arbitrary information.
Condition types may inherit from one another.  This allows the part of
the program that handles (or “catches”) conditions to get accurate
information about the exceptional condition that arose.

   SRFI-35 conditions are made available using:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-35))

   The procedures available to manipulate condition types are the
following:

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-condition-type id parent field-names
     Return a new condition type named ID, inheriting from PARENT, and
     with the fields whose names are listed in FIELD-NAMES.  FIELD-NAMES
     must be a list of symbols and must not contain names already used
     by PARENT or one of its supertypes.

 -- Scheme Procedure: condition-type? obj
     Return true if OBJ is a condition type.

   Conditions can be created and accessed with the following procedures:

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-condition type . field+value
     Return a new condition of type TYPE with fields initialized as
     specified by FIELD+VALUE, a sequence of field names (symbols) and
     values as in the following example:

          (let ((&ct (make-condition-type 'foo &condition '(a b c))))
            (make-condition &ct 'a 1 'b 2 'c 3))

     Note that all fields of TYPE and its supertypes must be specified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-compound-condition condition1 condition2 ...
     Return a new compound condition composed of CONDITION1 CONDITION2
     ....  The returned condition has the type of each condition of
     condition1 condition2 ... (per ‘condition-has-type?’).

 -- Scheme Procedure: condition-has-type? c type
     Return true if condition C has type TYPE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: condition-ref c field-name
     Return the value of the field named FIELD-NAME from condition C.

     If C is a compound condition and several underlying condition types
     contain a field named FIELD-NAME, then the value of the first such
     field is returned, using the order in which conditions were passed
     to ‘make-compound-condition’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: extract-condition c type
     Return a condition of condition type TYPE with the field values
     specified by C.

     If C is a compound condition, extract the field values from the
     subcondition belonging to TYPE that appeared first in the call to
     ‘make-compound-condition’ that created the condition.

   Convenience macros are also available to create condition types and
conditions.

 -- library syntax: define-condition-type type supertype predicate
          field-spec...
     Define a new condition type named TYPE that inherits from
     SUPERTYPE.  In addition, bind PREDICATE to a type predicate that
     returns true when passed a condition of type TYPE or any of its
     subtypes.  FIELD-SPEC must have the form ‘(field accessor)’ where
     FIELD is the name of field of TYPE and ACCESSOR is the name of a
     procedure to access field FIELD in conditions of type TYPE.

     The example below defines condition type ‘&foo’, inheriting from
     ‘&condition’ with fields ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’:

          (define-condition-type &foo &condition
            foo-condition?
            (a  foo-a)
            (b  foo-b)
            (c  foo-c))

 -- library syntax: condition type-field-binding1 type-field-binding2
          ...
     Return a new condition or compound condition, initialized according
     to TYPE-FIELD-BINDING1 TYPE-FIELD-BINDING2 ....  Each
     TYPE-FIELD-BINDING must have the form ‘(type field-specs...)’,
     where TYPE is the name of a variable bound to a condition type;
     each FIELD-SPEC must have the form ‘(field-name value)’ where
     FIELD-NAME is a symbol denoting the field being initialized to
     VALUE.  As for ‘make-condition’, all fields must be specified.

     The following example returns a simple condition:

          (condition (&message (message "An error occurred")))

     The one below returns a compound condition:

          (condition (&message (message "An error occurred"))
                     (&serious))

   Finally, SRFI-35 defines a several standard condition types.

 -- Variable: &condition
     This condition type is the root of all condition types.  It has no
     fields.

 -- Variable: &message
     A condition type that carries a message describing the nature of
     the condition to humans.

 -- Scheme Procedure: message-condition? c
     Return true if C is of type ‘&message’ or one of its subtypes.

 -- Scheme Procedure: condition-message c
     Return the message associated with message condition C.

 -- Variable: &serious
     This type describes conditions serious enough that they cannot
     safely be ignored.  It has no fields.

 -- Scheme Procedure: serious-condition? c
     Return true if C is of type ‘&serious’ or one of its subtypes.

 -- Variable: &error
     This condition describes errors, typically caused by something that
     has gone wrong in the interaction of the program with the external
     world or the user.

 -- Scheme Procedure: error? c
     Return true if C is of type ‘&error’ or one of its subtypes.

   As an implementation note, condition objects in Guile are the same as
“exception objects”.  *Note* Exception Objects::.  The ‘&condition’,
‘&serious’, and ‘&error’ condition types are known in core Guile as
‘&exception’, ‘&error’, and ‘&external-error’, respectively.

7.5.25 SRFI-37 - args-fold
--------------------------

This is a processor for GNU ‘getopt_long’-style program arguments.  It
provides an alternative, less declarative interface than ‘getopt-long’
in ‘(ice-9 getopt-long)’ (*note* The (ice-9 getopt-long) Module:
getopt-long.).  Unlike ‘getopt-long’, it supports repeated options and
any number of short and long names per option.  Access it with:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-37))

   SRFI-37 principally provides an ‘option’ type and the ‘args-fold’
function.  To use the library, create a set of options with ‘option’ and
use it as a specification for invoking ‘args-fold’.

   Here is an example of a simple argument processor for the typical
‘--version’ and ‘--help’ options, which returns a backwards list of
files given on the command line:

     (args-fold (cdr (program-arguments))
                (let ((display-and-exit-proc
                       (lambda (msg)
                         (lambda (opt name arg loads)
                           (display msg) (quit)))))
                  (list (option '(#\v "version") #f #f
                                (display-and-exit-proc "Foo version 42.0\n"))
                        (option '(#\h "help") #f #f
                                (display-and-exit-proc
                                 "Usage: foo scheme-file ..."))))
                (lambda (opt name arg loads)
                  (error "Unrecognized option `~A'" name))
                (lambda (op loads) (cons op loads))
                '())

 -- Scheme Procedure: option names required-arg? optional-arg? processor
     Return an object that specifies a single kind of program option.

     NAMES is a list of command-line option names, and should consist of
     characters for traditional ‘getopt’ short options and strings for
     ‘getopt_long’-style long options.

     REQUIRED-ARG? and OPTIONAL-ARG? are mutually exclusive; one or both
     must be ‘#f’.  If REQUIRED-ARG?, the option must be followed by an
     argument on the command line, such as ‘--opt=value’ for long
     options, or an error will be signalled.  If OPTIONAL-ARG?, an
     argument will be taken if available.

     PROCESSOR is a procedure that takes at least 3 arguments, called
     when ‘args-fold’ encounters the option: the containing option
     object, the name used on the command line, and the argument given
     for the option (or ‘#f’ if none).  The rest of the arguments are
     ‘args-fold’ “seeds”, and the PROCESSOR should return seeds as well.

 -- Scheme Procedure: option-names opt
 -- Scheme Procedure: option-required-arg? opt
 -- Scheme Procedure: option-optional-arg? opt
 -- Scheme Procedure: option-processor opt
     Return the specified field of OPT, an option object, as described
     above for ‘option’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: args-fold args options unrecognized-option-proc
          operand-proc seed ...
     Process ARGS, a list of program arguments such as that returned by
     ‘(cdr (program-arguments))’, in order against OPTIONS, a list of
     option objects as described above.  All functions called take the
     “seeds”, or the last multiple-values as multiple arguments,
     starting with SEED ..., and must return the new seeds.  Return the
     final seeds.

     Call ‘unrecognized-option-proc’, which is like an option object’s
     processor, for any options not found in OPTIONS.

     Call ‘operand-proc’ with any items on the command line that are not
     named options.  This includes arguments after ‘--’.  It is called
     with the argument in question, as well as the seeds.

7.5.26 SRFI-38 - External Representation for Data With Shared Structure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This subsection is based on the specification of SRFI-38
(http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-38/srfi-38.html) written by Ray
Dillinger.

   This SRFI creates an alternative external representation for data
written and read using ‘write-with-shared-structure’ and
‘read-with-shared-structure’.  It is identical to the grammar for
external representation for data written and read with ‘write’ and
‘read’ given in section 7 of R5RS, except that the single production

     <datum> --> <simple datum> | <compound datum>

   is replaced by the following five productions:

     <datum> --> <defining datum> | <nondefining datum> | <defined datum>
     <defining datum> -->  #<indexnum>=<nondefining datum>
     <defined datum> --> #<indexnum>#
     <nondefining datum> --> <simple datum> | <compound datum>
     <indexnum> --> <digit 10>+

 -- Scheme procedure: write-with-shared-structure obj
 -- Scheme procedure: write-with-shared-structure obj port
 -- Scheme procedure: write-with-shared-structure obj port optarg

     Writes an external representation of OBJ to the given port.
     Strings that appear in the written representation are enclosed in
     doublequotes, and within those strings backslash and doublequote
     characters are escaped by backslashes.  Character objects are
     written using the ‘#\’ notation.

     Objects which denote locations rather than values (cons cells,
     vectors, and non-zero-length strings in R5RS scheme; also Guile’s
     structs, bytevectors and ports and hash-tables), if they appear at
     more than one point in the data being written, are preceded by
     ‘#N=’ the first time they are written and replaced by ‘#N#’ all
     subsequent times they are written, where N is a natural number used
     to identify that particular object.  If objects which denote
     locations occur only once in the structure, then
     ‘write-with-shared-structure’ must produce the same external
     representation for those objects as ‘write’.

     ‘write-with-shared-structure’ terminates in finite time and
     produces a finite representation when writing finite data.

     ‘write-with-shared-structure’ returns an unspecified value.  The
     PORT argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the
     value returned by ‘(current-output-port)’.  The OPTARG argument may
     also be omitted.  If present, its effects on the output and return
     value are unspecified but ‘write-with-shared-structure’ must still
     write a representation that can be read by
     ‘read-with-shared-structure’.  Some implementations may wish to use
     OPTARG to specify formatting conventions, numeric radixes, or
     return values.  Guile’s implementation ignores OPTARG.

     For example, the code

          (begin (define a (cons 'val1 'val2))
                 (set-cdr! a a)
                 (write-with-shared-structure a))

     should produce the output ‘#1=(val1 . #1#)’.  This shows a cons
     cell whose ‘cdr’ contains itself.

 -- Scheme procedure: read-with-shared-structure
 -- Scheme procedure: read-with-shared-structure port

     ‘read-with-shared-structure’ converts the external representations
     of Scheme objects produced by ‘write-with-shared-structure’ into
     Scheme objects.  That is, it is a parser for the nonterminal
     ‘<datum>’ in the augmented external representation grammar defined
     above.  ‘read-with-shared-structure’ returns the next object
     parsable from the given input port, updating PORT to point to the
     first character past the end of the external representation of the
     object.

     If an end-of-file is encountered in the input before any characters
     are found that can begin an object, then an end-of-file object is
     returned.  The port remains open, and further attempts to read it
     (by ‘read-with-shared-structure’ or ‘read’ will also return an
     end-of-file object.  If an end of file is encountered after the
     beginning of an object’s external representation, but the external
     representation is incomplete and therefore not parsable, an error
     is signalled.

     The PORT argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the
     value returned by ‘(current-input-port)’.  It is an error to read
     from a closed port.

7.5.27 SRFI-39 - Parameters
---------------------------

This SRFI adds support for dynamically-scoped parameters.  SRFI 39 is
implemented in the Guile core; there’s no module needed to get SRFI-39
itself.  Parameters are documented in *note* Parameters::.

   This module does export one extra function: ‘with-parameters*’.  This
is a Guile-specific addition to the SRFI, similar to the core
‘with-fluids*’ (*note* Fluids and Dynamic States::).

 -- Function: with-parameters* param-list value-list thunk
     Establish a new dynamic scope, as per ‘parameterize’ above, taking
     parameters from PARAM-LIST and corresponding values from
     VALUE-LIST.  A call ‘(THUNK)’ is made in the new scope and the
     result from that THUNK is the return from ‘with-parameters*’.

7.5.28 SRFI-41 - Streams
------------------------

This subsection is based on the specification of SRFI-41
(http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-41/srfi-41.html) by Philip L. Bewig.

This SRFI implements streams, sometimes called lazy lists, a sequential
data structure containing elements computed only on demand.  A stream is
either null or is a pair with a stream in its cdr.  Since elements of a
stream are computed only when accessed, streams can be infinite.  Once
computed, the value of a stream element is cached in case it is needed
again.  SRFI-41 can be made available with:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-41))

### 7.5.28.1 SRFI-41 Stream Fundamentals
....................................

SRFI-41 Streams are based on two mutually-recursive abstract data types:
An object of the ‘stream’ abstract data type is a promise that, when
forced, is either ‘stream-null’ or is an object of type ‘stream-pair’.
An object of the ‘stream-pair’ abstract data type contains a
‘stream-car’ and a ‘stream-cdr’, which must be a ‘stream’.  The
essential feature of streams is the systematic suspensions of the
recursive promises between the two data types.

   The object stored in the ‘stream-car’ of a ‘stream-pair’ is a promise
that is forced the first time the ‘stream-car’ is accessed; its value is
cached in case it is needed again.  The object may have any type, and
different stream elements may have different types.  If the ‘stream-car’
is never accessed, the object stored there is never evaluated.
Likewise, the ‘stream-cdr’ is a promise to return a stream, and is only
forced on demand.

### 7.5.28.2 SRFI-41 Stream Primitives
..................................

This library provides eight operators: constructors for ‘stream-null’
and ‘stream-pair’s, type predicates for streams and the two kinds of
streams, accessors for both fields of a ‘stream-pair’, and a lambda that
creates procedures that return streams.

 -- Scheme Variable: stream-null
     A promise that, when forced, is a single object, distinguishable
     from all other objects, that represents the null stream.
     ‘stream-null’ is immutable and unique.

 -- Scheme Syntax: stream-cons object-expr stream-expr
     Creates a newly-allocated stream containing a promise that, when
     forced, is a ‘stream-pair’ with OBJECT-EXPR in its ‘stream-car’ and
     STREAM-EXPR in its ‘stream-cdr’.  Neither OBJECT-EXPR nor
     STREAM-EXPR is evaluated when ‘stream-cons’ is called.

     Once created, a ‘stream-pair’ is immutable; there is no
     ‘stream-set-car!’ or ‘stream-set-cdr!’ that modifies an existing
     stream-pair.  There is no dotted-pair or improper stream as with
     lists.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream? object
     Returns true if OBJECT is a stream, otherwise returns false.  If
     OBJECT is a stream, its promise will not be forced.  If ‘(stream?
     obj)’ returns true, then one of ‘(stream-null? obj)’ or
     ‘(stream-pair? obj)’ will return true and the other will return
     false.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-null? object
     Returns true if OBJECT is the distinguished null stream, otherwise
     returns false.  If OBJECT is a stream, its promise will be forced.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-pair? object
     Returns true if OBJECT is a ‘stream-pair’ constructed by
     ‘stream-cons’, otherwise returns false.  If OBJECT is a stream, its
     promise will be forced.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-car stream
     Returns the object stored in the ‘stream-car’ of STREAM.  An error
     is signalled if the argument is not a ‘stream-pair’.  This causes
     the OBJECT-EXPR passed to ‘stream-cons’ to be evaluated if it had
     not yet been; the value is cached in case it is needed again.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-cdr stream
     Returns the stream stored in the ‘stream-cdr’ of STREAM.  An error
     is signalled if the argument is not a ‘stream-pair’.

 -- Scheme Syntax: stream-lambda formals body ...
     Creates a procedure that returns a promise to evaluate the BODY of
     the procedure.  The last BODY expression to be evaluated must yield
     a stream.  As with normal ‘lambda’, FORMALS may be a single
     variable name, in which case all the formal arguments are collected
     into a single list, or a list of variable names, which may be null
     if there are no arguments, proper if there are an exact number of
     arguments, or dotted if a fixed number of arguments is to be
     followed by zero or more arguments collected into a list.  BODY
     must contain at least one expression, and may contain internal
     definitions preceding any expressions to be evaluated.

     (define strm123
       (stream-cons 1
         (stream-cons 2
           (stream-cons 3
             stream-null))))

     (stream-car strm123) ⇒ 1
     (stream-car (stream-cdr strm123) ⇒ 2

     (stream-pair?
       (stream-cdr
         (stream-cons (/ 1 0) stream-null))) ⇒ #f

     (stream? (list 1 2 3)) ⇒ #f

     (define iter
       (stream-lambda (f x)
         (stream-cons x (iter f (f x)))))

     (define nats (iter (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 0))

     (stream-car (stream-cdr nats)) ⇒ 1

     (define stream-add
       (stream-lambda (s1 s2)
         (stream-cons
           (+ (stream-car s1) (stream-car s2))
           (stream-add (stream-cdr s1)
                       (stream-cdr s2)))))

     (define evens (stream-add nats nats))

     (stream-car evens) ⇒ 0
     (stream-car (stream-cdr evens)) ⇒ 2
     (stream-car (stream-cdr (stream-cdr evens))) ⇒ 4

### 7.5.28.3 SRFI-41 Stream Library
...............................

 -- Scheme Syntax: define-stream (name args ...) body ...
     Creates a procedure that returns a stream, and may appear anywhere
     a normal ‘define’ may appear, including as an internal definition.
     It may contain internal definitions of its own.  The defined
     procedure takes arguments in the same way as ‘stream-lambda’.
     ‘define-stream’ is syntactic sugar on ‘stream-lambda’; see also
     ‘stream-let’, which is also a sugaring of ‘stream-lambda’.

     A simple version of ‘stream-map’ that takes only a single input
     stream calls itself recursively:

          (define-stream (stream-map proc strm)
            (if (stream-null? strm)
                stream-null
                (stream-cons
                  (proc (stream-car strm))
                  (stream-map proc (stream-cdr strm))))))

 -- Scheme Procedure: list->stream list
     Returns a newly-allocated stream containing the elements from LIST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port->stream [port]
     Returns a newly-allocated stream containing in its elements the
     characters on the port.  If PORT is not given it defaults to the
     current input port.  The returned stream has finite length and is
     terminated by ‘stream-null’.

     It looks like one use of ‘port->stream’ would be this:

          (define s ;wrong!
            (with-input-from-file filename
              (lambda () (port->stream))))

     But that fails, because ‘with-input-from-file’ is eager, and closes
     the input port prematurely, before the first character is read.  To
     read a file into a stream, say:

          (define-stream (file->stream filename)
            (let ((p (open-input-file filename)))
              (stream-let loop ((c (read-char p)))
                (if (eof-object? c)
                    (begin (close-input-port p)
                           stream-null)
                    (stream-cons c
                      (loop (read-char p)))))))

 -- Scheme Syntax: stream object-expr ...
     Creates a newly-allocated stream containing in its elements the
     objects, in order.  The OBJECT-EXPRs are evaluated when they are
     accessed, not when the stream is created.  If no objects are given,
     as in (stream), the null stream is returned.  See also
     ‘list->stream’.

          (define strm123 (stream 1 2 3))

          ; (/ 1 0) not evaluated when stream is created
          (define s (stream 1 (/ 1 0) -1))

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream->list [n] stream
     Returns a newly-allocated list containing in its elements the first
     N items in STREAM.  If STREAM has less than N items, all the items
     in the stream will be included in the returned list.  If N is not
     given it defaults to infinity, which means that unless STREAM is
     finite ‘stream->list’ will never return.

          (stream->list 10
            (stream-map (lambda (x) (* x x))
              (stream-from 0)))
            ⇒ (0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81)

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-append stream ...
     Returns a newly-allocated stream containing in its elements those
     elements contained in its input STREAMs, in order of input.  If any
     of the input streams is infinite, no elements of any of the
     succeeding input streams will appear in the output stream.  See
     also ‘stream-concat’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-concat stream
     Takes a STREAM consisting of one or more streams and returns a
     newly-allocated stream containing all the elements of the input
     streams.  If any of the streams in the input STREAM is infinite,
     any remaining streams in the input stream will never appear in the
     output stream.  See also ‘stream-append’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-constant object ...
     Returns a newly-allocated stream containing in its elements the
     OBJECTs, repeating in succession forever.

          (stream-constant 1) ⇒ 1 1 1 ...
          (stream-constant #t #f) ⇒ #t #f #t #f #t #f ...

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-drop n stream
     Returns the suffix of the input STREAM that starts at the next
     element after the first N elements.  The output stream shares
     structure with the input STREAM; thus, promises forced in one
     instance of the stream are also forced in the other instance of the
     stream.  If the input STREAM has less than N elements,
     ‘stream-drop’ returns the null stream.  See also ‘stream-take’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-drop-while pred stream
     Returns the suffix of the input STREAM that starts at the first
     element X for which ‘(pred x)’ returns false.  The output stream
     shares structure with the input STREAM.  See also
     ‘stream-take-while’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-filter pred stream
     Returns a newly-allocated stream that contains only those elements
     X of the input STREAM which satisfy the predicate ‘pred’.

          (stream-filter odd? (stream-from 0))
             ⇒ 1 3 5 7 9 ...

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-fold proc base stream
     Applies a binary procedure PROC to BASE and the first element of
     STREAM to compute a new BASE, then applies the procedure to the new
     BASE and the next element of STREAM to compute a succeeding BASE,
     and so on, accumulating a value that is finally returned as the
     value of ‘stream-fold’ when the end of the stream is reached.
     STREAM must be finite, or ‘stream-fold’ will enter an infinite
     loop.  See also ‘stream-scan’, which is similar to ‘stream-fold’,
     but useful for infinite streams.  For readers familiar with other
     functional languages, this is a left-fold; there is no
     corresponding right-fold, since right-fold relies on finite streams
     that are fully-evaluated, in which case they may as well be
     converted to a list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-for-each proc stream ...
     Applies PROC element-wise to corresponding elements of the input
     STREAMs for side-effects; it returns nothing.  ‘stream-for-each’
     stops as soon as any of its input streams is exhausted.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-from first [step]
     Creates a newly-allocated stream that contains FIRST as its first
     element and increments each succeeding element by STEP.  If STEP is
     not given it defaults to 1.  FIRST and STEP may be of any numeric
     type.  ‘stream-from’ is frequently useful as a generator in
     ‘stream-of’ expressions.  See also ‘stream-range’ for a similar
     procedure that creates finite streams.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-iterate proc base
     Creates a newly-allocated stream containing BASE in its first
     element and applies PROC to each element in turn to determine the
     succeeding element.  See also ‘stream-unfold’ and ‘stream-unfolds’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-length stream
     Returns the number of elements in the STREAM; it does not evaluate
     its elements.  ‘stream-length’ may only be used on finite streams;
     it enters an infinite loop with infinite streams.

 -- Scheme Syntax: stream-let tag ((var expr) ...) body ...
     Creates a local scope that binds each variable to the value of its
     corresponding expression.  It additionally binds TAG to a procedure
     which takes the bound variables as arguments and BODY as its
     defining expressions, binding the TAG with ‘stream-lambda’.  TAG is
     in scope within body, and may be called recursively.  When the
     expanded expression defined by the ‘stream-let’ is evaluated,
     ‘stream-let’ evaluates the expressions in its BODY in an
     environment containing the newly-bound variables, returning the
     value of the last expression evaluated, which must yield a stream.

     ‘stream-let’ provides syntactic sugar on ‘stream-lambda’, in the
     same manner as normal ‘let’ provides syntactic sugar on normal
     ‘lambda’.  However, unlike normal ‘let’, the TAG is required, not
     optional, because unnamed ‘stream-let’ is meaningless.

     For example, ‘stream-member’ returns the first ‘stream-pair’ of the
     input STRM with a ‘stream-car’ X that satisfies ‘(eql? obj x)’, or
     the null stream if X is not present in STRM.

          (define-stream (stream-member eql? obj strm)
            (stream-let loop ((strm strm))
              (cond ((stream-null? strm) strm)
                    ((eql? obj (stream-car strm)) strm)
                    (else (loop (stream-cdr strm))))))

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-map proc stream ...
     Applies PROC element-wise to corresponding elements of the input
     STREAMs, returning a newly-allocated stream containing elements
     that are the results of those procedure applications.  The output
     stream has as many elements as the minimum-length input stream, and
     may be infinite.

 -- Scheme Syntax: stream-match stream clause ...
     Provides pattern-matching for streams.  The input STREAM is an
     expression that evaluates to a stream.  Clauses are of the form
     ‘(pattern [fender] expression)’, consisting of a PATTERN that
     matches a stream of a particular shape, an optional FENDER that
     must succeed if the pattern is to match, and an EXPRESSION that is
     evaluated if the pattern matches.  There are four types of
     patterns:

        • () matches the null stream.

        • (PAT0 PAT1 ...) matches a finite stream with length exactly
          equal to the number of pattern elements.

        • (PAT0 PAT1 ... ‘.’ PAT-REST) matches an infinite stream, or a
          finite stream with length at least as great as the number of
          pattern elements before the literal dot.

        • PAT matches an entire stream.  Should always appear last in
          the list of clauses; it’s not an error to appear elsewhere,
          but subsequent clauses could never match.

     Each pattern element may be either:

        • An identifier, which matches any stream element.
          Additionally, the value of the stream element is bound to the
          variable named by the identifier, which is in scope in the
          FENDER and EXPRESSION of the corresponding CLAUSE.  Each
          identifier in a single pattern must be unique.

        • A literal underscore (‘_’), which matches any stream element
          but creates no bindings.

     The PATTERNs are tested in order, left-to-right, until a matching
     pattern is found; if FENDER is present, it must evaluate to a true
     value for the match to be successful.  Pattern variables are bound
     in the corresponding FENDER and EXPRESSION.  Once the matching
     PATTERN is found, the corresponding EXPRESSION is evaluated and
     returned as the result of the match.  An error is signaled if no
     pattern matches the input STREAM.

     ‘stream-match’ is often used to distinguish null streams from
     non-null streams, binding HEAD and TAIL:

          (define (len strm)
            (stream-match strm
              (() 0)
              ((head . tail) (+ 1 (len tail)))))

     Fenders can test the common case where two stream elements must be
     identical; the ‘else’ pattern is an identifier bound to the entire
     stream, not a keyword as in ‘cond’.

          (stream-match strm
            ((x y . _) (equal? x y) 'ok)
            (else 'error))

     A more complex example uses two nested matchers to match two
     different stream arguments; ‘(stream-merge lt? . strms)’ stably
     merges two or more streams ordered by the ‘lt?’ predicate:

          (define-stream (stream-merge lt? . strms)
            (define-stream (merge xx yy)
              (stream-match xx (() yy) ((x . xs)
                (stream-match yy (() xx) ((y . ys)
                  (if (lt? y x)
                      (stream-cons y (merge xx ys))
                      (stream-cons x (merge xs yy))))))))
            (stream-let loop ((strms strms))
              (cond ((null? strms) stream-null)
                    ((null? (cdr strms)) (car strms))
                    (else (merge (car strms)
                                 (apply stream-merge lt?
                                   (cdr strms)))))))

 -- Scheme Syntax: stream-of expr clause ...
     Provides the syntax of stream comprehensions, which generate
     streams by means of looping expressions.  The result is a stream of
     objects of the type returned by EXPR.  There are four types of
     clauses:

        • (VAR ‘in’ STREAM-EXPR) loops over the elements of STREAM-EXPR,
          in order from the start of the stream, binding each element of
          the stream in turn to VAR.  ‘stream-from’ and ‘stream-range’
          are frequently useful as generators for STREAM-EXPR.

        • (VAR ‘is’ EXPR) binds VAR to the value obtained by evaluating
          EXPR.

        • (PRED EXPR) includes in the output stream only those elements
          X which satisfy the predicate PRED.

     The scope of variables bound in the stream comprehension is the
     clauses to the right of the binding clause (but not the binding
     clause itself) plus the result expression.

     When two or more generators are present, the loops are processed as
     if they are nested from left to right; that is, the rightmost
     generator varies fastest.  A consequence of this is that only the
     first generator may be infinite and all subsequent generators must
     be finite.  If no generators are present, the result of a stream
     comprehension is a stream containing the result expression; thus,
     ‘(stream-of 1)’ produces a finite stream containing only the
     element 1.

          (stream-of (* x x)
            (x in (stream-range 0 10))
            (even? x))
            ⇒ 0 4 16 36 64

          (stream-of (list a b)
            (a in (stream-range 1 4))
            (b in (stream-range 1 3)))
            ⇒ (1 1) (1 2) (2 1) (2 2) (3 1) (3 2)

          (stream-of (list i j)
            (i in (stream-range 1 5))
            (j in (stream-range (+ i 1) 5)))
            ⇒ (1 2) (1 3) (1 4) (2 3) (2 4) (3 4)

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-range first past [step]
     Creates a newly-allocated stream that contains FIRST as its first
     element and increments each succeeding element by STEP.  The stream
     is finite and ends before PAST, which is not an element of the
     stream.  If STEP is not given it defaults to 1 if FIRST is less
     than past and -1 otherwise.  FIRST, PAST and STEP may be of any
     real numeric type.  ‘stream-range’ is frequently useful as a
     generator in ‘stream-of’ expressions.  See also ‘stream-from’ for a
     similar procedure that creates infinite streams.

          (stream-range 0 10) ⇒ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
          (stream-range 0 10 2) ⇒ 0 2 4 6 8

     Successive elements of the stream are calculated by adding STEP to
     FIRST, so if any of FIRST, PAST or STEP are inexact, the length of
     the output stream may differ from ‘(ceiling (- (/ (- past first)
     step) 1)’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-ref stream n
     Returns the Nth element of stream, counting from zero.  An error is
     signaled if N is greater than or equal to the length of stream.

          (define (fact n)
            (stream-ref
              (stream-scan * 1 (stream-from 1))
              n))

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-reverse stream
     Returns a newly-allocated stream containing the elements of the
     input STREAM but in reverse order.  ‘stream-reverse’ may only be
     used with finite streams; it enters an infinite loop with infinite
     streams.  ‘stream-reverse’ does not force evaluation of the
     elements of the stream.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-scan proc base stream
     Accumulates the partial folds of an input STREAM into a
     newly-allocated output stream.  The output stream is the BASE
     followed by ‘(stream-fold proc base (stream-take i stream))’ for
     each of the first I elements of STREAM.

          (stream-scan + 0 (stream-from 1))
            ⇒ (stream 0 1 3 6 10 15 ...)

          (stream-scan * 1 (stream-from 1))
            ⇒ (stream 1 1 2 6 24 120 ...)

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-take n stream
     Returns a newly-allocated stream containing the first N elements of
     the input STREAM.  If the input STREAM has less than N elements, so
     does the output stream.  See also ‘stream-drop’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-take-while pred stream
     Takes a predicate and a ‘stream’ and returns a newly-allocated
     stream containing those elements ‘x’ that form the maximal prefix
     of the input stream which satisfy PRED.  See also
     ‘stream-drop-while’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-unfold map pred gen base
     The fundamental recursive stream constructor.  It constructs a
     stream by repeatedly applying GEN to successive values of BASE, in
     the manner of ‘stream-iterate’, then applying MAP to each of the
     values so generated, appending each of the mapped values to the
     output stream as long as ‘(pred? base)’ returns a true value.  See
     also ‘stream-iterate’ and ‘stream-unfolds’.

     The expression below creates the finite stream ‘0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49
     64 81’.  Initially the BASE is 0, which is less than 10, so MAP
     squares the BASE and the mapped value becomes the first element of
     the output stream.  Then GEN increments the BASE by 1, so it
     becomes 1; this is less than 10, so MAP squares the new BASE and 1
     becomes the second element of the output stream.  And so on, until
     the base becomes 10, when PRED stops the recursion and stream-null
     ends the output stream.

          (stream-unfold
            (lambda (x) (expt x 2)) ; map
            (lambda (x) (< x 10))   ; pred?
            (lambda (x) (+ x 1))    ; gen
            0)                      ; base

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-unfolds proc seed
     Returns N newly-allocated streams containing those elements
     produced by successive calls to the generator PROC, which takes the
     current SEED as its argument and returns N+1 values

     (PROC SEED) ⇒ SEED RESULT_0 ... RESULT_N-1

     where the returned SEED is the input SEED to the next call to the
     generator and RESULT_I indicates how to produce the next element of
     the Ith result stream:

        • (VALUE): VALUE is the next car of the result stream.

        • ‘#f’: no value produced by this iteration of the generator
          PROC for the result stream.

        • (): the end of the result stream.

     It may require multiple calls of PROC to produce the next element
     of any particular result stream.  See also ‘stream-iterate’ and
     ‘stream-unfold’.

          (define (stream-partition pred? strm)
            (stream-unfolds
              (lambda (s)
                (if (stream-null? s)
                    (values s '() '())
                    (let ((a (stream-car s))
                          (d (stream-cdr s)))
                      (if (pred? a)
                          (values d (list a) #f)
                          (values d #f (list a))))))
              strm))

          (call-with-values
            (lambda ()
              (stream-partition odd?
                (stream-range 1 6)))
            (lambda (odds evens)
              (list (stream->list odds)
                    (stream->list evens))))
            ⇒ ((1 3 5) (2 4))

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-zip stream ...
     Returns a newly-allocated stream in which each element is a list
     (not a stream) of the corresponding elements of the input STREAMs.
     The output stream is as long as the shortest input STREAM, if any
     of the input STREAMs is finite, or is infinite if all the input
     STREAMs are infinite.

### 7.5.30.1 SRFI-43 Constructors
.............................

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-vector size [fill]
     Create and return a vector of size SIZE, optionally filling it with
     FILL.  The default value of FILL is unspecified.

          (make-vector 5 3) ⇒ #(3 3 3 3 3)

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector x ...
     Create and return a vector whose elements are X ....

          (vector 0 1 2 3 4) ⇒ #(0 1 2 3 4)

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-unfold f length initial-seed ...
     The fundamental vector constructor.  Create a vector whose length
     is LENGTH and iterates across each index k from 0 up to LENGTH - 1,
     applying F at each iteration to the current index and current
     seeds, in that order, to receive n + 1 values: the element to put
     in the kth slot of the new vector, and n new seeds for the next
     iteration.  It is an error for the number of seeds to vary between
     iterations.

          (vector-unfold (lambda (i x) (values x (- x 1)))
                         10 0)
          ⇒ #(0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9)

          (vector-unfold values 10)
          ⇒ #(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-unfold-right f length initial-seed ...
     Like ‘vector-unfold’, but it uses F to generate elements from
     right-to-left, rather than left-to-right.

          (vector-unfold-right (lambda (i x) (values x (+ x 1)))
                               10 0)
          ⇒ #(9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0)

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-copy vec [start [end [fill]]]
     Allocate a new vector whose length is END - START and fills it with
     elements from VEC, taking elements from VEC starting at index START
     and stopping at index END.  START defaults to 0 and END defaults to
     the value of ‘(vector-length vec)’.  If END extends beyond the
     length of VEC, the slots in the new vector that obviously cannot be
     filled by elements from VEC are filled with FILL, whose default
     value is unspecified.

          (vector-copy '#(a b c d e f g h i))
          ⇒ #(a b c d e f g h i)

          (vector-copy '#(a b c d e f g h i) 6)
          ⇒ #(g h i)

          (vector-copy '#(a b c d e f g h i) 3 6)
          ⇒ #(d e f)

          (vector-copy '#(a b c d e f g h i) 6 12 'x)
          ⇒ #(g h i x x x)

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-reverse-copy vec [start [end]]
     Like ‘vector-copy’, but it copies the elements in the reverse order
     from VEC.

          (vector-reverse-copy '#(5 4 3 2 1 0) 1 5)
          ⇒ #(1 2 3 4)

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-append vec ...

### 7.5.30.4 SRFI-43 Iteration
..........................

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-fold kons knil vec1 vec2 ...
     The fundamental vector iterator.  KONS is iterated over each index
     in all of the vectors, stopping at the end of the shortest; KONS is
     applied as
          (kons i state (vector-ref vec1 i) (vector-ref vec2 i) ...)
     where STATE is the current state value, and I is the current index.
     The current state value begins with KNIL, and becomes whatever KONS
     returned at the respective iteration.  The iteration is strictly
     left-to-right.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-fold-right kons knil vec1 vec2 ...
     Similar to ‘vector-fold’, but it iterates right-to-left instead of
     left-to-right.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-map f vec1 vec2 ...
     Return a new vector of the shortest size of the vector arguments.
     Each element at index i of the new vector is mapped from the old
     vectors by
          (f i (vector-ref vec1 i) (vector-ref vec2 i) ...)
     The dynamic order of application of F is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-map! f vec1 vec2 ...
     Similar to ‘vector-map’, but rather than mapping the new elements
     into a new vector, the new mapped elements are destructively
     inserted into VEC1.  The dynamic order of application of F is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-for-each f vec1 vec2 ...
     Call ‘(f i (vector-ref vec1 i) (vector-ref vec2 i) ...)’ for each
     index i less than the length of the shortest vector passed.  The
     iteration is strictly left-to-right.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-count pred? vec1 vec2 ...
     Count the number of parallel elements in the vectors that satisfy
     PRED?, which is applied, for each index i less than the length of
     the smallest vector, to i and each parallel element in the vectors
     at that index, in order.

          (vector-count (lambda (i elt) (even? elt))
                        '#(3 1 4 1 5 9 2 5 6))
          ⇒ 3
          (vector-count (lambda (i x y) (< x y))
                        '#(1 3 6 9) '#(2 4 6 8 10 12))

..........................

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-index pred? vec1 vec2 ...
     Find and return the index of the first elements in VEC1 VEC2 ...
     that satisfy PRED?.  If no matching element is found by the end of
     the shortest vector, return ‘#f’.

          (vector-index even? '#(3 1 4 1 5 9))
          ⇒ 2
          (vector-index < '#(3 1 4 1 5 9 2 5 6) '#(2 7 1 8 2))

          (vector-index = '#(3 1 4 1 5 9 2 5 6) '#(2 7 1 8 2))
          ⇒ #f

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-index-right pred? vec1 vec2 ...
     Like ‘vector-index’, but it searches right-to-left, rather than
     left-to-right.  Note that the SRFI 43 specification requires that
     all the vectors must have the same length, but both the SRFI 43
     reference implementation and Guile’s implementation allow vectors
     with unequal lengths, and start searching from the last index of
     the shortest vector.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-skip pred? vec1 vec2 ...
     Find and return the index of the first elements in VEC1 VEC2 ...
     that do not satisfy PRED?.  If no matching element is found by the
     end of the shortest vector, return ‘#f’.  Equivalent to
     ‘vector-index’ but with the predicate inverted.

          (vector-skip number? '#(1 2 a b 3 4 c d)) ⇒ 2

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-skip-right pred? vec1 vec2 ...
     Like ‘vector-skip’, but it searches for a non-matching element
     right-to-left, rather than left-to-right.  Note that the SRFI 43
     specification requires that all the vectors must have the same
     length, but both the SRFI 43 reference implementation and Guile’s
     implementation allow vectors with unequal lengths, and start
     searching from the last index of the shortest vector.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-binary-search vec value cmp [start [end]]
     Find and return an index of VEC between START and END whose value
     is VALUE using a binary search.  If no matching element is found,
     return ‘#f’.  The default START is 0 and the default END is the
     length of VEC.

     CMP must be a procedure of two arguments such that ‘(cmp a b)’
     returns a negative integer if a < b, a positive integer if a > b,
     or zero if a = b.  The elements of VEC must be sorted in
     non-decreasing order according to CMP.

     Note that SRFI 43 does not document the START and END arguments,
     but both its reference implementation and Guile’s implementation
     support them.

                                char-cmp)
          ⇒ 6

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-any pred? vec1 vec2 ...
     Find the first parallel set of elements from VEC1 VEC2 ... for
     which PRED? returns a true value.  If such a parallel set of
     elements exists, ‘vector-any’ returns the value that PRED? returned
     for that set of elements.  The iteration is strictly left-to-right.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-every pred? vec1 vec2 ...
     If, for every index i between 0 and the length of the shortest
     vector argument, the set of elements ‘(vector-ref vec1 i)’
     ‘(vector-ref vec2 i)’ ... satisfies PRED?, ‘vector-every’ returns
     the value that PRED? returned for the last set of elements, at the
     last index of the shortest vector.  Otherwise it returns ‘#f’.  The
     iteration is strictly left-to-right.

7.5.31 SRFI-45 - Primitives for Expressing Iterative Lazy Algorithms
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This subsection is based on the specification of SRFI-45
(http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-45/srfi-45.html) written by André van
Tonder.

   Lazy evaluation is traditionally simulated in Scheme using ‘delay’
and ‘force’.  However, these primitives are not powerful enough to
express a large class of lazy algorithms that are iterative.  Indeed, it
is folklore in the Scheme community that typical iterative lazy
algorithms written using delay and force will often require unbounded
memory.

   This SRFI provides set of three operations: {‘lazy’, ‘delay’,
‘force’}, which allow the programmer to succinctly express lazy
algorithms while retaining bounded space behavior in cases that are
properly tail-recursive.  A general recipe for using these primitives is
provided.  An additional procedure ‘eager’ is provided for the
construction of eager promises in cases where efficiency is a concern.

   Although this SRFI redefines ‘delay’ and ‘force’, the extension is
conservative in the sense that the semantics of the subset {‘delay’,
‘force’} in isolation (i.e., as long as the program does not use ‘lazy’)
agrees with that in R5RS. In other words, no program that uses the R5RS
definitions of delay and force will break if those definition are
replaced by the SRFI-45 definitions of delay and force.

   Guile also adds ‘promise?’ to the list of exports, which is not part
of the official SRFI-45.

 -- Scheme Procedure: promise? obj
     Return true if OBJ is an SRFI-45 promise, otherwise return false.

 -- Scheme Syntax: delay expression
     Takes an expression of arbitrary type A and returns a promise of
     type ‘(Promise A)’ which at some point in the future may be asked
     (by the ‘force’ procedure) to evaluate the expression and deliver
     the resulting value.

 -- Scheme Syntax: lazy expression
     Takes an expression of type ‘(Promise A)’ and returns a promise of
     type ‘(Promise A)’ which at some point in the future may be asked
     (by the ‘force’ procedure) to evaluate the expression and deliver
     the resulting promise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: force expression
     Takes an argument of type ‘(Promise A)’ and returns a value of type
     A as follows: If a value of type A has been computed for the
     promise, this value is returned.  Otherwise, the promise is first
     evaluated, then overwritten by the obtained promise or value, and
     then force is again applied (iteratively) to the promise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: eager expression
     Takes an argument of type A and returns a value of type ‘(Promise
     A)’.  As opposed to ‘delay’, the argument is evaluated eagerly.
     Semantically, writing ‘(eager expression)’ is equivalent to writing

          (let ((value expression)) (delay value)).

     However, the former is more efficient since it does not require
     unnecessary creation and evaluation of thunks.  We also have the
     equivalence

          (delay expression) = (lazy (eager expression))

   The following reduction rules may be helpful for reasoning about
these primitives.  However, they do not express the memoization and
memory usage semantics specified above:

     (force (delay expression)) -> expression
     (force (lazy  expression)) -> (force expression)
     (force (eager value))      -> value

### Correct usage
.............

We now provide a general recipe for using the primitives {‘lazy’,
‘delay’, ‘force’} to express lazy algorithms in Scheme.  The
transformation is best described by way of an example: Consider the
stream-filter algorithm, expressed in a hypothetical lazy language as

     (define (stream-filter p? s)
       (if (null? s) '()
           (let ((h (car s))
                 (t (cdr s)))
             (if (p? h)
                 (cons h (stream-filter p? t))
                 (stream-filter p? t)))))

   This algorithm can be expressed as follows in Scheme:

     (define (stream-filter p? s)
       (lazy
          (if (null? (force s)) (delay '())
              (let ((h (car (force s)))
                    (t (cdr (force s))))
                (if (p? h)
                    (delay (cons h (stream-filter p? t)))
                    (stream-filter p? t))))))

   In other words, we

   • wrap all constructors (e.g., ‘'()’, ‘cons’) with ‘delay’,
   • apply ‘force’ to arguments of deconstructors (e.g., ‘car’, ‘cdr’
     and ‘null?’),
   • wrap procedure bodies with ‘(lazy ...)’.

7.5.32 SRFI-46 Basic syntax-rules Extensions
--------------------------------------------

Guile’s core ‘syntax-rules’ supports the extensions specified by

2.0, and custom ellipsis identifiers have been supported since Guile
2.0.10.  *Note* Syntax Rules::.

7.5.33 SRFI-55 - Requiring Features
-----------------------------------

SRFI-55 provides ‘require-extension’ which is a portable mechanism to
load selected SRFI modules.  This is implemented in the Guile core,
there’s no module needed to get SRFI-55 itself.

 -- library syntax: require-extension clause1 clause2 ...
     Require the features of CLAUSE1 CLAUSE2 ... , throwing an error if
     any are unavailable.

     A CLAUSE is of the form ‘(IDENTIFIER arg...)’.  The only IDENTIFIER
     currently supported is ‘srfi’ and the arguments are SRFI numbers.
     For example to get SRFI-1 and SRFI-6,

          (require-extension (srfi 1 6))

     ‘require-extension’ can only be used at the top-level.

     A Guile-specific program can simply ‘use-modules’ to load SRFIs not
     already in the core, ‘require-extension’ is for programs designed
     to be portable to other Scheme implementations.

7.5.34 SRFI-60 - Integers as Bits
---------------------------------

This SRFI provides various functions for treating integers as bits and
for bitwise manipulations.  These functions can be obtained with,

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-60))

   Integers are treated as infinite precision twos-complement, the same
as in the core logical functions (*note* Bitwise Operations::).  And
likewise bit indexes start from 0 for the least significant bit.  The
following functions in this SRFI are already in the Guile core,

     ‘logand’, ‘logior’, ‘logxor’, ‘lognot’, ‘logtest’, ‘logcount’,
     ‘integer-length’, ‘logbit?’, ‘ash’


 -- Function: bitwise-and n1 ...
 -- Function: bitwise-ior n1 ...
 -- Function: bitwise-xor n1 ...
 -- Function: bitwise-not n
 -- Function: any-bits-set? j k
 -- Function: bit-set? index n
 -- Function: arithmetic-shift n count
 -- Function: bit-field n start end
 -- Function: bit-count n
     Aliases for ‘logand’, ‘logior’, ‘logxor’, ‘lognot’, ‘logtest’,
     ‘logbit?’, ‘ash’, ‘bit-extract’ and ‘logcount’ respectively.

     Note that the name ‘bit-count’ conflicts with ‘bit-count’ in the
     core (*note* Bit Vectors::).

 -- Function: bitwise-if mask n1 n0
 -- Function: bitwise-merge mask n1 n0
     Return an integer with bits selected from N1 and N0 according to
     MASK.  Those bits where MASK has 1s are taken from N1, and those
     where MASK has 0s are taken from N0.

          (bitwise-if 3 #b0101 #b1010) ⇒ 9

 -- Function: log2-binary-factors n
 -- Function: first-set-bit n
     Return a count of how many factors of 2 are present in N.  This is
     also the bit index of the lowest 1 bit in N.  If N is 0, the return
     is -1.

          (log2-binary-factors 6) ⇒ 1
          (log2-binary-factors -8) ⇒ 3

 -- Function: copy-bit index n newbit
     Return N with the bit at INDEX set according to NEWBIT.  NEWBIT
     should be ‘#t’ to set the bit to 1, or ‘#f’ to set it to 0.  Bits
     other than at INDEX are unchanged in the return.

          (copy-bit 1 #b0101 #t) ⇒ 7

 -- Function: copy-bit-field n newbits start end
     Return N with the bits from START (inclusive) to END (exclusive)
     changed to the value NEWBITS.

     The least significant bit in NEWBITS goes to START, the next to
     START+1, etc.  Anything in NEWBITS past the END given is ignored.

          (copy-bit-field #b10000 #b11 1 3) ⇒ #b10110

 -- Function: rotate-bit-field n count start end
     Return N with the bit field from START (inclusive) to END
     (exclusive) rotated upwards by COUNT bits.

     COUNT can be positive or negative, and it can be more than the
     field width (it’ll be reduced modulo the width).

          (rotate-bit-field #b0110 2 1 4) ⇒ #b1010

 -- Function: reverse-bit-field n start end
     Return N with the bits from START (inclusive) to END (exclusive)
     reversed.

          (reverse-bit-field #b101001 2 4) ⇒ #b100101

 -- Function: integer->list n [len]
     Return bits from N in the form of a list of ‘#t’ for 1 and ‘#f’ for
     0.  The least significant LEN bits are returned, and the first list
     element is the most significant of those bits.  If LEN is not
     given, the default is ‘(integer-length N)’ (*note* Bitwise
     Operations::).

          (integer->list 6)   ⇒ (#t #t #f)
          (integer->list 1 4) ⇒ (#f #f #f #t)

 -- Function: list->integer lst
 -- Function: booleans->integer bool...
     Return an integer formed bitwise from the given LST list of
     booleans, or for ‘booleans->integer’ from the BOOL arguments.

     Each boolean is ‘#t’ for a 1 and ‘#f’ for a 0.  The first element
     becomes the most significant bit in the return.

          (list->integer '(#t #f #t #f)) ⇒ 10

### 7.5.39.1 Creating hash tables
.............................

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-hash-table [equal-proc hash-proc #:weak
          weakness start-size]
     Create and answer a new hash table with EQUAL-PROC as the equality
     function and HASH-PROC as the hashing function.

     By default, EQUAL-PROC is ‘equal?’.  It can be any two-argument
     procedure, and should answer whether two keys are the same for this
     table’s purposes.

     By default HASH-PROC assumes that ‘equal-proc’ is no coarser than
     ‘equal?’ unless it is literally ‘string-ci=?’.  If provided,
     HASH-PROC should be a two-argument procedure that takes a key and
     the current table size, and answers a reasonably good hash integer
     between 0 (inclusive) and the size (exclusive).

     WEAKNESS should be ‘#f’ or a symbol indicating how “weak” the hash
     table is:

     ‘#f’
          An ordinary non-weak hash table.  This is the default.

     ‘key’
          When the key has no more non-weak references at GC, remove
          that entry.

     ‘value’
          When the value has no more non-weak references at GC, remove
          that entry.

     ‘key-or-value’
          When either has no more non-weak references at GC, remove the
          association.

     As a legacy of the time when Guile couldn’t grow hash tables,
     START-SIZE is an optional integer argument that specifies the
     approximate starting size for the hash table, which will be rounded
     to an algorithmically-sounder number.

   By “coarser” than ‘equal?’, we mean that for all X and Y values where
‘(EQUAL-PROC X Y)’, ‘(equal? X Y)’ as well.  If that does not hold for
your EQUAL-PROC, you must provide a HASH-PROC.

   In the case of weak tables, remember that “references” above always
refers to ‘eq?’-wise references.  Just because you have a reference to
some string ‘"foo"’ doesn’t mean that an association with key ‘"foo"’ in
a weak-key table _won’t_ be collected; it only counts as a reference if
the two ‘"foo"’s are ‘eq?’, regardless of EQUAL-PROC.  As such, it is
usually only sensible to use ‘eq?’ and ‘hashq’ as the equivalence and
hash functions for a weak table.  *Note* Weak References::, for more
information on Guile’s built-in weak table support.

 -- Scheme Procedure: alist->hash-table alist [equal-proc hash-proc
          #:weak weakness start-size]
     As with ‘make-hash-table’, but initialize it with the associations
     in ALIST.  Where keys are repeated in ALIST, the leftmost
     association takes precedence.

..............................

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-table-ref table key [default-thunk]
 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-table-ref/default table key default
     Answer the value associated with KEY in TABLE.  If KEY is not
     present, answer the result of invoking the thunk DEFAULT-THUNK,
     which signals an error instead by default.

     ‘hash-table-ref/default’ is a variant that requires a third
     argument, DEFAULT, and answers DEFAULT itself instead of invoking
     it.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-table-set! table key new-value
     Set KEY to NEW-VALUE in TABLE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-table-delete! table key
     Remove the association of KEY in TABLE, if present.  If absent, do
     nothing.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-table-exists? table key
     Answer whether KEY has an association in TABLE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-table-update! table key modifier
          [default-thunk]
 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-table-update!/default table key modifier
          default
     Replace KEY’s associated value in TABLE by invoking MODIFIER with
     one argument, the old value.

     If KEY is not present, and DEFAULT-THUNK is provided, invoke it
     with no arguments to get the “old value” to be passed to MODIFIER
     as above.  If DEFAULT-THUNK is not provided in such a case, signal
     an error.

     ‘hash-table-update!/default’ is a variant that requires the fourth
     argument, which is used directly as the “old value” rather than as
     a thunk to be invoked to retrieve the “old value”.

### 7.5.39.4 Hash table algorithms
..............................

Each hash table carries an “equivalence function” and a “hash function”,
used to implement key lookups.  Beginning users should follow the rules
for consistency of the default HASH-PROC specified above.  Advanced
users can use these to implement their own equivalence and hash
functions for specialized lookup semantics.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-table-equivalence-function hash-table
 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-table-hash-function hash-table
     Answer the equivalence and hash function of HASH-TABLE,
     respectively.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hash obj [size]
 -- Scheme Procedure: string-hash obj [size]
 -- Scheme Procedure: string-ci-hash obj [size]
 -- Scheme Procedure: hash-by-identity obj [size]
     Answer a hash value appropriate for equality predicate ‘equal?’,
     ‘string=?’, ‘string-ci=?’, and ‘eq?’, respectively.

   ‘hash’ is a backwards-compatible replacement for Guile’s built-in
‘hash’.

This SRFI shadows the forms for ‘let’, ‘let*’, and ‘letrec’ so that they
may accept multiple values.  For example:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-71))

     (let* ((x y (values 1 2))
            (z (+ x y)))
       (* z 2))

7.5.42 SRFI-88 Keyword Objects
------------------------------

SRFI-88 (http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-88/srfi-88.html) provides
“keyword objects”, which are equivalent to Guile’s keywords (*note*
Keywords::).  SRFI-88 keywords can be entered using the “postfix keyword
syntax”, which consists of an identifier followed by ‘:’ (*note*
‘postfix’ keyword syntax: Scheme Read.).  SRFI-88 can be made available
with:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-88))

   Doing so installs the right reader option for keyword syntax, using
‘(read-set! keywords 'postfix)’.  It also provides the procedures
described below.

 -- Scheme Procedure: keyword? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a keyword.  This is the same procedure as the
     same-named built-in procedure (*note* ‘keyword?’: Keyword
     Procedures.).

          (keyword? foo:)         ⇒ #t
          (keyword? 'foo:)        ⇒ #t
          (keyword? "foo")        ⇒ #f

 -- Scheme Procedure: keyword->string kw
     Return the name of KW as a string, i.e., without the trailing
     colon.  The returned string may not be modified, e.g., with
     ‘string-set!’.

          (keyword->string foo:)  ⇒ "foo"

 -- Scheme Procedure: string->keyword str
     Return the keyword object whose name is STR.

          (keyword->string (string->keyword "a b c"))     ⇒ "a b c"

     Returns a string containing the value of the environment variable
     given by the string ‘name’, or ‘#f’ if the named environment
     variable is not found.  This is equivalent to ‘(getenv name)’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-environment-variables

7.5.44 SRFI-105 Curly-infix expressions.
----------------------------------------

Guile’s built-in reader includes support for SRFI-105 curly-infix
expressions.  See the specification of SRFI-105
(http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-105/srfi-105.html).  Some examples:

     {n <= 5}                ⇒  (<= n 5)
     {a + b + c}             ⇒  (+ a b c)
     {a * {b + c}}           ⇒  (* a (+ b c))
     {(- a) / b}             ⇒  (/ (- a) b)
     {-(a) / b}              ⇒  (/ (- a) b) as well
     {(f a b) + (g h)}       ⇒  (+ (f a b) (g h))
     {f(a b) + g(h)}         ⇒  (+ (f a b) (g h)) as well
     {f[a b] + g(h)}         ⇒  (+ ($bracket-apply$ f a b) (g h))
     '{a + f(b) + x}         ⇒  '(+ a (f b) x)
     {length(x) >= 6}        ⇒  (>= (length x) 6)
     {n-1 + n-2}             ⇒  (+ n-1 n-2)
     {n * factorial{n - 1}}  ⇒  (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
     {{a > 0} and {b >= 1}}  ⇒  (and (> a 0) (>= b 1))
     {f{n - 1}(x)}           ⇒  ((f (- n 1)) x)
     {a . z}                 ⇒  ($nfx$ a . z)
     {a + b - c}             ⇒  ($nfx$ a + b - c)

   To enable curly-infix expressions within a file, place the reader
directive ‘#!curly-infix’ before the first use of curly-infix notation.
To globally enable curly-infix expressions in Guile’s reader, set the
‘curly-infix’ read option.

   Guile also implements the following non-standard extension to
SRFI-105: if ‘curly-infix’ is enabled and there is no other meaning
assigned to square brackets (i.e.  the ‘square-brackets’ read option is
turned off), then lists within square brackets are read as normal lists
but with the special symbol ‘$bracket-list$’ added to the front.  To
enable this combination of read options within a file, use the reader
directive ‘#!curly-infix-and-bracket-lists’.  For example:

     [a b]    ⇒  ($bracket-list$ a b)
     [a . b]  ⇒  ($bracket-list$ a . b)

7.5.46 Transducers
------------------

Some of the most common operations used in the Scheme language are those
transforming lists: map, filter, take and so on.  They work well, are
well understood, and are used daily by most Scheme programmers.  They
are however not general because they only work on lists, and they do not
compose very well since combining N of them builds ‘(- N 1)’
intermediate lists.

   Transducers are oblivious to what kind of process they are used in,
and are composable without building intermediate collections.  This
means we can create a transducer that squares all odd numbers:

     (compose (tfilter odd?) (tmap (lambda (x) (* x x))))

   and reuse it with lists, vectors, or in just about any context where
data flows in one direction.  We could use it as a processing step for
asynchronous channels, with an event framework as a pre-processing step,
or even in lazy contexts where you pass a lazy collection and a
transducer to a function and get a new lazy collection back.

   The traditional Scheme approach of having collection-specific
procedures is not changed.  We instead specify a general form of
transformations that complement these procedures.  The benefits are
obvious: a clear, well-understood way of describing common
transformations in a way that is faster than just chaining the
collection-specific counterparts.  For guile in particular this means a
lot better GC performance.

   Notice however that ‘(compose ...)’ composes transducers
left-to-right, due to how transducers are initiated.

### 7.5.46.1 SRFI-171 General Discussion
....................................

The concept of reducers
-----------------------

The central part of transducers are 3-arity reducing procedures.

   • no arguments: Produces the identity of the reducer.

   • (result-so-far): completion.  Returns ‘result-so-far’ either with
     or without transforming it first.

   • (result-so-far input) combines ‘result-so-far’ and ‘input’ to
     produce a new ‘result-so-far’.

   In the case of a summing ‘+’ reducer, the reducer would produce, in
arity order: ‘0’, ‘result-so-far’, ‘(+ result-so-far input)’.  This
happens to be exactly what the regular ‘+’ does.

The concept of transducers
--------------------------

A transducer is a one-arity procedure that takes a reducer and produces
a reducing function that behaves as follows:

   • no arguments: calls reducer with no arguments (producing its
     identity)

   • (result-so-far): Maybe transform the result-so-far and call reducer
     with it.

   • (result-so-far input) Maybe do something to input and maybe call
     the reducer with result-so-far and the maybe-transformed input.

   A simple example is as following:

     (list-transduce (tfilter odd?) + '(1 2 3 4 5)).

   This first returns a transducer filtering all odd elements, then it
runs ‘+’ without arguments to retrieve its identity.  It then starts the
transduction by passing ‘+’ to the transducer returned by ‘(tfilter
odd?)’ which returns a reducing function.  It works not unlike reduce
from SRFI 1, but also checks whether one of the intermediate transducers
returns a "reduced" value (implemented as a SRFI 9 record), which means
the reduction finished early.

   Because transducers compose and the final reduction is only executed
in the last step, composed transducers will not build any intermediate
result or collections.  Although the normal way of thinking about
application of composed functions is right to left, due to how the
transduction is built it is applied left to right.  ‘(compose (tfilter
odd?) (tmap sqrt))’ will create a transducer that first filters out any
odd values and then computes the square root of the rest.

State
-----

Even though transducers appear to be somewhat of a generalisation of
‘map’ and friends, this is not really true.  Since transducers don’t
know in which context they are being used, some transducers must keep
state where their collection-specific counterparts do not.  The
transducers that keep state do so using hidden mutable state, and as
such all the caveats of mutation, parallelism, and multi-shot
continuations apply.  Each transducer keeping state is clearly described
as doing so in the documentation.

Naming
------

Reducers exported from the transducers module are named as in their
SRFI-1 counterpart, but prepended with an r.  Transducers also follow
that naming, but are prepended with a t.

### 7.5.46.2 Applying Transducers
.............................

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-transduce xform f lst
 -- Scheme Procedure: list-transduce xform f identity lst
     Initialize the transducer XFORM by passing the reducer F to it.  If
     no identity is provided, F runs without arguments to return the
     reducer identity.  It then reduces over LST using the identity as
     the seed.

     If one of the transducers finishes early (such as ‘ttake’ or
     ‘tdrop’), it communicates this by returning a reduced value, which
     in the guile implementation is just a value wrapped in a SRFI 9
     record type named “reduced”.  If such a value is returned by the
     transducer, ‘list-transduce’ must stop execution and return an
     unreduced value immediately.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-transduce xform f vec
 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-transduce xform f identity vec
 -- Scheme Procedure: string-transduce xform f str
 -- Scheme Procedure: string-transduce xform f identity str
 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-u8-transduce xform f bv
 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-u8-transduce xform f identity bv

 -- Scheme Procedure: generator-transduce xform f identity gen

     Same as ‘list-transduce’, but for vectors, strings, u8-bytevectors
     and SRFI-158-styled generators respectively.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-transduce xform f reader
 -- Scheme Procedure: port-transduce xform f reader port
 -- Scheme Procedure: port-transduce xform f identity reader port

     Same as ‘list-transduce’ but for ports.  Called without a port, it
     reduces over the results of applying READER until the EOF-object is
     returned, presumably to read from ‘current-input-port’.  With a
     port READER is applied to PORT instead of without any arguments.
     If IDENTITY is provided, that is used as the initial identity in
     the reduction.

### 7.5.46.3 Reducers
.................

 -- Scheme Procedure: rcons
     a simple consing reducer.  When called without values, it returns
     its identity, ‘'()’.  With one value, which will be a list, it
     reverses the list (using ‘reverse!’).  When called with two values,
     it conses the second value to the first.

          (list-transduce (tmap (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) rcons (list 0 1 2 3))
          ⇒ (1 2 3 4)

 -- Scheme Procedure: reverse-rcons

          ⇒ (4 3 2 1)

 -- Scheme Procedure: rany pred?
     The reducer version of any.  Returns ‘(reduced (pred? value))’ if

          ⇒ #f

          (list-transduce (tmap (lambda (x) (+ x 1))) (rany odd?) (list 1 3 4 5))
          ⇒ #t

 -- Scheme Procedure: revery pred?
     The reducer version of every.  Stops the transduction and returns
     ‘(reduced #f)’ if any ‘(pred? value)’ returns #f.  If every ‘(pred?
     value)’ returns true, it returns the result of the last invocation
     of ‘(pred? value)’.  The identity is #t.

          (list-transduce
            (tmap (lambda (x) (+ x 1)))
            (revery (lambda (v) (if (odd? v) v #f)))

 -- Scheme Procedure: rcount
     A simple counting reducer.  Counts the values that pass through the
     transduction.

     argument and either producing that same argument or a replacement
     value.

     Returns a transducer which checks for the presence of any value
     passed through it in mapping.  If a mapping is found, the value of
     that mapping is returned, otherwise it just returns the original
     value.

     Does not keep internal state, but modifying the mapping while it’s
     in use by treplace is an error.

 -- Scheme Procedure: ttake-while pred?
 -- Scheme Procedure: ttake-while pred? retf
     Returns a transducer that stops the transduction after PRED? has
     returned #f.  Any subsequent values are ignored and the last

     whenever PRED? returns false.  The arguments passed are the result
     so far and the input for which pred?  returns ‘#f’.  The default
     function is ‘(lambda (result input) result)’.

     When the transduction stops, it flushes any remaining collection,
     even if it contains fewer than N elements.

     Stateful.

 -- Scheme Procedure: tpartition pred?
     Returns a transducer that groups inputs in lists by whenever
     ‘(pred? input)’ changes value.

     Stateful.

 -- Scheme Procedure: tadd-between value
     Returns a transducer which interposes VALUE between each value and
     the next.  This does not compose gracefully with transducers like
     ‘ttake’, as you might end up ending the transduction on ‘value’.

     Stateful.

 -- Scheme Procedure: tenumerate
 -- Scheme Procedure: tenumerate start
     Returns a transducer that indexes values passed through it,
     starting at START, which defaults to 0.  The indexing is done
     through cons pairs like ‘(index . input)’.

          (list-transduce (tenumerate 1) rcons (list 'first 'second 'third))
          ⇒ ((1 . first) (2 . second) (3 . third))

     Stateful.

 -- Scheme Procedure: tlog
 -- Scheme Procedure: tlog logger
     Returns a transducer that can be used to log or print values and
     results.  The result of the LOGGER procedure is discarded.  The
     default LOGGER is ‘(lambda (result input) (write input)
     (newline))’.

     Stateless.

Guile-specific transducers
--------------------------

These transducers are available in the ‘(srfi srfi-171 gnu)’ library,
and are provided outside the standard described by the SRFI-171
document.

 -- Scheme Procedure: tbatch reducer
 -- Scheme Procedure: tbatch transducer reducer
     A batching transducer that accumulates results using REDUCER or
     ‘((transducer) reducer)’ until it returns a reduced value.  This
     can be used to generalize something like ‘tsegment’:

          ;; This behaves exactly like (tsegment 4).
          (list-transduce (tbatch (ttake 4) rcons) rcons (iota 10))
          ⇒ ((0 1 2 3) (4 5 6 7) (8 9))

 -- Scheme Procedure: tfold reducer
 -- Scheme Procedure: tfold reducer seed

     A folding transducer that yields the result of ‘(reducer seed
     value)’, saving its result between iterations.

          (list-transduce (tfold +) rcons (iota 10))
          ⇒ (0 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45)

### 7.5.46.5 Helper functions for writing transducers
.................................................

These functions are in the ‘(srfi srfi-171 meta)’ module and are only
usable when you want to write your own transducers.

 -- Scheme Procedure: reduced value
     Wraps a value in a ‘<reduced>’ container, signalling that the
     reduction should stop.

 -- Scheme Procedure: reduced? value
     Returns #t if value is a ‘<reduced>’ record.

 -- Scheme Procedure: unreduce reduced-container
     Returns the value in reduced-container.

 -- Scheme Procedure: ensure-reduced value
     Wraps value in a ‘<reduced>’ container if it is not already
     reduced.

 -- Scheme Procedure: preserving-reduced reducer
     Wraps ‘reducer’ in another reducer that encapsulates any returned
     reduced value in another reduced container.  This is useful in
     places where you re-use a reducer with [collection]-reduce.  If the
     reducer returns a reduced value, [collection]-reduce unwraps it.
     Unless handled, this leads to the reduction continuing.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-reduce f identity lst
     The reducing function used internally by ‘list-transduce’.  F is a
     reducer as returned by a transducer.  IDENTITY is the identity
     (sometimes called "seed") of the reduction.  LST is a list.  If F
     returns a reduced value, the reduction stops immediately and the
     unreduced value is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-reduce f identity vec
     The vector version of list-reduce.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-reduce f identity str
     The string version of list-reduce.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector-u8-reduce f identity bv
     The bytevector-u8 version of list-reduce.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-reduce f identity reader port
     The port version of list-reduce.  It reduces over port using reader
     until reader returns the EOF object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: generator-reduce f identity gen
     The generator version of list-reduce.  It reduces over ‘gen’ until
     it returns the EOF object

File: guile.info,  Node: R6RS Incompatibilities,  Next: R6RS Standard Libraries,  Up: R6RS Support

7.6.1 Incompatibilities with the R6RS
-------------------------------------

There are some incompatibilities between Guile and the R6RS. Some of
them are intentional, some of them are bugs, and some are simply
unimplemented features.  Please let the Guile developers know if you
find one that is not on this list.

   • The R6RS specifies many situations in which a conforming
     implementation must signal a specific error.  Guile doesn’t really
     care about that too much—if a correct R6RS program would not hit
     that error, we don’t bother checking for it.

   • Multiple ‘library’ forms in one file are not yet supported.  This
     is because the expansion of ‘library’ sets the current module, but
     does not restore it.  This is a bug.

   • R6RS unicode escapes within strings are disabled by default,
     because they conflict with Guile’s already-existing escapes.  The
     same is the case for R6RS treatment of escaped newlines in strings.

     R6RS behavior can be turned on via a reader option.  *Note* String
     Syntax::, for more information.

   • Guile does not yet support Unicode escapes in symbols, such as
     ‘H\x65;llo’ (the same as ‘Hello’), or ‘\x3BB;’ (the same as ‘λ’).

   • A ‘set!’ to a variable transformer may only expand to an
     expression, not a definition—even if the original ‘set!’ expression
     was in definition context.

   • Instead of using the algorithm detailed in chapter 10 of the R6RS,
     expansion of toplevel forms happens sequentially.

     For example, while the expansion of the following set of toplevel
     definitions does the correct thing:

          (begin
           (define even?
             (lambda (x)
               (or (= x 0) (odd? (- x 1)))))
           (define-syntax odd?
             (syntax-rules ()
               ((odd? x) (not (even? x)))))
           (even? 10))
          ⇒ #t

     The same definitions outside of the ‘begin’ wrapper do not:

          (define even?
            (lambda (x)
              (or (= x 0) (odd? (- x 1)))))
          (define-syntax odd?
            (syntax-rules ()
              ((odd? x) (not (even? x)))))
          (even? 10)
          <unnamed port>:4:18: In procedure even?:
          <unnamed port>:4:18: Wrong type to apply: #<syntax-transformer odd?>

     This is because when expanding the right-hand-side of ‘even?’, the
     reference to ‘odd?’ is not yet marked as a syntax transformer, so
     it is assumed to be a function.

     This bug will only affect top-level programs, not code in ‘library’
     forms.  Fixing it for toplevel forms seems doable, but tricky to
     implement in a backward-compatible way.  Suggestions and/or patches
     would be appreciated.

   • The ‘(rnrs io ports)’ module is incomplete.  Work is ongoing to fix
     this.

   • Guile does not prevent use of textual I/O procedures on binary
     ports, or vice versa.  All ports in Guile support both binary and
     textual I/O. *Note* Encoding::, for full details.

   • Guile’s implementation of ‘equal?’ may fail to terminate when
     applied to arguments containing cycles.

   Guile exposes a procedure in the root module to choose R6RS defaults
over Guile’s historical defaults.

 -- Scheme Procedure: install-r6rs!
     Alter Guile’s default settings to better conform to the R6RS.

     While Guile’s defaults may evolve over time, the current changes
     that this procedure imposes are to add ‘.sls’ and ‘.guile.sls’ to
     the set of supported ‘%load-extensions’, to better support R6RS
     conventions.  *Note* Load Paths::.  Also, enable R6RS unicode
     escapes in strings; see the discussion above.

   Finally, note that the ‘--r6rs’ command-line argument will call
‘install-r6rs!’ before calling user code.  R6RS users probably want to
pass this argument to their Guile.

7.6.2 R6RS Standard Libraries
-----------------------------

In contrast with earlier versions of the Revised Report, the R6RS
organizes the procedures and syntactic forms required of conforming
implementations into a set of “standard libraries” which can be imported
as necessary by user programs and libraries.  Here we briefly list the
libraries that have been implemented for Guile.

   We do not attempt to document these libraries fully here, as most of
their functionality is already available in Guile itself.  The
expectation is that most Guile users will use the well-known and
well-documented Guile modules.  These R6RS libraries are mostly useful
to users who want to port their code to other R6RS systems.

   The documentation in the following sections reproduces some of the
content of the library section of the Report, but is mostly intended to
provide supplementary information about Guile’s implementation of the
R6RS standard libraries.  For complete documentation, design rationales
and further examples, we advise you to consult the “Standard Libraries”
section of the Report (*note* R6RS Standard Libraries: (r6rs)Standard
Libraries.).

### 7.6.2.1 Library Usage
.....................

Guile implements the R6RS ‘library’ form as a transformation to a native
Guile module definition.  As a consequence of this, all of the libraries
described in the following subsections, in addition to being available
for use by R6RS libraries and top-level programs, can also be imported
as if they were normal Guile modules—via a ‘use-modules’ form, say.  For
example, the R6RS “composite” library can be imported by:

       (import (rnrs (6)))

       (use-modules ((rnrs) :version (6)))

   For more information on Guile’s library implementation, see (*note*
R6RS Libraries::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: div x y
 -- Scheme Procedure: mod x y
 -- Scheme Procedure: div-and-mod x y
     These procedures accept two real numbers X and Y, where the divisor
     Y must be non-zero.  ‘div’ returns the integer Q and ‘mod’ returns
     the real number R such that X = Q*Y + R and 0 <= R < abs(Y).
     ‘div-and-mod’ returns both Q and R, and is more efficient than
     computing each separately.  Note that when Y > 0, ‘div’ returns
     floor(X/Y), otherwise it returns ceiling(X/Y).

          (div 123 10) ⇒ 12
          (mod 123 10) ⇒ 3
          (div-and-mod 123 10) ⇒ 12 and 3
          (div-and-mod 123 -10) ⇒ -12 and 3
          (div-and-mod -123 10) ⇒ -13 and 7
          (div-and-mod -123 -10) ⇒ 13 and 7
          (div-and-mod -123.2 -63.5) ⇒ 2.0 and 3.8
          (div-and-mod 16/3 -10/7) ⇒ -3 and 22/21

 -- Scheme Procedure: div0 x y
 -- Scheme Procedure: mod0 x y
 -- Scheme Procedure: div0-and-mod0 x y
     These procedures accept two real numbers X and Y, where the divisor
     Y must be non-zero.  ‘div0’ returns the integer Q and ‘mod0’
     returns the real number R such that X = Q*Y + R and -abs(Y/2) <= R
     < abs(Y/2).  ‘div0-and-mod0’ returns both Q and R, and is more
     efficient than computing each separately.

     Note that ‘div0’ returns X/Y rounded to the nearest integer.  When
     X/Y lies exactly half-way between two integers, the tie is broken
     according to the sign of Y.  If Y > 0, ties are rounded toward
     positive infinity, otherwise they are rounded toward negative
     infinity.  This is a consequence of the requirement that -abs(Y/2)
     <= R < abs(Y/2).

          (div0 123 10) ⇒ 12
          (mod0 123 10) ⇒ 3
          (div0-and-mod0 123 10) ⇒ 12 and 3
          (div0-and-mod0 123 -10) ⇒ -12 and 3
          (div0-and-mod0 -123 10) ⇒ -12 and -3
          (div0-and-mod0 -123 -10) ⇒ 12 and -3
          (div0-and-mod0 -123.2 -63.5) ⇒ 2.0 and 3.8
          (div0-and-mod0 16/3 -10/7) ⇒ -4 and -8/21

 -- Scheme Procedure: real-valued? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: rational-valued? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: integer-valued? obj
     These procedures return ‘#t’ if and only if their arguments can,
     respectively, be coerced to a real, rational, or integer value
     without a loss of numerical precision.

     ‘real-valued?’ will return ‘#t’ for complex numbers whose imaginary
     parts are zero.

 -- Scheme Procedure: nan? x
 -- Scheme Procedure: infinite? x
 -- Scheme Procedure: finite? x
     ‘nan?’ returns ‘#t’ if X is a NaN value, ‘#f’ otherwise.
     ‘infinite?’ returns ‘#t’ if X is an infinite value, ‘#f’ otherwise.
     ‘finite?’ returns ‘#t’ if X is neither infinite nor a NaN value,
     otherwise it returns ‘#f’.  Every real number satisfies exactly one
     of these predicates.  An exception is raised if X is not real.

 -- Scheme Syntax: assert expr
     Raises an ‘&assertion’ condition if EXPR evaluates to ‘#f’;
     otherwise evaluates to the value of EXPR.

 -- Scheme Procedure: error who message irritant1 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: assertion-violation who message irritant1 ...
     These procedures raise compound conditions based on their
     arguments: If WHO is not ‘#f’, the condition will include a ‘&who’
     condition whose ‘who’ field is set to WHO; a ‘&message’ condition
     will be included with a ‘message’ field equal to MESSAGE; an
     ‘&irritants’ condition will be included with its ‘irritants’ list
     given by ‘irritant1 ...’.

     ‘error’ produces a compound condition with the simple conditions
     described above, as well as an ‘&error’ condition;
     ‘assertion-violation’ produces one that includes an ‘&assertion’
     condition.

### 7.6.2.3 rnrs unicode
....................

The ‘(rnrs unicode (6))’ library provides procedures for manipulating
Unicode characters and strings.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-upcase char
 -- Scheme Procedure: char-downcase char
 -- Scheme Procedure: char-titlecase char
 -- Scheme Procedure: char-foldcase char
     These procedures translate their arguments from one Unicode
     character set to another.  ‘char-upcase’, ‘char-downcase’, and
     ‘char-titlecase’ are identical to their counterparts in the Guile
     core library; *Note* Characters::, for documentation.

     ‘char-foldcase’ returns the result of applying ‘char-upcase’ to its
     argument, followed by ‘char-downcase’—except in the case of the
     Turkic characters ‘U+0130’ and ‘U+0131’, for which the procedure
     acts as the identity function.

 -- Scheme Procedure: char-ci=? char1 char2 char3 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: char-ci<? char1 char2 char3 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: char-ci>? char1 char2 char3 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: char-ci<=? char1 char2 char3 ...

### 7.6.2.5 rnrs lists
..................

The ‘(rnrs lists (6))’ library provides procedures additional procedures
for working with lists.

 -- Scheme Procedure: find proc list
     This procedure is identical to the one defined in Guile’s SRFI-1
     implementation.  *Note* SRFI-1 Searching::, for documentation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: for-all proc list1 list2 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: exists proc list1 list2 ...

     The ‘for-all’ procedure is identical to the ‘every’ procedure
     defined by SRFI-1; the ‘exists’ procedure is identical to SRFI-1’s
     ‘any’.  *Note* SRFI-1 Searching::, for documentation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: filter proc list
 -- Scheme Procedure: partition proc list
     These procedures are identical to the ones provided by SRFI-1.
     *Note* List Modification::, for a description of ‘filter’; *Note*
     SRFI-1 Filtering and Partitioning::, for ‘partition’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fold-right combine nil list1 list2 ...
     This procedure is identical the ‘fold-right’ procedure provided by
     SRFI-1.  *Note* SRFI-1 Fold and Map::, for documentation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fold-left combine nil list1 list2 ...
     This procedure is like ‘fold’ from SRFI-1, but COMBINE is called
     with the seed as the first argument.  *Note* SRFI-1 Fold and Map::,
     for documentation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: remp proc list
 -- Scheme Procedure: remove obj list
 -- Scheme Procedure: remv obj list
 -- Scheme Procedure: remq obj list
     ‘remove’, ‘remv’, and ‘remq’ are identical to the ‘delete’, ‘delv’,
     and ‘delq’ procedures provided by Guile’s core library, (*note* List
     Modification::).  ‘remp’ is identical to the alternate ‘remove’
     procedure provided by SRFI-1; *Note* SRFI-1 Deleting::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: memp proc list
 -- Scheme Procedure: member obj list
 -- Scheme Procedure: memv obj list
 -- Scheme Procedure: memq obj list
     ‘member’, ‘memv’, and ‘memq’ are identical to the procedures
     provided by Guile’s core library; *Note* List Searching::, for their
     documentation.  ‘memp’ uses the specified predicate function ‘proc’
     to test elements of the list LIST—it behaves similarly to ‘find’,
     except that it returns the first sublist of LIST whose ‘car’
     satisfies PROC.

 -- Scheme Procedure: assp proc alist
 -- Scheme Procedure: assoc obj alist
 -- Scheme Procedure: assv obj alist
 -- Scheme Procedure: assq obj alist
     ‘assoc’, ‘assv’, and ‘assq’ are identical to the procedures

### 7.6.2.6 rnrs sorting
....................

The ‘(rnrs sorting (6))’ library provides procedures for sorting lists
and vectors.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list-sort proc list
 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-sort proc vector
     These procedures return their input sorted in ascending order,
     without modifying the original data.  PROC must be a procedure that
     takes two elements from the input list or vector as arguments, and
     returns a true value if the first is “less” than the second, ‘#f’
     otherwise.  ‘list-sort’ returns a list; ‘vector-sort’ returns a
     vector.

     Both ‘list-sort’ and ‘vector-sort’ are implemented in terms of the
     ‘stable-sort’ procedure from Guile’s core library.  *Note*
     Sorting::, for a discussion of the behavior of that procedure.

 -- Scheme Procedure: vector-sort! proc vector
     Performs a destructive, “in-place” sort of VECTOR, using PROC as
     described above to determine an ascending ordering of elements.
     ‘vector-sort!’ returns an unspecified value.

     This procedure is implemented in terms of the ‘sort!’ procedure
     from Guile’s core library.  *Note* Sorting::, for more information.

### 7.6.2.7 rnrs control
....................

The ‘(rnrs control (6))’ library provides syntactic forms useful for
constructing conditional expressions and controlling the flow of
execution.

 -- Scheme Syntax: when test expression1 expression2 ...
 -- Scheme Syntax: unless test expression1 expression2 ...
     The ‘when’ form is evaluated by evaluating the specified TEST
     expression; if the result is a true value, the EXPRESSIONs that
     follow it are evaluated in order, and the value of the final
     EXPRESSION becomes the value of the entire ‘when’ expression.

     The ‘unless’ form behaves similarly, with the exception that the
     specified EXPRESSIONs are only evaluated if the value of TEST is
     false.

 -- Scheme Syntax: do ((variable init step) ...) (test expression ...)
          command ...
     This form is identical to the one provided by Guile’s core library.
     *Note* while do::, for documentation.

 -- Scheme Syntax: case-lambda clause ...
     This form is identical to the one provided by Guile’s core library.
     *Note* Case-lambda::, for documentation.

### 7.6.2.8 R6RS Records
....................

The manual sections below describe Guile’s implementation of R6RS
records, which provide support for user-defined data types.  The R6RS
records API provides a superset of the features provided by Guile’s
“native” records, as well as those of the SRFI-9 records API; *Note*
Records::, and *note* SRFI-9 Records::, for a description of those
interfaces.

   As with SRFI-9 and Guile’s native records, R6RS records are
constructed using a record-type descriptor that specifies attributes
like the record’s name, its fields, and the mutability of those fields.

   R6RS records extend this framework to support single inheritance via
the specification of a “parent” type for a record type at definition
time.  Accessors and mutator procedures for the fields of a parent type
may be applied to records of a subtype of this parent.  A record type
may be “sealed”, in which case it cannot be used as the parent of
another record type.

   The inheritance mechanism for record types also informs the process
of initializing the fields of a record and its parents.  Constructor
procedures that generate new instances of a record type are obtained
from a record constructor descriptor, which encapsulates the record-type
descriptor of the record to be constructed along with a “protocol”
procedure that defines how constructors for record subtypes delegate to
the constructors of their parent types.

   A protocol is a procedure used by the record system at construction
time to bind arguments to the fields of the record being constructed.
The protocol procedure is passed a procedure N that accepts the
arguments required to construct the record’s parent type; this
procedure, when invoked, will return a procedure P that accepts the
arguments required to construct a new instance of the record type itself
and returns a new instance of the record type.

   The protocol should in turn return a procedure that uses N and P to
initialize the fields of the record type and its parent type(s).  This
procedure will be the constructor returned by

   As a trivial example, consider the hypothetical record type ‘pixel’,
which encapsulates an x-y location on a screen, and ‘voxel’, which has
‘pixel’ as its parent type and stores an additional coordinate.  The
following protocol produces a constructor procedure that accepts all
three coordinates, uses the first two to initialize the fields of
‘pixel’, and binds the third to the single field of ‘voxel’.

       (lambda (n)
         (lambda (x y z)
           (let ((p (n x y)))
             (p z))))

   It may be helpful to think of protocols as “constructor factories”
that produce chains of delegating constructors glued together by the
helper procedure N.

   An R6RS record type may be declared to be “nongenerative” via the use
of a unique generated or user-supplied symbol—or “uid”—such that
subsequent record type declarations with the same uid and attributes
will return the previously-declared record-type descriptor.

   R6RS record types may also be declared to be “opaque”, in which case
the various predicates and introspection procedures defined in ‘(rnrs
records introspection)’ will behave as if records of this type are not
records at all.

   Note that while the R6RS records API shares much of its namespace
with both the SRFI-9 and native Guile records APIs, it is not currently
compatible with either.

### 7.6.2.9 rnrs records syntactic
..............................

The ‘(rnrs records syntactic (6))’ library exports the syntactic API for
working with R6RS records.

 -- Scheme Syntax: define-record-type name-spec record-clause ...
     Defines a new record type, introducing bindings for a record-type
     descriptor, a record constructor descriptor, a constructor
     procedure, a record predicate, and accessor and mutator procedures
     for the new record type’s fields.

     NAME-SPEC must either be an identifier or must take the form
     ‘(record-name constructor-name predicate-name)’, where RECORD-NAME,
     CONSTRUCTOR-NAME, and PREDICATE-NAME are all identifiers and
     specify the names to which, respectively, the record-type
     descriptor, constructor, and predicate procedures will be bound.
     If NAME-SPEC is only an identifier, it specifies the name to which
     the generated record-type descriptor will be bound.

     Each RECORD-CLAUSE must be one of the following:

        • ‘(fields field-spec*)’, where each FIELD-SPEC specifies a
          field of the new record type and takes one of the following
          forms:
             • ‘(immutable field-name accessor-name)’, which specifies
               an immutable field with the name FIELD-NAME and binds an
               accessor procedure for it to the name given by
               ACCESSOR-NAME
             • ‘(mutable field-name accessor-name mutator-name)’, which
               specifies a mutable field with the name FIELD-NAME and
               binds accessor and mutator procedures to ACCESSOR-NAME
               and MUTATOR-NAME, respectively
             • ‘(immutable field-name)’, which specifies an immutable
               field with the name FIELD-NAME; an accessor procedure for
               it will be created and named by appending record name and
               FIELD-NAME with a hyphen separator
             • ‘(mutable field-name’), which specifies a mutable field
               with the name FIELD-NAME; an accessor procedure for it
               will be created and named as described above; a mutator
               procedure will also be created and named by appending
               ‘-set!’ to the accessor name
             • ‘field-name’, which specifies an immutable field with the
               name FIELD-NAME; an access procedure for it will be
               created and named as described above
        • ‘(parent parent-name)’, where PARENT-NAME is a symbol giving
          the name of the record type to be used as the parent of the
          new record type
        • ‘(protocol expression)’, where EXPRESSION evaluates to a
          protocol procedure which behaves as described above, and is
          used to create a record constructor descriptor for the new
          record type
        • ‘(sealed sealed?)’, where SEALED? is a boolean value that
          specifies whether or not the new record type is sealed
        • ‘(opaque opaque?)’, where OPAQUE? is a boolean value that
          specifies whether or not the new record type is opaque
        • ‘(nongenerative [uid])’, which specifies that the record type
          is nongenerative via the optional uid UID.  If UID is not
          specified, a unique uid will be generated at expansion time
        • ‘(parent-rtd parent-rtd parent-cd)’, a more explicit form of
          the ‘parent’ form above; PARENT-RTD and PARENT-CD should
          evaluate to a record-type descriptor and a record constructor
          descriptor, respectively

 -- Scheme Syntax: record-type-descriptor record-name
     Evaluates to the record-type descriptor associated with the type
     specified by RECORD-NAME.

 -- Scheme Syntax: record-constructor-descriptor record-name
     Evaluates to the record-constructor descriptor associated with the
     type specified by RECORD-NAME.

### 7.6.2.10 rnrs records procedural
................................

The ‘(rnrs records procedural (6))’ library exports the procedural API
for working with R6RS records.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-record-type-descriptor name parent uid
          sealed? opaque? fields
     Returns a new record-type descriptor with the specified
     characteristics: NAME must be a symbol giving the name of the new
     record type; PARENT must be either ‘#f’ or a non-sealed record-type
     descriptor for the returned record type to extend; UID must be
     either ‘#f’, indicating that the record type is generative, or a
     symbol giving the type’s nongenerative uid; SEALED? and OPAQUE?
     must be boolean values that specify the sealedness and opaqueness
     of the record type; FIELDS must be a vector of zero or more field
     specifiers of the form ‘(mutable name)’ or ‘(immutable name)’,
     where name is a symbol giving a name for the field.

     If UID is not ‘#f’, it must be a symbol

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-type-descriptor? obj
     Returns ‘#t’ if OBJ is a record-type descriptor, ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-record-constructor-descriptor rtd
          parent-constructor-descriptor protocol
     Returns a new record constructor descriptor that can be used to
     produce constructors for the record type specified by the
     record-type descriptor RTD and whose delegation and binding
     behavior are specified by the protocol procedure PROTOCOL.

     PARENT-CONSTRUCTOR-DESCRIPTOR specifies a record constructor
     descriptor for the parent type of RTD, if one exists.  If RTD
     represents a base type, then PARENT-CONSTRUCTOR-DESCRIPTOR must be
     ‘#f’.  If RTD is an extension of another type,
     PARENT-CONSTRUCTOR-DESCRIPTOR may still be ‘#f’, but protocol must
     also be ‘#f’ in this case.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-constructor rcd
     Returns a record constructor procedure by invoking the protocol
     defined by the record-constructor descriptor RCD.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-predicate rtd
     Returns the record predicate procedure for the record-type
     descriptor RTD.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-accessor rtd k
     Returns the record field accessor procedure for the Kth field of
     the record-type descriptor RTD.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-mutator rtd k
     Returns the record field mutator procedure for the Kth field of the
     record-type descriptor RTD.  An ‘&assertion’ condition will be
     raised if this field is not mutable.

................................

The ‘(rnrs records inspection (6))’ library provides procedures useful
for accessing metadata about R6RS records.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if the specified object is a non-opaque R6RS record,
     ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-rtd record
     Returns the record-type descriptor for RECORD.  An ‘&assertion’ is

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-type-name rtd
     Returns the name of the record-type descriptor RTD.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-type-parent rtd
     Returns the parent of the record-type descriptor RTD, or ‘#f’ if it
     has none.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-type-uid rtd
     Returns the uid of the record-type descriptor RTD, or ‘#f’ if it
     has none.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-type-generative? rtd
     Returns ‘#t’ if the record-type descriptor RTD is generative, ‘#f’
     otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-type-sealed? rtd
     Returns ‘#t’ if the record-type descriptor RTD is sealed, ‘#f’
     otherwise.

     otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-type-field-names rtd
     Returns a vector of symbols giving the names of the fields defined
     by the record-type descriptor RTD (and not any of its sub- or
     supertypes).

 -- Scheme Procedure: record-field-mutable? rtd k
     Returns ‘#t’ if the field at index K of the record-type descriptor
     RTD (and not any of its sub- or supertypes) is mutable.

### 7.6.2.12 rnrs exceptions
........................

The ‘(rnrs exceptions (6))’ library provides functionality related to
signaling and handling exceptional situations.  This functionality
re-exports Guile’s core exception-handling primitives.  *Note*
Exceptions::, for a full discussion.  *Note* SRFI-34::, for a similar
pre-R6RS facility.  In Guile, SRFI-34, SRFI-35, and R6RS exception
handling are all built on the same core facilities, and so are
interoperable.

 -- Scheme Procedure: with-exception-handler handler thunk
     *Note* Raising and Handling Exceptions::, for more information on
     ‘with-exception-handler’.

 -- Scheme Syntax: guard (variable clause1 clause2 ...) body
     Evaluates the expression given by BODY, first creating an ad hoc
     exception handler that binds a raised exception to VARIABLE and
     then evaluates the specified CLAUSEs as if they were part of a
     ‘cond’ expression, with the value of the first matching clause
     becoming the value of the ‘guard’ expression (*note*
     Conditionals::).  If none of the clause’s test expressions
     evaluates to ‘#t’, the exception is re-raised, with the exception
     handler that was current before the evaluation of the ‘guard’ form.

     For example, the expression

          (guard (ex ((eq? ex 'foo) 'bar) ((eq? ex 'bar) 'baz))
            (raise 'bar))

     evaluates to ‘baz’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: raise obj
     Equivalent to core Guile ‘(raise-exception OBJ)’.  *Note* Raising
     and Handling Exceptions::.  (Unfortunately, ‘raise’ is already
     bound to a different function in core Guile.  *Note* Signals::.)

 -- Scheme Procedure: raise-continuable obj
     Equivalent to core Guile ‘(raise-exception OBJ #:continuable? #t)’.
     *Note* Raising and Handling Exceptions::.

### 7.6.2.13 rnrs conditions
........................

The ‘(rnrs condition (6))’ library provides forms and procedures for
constructing new condition types, as well as a library of pre-defined
condition types that represent a variety of common exceptional
situations.  Conditions are records of a subtype of the ‘&condition’
record type, which is neither sealed nor opaque.  *Note* R6RS Records::.

   Conditions may be manipulated singly, as “simple conditions”, or when
composed with other conditions to form “compound conditions”.  Compound
conditions do not “nest”—constructing a new compound condition out of
existing compound conditions will “flatten” them into their component
simple conditions.  For example, making a new condition out of a
‘&message’ condition and a compound condition that contains an
‘&assertion’ condition and another ‘&message’ condition will produce a
compound condition that contains two ‘&message’ conditions and one
‘&assertion’ condition.

   The record type predicates and field accessors described below can
operate on either simple or compound conditions.  In the latter case,
the predicate returns ‘#t’ if the compound condition contains a
component simple condition of the appropriate type; the field accessors
return the requisite fields from the first component simple condition
found to be of the appropriate type.

   Guile’s R6RS layer uses core exception types from the ‘(ice-9
exceptions)’ module as the basis for its R6RS condition system.  Guile
prefers to use the term “exception object” and “exception type” rather
than “condition” or “condition type”, but that’s just a naming
difference.  Guile also has different names for the types in the
condition hierarchy.  *Note* Exception Objects::, for full details.

   This library is quite similar to the SRFI-35 conditions module (*note*
SRFI-35::).  Among other minor differences, the ‘(rnrs conditions)’
library features slightly different semantics around condition field
accessors, and comes with a larger number of pre-defined condition
types.  The two APIs are compatible; the ‘condition?’ predicate from one
API will return ‘#t’ when applied to a condition object created in the
other.  of the condition types are the same, also.

 -- Condition Type: &condition
 -- Scheme Procedure: condition? obj
     The base record type for conditions.  Known as ‘&exception’ in core
     Guile.

 -- Scheme Procedure: condition condition1 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: simple-conditions condition
     The ‘condition’ procedure creates a new compound condition out of
     its condition arguments, flattening any specified compound
     conditions into their component simple conditions as described
     above.

     ‘simple-conditions’ returns a list of the component simple
     conditions of the compound condition ‘condition’, in the order in
     which they were specified at construction time.

 -- Scheme Procedure: condition-predicate rtd
 -- Scheme Procedure: condition-accessor rtd proc
     These procedures return condition predicate and accessor procedures
     for the specified condition record type RTD.

 -- Scheme Syntax: define-condition-type condition-type supertype
          constructor predicate field-spec ...
     Evaluates to a new record type definition for a condition type with
     the name CONDITION-TYPE that has the condition type SUPERTYPE as
     its parent.  A default constructor, which binds its arguments to
     the fields of this type and its parent types, will be bound to the
     identifier CONSTRUCTOR; a condition predicate will be bound to
     PREDICATE.  The fields of the new type, which are immutable, are
     specified by the FIELD-SPECs, each of which must be of the form:
          (field accessor)
     where FIELD gives the name of the field and ACCESSOR gives the name
     for a binding to an accessor procedure created for this field.

File: guile.info,  Node: R6RS Transcoders,  Next: rnrs io ports,  Prev: R6RS I/O Conditions,  Up: R6RS Standard Libraries

### 7.6.2.15 Transcoders
....................

The transcoder facilities are exported by ‘(rnrs io ports)’.

   Several different Unicode encoding schemes describe standard ways to
encode characters and strings as byte sequences and to decode those
sequences.  Within this document, a “codec” is an immutable Scheme
object that represents a Unicode or similar encoding scheme.

   An “end-of-line style” is a symbol that, if it is not ‘none’,
describes how a textual port transcodes representations of line endings.

   A “transcoder” is an immutable Scheme object that combines a codec
with an end-of-line style and a method for handling decoding errors.
Each transcoder represents some specific bidirectional (but not
necessarily lossless), possibly stateful translation between byte
sequences and Unicode characters and strings.  Every transcoder can
operate in the input direction (bytes to characters) or in the output
direction (characters to bytes).  A TRANSCODER parameter name means that
the corresponding argument must be a transcoder.

   A “binary port” is a port that supports binary I/O, does not have an
associated transcoder and does not support textual I/O. A “textual port”
is a port that supports textual I/O, and does not support binary I/O. A
textual port may or may not have an associated transcoder.

 -- Scheme Procedure: latin-1-codec
 -- Scheme Procedure: utf-8-codec
 -- Scheme Procedure: utf-16-codec

     These are predefined codecs for the ISO 8859-1, UTF-8, and UTF-16
     encoding schemes.

     A call to any of these procedures returns a value that is equal in
     the sense of ‘eqv?’ to the result of any other call to the same
     procedure.

 -- Scheme Syntax: eol-style EOL-STYLE-SYMBOL

     EOL-STYLE-SYMBOL should be a symbol whose name is one of ‘lf’,
     ‘cr’, ‘crlf’, ‘nel’, ‘crnel’, ‘ls’, and ‘none’.

     The form evaluates to the corresponding symbol.  If the name of
     EOL-STYLE-SYMBOL is not one of these symbols, the effect and result
     are implementation-dependent; in particular, the result may be an
     eol-style symbol acceptable as an EOL-STYLE argument to
     ‘make-transcoder’.  Otherwise, an exception is raised.

     All eol-style symbols except ‘none’ describe a specific line-ending
     encoding:

     ‘lf’
          linefeed
     ‘cr’
          carriage return
     ‘crlf’
          carriage return, linefeed
     ‘nel’
          next line
     ‘crnel’
          carriage return, next line
     ‘ls’
          line separator

     For a textual port with a transcoder, and whose transcoder has an
     eol-style symbol ‘none’, no conversion occurs.  For a textual input
     port, any eol-style symbol other than ‘none’ means that all of the
     above line-ending encodings are recognized and are translated into
     a single linefeed.  For a textual output port, ‘none’ and ‘lf’ are
     equivalent.  Linefeed characters are encoded according to the
     specified eol-style symbol, and all other characters that
     participate in possible line endings are encoded as is.

          Note: Only the name of EOL-STYLE-SYMBOL is significant.

 -- Scheme Procedure: native-eol-style
     Returns the default end-of-line style of the underlying platform,
     e.g., ‘lf’ on Unix and ‘crlf’ on Windows.

 -- Condition Type: &i/o-decoding
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-i/o-decoding-error port
 -- Scheme Procedure: i/o-decoding-error? obj
     This condition type could be defined by

          (define-condition-type &i/o-decoding &i/o-port
            make-i/o-decoding-error i/o-decoding-error?)

     An exception with this type is raised when one of the operations
     for textual input from a port encounters a sequence of bytes that
     cannot be translated into a character or string by the input
     direction of the port’s transcoder.

     When such an exception is raised, the port’s position is past the
     invalid encoding.

 -- Condition Type: &i/o-encoding
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-i/o-encoding-error port char
 -- Scheme Procedure: i/o-encoding-error? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: i/o-encoding-error-char condition
     This condition type could be defined by

          (define-condition-type &i/o-encoding &i/o-port
            make-i/o-encoding-error i/o-encoding-error?
            (char i/o-encoding-error-char))

     An exception with this type is raised when one of the operations
     for textual output to a port encounters a character that cannot be
     translated into bytes by the output direction of the port’s
     transcoder.  CHAR is the character that could not be encoded.

 -- Scheme Syntax: error-handling-mode ERROR-HANDLING-MODE-SYMBOL
     ERROR-HANDLING-MODE-SYMBOL should be a symbol whose name is one of
     ‘ignore’, ‘raise’, and ‘replace’.  The form evaluates to the
     corresponding symbol.  If ERROR-HANDLING-MODE-SYMBOL is not one of
     these identifiers, effect and result are implementation-dependent:
     The result may be an error-handling-mode symbol acceptable as a
     HANDLING-MODE argument to ‘make-transcoder’.  If it is not
     acceptable as a HANDLING-MODE argument to ‘make-transcoder’, an
     exception is raised.

          Note: Only the name of ERROR-HANDLING-MODE-SYMBOL is
          significant.

     The error-handling mode of a transcoder specifies the behavior of
     textual I/O operations in the presence of encoding or decoding
     errors.

     If a textual input operation encounters an invalid or incomplete
     character encoding, and the error-handling mode is ‘ignore’, an
     appropriate number of bytes of the invalid encoding are ignored and
     decoding continues with the following bytes.

     If the error-handling mode is ‘replace’, the replacement character
     U+FFFD is injected into the data stream, an appropriate number of
     bytes are ignored, and decoding continues with the following bytes.

     If the error-handling mode is ‘raise’, an exception with condition
     type ‘&i/o-decoding’ is raised.

     If a textual output operation encounters a character it cannot
     encode, and the error-handling mode is ‘ignore’, the character is
     ignored and encoding continues with the next character.  If the
     error-handling mode is ‘replace’, a codec-specific replacement
     character is emitted by the transcoder, and encoding continues with
     the next character.  The replacement character is U+FFFD for
     transcoders whose codec is one of the Unicode encodings, but is the
     ‘?’ character for the Latin-1 encoding.  If the error-handling mode
     is ‘raise’, an exception with condition type ‘&i/o-encoding’ is
     raised.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-transcoder codec
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-transcoder codec eol-style
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-transcoder codec eol-style handling-mode
     CODEC must be a codec; EOL-STYLE, if present, an eol-style symbol;
     and HANDLING-MODE, if present, an error-handling-mode symbol.

     EOL-STYLE may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the native
     end-of-line style of the underlying platform.  HANDLING-MODE may be
     omitted, in which case it defaults to ‘replace’.  The result is a
     transcoder with the behavior specified by its arguments.

 -- Scheme procedure: native-transcoder
     Returns an implementation-dependent transcoder that represents a
     possibly locale-dependent “native” transcoding.

 -- Scheme Procedure: transcoder-codec transcoder
 -- Scheme Procedure: transcoder-eol-style transcoder
 -- Scheme Procedure: transcoder-error-handling-mode transcoder
     These are accessors for transcoder objects; when applied to a
     transcoder returned by ‘make-transcoder’, they return the CODEC,
     EOL-STYLE, and HANDLING-MODE arguments, respectively.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bytevector->string bytevector transcoder
     Returns the string that results from transcoding the BYTEVECTOR
     according to the input direction of the transcoder.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string->bytevector string transcoder
     Returns the bytevector that results from transcoding the STRING
     according to the output direction of the transcoder.

### 7.6.2.16 rnrs io ports
......................

Guile’s binary and textual port interface was heavily inspired by R6RS,
so many R6RS port interfaces are documented elsewhere.  Note that R6RS
ports are not disjoint from Guile’s native ports, so Guile-specific
procedures will work on ports created using the R6RS API, and vice
versa.  Also note that in Guile, all ports are both textual and binary.
*Note* Input and Output::, for more on Guile’s core port API. The R6RS
ports module wraps Guile’s I/O routines in a helper that will translate
native Guile exceptions to R6RS conditions; *Note* R6RS I/O Conditions::,
for more.  *Note* R6RS File Ports::, for documentation on the R6RS file
port interface.

   _Note_: The implementation of this R6RS API is not complete yet.

 -- Scheme Procedure: eof-object? obj
     *Note* Binary I/O::, for documentation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: eof-object
     Return the end-of-file (EOF) object.

          (eof-object? (eof-object))
          ⇒ #t

 -- Scheme Procedure: port? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: input-port? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: output-port? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: call-with-port port proc
     *Note* Ports::, for documentation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-transcoder port
     Return a transcoder associated with the encoding of PORT.  *Note*
     Encoding::, and *Note* R6RS Transcoders::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: binary-port? port
     Return ‘#t’ if PORT appears to be a binary port, else return ‘#f’.
     Note that Guile does not currently distinguish between binary and
     textual ports, so this predicate is not a reliable indicator of
     whether the port was created as a binary port.  Currently, it
     returns ‘#t’ if and only if the port encoding is “ISO-8859-1”,
     because Guile uses this encoding when creating a binary port.
     *Note* Encoding::, for more details.

 -- Scheme Procedure: textual-port? port
     Return ‘#t’ if PORT appears to be a textual port, else return ‘#f’.
     Note that Guile does not currently distinguish between binary and
     textual ports, so this predicate is not a reliable indicator of
     whether the port was created as a textual port.  Currently, it
     always returns ‘#t’, because all ports can be used for textual I/O
     in Guile.  *Note* Encoding::, for more details.

 -- Scheme Procedure: transcoded-port binary-port transcoder
     The ‘transcoded-port’ procedure returns a new textual port with the
     specified TRANSCODER.  Otherwise the new textual port’s state is
     largely the same as that of BINARY-PORT.  If BINARY-PORT is an
     input port, the new textual port will be an input port and will
     transcode the bytes that have not yet been read from BINARY-PORT.
     If BINARY-PORT is an output port, the new textual port will be an
     output port and will transcode output characters into bytes that
     are written to the byte sink represented by BINARY-PORT.

     As a side effect, however, ‘transcoded-port’ closes BINARY-PORT in
     a special way that allows the new textual port to continue to use
     the byte source or sink represented by BINARY-PORT, even though
     BINARY-PORT itself is closed and cannot be used by the input and
     output operations described in this chapter.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-position port
     Equivalent to ‘(seek PORT 0 SEEK_CUR)’.  *Note* Random Access::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-has-port-position? port
     Return ‘#t’ is PORT supports ‘port-position’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-port-position! port offset
     Equivalent to ‘(seek PORT OFFSET SEEK_SET)’.  *Note* Random
     Access::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-has-set-port-position!? port
     Return ‘#t’ is PORT supports ‘set-port-position!’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port-eof? input-port
     Equivalent to ‘(eof-object? (lookahead-u8 INPUT-PORT))’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: standard-input-port
 -- Scheme Procedure: standard-output-port
 -- Scheme Procedure: standard-error-port
     Returns a fresh binary input port connected to standard input, or a
     binary output port connected to the standard output or standard
     error, respectively.  Whether the port supports the ‘port-position’
     and ‘set-port-position!’ operations is implementation-dependent.

 -- Scheme Procedure: put-char port char
 -- Scheme Procedure: put-string port string [start [count]]
     *Note* Textual I/O::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: get-datum textual-input-port count
     Reads an external representation from TEXTUAL-INPUT-PORT and
     returns the datum it represents.  The ‘get-datum’ procedure returns
     the next datum that can be parsed from the given
     TEXTUAL-INPUT-PORT, updating TEXTUAL-INPUT-PORT to point exactly
     past the end of the external representation of the object.

     Any _interlexeme space_ (comment or whitespace, *note* Scheme
     Syntax::) in the input is first skipped.  If an end of file occurs
     after the interlexeme space, the end-of-file object is returned.

     If a character inconsistent with an external representation is
     encountered in the input, an exception with condition types
     ‘&lexical’ and ‘&i/o-read’ is raised.  Also, if the end of file is
     encountered after the beginning of an external representation, but
     the external representation is incomplete and therefore cannot be
     parsed, an exception with condition types ‘&lexical’ and
     ‘&i/o-read’ is raised.

 -- Scheme Procedure: put-datum textual-output-port datum
     DATUM should be a datum value.  The ‘put-datum’ procedure writes an
     external representation of DATUM to TEXTUAL-OUTPUT-PORT.  The
     specific external representation is implementation-dependent.
     However, whenever possible, an implementation should produce a
     representation for which ‘get-datum’, when reading the
     representation, will return an object equal (in the sense of
     ‘equal?’) to DATUM.

          Note: Not all datums may allow producing an external
          representation for which ‘get-datum’ will produce an object
          that is equal to the original.  Specifically, NaNs contained
          in DATUM may make this impossible.

          Note: The ‘put-datum’ procedure merely writes the external
          representation, but no trailing delimiter.  If ‘put-datum’ is
          used to write several subsequent external representations to
          an output port, care should be taken to delimit them properly
          so they can be read back in by subsequent calls to
          ‘get-datum’.

### 7.6.2.17 R6RS File Ports
........................

The facilities described in this section are exported by the ‘(rnrs io
ports)’ module.

 -- Scheme Syntax: buffer-mode BUFFER-MODE-SYMBOL
     BUFFER-MODE-SYMBOL must be a symbol whose name is one of ‘none’,
     ‘line’, and ‘block’.  The result is the corresponding symbol, and
     specifies the associated buffer mode.  *Note* Buffering::, for a
     discussion of these different buffer modes.  To control the amount
     of buffering, use ‘setvbuf’ instead.  Note that only the name of
     BUFFER-MODE-SYMBOL is significant.

     *Note* Buffering::, for a discussion of port buffering.

 -- Scheme Procedure: buffer-mode? obj
     Returns ‘#t’ if the argument is a valid buffer-mode symbol, and
     returns ‘#f’ otherwise.

   When opening a file, the various procedures accept a ‘file-options’
object that encapsulates flags to specify how the file is to be opened.
A ‘file-options’ object is an enum-set (*note* rnrs enums::) over the
symbols constituting valid file options.

   A FILE-OPTIONS parameter name means that the corresponding argument
must be a file-options object.

 -- Scheme Syntax: file-options FILE-OPTIONS-SYMBOL ...

     Each FILE-OPTIONS-SYMBOL must be a symbol.

     The ‘file-options’ syntax returns a file-options object that
     encapsulates the specified options.

     When supplied to an operation that opens a file for output, the
     file-options object returned by ‘(file-options)’ specifies that the
     file is created if it does not exist and an exception with
     condition type ‘&i/o-file-already-exists’ is raised if it does
     exist.  The following standard options can be included to modify
     the default behavior.

     ‘no-create’
          If the file does not already exist, it is not created;
          instead, an exception with condition type
          ‘&i/o-file-does-not-exist’ is raised.  If the file already
          exists, the exception with condition type
          ‘&i/o-file-already-exists’ is not raised and the file is
          truncated to zero length.
     ‘no-fail’
          If the file already exists, the exception with condition type
          ‘&i/o-file-already-exists’ is not raised, even if ‘no-create’
          is not included, and the file is truncated to zero length.
     ‘no-truncate’
          If the file already exists and the exception with condition
          type ‘&i/o-file-already-exists’ has been inhibited by
          inclusion of ‘no-create’ or ‘no-fail’, the file is not
          truncated, but the port’s current position is still set to the
          beginning of the file.

     These options have no effect when a file is opened only for input.
     Symbols other than those listed above may be used as
     FILE-OPTIONS-SYMBOLs; they have implementation-specific meaning, if
     any.

          Note: Only the name of FILE-OPTIONS-SYMBOL is significant.

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-file-input-port filename
 -- Scheme Procedure: open-file-input-port filename file-options
 -- Scheme Procedure: open-file-input-port filename file-options
          buffer-mode
 -- Scheme Procedure: open-file-input-port filename file-options
          buffer-mode maybe-transcoder
     MAYBE-TRANSCODER must be either a transcoder or ‘#f’.

     The ‘open-file-input-port’ procedure returns an input port for the
     named file.  The FILE-OPTIONS and MAYBE-TRANSCODER arguments are
     optional.

     The FILE-OPTIONS argument, which may determine various aspects of
     the returned port, defaults to the value of ‘(file-options)’.

     The BUFFER-MODE argument, if supplied, must be one of the symbols
     that name a buffer mode.  The BUFFER-MODE argument defaults to
     ‘block’.

     If MAYBE-TRANSCODER is a transcoder, it becomes the transcoder
     associated with the returned port.

     If MAYBE-TRANSCODER is ‘#f’ or absent, the port will be a binary
     port and will support the ‘port-position’ and ‘set-port-position!’
     operations.  Otherwise the port will be a textual port, and whether
     it supports the ‘port-position’ and ‘set-port-position!’ operations
     is implementation-dependent (and possibly transcoder-dependent).

          buffer-mode
 -- Scheme Procedure: open-file-output-port filename file-options
          buffer-mode maybe-transcoder
     MAYBE-TRANSCODER must be either a transcoder or ‘#f’.

     The ‘open-file-output-port’ procedure returns an output port for
     the named file.

     The FILE-OPTIONS argument, which may determine various aspects of
     the returned port, defaults to the value of ‘(file-options)’.

     The BUFFER-MODE argument, if supplied, must be one of the symbols
     that name a buffer mode.  The BUFFER-MODE argument defaults to
     ‘block’.

     If MAYBE-TRANSCODER is a transcoder, it becomes the transcoder
     associated with the port.

     If MAYBE-TRANSCODER is ‘#f’ or absent, the port will be a binary
     port and will support the ‘port-position’ and ‘set-port-position!’
     operations.  Otherwise the port will be a textual port, and whether
     it supports the ‘port-position’ and ‘set-port-position!’ operations
     is implementation-dependent (and possibly transcoder-dependent).

### 7.6.2.18 rnrs io simple
.......................

The ‘(rnrs io simple (6))’ library provides convenience functions for
performing textual I/O on ports.  This library also exports all of the
condition types and associated procedures described in (*note* R6RS I/O
Conditions::).  In the context of this section, when stating that a
procedure behaves “identically” to the corresponding procedure in
Guile’s core library, this is modulo the behavior wrt.  conditions: such
procedures raise the appropriate R6RS conditions in case of error, but
otherwise behave identically.

     Note: There are still known issues regarding condition-correctness;
     some errors may still be thrown as native Guile exceptions instead
     of the appropriate R6RS conditions.

### 7.6.2.21 rnrs arithmetic fixnums
................................

The ‘(rnrs arithmetic fixnums (6))’ library provides procedures for
performing arithmetic operations on an implementation-dependent range of
exact integer values, which R6RS refers to as “fixnums”.  In Guile, the
size of a fixnum is determined by the size of the ‘SCM’ type; a single
SCM struct is guaranteed to be able to hold an entire fixnum, making
fixnum computations particularly efficient—(*note* The SCM Type::).  On
32-bit systems, the most negative and most positive fixnum values are,
respectively, -536870912 and 536870911.

   Unless otherwise specified, all of the procedures below take fixnums
as arguments, and will raise an ‘&assertion’ condition if passed a
non-fixnum argument or an ‘&implementation-restriction’ condition if
their result is not itself a fixnum.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fixnum? obj
     Returns ‘#t’ if OBJ is a fixnum, ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fixnum-width
 -- Scheme Procedure: least-fixnum

     value, and the maximum fixnum value.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fx>? fx1 fx2 fx3 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: fx<? fx1 fx2 fx3 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: fx>=? fx1 fx2 fx3 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: fx<=? fx1 fx2 fx3 ...
     These procedures return ‘#t’ if their fixnum arguments are
     (respectively): equal, monotonically increasing, monotonically
     decreasing, monotonically nondecreasing, or monotonically
     nonincreasing; ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fxzero? fx
 -- Scheme Procedure: fxpositive? fx
 -- Scheme Procedure: fxnegative? fx
 -- Scheme Procedure: fxodd? fx
 -- Scheme Procedure: fxeven? fx
     These numerical predicates return ‘#t’ if FX is, respectively,
     zero, greater than zero, less than zero, odd, or even; ‘#f’
     otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fxmax fx1 fx2 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: fxmin fx1 fx2 ...
     These procedures return the maximum or minimum of their arguments.

     Returns the two fixnum results of the following computation:
          (let* ((s (+ fx1 fx2 fx3))
                 (s0 (mod0 s (expt 2 (fixnum-width))))
                 (s1 (div0 s (expt 2 (fixnum-width)))))
            (values s0 s1))

### 7.6.2.22 rnrs arithmetic flonums
................................

The ‘(rnrs arithmetic flonums (6))’ library provides procedures for
performing arithmetic operations on inexact representations of real
numbers, which R6RS refers to as “flonums”.

   Unless otherwise specified, all of the procedures below take flonums
as arguments, and will raise an ‘&assertion’ condition if passed a

     nonincreasing; ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: flinteger? fl
 -- Scheme Procedure: flzero? fl
 -- Scheme Procedure: flpositive? fl
 -- Scheme Procedure: flnegative? fl
 -- Scheme Procedure: flodd? fl
 -- Scheme Procedure: fleven? fl
     These numerical predicates return ‘#t’ if FL is, respectively, an
     integer, zero, greater than zero, less than zero, odd, even, ‘#f’
     otherwise.  In the case of ‘flodd?’ and ‘fleven?’, FL must be an
     integer-valued flonum.

 -- Scheme Procedure: flfinite? fl
 -- Scheme Procedure: flinfinite? fl
 -- Scheme Procedure: flnan? fl
     These numerical predicates return ‘#t’ if FL is, respectively, not

 -- Scheme Procedure: flmin fl1 fl2 ...
     These procedures return the maximum or minimum of their arguments.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fl- fl
 -- Scheme Procedure: fl/ fl1 fl2 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: fl/ fl
     These procedures return, respectively, the difference or quotient
     of their arguments when called with two arguments; when called with
     a single argument, they return the additive or multiplicative
     inverse of FL.

 -- Scheme Procedure: flabs fl
     Returns the absolute value of FL.

 -- Scheme Procedure: fldiv-and-mod fl1 fl2

 -- Scheme Procedure: fldmod fl1 fl2
 -- Scheme Procedure: fldiv0-and-mod0 fl1 fl2

     These procedures return the numerator or denominator of FL as a
     flonum.

 -- Scheme Procedure: flround fl
     These procedures are identical to the ‘floor’, ‘ceiling’,

     for other negative values, a ‘NaN’ value is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: flexpt fl1 fl2
     Returns the value of FL1 raised to the power of FL2.

   The following condition types are provided to allow Scheme
implementations that do not support infinities or ‘NaN’ values to
indicate that a computation resulted in such a value.  Guile supports
both of these, so these conditions will never be raised by Guile’s
standard libraries implementation.

 -- Condition Type: &no-infinities
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-no-infinities-violation obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: no-infinities-violation?
     A condition type indicating that a computation resulted in an
     infinite value on a Scheme implementation incapable of representing

### 7.6.2.23 rnrs arithmetic bitwise
................................

The ‘(rnrs arithmetic bitwise (6))’ library provides procedures for
performing bitwise arithmetic operations on the two’s complement
representations of fixnums.

   This library and the procedures it exports share functionality with
SRFI-60, which provides support for bitwise manipulation of integers
(*note* SRFI-60::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: bitwise-not ei
 -- Scheme Procedure: bitwise-and ei1 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: bitwise-ior ei1 ...
 -- Scheme Procedure: bitwise-xor ei1 ...
     These procedures are identical to the ‘lognot’, ‘logand’, ‘logior’,

     Bitwise Operations::, for documentation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bitwise-if ei1 ei2 ei3
     Returns the bitwise “if” of its arguments.  The bit at position ‘i’
     in the return value will be the ‘i’th bit from EI2 if the ‘i’th bit
     of EI1 is 1, the ‘i’th bit from EI3.

 -- Scheme Procedure: bitwise-bit-count ei

### 7.6.2.24 rnrs syntax-case
.........................

The ‘(rnrs syntax-case (6))’ library provides access to the
‘syntax-case’ system for writing hygienic macros.  With one exception,
all of the forms and procedures exported by this library are
“re-exports” of Guile’s native support for ‘syntax-case’; *Note* Syntax
Case::, for documentation, examples, and rationale.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-variable-transformer proc
     Creates a new variable transformer out of PROC, a procedure that
     takes a syntax object as input and returns a syntax object.  If an
     identifier to which the result of this procedure is bound appears
     on the left-hand side of a ‘set!’ expression, PROC will be called
     with a syntax object representing the entire ‘set!’ expression, and
     its return value will replace that ‘set!’ expression.

 -- Scheme Syntax: syntax-case expression (literal ...) clause ...
     The ‘syntax-case’ pattern matching form.

 -- Scheme Syntax: syntax template
 -- Scheme Syntax: quasisyntax template
 -- Scheme Syntax: unsyntax template
 -- Scheme Syntax: unsyntax-splicing template
     These forms allow references to be made in the body of a
     syntax-case output expression subform to datum and non-datum
     values.  They are identical to the forms provided by Guile’s core
     library; *Note* Syntax Case::, for documentation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: identifier? obj
 -- Scheme Procedure: bound-identifier=? id1 id2
 -- Scheme Procedure: free-identifier=? id1 id2
     These predicate procedures operate on syntax objects representing
     Scheme identifiers.  ‘identifier?’ returns ‘#t’ if OBJ represents
     an identifier, ‘#f’ otherwise.  ‘bound-identifier=?’ returns ‘#t’
     if and only if a binding for ID1 would capture a reference to ID2
     in the transformer’s output, or vice-versa.  ‘free-identifier=?’
     returns ‘#t’ if and only ID1 and ID2 would refer to the same
     binding in the output of the transformer, independent of any
     bindings introduced by the transformer.

 -- Scheme Procedure: generate-temporaries l
     Returns a list, of the same length as L, which must be a list or a
     syntax object representing a list, of globally unique symbols.

 -- Scheme Procedure: syntax->datum syntax-object
 -- Scheme Procedure: datum->syntax template-id datum
     These procedures convert wrapped syntax objects to and from Scheme
     datum values.  The syntax object returned by ‘datum->syntax’ shares
     contextual information with the syntax object TEMPLATE-ID.

 -- Scheme Procedure: syntax-violation whom message form
 -- Scheme Procedure: syntax-violation whom message form subform
     Constructs a new compound condition that includes the following
     simple conditions:
        • If WHOM is not ‘#f’, a ‘&who’ condition with the WHOM as its
          field
        • A ‘&message’ condition with the specified MESSAGE
        • A ‘&syntax’ condition with the specified FORM and optional
          SUBFORM fields

### 7.6.2.25 rnrs hashtables
........................

The ‘(rnrs hashtables (6))’ library provides structures and procedures
for creating and accessing hash tables.  The hash tables API defined by
R6RS is substantially similar to both Guile’s native hash tables
implementation as well as the one provided by SRFI-69; *Note* Hash
Tables::, and *note* SRFI-69::, respectively.  Note that you can write
portable R6RS library code that manipulates SRFI-69 hash tables (by
importing the ‘(srfi :69)’ library); however, hash tables created by one
API cannot be used by another.

   Like SRFI-69 hash tables—and unlike Guile’s native ones—R6RS hash
tables associate hash and equality functions with a hash table at the
time of its creation.  Additionally, R6RS allows for the creation (via
‘hashtable-copy’; see below) of immutable hash tables.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-eq-hashtable
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-eq-hashtable k
     Returns a new hash table that uses ‘eq?’ to compare keys and
     Guile’s ‘hashq’ procedure as a hash function.  If K is given, it
     specifies the initial capacity of the hash table.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-eqv-hashtable
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-eqv-hashtable k
     Returns a new hash table that uses ‘eqv?’ to compare keys and
     Guile’s ‘hashv’ procedure as a hash function.  If K is given, it
     specifies the initial capacity of the hash table.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-hashtable hash-function equiv
 -- Scheme Procedure: make-hashtable hash-function equiv k
     Returns a new hash table that uses EQUIV to compare keys and
     HASH-FUNCTION as a hash function.  EQUIV must be a procedure that
     accepts two arguments and returns a true value if they are
     equivalent, ‘#f’ otherwise; HASH-FUNCTION must be a procedure that
     accepts one argument and returns a non-negative integer.

     If K is given, it specifies the initial capacity of the hash table.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable? obj
     Returns ‘#t’ if OBJ is an R6RS hash table, ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-size hashtable
     Returns the number of keys currently in the hash table HASHTABLE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-ref hashtable key default
     Returns the value associated with KEY in the hash table HASHTABLE,
     or DEFAULT if none is found.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-set! hashtable key obj
     Associates the key KEY with the value OBJ in the hash table
     HASHTABLE, and returns an unspecified value.  An ‘&assertion’
     condition is raised if HASHTABLE is immutable.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-delete! hashtable key
     Removes any association found for the key KEY in the hash table
     HASHTABLE, and returns an unspecified value.  An ‘&assertion’
     condition is raised if HASHTABLE is immutable.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-contains? hashtable key
     Returns ‘#t’ if the hash table HASHTABLE contains an association
     for the key KEY, ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-update! hashtable key proc default
     Associates with KEY in the hash table HASHTABLE the result of
     calling PROC, which must be a procedure that takes one argument, on
     the value currently associated KEY in HASHTABLE—or on DEFAULT if no
     such association exists.  An ‘&assertion’ condition is raised if
     HASHTABLE is immutable.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-copy hashtable
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-copy hashtable mutable
     Returns a copy of the hash table HASHTABLE.  If the optional
     argument MUTABLE is provided and is a true value, the new hash
     table will be mutable.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-clear! hashtable
 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-clear! hashtable k
     Removes all of the associations from the hash table HASHTABLE.  The
     optional argument K, which specifies a new capacity for the hash
     table, is accepted by Guile’s ‘(rnrs hashtables)’ implementation,
     but is ignored.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-keys hashtable
     Returns a vector of the keys with associations in the hash table
     HASHTABLE, in an unspecified order.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-entries hashtable
     Return two values—a vector of the keys with associations in the
     hash table HASHTABLE, and a vector of the values to which these
     keys are mapped, in corresponding but unspecified order.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-equivalence-function hashtable
     Returns the equivalence predicated use by HASHTABLE.  This
     procedure returns ‘eq?’ and ‘eqv?’, respectively, for hash tables
     created by ‘make-eq-hashtable’ and ‘make-eqv-hashtable’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-hash-function hashtable
     Returns the hash function used by HASHTABLE.  For hash tables
     created by ‘make-eq-hashtable’ or ‘make-eqv-hashtable’, ‘#f’ is
     returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: hashtable-mutable? hashtable
     Returns ‘#t’ if HASHTABLE is mutable, ‘#f’ otherwise.

   A number of hash functions are provided for convenience:

 -- Scheme Procedure: equal-hash obj
     Returns an integer hash value for OBJ, based on its structure and
     current contents.  This hash function is suitable for use with
     ‘equal?’ as an equivalence function.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-hash string
 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-hash symbol
     These procedures are identical to the ones provided by Guile’s core
     library.  *Note* Hash Table Reference::, for documentation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string-ci-hash string
     Returns an integer hash value for STRING based on its contents,
     ignoring case.  This hash function is suitable for use with
     ‘string-ci=?’ as an equivalence function.

### 7.6.2.26 rnrs enums
...................

The ‘(rnrs enums (6))’ library provides structures and procedures for
working with enumerable sets of symbols.  Guile’s implementation defines
an “enum-set” record type that encapsulates a finite set of distinct
symbols, the “universe”, and a subset of these symbols, which define the
enumeration set.

   The SRFI-1 list library provides a number of procedures for
performing set operations on lists; Guile’s ‘(rnrs enums)’
implementation makes use of several of them.  *Note* SRFI-1 Set
Operations::, for more information.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-enumeration symbol-list
     Returns a new enum-set whose universe and enumeration set are both
     equal to SYMBOL-LIST, a list of symbols.

 -- Scheme Procedure: enum-set-universe enum-set
     Returns an enum-set representing the universe of ENUM-SET, an
     enum-set.

 -- Scheme Procedure: enum-set-indexer enum-set
     Returns a procedure that takes a single argument and returns the
     zero-indexed position of that argument in the universe of ENUM-SET,
     or ‘#f’ if its argument is not a member of that universe.

 -- Scheme Procedure: enum-set-constructor enum-set
     Returns a procedure that takes a single argument, a list of symbols
     from the universe of ENUM-SET, an enum-set, and returns a new
     enum-set with the same universe that represents a subset containing
     the specified symbols.

 -- Scheme Procedure: enum-set->list enum-set
     Returns a list containing the symbols of the set represented by
     ENUM-SET, an enum-set, in the order that they appear in the
     universe of ENUM-SET.

 -- Scheme Procedure: enum-set-member? symbol enum-set
 -- Scheme Procedure: enum-set-subset? enum-set1 enum-set2
 -- Scheme Procedure: enum-set=? enum-set1 enum-set2
     These procedures test for membership of symbols and enum-sets in
     other enum-sets.  ‘enum-set-member?’ returns ‘#t’ if and only if
     SYMBOL is a member of the subset specified by ENUM-SET.
     ‘enum-set-subset?’ returns ‘#t’ if and only if the universe of
     ENUM-SET1 is a subset of the universe of ENUM-SET2 and every symbol
     in ENUM-SET1 is present in ENUM-SET2.  ‘enum-set=?’ returns ‘#t’ if
     and only if ENUM-SET1 is a subset, as per ‘enum-set-subset?’ of
     ENUM-SET2 and vice versa.

 -- Scheme Procedure: enum-set-union enum-set1 enum-set2
 -- Scheme Procedure: enum-set-intersection enum-set1 enum-set2
 -- Scheme Procedure: enum-set-difference enum-set1 enum-set2
     These procedures return, respectively, the union, intersection, and
     difference of their enum-set arguments.

 -- Scheme Procedure: enum-set-complement enum-set
     Returns ENUM-SET’s complement (an enum-set), with regard to its
     universe.

 -- Scheme Procedure: enum-set-projection enum-set1 enum-set2
     Returns the projection of the enum-set ENUM-SET1 onto the universe
     of the enum-set ENUM-SET2.

 -- Scheme Syntax: define-enumeration type-name (symbol ...)
          constructor-syntax
     Evaluates to two new definitions: A constructor bound to
     CONSTRUCTOR-SYNTAX that behaves similarly to constructors created
     by ‘enum-set-constructor’, above, and creates new ENUM-SETs in the
     universe specified by ‘(symbol ...)’; and a “predicate macro” bound
     to TYPE-NAME, which has the following form:

          (TYPE-NAME sym)

     If SYM is a member of the universe specified by the SYMBOLs above,
     this form evaluates to SYM.  Otherwise, a ‘&syntax’ condition is
     raised.

The ‘(rnrs (6))’ library is a composite of all of the other R6RS
standard libraries—it imports and re-exports all of their exported
procedures and syntactic forms—with the exception of the following
libraries:

..................

The ‘(rnrs eval (6)’ library provides procedures for performing
“on-the-fly” evaluation of expressions.

 -- Scheme Procedure: eval expression environment
     Evaluates EXPRESSION, which must be a datum representation of a
     valid Scheme expression, in the environment specified by
     ENVIRONMENT.  This procedure is identical to the one provided by
     Guile’s code library; *Note* Fly Evaluation::, for documentation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: environment import-spec ...
     Constructs and returns a new environment based on the specified
     IMPORT-SPECs, which must be datum representations of the import
     specifications used with the ‘import’ form.  *Note* R6RS
     Libraries::, for documentation.

7.7 R7RS Support
================

The R7RS (https://small.r7rs.org/) standard is essentially R5RS
(directly supported by Guile), plus a module facility, plus an
organization of bindings into a standard set of modules.

   Happily, the syntax for R7RS modules was chosen to be compatible with
R6RS, and so Guile’s documentation there applies.  *Note* R6RS
Libraries::, for more information on how to define R6RS libraries, and
their integration with Guile modules.  *Note* Library Usage::, also.

* Menu:

* R7RS Incompatibilities::              Guile mostly implements R7RS.
* R7RS Standard Libraries::             Modules defined by the R7RS.


File: guile.info,  Node: R7RS Incompatibilities,  Next: R7RS Standard Libraries,  Up: R7RS Support

7.7.1 Incompatibilities with the R7RS
-------------------------------------

As the R7RS is a much less ambitious standard than the R6RS (*note* Guile
and Scheme::), it is very easy for Guile to support.  As such, Guile is
a fully conforming implementation of R7RS, with the exception of the
occasional bug and a couple of unimplemented features:

   • The R7RS specifies a syntax for reading circular data structures
     using “datum labels”, such as ‘#0=(1 2 3 . #0#)’.  Guile’s reader
     does not support this syntax currently;
     <https://bugs.gnu.org/38236>.

   • As with R6RS, a number of lexical features of R7RS conflict with
     Guile’s historical syntax.  In addition to ‘r6rs-hex-escapes’ and
     ‘hungry-eol-escapes’ (*note* R6RS Incompatibilities::), the
     ‘r7rs-symbols’ reader feature needs to be explicitly enabled.

   Guile exposes a procedure in the root module to choose R7RS defaults
over Guile’s historical defaults.

 -- Scheme Procedure: install-r7rs!
     Alter Guile’s default settings to better conform to the R7RS.

     While Guile’s defaults may evolve over time, the current changes
     that this procedure imposes are to add ‘.sls’ and ‘.guile.sls’ to
     the set of supported ‘%load-extensions’, to better support R7RS
     conventions.  *Note* Load Paths::.  ‘install-r7rs!’ will also enable
     the reader options mentioned above.

   Finally, note that the ‘--r7rs’ command-line argument will call
‘install-r7rs!’ before calling user code.  R7RS users probably want to
pass this argument to their Guile.

7.7.2 R7RS Standard Libraries
-----------------------------

The R7RS organizes the definitions from R5RS into modules, and also adds
a few new definitions.

   We do not attempt to document these libraries fully here, as unlike
R6RS, there are few new definitions in R7RS relative to R5RS. Most of
their functionality is already in Guile’s standard environment.  Again,
the expectation is that most Guile users will use the well-known and
well-documented Guile modules; these R7RS libraries are mostly useful to
users who want to port their code to other R7RS systems.

   As a brief overview, we note that the libraries defined by the R7RS
are as follows:

‘(scheme base)’
     The core functions, mostly corresponding to R5RS minus the elements
     listed separately below, but plus SRFI-34 error handling (*note*
     SRFI-34::), bytevectors and bytevector ports (*note* Bytevectors::),
     and some miscellaneous other new procedures.
‘(scheme case-lambda)’
     ‘case-lambda’.
‘(scheme char)’
     Converting strings and characters to upper or lower case,
     predicates for if a characer is numeric, and so on.
‘(scheme complex)’
     Constructors and accessors for complex numbers.
‘(scheme cxr)’
     ‘cddr’, ‘cadadr’, and all that.
‘(scheme eval)’
     ‘eval’, but also an ‘environment’ routine allowing a user to
     specify an environment using a module import set.
‘(scheme file)’
     ‘call-with-input-file’ and so on.
‘(scheme inexact)’
     Routines that operate on inexact numbers: ‘sin’, ‘finite?’, and so
     on.
‘(scheme lazy)’
     Promises.
‘(scheme load)’
     The ‘load’ procedure.
‘(scheme process-context)’
     Environment variables.  *Note* SRFI-98::.  Also, ‘commmand-line’,
     ‘emergency-exit’ (like Guile’s ‘primitive-_exit’), and ‘exit’.
‘(scheme r5rs)’
     The precise set of bindings exported by ‘r5rs’, but without
     ‘transcript-off’ / ‘transcript-on’, and also with the auxiliary
     syntax definitions like ‘_’ or ‘else’.  *Note* Syntax Rules::, for
     more on auxiliary syntax.
‘(scheme read)’
     The ‘read’ procedure.
‘(scheme repl)’
     The ‘interaction-environment’ procedure.
‘(scheme time)’
     ‘current-second’, as well as ‘current-jiffy’ and
     ‘jiffies-per-second’.  Guile uses the term “internal time unit” for
     what R7RS calls “jiffies”.
‘(scheme write)’
     ‘display’, ‘write’, as well as ‘write-shared’ and ‘write-simple’.

   For complete documentation, we advise the interested user to consult
the R7RS directly (*note* (r7rs)R7RS::).

7.8 Pattern Matching
====================

The ‘(ice-9 match)’ module provides a “pattern matcher”, written by Alex
Shinn, and compatible with Andrew K. Wright’s pattern matcher found in
many Scheme implementations.

   A pattern matcher can match an object against several patterns and
extract the elements that make it up.  Patterns can represent any Scheme
object: lists, strings, symbols, records, etc.  They can optionally
contain “pattern variables”.  When a matching pattern is found, an
expression associated with the pattern is evaluated, optionally with all
pattern variables bound to the corresponding elements of the object:

     (let ((l '(hello (world))))
       (match l           ;; <- the input object
         (('hello (who))  ;; <- the pattern
          who)))          ;; <- the expression evaluated upon matching
     ⇒ world

   In this example, list L matches the pattern ‘('hello (who))’, because
it is a two-element list whose first element is the symbol ‘hello’ and
whose second element is a one-element list.  Here WHO is a pattern
variable.  ‘match’, the pattern matcher, locally binds WHO to the value
contained in this one-element list—i.e., the symbol ‘world’.  An error
would be raised if L did not match the pattern.

   The same object can be matched against a simpler pattern:

     (let ((l '(hello (world))))
       (match l
         ((x y)
          (values x y))))
     ⇒ hello
     ⇒ (world)

   Here pattern ‘(x y)’ matches any two-element list, regardless of the
types of these elements.  Pattern variables X and Y are bound to,
respectively, the first and second element of L.

   Patterns can be composed, and nested.  For instance, ‘...’ (ellipsis)
means that the previous pattern may be matched zero or more times in a
list:

     (match lst
       (((heads tails ...) ...)
        heads))

This expression returns the first element of each list within LST.  For
proper lists of proper lists, it is equivalent to ‘(map car lst)’.
However, it performs additional checks to make sure that LST and the
lists therein are proper lists, as prescribed by the pattern, raising an
error if they are not.

   Compared to hand-written code, pattern matching noticeably improves
clarity and conciseness—no need to resort to series of ‘car’ and ‘cdr’
calls when matching lists, for instance.  It also improves robustness,
by making sure the input _completely_ matches the pattern—conversely,
hand-written code often trades robustness for conciseness.  And of
course, ‘match’ is a macro, and the code it expands to is just as
efficient as equivalent hand-written code.

   The pattern matcher is defined as follows:

 -- Scheme Syntax: match exp clause1 clause2 ...
     Match object EXP against the patterns in CLAUSE1 CLAUSE2 ... in the
     order in which they appear.  Return the value produced by the first
     matching clause.  If no clause matches, throw an exception with key
     ‘match-error’.

     Each clause has the form ‘(pattern body1 body2 ...)’.  Each PATTERN
     must follow the syntax described below.  Each body is an arbitrary
     Scheme expression, possibly referring to pattern variables of
     PATTERN.

   The syntax and interpretation of patterns is as follows:

        patterns:                       matches:

pat ::= identifier                      anything, and binds identifier

      | ,@pat                           a pattern

   The names ‘quote’, ‘quasiquote’, ‘unquote’, ‘unquote-splicing’, ‘?’,
‘_’, ‘$’, ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘not’, ‘set!’, ‘get!’, ‘...’, and ‘___’ cannot be
used as pattern variables.

   Here is a more complex example:

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-9))

     (let ()
       (define-record-type person
         (make-person name friends)
         person?
         (name    person-name)
         (friends person-friends))

       (letrec ((alice (make-person "Alice" (delay (list bob))))
                (bob   (make-person "Bob" (delay (list alice)))))
         (match alice
           (($ person name (= force (($ person "Bob"))))
            (list 'friend-of-bob name))
           (_ #f))))

     ⇒ (friend-of-bob "Alice")

Here the ‘$’ pattern is used to match a SRFI-9 record of type PERSON
containing two or more slots.  The value of the first slot is bound to
NAME.  The ‘=’ pattern is used to apply ‘force’ on the second slot, and
then checking that the result matches the given pattern.  In other
words, the complete pattern matches any PERSON whose second slot is a
promise that evaluates to a one-element list containing a PERSON whose
first slot is ‘"Bob"’.

   The ‘(ice-9 match)’ module also provides the following convenient
syntactic sugar macros wrapping around ‘match’.

 -- Scheme Syntax: match-lambda clause1 clause2 ...
     Create a procedure of one argument that matches its argument
     against each clause, and returns the result of evaluating the
     corresponding expressions.

          (match-lambda clause1 clause2 ...)
          ≡
          (lambda (arg) (match arg clause1 clause2 ...))

     ((match-lambda
        (('hello (who))
         who))
      '(hello (world)))
     ⇒ world

 -- Scheme Syntax: match-lambda* clause1 clause2 ...
     Create a procedure of any number of arguments that matches its
     argument list against each clause, and returns the result of
     evaluating the corresponding expressions.

          (match-lambda* clause1 clause2 ...)
          ≡
          (lambda args (match args clause1 clause2 ...))

     ((match-lambda*
        (('hello (who))
         who))
      'hello '(world))
     ⇒ world

 -- Scheme Syntax: match-let ((pattern expression) ...) body
     Match each pattern to the corresponding expression, and evaluate
     the body with all matched variables in scope.  Raise an error if
     any of the expressions fail to match.  ‘match-let’ is analogous to
     named let and can also be used for recursive functions which match
     on their arguments as in ‘match-lambda*’.

          (match-let (((x y) (list 1 2))
                      ((a b) (list 3 4)))
            (list a b x y))
          ⇒
          (3 4 1 2)

 -- Scheme Syntax: match-let variable ((pattern init) ...) body
     Similar to ‘match-let’, but analogously to “named let”, locally
     bind VARIABLE to a new procedure which accepts as many arguments as
     there are INIT expressions.  The procedure is initially applied to
     the results of evaluating the INIT expressions.  When called, the
     procedure matches each argument against the corresponding PATTERN,
     and returns the result(s) of evaluating the BODY expressions.
     *Note* Iteration: while do, for more on “named let”.

 -- Scheme Syntax: match-let* ((variable expression) ...) body
     Similar to ‘match-let’, but analogously to ‘let*’, match and bind
     the variables in sequence, with preceding match variables in scope.

          (match-let* (((x y) (list 1 2))
                       ((a b) (list x 4)))
            (list a b x y))
          ≡
          (match-let (((x y) (list 1 2)))
            (match-let (((a b) (list x 4)))
              (list a b x y)))
          ⇒
          (1 4 1 2)

 -- Scheme Syntax: match-letrec ((variable expression) ...) body
     Similar to ‘match-let’, but analogously to ‘letrec’, match and bind
     the variables with all match variables in scope.

   Guile also comes with a pattern matcher specifically tailored to SXML
trees, *Note* sxml-match::.

7.9 Readline Support
====================

Guile comes with an interface module to the readline library (*note*
(readline)Top::).  This makes interactive use much more convenient,
because of the command-line editing features of readline.  Using ‘(ice-9
readline)’, you can navigate through the current input line with the
cursor keys, retrieve older command lines from the input history and
even search through the history entries.

* Menu:

* Loading Readline Support::    How to load readline support into Guile.
* Readline Options::            How to modify readline’s behaviour.
* Readline Functions::          Programming with readline.


File: guile.info,  Node: Loading Readline Support,  Next: Readline Options,  Up: Readline Support

7.9.1 Loading Readline Support
------------------------------

The module is not loaded by default and so has to be loaded and
activated explicitly.  This is done with two simple lines of code:

     (use-modules (ice-9 readline))
     (activate-readline)

   The first line will load the necessary code, and the second will
activate readline’s features for the REPL. If you plan to use this
module often, you should save these to lines to your ‘.guile’ personal
startup file.

   You will notice that the REPL’s behaviour changes a bit when you have
loaded the readline module.  For example, when you press Enter before
typing in the closing parentheses of a list, you will see the
“continuation” prompt, three dots: ‘...’ This gives you a nice visual
feedback when trying to match parentheses.  To make this even easier,
“bouncing parentheses” are implemented.  That means that when you type
in a closing parentheses, the cursor will jump to the corresponding
opening parenthesis for a short time, making it trivial to make them
match.

   Once the readline module is activated, all lines entered
interactively will be stored in a history and can be recalled later
using the cursor-up and -down keys.  Readline also understands the Emacs
keys for navigating through the command line and history.

   When you quit your Guile session by evaluating ‘(quit)’ or pressing
Ctrl-D, the history will be saved to the file ‘.guile_history’ and read
in when you start Guile for the next time.  Thus you can start a new
Guile session and still have the (probably long-winded) definition
expressions available.

   You can specify a different history file by setting the environment
variable ‘GUILE_HISTORY’.  And you can make Guile specific
customizations to your ‘.inputrc’ by testing for application ‘Guile’
(*note* (readline)Conditional Init Constructs::).  For instance to define
a key inserting a matched pair of parentheses,

     $if Guile
       "\C-o": "()\C-b"
     $endif

7.9.2 Readline Options
----------------------

The readline interface module can be tweaked in a few ways to better
suit the user’s needs.  Configuration is done via the readline module’s
options interface, in a similar way to the evaluator and debugging
options (*note* Runtime Options::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: readline-options
 -- Scheme Procedure: readline-enable option-name
 -- Scheme Procedure: readline-disable option-name
 -- Scheme Syntax: readline-set! option-name value
     Accessors for the readline options.  Note that unlike the
     enable/disable procedures, ‘readline-set!’ is syntax, which expects
     an unquoted option name.

   Here is the list of readline options generated by typing
‘(readline-options 'help)’ in Guile.  You can also see the default
values.

     history-file    yes     Use history file.
     history-length  200     History length.
     bounce-parens   500     Time (ms) to show matching opening parenthesis
                             (0 = off).
     bracketed-paste yes     Disable interpretation of control characters
                             in pastes.

   The readline options interface can only be used _after_ loading the
readline module, because it is defined in that module.


File: guile.info,  Node: Readline Functions,  Prev: Readline Options,  Up: Readline Support

7.9.3 Readline Functions
------------------------

The following functions are provided by

     (use-modules (ice-9 readline))

   There are two ways to use readline from Scheme code, either make
calls to ‘readline’ directly to get line by line input, or use the
readline port below with all the usual reading functions.

 -- Function: readline [prompt]
     Read a line of input from the user and return it as a string
     (without a newline at the end).  PROMPT is the prompt to show, or
     the default is the string set in ‘set-readline-prompt!’ below.

          (readline "Type something: ") ⇒ "hello"

 -- Function: set-readline-input-port! port
 -- Function: set-readline-output-port! port
     Set the input and output port the readline function should read
     from and write to.  PORT must be a file port (*note* File Ports::),
     and should usually be a terminal.

     The default is the ‘current-input-port’ and ‘current-output-port’
     (*note* Default Ports::) when ‘(ice-9 readline)’ loads, which in an
     interactive user session means the Unix “standard input” and
     “standard output”.

### 7.9.3.1 Readline Port
.....................

 -- Function: readline-port
     Return a buffered input port (*note* Buffered Input::) which calls
     the ‘readline’ function above to get input.  This port can be used
     with all the usual reading functions (‘read’, ‘read-char’, etc),
     and the user gets the interactive editing features of readline.

     There’s only a single readline port created.  ‘readline-port’
     creates it when first called, and on subsequent calls just returns
     what it previously made.

 -- Function: activate-readline
     If the ‘current-input-port’ is a terminal (*note* ‘isatty?’:
     Terminals and Ptys.) then enable readline for all reading from
     ‘current-input-port’ (*note* Default Ports::) and enable readline
     features in the interactive REPL (*note* The REPL::).

          (activate-readline)
          (read-char)

     ‘activate-readline’ enables readline on ‘current-input-port’ simply
     by a ‘set-current-input-port’ to the ‘readline-port’ above.  An
     application can do that directly if the extra REPL features that
     ‘activate-readline’ adds are not wanted.

 -- Function: set-readline-prompt! prompt1 [prompt2]
     Set the prompt string to print when reading input.  This is used
     when reading through ‘readline-port’, and is also the default
     prompt for the ‘readline’ function above.

     PROMPT1 is the initial prompt shown.  If a user might enter an
     expression across multiple lines, then PROMPT2 is a different
     prompt to show further input required.  In the Guile REPL for
     instance this is an ellipsis (‘...’).

     See ‘set-buffered-input-continuation?!’ (*note* Buffered Input::)
     for an application to indicate the boundaries of logical
     expressions (assuming of course an application has such a notion).

### 7.9.3.2 Completion
..................

 -- Function: with-readline-completion-function completer thunk
     Call ‘(THUNK)’ with COMPLETER as the readline tab completion
     function to be used in any readline calls within that THUNK.
     COMPLETER can be ‘#f’ for no completion.

     COMPLETER will be called as ‘(COMPLETER text state)’, as described
     in (*note* (readline)How Completing Works::).  TEXT is a partial
     word to be completed, and each COMPLETER call should return a
     possible completion string or ‘#f’ when no more.  STATE is ‘#f’ for
     the first call asking about a new TEXT then ‘#t’ while getting
     further completions of that TEXT.

     Here’s an example COMPLETER for user login names from the password
     file (*note* User Information::), much like readline’s own
     ‘rl_username_completion_function’,

          (define (username-completer-function text state)
            (if (not state)
                (setpwent))  ;; new, go to start of database
            (let more ((pw (getpwent)))
              (if pw
                  (if (string-prefix? text (passwd:name pw))
                      (passwd:name pw)     ;; this name matches, return it
                      (more (getpwent)))   ;; doesn't match, look at next
                  (begin
                    ;; end of database, close it and return #f
                    (endpwent)
                    #f))))

 -- Function: apropos-completion-function text state
     A completion function offering completions for Guile functions and
     variables (all ‘define’s).  This is the default completion
     function.

 -- Function: filename-completion-function text state
     A completion function offering filename completions.  This is
     readline’s ‘rl_filename_completion_function’ (*note*
     (readline)Completion Functions::).

 -- Function: make-completion-function string-list
     Return a completion function which offers completions from the
     possibilities in STRING-LIST.  Matching is case-sensitive.

7.10 Pretty Printing
====================

The module ‘(ice-9 pretty-print)’ provides the procedure ‘pretty-print’,
which provides nicely formatted output of Scheme objects.  This is
especially useful for deeply nested or complex data structures, such as
lists and vectors.

   The module is loaded by entering the following:

     (use-modules (ice-9 pretty-print))

   This makes the procedure ‘pretty-print’ available.  As an example how
‘pretty-print’ will format the output, see the following:

     (pretty-print '(define (foo) (lambda (x)
     (cond ((zero? x) #t) ((negative? x) -x) (else
     (if (= x 1) 2 (* x x x)))))))
     ⊣
     (define (foo)
       (lambda (x)
         (cond ((zero? x) #t)
               ((negative? x) -x)
               (else (if (= x 1) 2 (* x x x))))))

 -- Scheme Procedure: pretty-print obj [port] [keyword-options]
     Print the textual representation of the Scheme object OBJ to PORT.
     PORT defaults to the current output port, if not given.

     The further KEYWORD-OPTIONS are keywords and parameters as follows,

     #:display? FLAG
          If FLAG is true then print using ‘display’.  The default is
          ‘#f’ which means use ‘write’ style.  *Note* Scheme Write::.

     #:per-line-prefix STRING
          Print the given STRING as a prefix on each line.  The default
          is no prefix.

     #:width COLUMNS
          Print within the given COLUMNS.  The default is 79.

     #:max-expr-width COLUMNS
          The maximum width of an expression.  The default is 50.

   Also exported by the ‘(ice-9 pretty-print)’ module is
‘truncated-print’, a procedure to print Scheme datums, truncating the
output to a certain number of characters.  This is useful when you need
to present an arbitrary datum to the user, but you only have one line in
which to do so.

     (define exp '(a b #(c d e) f . g))
     (truncated-print exp #:width 10) (newline)
     ⊣ (a b . #)
     (truncated-print exp #:width 15) (newline)
     ⊣ (a b # f . g)
     (truncated-print exp #:width 18) (newline)
     ⊣ (a b #(c ...) . #)
     (truncated-print exp #:width 20) (newline)
     ⊣ (a b #(c d e) f . g)
     (truncated-print "The quick brown fox" #:width 20) (newline)
     ⊣ "The quick brown..."
     (truncated-print (current-module) #:width 20) (newline)
     ⊣ #<directory (gui...>

   ‘truncated-print’ will not output a trailing newline.  If an
expression does not fit in the given width, it will be truncated –
possibly ellipsized(1), or in the worst case, displayed as #.

 -- Scheme Procedure: truncated-print obj [port] [keyword-options]
     Print OBJ, truncating the output, if necessary, to make it fit into
     WIDTH characters.  By default, OBJ will be printed using ‘write’,
     though that behavior can be overridden via the DISPLAY? keyword
     argument.

     The default behaviour is to print depth-first, meaning that the
     entire remaining width will be available to each sub-expression of
     OBJ – e.g., if OBJ is a vector, each member of OBJ.  One can
     attempt to “ration” the available width, trying to allocate it
     equally to each sub-expression, via the BREADTH-FIRST? keyword
     argument.

     The further KEYWORD-OPTIONS are keywords and parameters as follows,

     #:display? FLAG
          If FLAG is true then print using ‘display’.  The default is
          ‘#f’ which means use ‘write’ style.  *note* Scheme Write::.

     #:width COLUMNS
          Print within the given COLUMNS.  The default is 79.

     #:breadth-first? FLAG
          If FLAG is true, then allocate the available width
          breadth-first among elements of a compound data structure
          (list, vector, pair, etc.).  The default is ‘#f’ which means
          that any element is allowed to consume all of the available
          width.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) On Unicode-capable ports, the ellipsis is represented by
character ‘HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS’ (U+2026), otherwise it is represented by
three dots.

7.11 Formatted Output
=====================

The ‘format’ function is a powerful way to print numbers, strings and
other objects together with literal text under the control of a format
string.  This function is available from

     (use-modules (ice-9 format))

   A format string is generally more compact and easier than using just
the standard procedures like ‘display’, ‘write’ and ‘newline’.
Parameters in the output string allow various output styles, and
parameters can be taken from the arguments for runtime flexibility.

   ‘format’ is similar to the Common Lisp procedure of the same name,
but it’s not identical and doesn’t have quite all the features found in
Common Lisp.

   C programmers will note the similarity between ‘format’ and ‘printf’,
though escape sequences are marked with ~ instead of %, and are more
powerful.


 -- Scheme Procedure: format dest fmt arg ...
     Write output specified by the FMT string to DEST.  DEST can be an
     output port, ‘#t’ for ‘current-output-port’ (*note* Default
     Ports::), or ‘#f’ to return the output as a string.

     FMT can contain literal text to be output, and ~ escapes.  Each
     escape has the form

          ~ [param [, param...] [:] [@] code

     code is a character determining the escape sequence.  The : and @
     characters are optional modifiers, one or both of which change the
     way various codes operate.  Optional parameters are accepted by
     some codes too.  Parameters have the following forms,

     [+/-]number
          An integer, with optional + or -.
     ’ (apostrophe)
          The following character in the format string, for instance ’z
          for z.
     v
          The next function argument as the parameter.  v stands for
          “variable”, a parameter can be calculated at runtime and
          included in the arguments.  Upper case V can be used too.
     #
          The number of arguments remaining.  (See ~* below for some
          usages.)

     Parameters are separated by commas (,).  A parameter can be left
     empty to keep its default value when supplying later parameters.


     The following escapes are available.  The code letters are not
     case-sensitive, upper and lower case are the same.

     ~a
     ~s
          Object output.  Parameters: MINWIDTH, PADINC, MINPAD, PADCHAR.

          ~a outputs an argument like ‘display’, ~s outputs an argument
          like ‘write’ (*note* Scheme Write::).

               (format #t "~a" "foo") ⊣ foo
               (format #t "~s" "foo") ⊣ "foo"

          ~:a and ~:s put objects that don’t have an external
          representation in quotes like a string.

               (format #t "~:a" car) ⊣ "#<primitive-procedure car>"

          If the output is less than MINWIDTH characters (default 0),
          it’s padded on the right with PADCHAR (default space).  ~@a
          and ~@s put the padding on the left instead.

               (format #f "~5a" 'abc)       ⇒ "abc  "
               (format #f "~5,,,'-@a" 'abc) ⇒ "--abc"

          MINPAD is a minimum for the padding then plus a multiple of
          PADINC.  Ie. the padding is MINPAD + N * PADINC, where N is
          the smallest integer making the total object plus padding
          greater than or equal to MINWIDTH.  The default MINPAD is 0
          and the default PADINC is 1 (imposing no minimum or multiple).

               (format #f "~5,1,4a" 'abc) ⇒ "abc    "

     ~c
          Character.  Parameter: CHARNUM.

          Output a character.  The default is to simply output, as per
          ‘write-char’ (*note* Venerable Port Interfaces::).  ~@c prints
          in ‘write’ style.  ~:c prints control characters (ASCII 0 to
          31) in ^X form.

               (format #t "~c" #\z)        ⊣ z
               (format #t "~@c" #\z)       ⊣ #\z
               (format #t "~:c" #\newline) ⊣ ^J

          If the CHARNUM parameter is given then an argument is not
          taken but instead the character is ‘(integer->char CHARNUM)’
          (*note* Characters::).  This can be used for instance to output
          characters given by their ASCII code.

               (format #t "~65c")  ⊣ A

     ~d
     ~x
     ~o
     ~b
          Integer.  Parameters: MINWIDTH, PADCHAR, COMMACHAR,
          COMMAWIDTH.

          Output an integer argument as a decimal, hexadecimal, octal or
          binary integer (respectively), in a locale-independent way.

               (format #t "~d" 123) ⊣ 123

          ~@d etc shows a + sign is shown on positive numbers.

               (format #t "~@b" 12) ⊣ +1100

          If the output is less than the MINWIDTH parameter (default no
          minimum), it’s padded on the left with the PADCHAR parameter
          (default space).

               (format #t "~5,'*d" 12)   ⊣ ***12
               (format #t "~5,'0d" 12)   ⊣ 00012
               (format #t "~3d"    1234) ⊣ 1234

          ~:d adds commas (or the COMMACHAR parameter) every three
          digits (or the COMMAWIDTH parameter many).  However, when your
          intent is to write numbers in a way that follows typographical
          conventions, using ~h is recommended.

               (format #t "~:d" 1234567)         ⊣ 1,234,567
               (format #t "~10,'*,'/,2:d" 12345) ⊣ ***1/23/45

          Hexadecimal ~x output is in lower case, but the ~( and ~) case
          conversion directives described below can be used to get upper
          case.

               (format #t "~x"       65261) ⊣ feed
               (format #t "~:@(~x~)" 65261) ⊣ FEED

     ~r
          Integer in words, roman numerals, or a specified radix.
          Parameters: RADIX, MINWIDTH, PADCHAR, COMMACHAR, COMMAWIDTH.

          With no parameters output is in words as a cardinal like
          “ten”, or ~:r prints an ordinal like “tenth”.

               (format #t "~r" 9)  ⊣ nine        ;; cardinal
               (format #t "~r" -9) ⊣ minus nine  ;; cardinal
               (format #t "~:r" 9) ⊣ ninth       ;; ordinal

          And also with no parameters, ~@r gives roman numerals and ~:@r
          gives old roman numerals.  In old roman numerals there’s no
          “subtraction”, so 9 is VIIII instead of IX. In both cases only
          positive numbers can be output.

               (format #t "~@r" 89)  ⊣ LXXXIX     ;; roman
               (format #t "~:@r" 89) ⊣ LXXXVIIII  ;; old roman

          When a parameter is given it means numeric output in the
          specified RADIX.  The modifiers and parameters following the
          radix are the same as described for ~d etc above.

               (format #f "~3r" 27)   ⇒ "1000"    ;; base 3
               (format #f "~3,5r" 26) ⇒ "  222"   ;; base 3 width 5

     ~f
          Fixed-point float.  Parameters: WIDTH, DECIMALS, SCALE,
          OVERFLOWCHAR, PADCHAR.

          Output a number or number string in fixed-point format, ie.
          with a decimal point.

               (format #t "~f" 5)      ⊣ 5.0
               (format #t "~f" "123")  ⊣ 123.0
               (format #t "~f" "1e-1") ⊣ 0.1

          ~@f prints a + sign on positive numbers (including zero).

               (format #t "~@f" 0) ⊣ +0.0

          If the output is less than WIDTH characters it’s padded on the
          left with PADCHAR (space by default).  If the output equals or
          exceeds WIDTH then there’s no padding.  The default for WIDTH
          is no padding.

               (format #f "~6f" -1.5)      ⇒ "  -1.5"
               (format #f "~6,,,,'*f" 23)  ⇒ "**23.0"
               (format #f "~6f" 1234567.0) ⇒ "1234567.0"

          DECIMALS is how many digits to print after the decimal point,
          with the value rounded or padded with zeros as necessary.
          (The default is to output as many decimals as required.)

               (format #t "~1,2f" 3.125) ⊣ 3.13
               (format #t "~1,2f" 1.5)   ⊣ 1.50

          SCALE is a power of 10 applied to the value, moving the
          decimal point that many places.  A positive SCALE increases
          the value shown, a negative decreases it.

               (format #t "~,,2f" 1234)  ⊣ 123400.0
               (format #t "~,,-2f" 1234) ⊣ 12.34

          If OVERFLOWCHAR and WIDTH are both given and if the output
          would exceed WIDTH, then that many OVERFLOWCHARs are printed
          instead of the value.

               (format #t "~6,,,'xf" 12345) ⊣ 12345.
               (format #t "~5,,,'xf" 12345) ⊣ xxxxx

     ~h
          Localized number(1).  Parameters: WIDTH, DECIMALS, PADCHAR.

          Like ~f, output an exact or floating point number, but do so
          according to the current locale, or according to the given
          locale object when the ‘:’ modifier is used (*note*
          ‘number->locale-string’: Number Input and Output.).

               (format #t "~h" 12345.5678)  ; with "C" as the current locale
               ⊣ 12345.5678

               (format #t "~14,,'*:h" 12345.5678
                       (make-locale LC_ALL "en_US"))
               ⊣ ***12,345.5678

               (format #t "~,2:h" 12345.5678
                       (make-locale LC_NUMERIC "fr_FR"))
               ⊣ 12 345,56

     ~e
          Exponential float.  Parameters: WIDTH, MANTDIGITS, EXPDIGITS,
          INTDIGITS, OVERFLOWCHAR, PADCHAR, EXPCHAR.

          Output a number or number string in exponential notation.

               (format #t "~e" 5000.25) ⊣ 5.00025E+3
               (format #t "~e" "123.4") ⊣ 1.234E+2
               (format #t "~e" "1e4")   ⊣ 1.0E+4

          ~@e prints a + sign on positive numbers (including zero).
          (This is for the mantissa, a + or - sign is always shown on
          the exponent.)

               (format #t "~@e" 5000.0) ⊣ +5.0E+3

          If the output is less than WIDTH characters it’s padded on the
          left with PADCHAR (space by default).  The default for WIDTH
          is to output with no padding.

               (format #f "~10e" 1234.0)     ⇒ "  1.234E+3"
               (format #f "~10,,,,,'*e" 0.5) ⇒ "****5.0E-1"

          MANTDIGITS is the number of digits shown in the mantissa after
          the decimal point.  The value is rounded or trailing zeros are
          added as necessary.  The default MANTDIGITS is to show as much
          as needed by the value.

               (format #f "~,3e" 11111.0) ⇒ "1.111E+4"
               (format #f "~,8e" 123.0)   ⇒ "1.23000000E+2"

          EXPDIGITS is the minimum number of digits shown for the
          exponent, with leading zeros added if necessary.  The default
          for EXPDIGITS is to show only as many digits as required.  At
          least 1 digit is always shown.

               (format #f "~,,1e" 1.0e99) ⇒ "1.0E+99"
               (format #f "~,,6e" 1.0e99) ⇒ "1.0E+000099"

          INTDIGITS (default 1) is the number of digits to show before
          the decimal point in the mantissa.  INTDIGITS can be zero, in
          which case the integer part is a single 0, or it can be
          negative, in which case leading zeros are shown after the
          decimal point.

               (format #t "~,,,3e" 12345.0)  ⊣ 123.45E+2
               (format #t "~,,,0e" 12345.0)  ⊣ 0.12345E+5
               (format #t "~,,,-3e" 12345.0) ⊣ 0.00012345E+8

          If OVERFLOWCHAR is given then WIDTH is a hard limit.  If the
          output would exceed WIDTH then instead that many OVERFLOWCHARs
          are printed.

               (format #f "~6,,,,'xe" 100.0) ⇒ "1.0E+2"
               (format #f "~3,,,,'xe" 100.0) ⇒ "xxx"

          EXPCHAR is the exponent marker character (default E).

               (format #t "~,,,,,,'ee" 100.0) ⊣ 1.0e+2

     ~g
          General float.  Parameters: WIDTH, MANTDIGITS, EXPDIGITS,
          INTDIGITS, OVERFLOWCHAR, PADCHAR, EXPCHAR.

          Output a number or number string in either exponential format
          the same as ~e, or fixed-point format like ~f but aligned
          where the mantissa would have been and followed by padding
          where the exponent would have been.

          Fixed-point is used when the absolute value is 0.1 or more and
          it takes no more space than the mantissa in exponential
          format, ie. basically up to MANTDIGITS digits.

               (format #f "~12,4,2g" 999.0)    ⇒ "   999.0    "
               (format #f "~12,4,2g" "100000") ⇒ "  1.0000E+05"

          The parameters are interpreted as per ~e above.  When
          fixed-point is used, the DECIMALS parameter to ~f is
          established from MANTDIGITS, so as to give a total
          MANTDIGITS+1 figures.

     ~$
          Monetary style fixed-point float.  Parameters: DECIMALS,
          INTDIGITS, WIDTH, PADCHAR.

          Output a number or number string in fixed-point format, ie.
          with a decimal point.  DECIMALS is the number of decimal
          places to show, default 2.

               (format #t "~$" 5)       ⊣ 5.00
               (format #t "~4$" "2.25") ⊣ 2.2500
               (format #t "~4$" "1e-2") ⊣ 0.0100

          ~@$ prints a + sign on positive numbers (including zero).

               (format #t "~@$" 0) ⊣ +0.00

          INTDIGITS is a minimum number of digits to show in the integer
          part of the value (default 1).

               (format #t "~,3$" 9.5)   ⊣ 009.50
               (format #t "~,0$" 0.125) ⊣ .13

          If the output is less than WIDTH characters (default 0), it’s
          padded on the left with PADCHAR (default space).  ~:$ puts the
          padding after the sign.

               (format #f "~,,8$" -1.5)   ⇒ "   -1.50"
               (format #f "~,,8:$" -1.5)  ⇒ "-   1.50"
               (format #f "~,,8,'.:@$" 3) ⇒ "+...3.00"

          Note that floating point for dollar amounts is generally not a
          good idea, because a cent 0.01 cannot be represented exactly
          in the binary floating point Guile uses, which leads to slowly
          accumulating rounding errors.  Keeping values as cents (or
          fractions of a cent) in integers then printing with the scale
          option in ~f may be a better approach.

     ~i
          Complex fixed-point float.  Parameters: WIDTH, DECIMALS,
          SCALE, OVERFLOWCHAR, PADCHAR.

          Output the argument as a complex number, with both real and
          imaginary part shown (even if one or both are zero).

          The parameters and modifiers are the same as for fixed-point
          ~f described above.  The real and imaginary parts are both
          output with the same given parameters and modifiers, except
          that for the imaginary part the @ modifier is always enabled,
          so as to print a + sign between the real and imaginary parts.

               (format #t "~i" 1)  ⊣ 1.0+0.0i

     ~p
          Plural.  No parameters.

          Output nothing if the argument is 1, or ‘s’ for any other
          value.

               (format #t "enter name~p" 1) ⊣ enter name
               (format #t "enter name~p" 2) ⊣ enter names

          ~@p prints ‘y’ for 1 or ‘ies’ otherwise.

               (format #t "pupp~@p" 1) ⊣ puppy
               (format #t "pupp~@p" 2) ⊣ puppies

          ~:p re-uses the preceding argument instead of taking a new
          one, which can be convenient when printing some sort of count.

               (format #t "~d cat~:p" 9)   ⊣ 9 cats
               (format #t "~d pupp~:@p" 5) ⊣ 5 puppies

          ~p is designed for English plurals and there’s no attempt to
          support other languages.  ~[ conditionals (below) may be able
          to help.  When using ‘gettext’ to translate messages
          ‘ngettext’ is probably best though (*note*
          Internationalization::).

     ~y
          Structured printing.  Parameters: WIDTH.

          ~y outputs an argument using ‘pretty-print’ (*note* Pretty
          Printing::).  The result will be formatted to fit within WIDTH
          columns (79 by default), consuming multiple lines if
          necessary.

          ~@y outputs an argument using ‘truncated-print’ (*note* Pretty
          Printing::).  The resulting code will be formatted to fit
          within WIDTH columns (79 by default), on a single line.  The
          output will be truncated if necessary.

          ~:@y is like ~@y, except the WIDTH parameter is interpreted to
          be the maximum column to which to output.  That is to say, if
          you are at column 10, and ~60:@y is seen, the datum will be
          truncated to 50 columns.

     ~?
     ~k
          Sub-format.  No parameters.

          Take a format string argument and a second argument which is a
          list of arguments for that string, and output the result.

               (format #t "~?" "~d ~d" '(1 2))    ⊣ 1 2

          ~@?  takes arguments for the sub-format directly rather than
          in a list.

               (format #t "~@? ~s" "~d ~d" 1 2 "foo") ⊣ 1 2 "foo"

          ~?  and ~k are the same, ~k is provided for T-Scheme
          compatibility.

     ~*
          Argument jumping.  Parameter: N.

          Move forward N arguments (default 1) in the argument list.
          ~:* moves backwards.  (N cannot be negative.)

               (format #f "~d ~2*~d" 1 2 3 4) ⇒ "1 4"
               (format #f "~d ~:*~d" 6)       ⇒ "6 6"

          ~@* moves to argument number N.  The first argument is number
          0 (and that’s the default for N).

               (format #f "~d~d again ~@*~d~d" 1 2) ⇒ "12 again 12"
               (format #f "~d~d~d ~1@*~d~d" 1 2 3)  ⇒ "123 23"

          A # move to the end followed by a : modifier move back can be
          used for an absolute position relative to the end of the
          argument list, a reverse of what the @ modifier does.

               (format #t "~#*~2:*~a" 'a 'b 'c 'd)   ⊣ c

          At the end of the format string the current argument position
          doesn’t matter, any further arguments are ignored.

     ~t
          Advance to a column position.  Parameters: COLNUM, COLINC,
          PADCHAR.

          Output PADCHAR (space by default) to move to the given COLNUM
          column.  The start of the line is column 0, the default for
          COLNUM is 1.

               (format #f "~tX")  ⇒ " X"
               (format #f "~3tX") ⇒ "   X"

          If the current column is already past COLNUM, then the move is
          to there plus a multiple of COLINC, ie. column COLNUM + N *
          COLINC for the smallest N which makes that value greater than
          or equal to the current column.  The default COLINC is 1
          (which means no further move).

               (format #f "abcd~2,5,'.tx") ⇒ "abcd...x"

          ~@t takes COLNUM as an offset from the current column.  COLNUM
          many pad characters are output, then further padding to make
          the current column a multiple of COLINC, if it isn’t already
          so.

               (format #f "a~3,5'*@tx") ⇒ "a****x"

          ~t is implemented using ‘port-column’ (*note* Textual I/O::),
          so it works even there has been other output before ‘format’.

     ~~
          Tilde character.  Parameter: N.

          Output a tilde character ~, or N many if a parameter is given.
          Normally ~ introduces an escape sequence, ~~ is the way to
          output a literal tilde.

     ~%
          Newline.  Parameter: N.

          Output a newline character, or N many if a parameter is given.
          A newline (or a few newlines) can of course be output just by
          including them in the format string.

     ~&
          Start a new line.  Parameter: N.

          Output a newline if not already at the start of a line.  With
          a parameter, output that many newlines, but with the first
          only if not already at the start of a line.  So for instance 3
          would be a newline if not already at the start of a line, and
          2 further newlines.

     ~_
          Space character.  Parameter: N.

          Output a space character, or N many if a parameter is given.

          With a variable parameter this is one way to insert runtime
          calculated padding (~t or the various field widths can do
          similar things).

               (format #f "~v_foo" 4) ⇒ "    foo"

     ~/
          Tab character.  Parameter: N.

          Output a tab character, or N many if a parameter is given.

     ~|
          Formfeed character.  Parameter: N.

          Output a formfeed character, or N many if a parameter is
          given.

     ~!
          Force output.  No parameters.

          At the end of output, call ‘force-output’ to flush any buffers
          on the destination (*note* Buffering::).  ~!  can occur
          anywhere in the format string, but the force is done at the
          end of output.

          When output is to a string (destination ‘#f’), ~!  does
          nothing.

     ~newline (ie. newline character)
          Continuation line.  No parameters.

          Skip this newline and any following whitespace in the format
          string, ie. don’t send it to the output.  This can be used to
          break up a long format string for readability, but not print
          the extra whitespace.

               (format #f "abc~
                           ~d def~
                           ~d" 1 2) ⇒ "abc1 def2"

          ~:newline skips the newline but leaves any further whitespace
          to be printed normally.

          ~@newline prints the newline then skips following whitespace.

     ~( ~)
          Case conversion.  No parameters.

          Between ~( and ~) the case of all output is changed.  The
          modifiers on ~( control the conversion.

               ~( — lower case.
               ~:@( — upper case.

          For example,

               (format #t "~(Hello~)")   ⊣ hello
               (format #t "~:@(Hello~)") ⊣ HELLO

          In the future it’s intended the modifiers : and @ alone will
          capitalize the first letters of words, as per Common Lisp
          ‘format’, but the current implementation of this is flawed and
          not recommended for use.

          Case conversions do not nest, currently.  This might change in
          the future, but if it does then it will be to Common Lisp
          style where the outermost conversion has priority, overriding
          inner ones (making those fairly pointless).

     ~{ ~}
          Iteration.  Parameter: MAXREPS (for ~{).

          The format between ~{ and ~} is iterated.  The modifiers to ~{
          determine how arguments are taken.  The default is a list
          argument with each iteration successively consuming elements
          from it.  This is a convenient way to output a whole list.

               (format #t "~{~d~}"     '(1 2 3))       ⊣ 123
               (format #t "~{~s=~d ~}" '("x" 1 "y" 2)) ⊣ "x"=1 "y"=2

          ~:{ takes a single argument which is a list of lists, each of
          those contained lists gives the arguments for the iterated
          format.

               (format #t "~:{~dx~d ~}" '((1 2) (3 4) (5 6)))
               ⊣ 1x2 3x4 5x6

          ~@{ takes arguments directly, with each iteration successively
          consuming arguments.

               (format #t "~@{~d~}"     1 2 3)       ⊣ 123
               (format #t "~@{~s=~d ~}" "x" 1 "y" 2) ⊣ "x"=1 "y"=2

          ~:@{ takes list arguments, one argument for each iteration,
          using that list for the format.

               (format #t "~:@{~dx~d ~}" '(1 2) '(3 4) '(5 6))
               ⊣ 1x2 3x4 5x6

          Iterating stops when there are no more arguments or when the
          MAXREPS parameter to ~{ is reached (default no maximum).

               (format #t "~2{~d~}" '(1 2 3 4)) ⊣ 12

          If the format between ~{ and ~} is empty, then a format string
          argument is taken (before iteration argument(s)) and used
          instead.  This allows a sub-format (like ~?  above) to be
          iterated.

               (format #t "~{~}" "~d" '(1 2 3)) ⊣ 123

          Iterations can be nested, an inner iteration operates in the
          same way as described, but of course on the arguments the
          outer iteration provides it.  This can be used to work into
          nested list structures.  For example in the following the
          inner ~{~d~}x is applied to ‘(1 2)’ then ‘(3 4 5)’ etc.

               (format #t "~{~{~d~}x~}" '((1 2) (3 4 5))) ⊣ 12x345x

          See also ~^ below for escaping from iteration.

     ~[ ~; ~]
          Conditional.  Parameter: SELECTOR.

          A conditional block is delimited by ~[ and ~], and ~;
          separates clauses within the block.  ~[ takes an integer
          argument and that number clause is used.  The first clause is
          number 0.

               (format #f "~[peach~;banana~;mango~]" 1)  ⇒ "banana"

          The SELECTOR parameter can be used for the clause number,
          instead of taking an argument.

               (format #f "~2[peach~;banana~;mango~]") ⇒ "mango"

          If the clause number is out of range then nothing is output.
          Or the last clause can be ~:; to use that for a number out of
          range.

               (format #f "~[banana~;mango~]"         99) ⇒ ""
               (format #f "~[banana~;mango~:;fruit~]" 99) ⇒ "fruit"

          ~:[ treats the argument as a flag, and expects two clauses.
          The first is used if the argument is ‘#f’ or the second
          otherwise.

               (format #f "~:[false~;not false~]" #f)   ⇒ "false"
               (format #f "~:[false~;not false~]" 'abc) ⇒ "not false"

               (let ((n 3))
                 (format #t "~d gnu~:[s are~; is~] here" n (= 1 n)))
               ⊣ 3 gnus are here

          ~@[ also treats the argument as a flag, and expects one
          clause.  If the argument is ‘#f’ then no output is produced
          and the argument is consumed, otherwise the clause is used and
          the argument is not consumed, it’s left for the clause.  This
          can be used for instance to suppress output if ‘#f’ means
          something not available.

               (format #f "~@[temperature=~d~]" 27) ⇒ "temperature=27"
               (format #f "~@[temperature=~d~]" #f) ⇒ ""

     ~^
          Escape.  Parameters: VAL1, VAL2, VAL3.

          Stop formatting if there are no more arguments.  This can be
          used for instance to have a format string adapt to a variable
          number of arguments.

               (format #t "~d~^ ~d" 1)   ⊣ 1
               (format #t "~d~^ ~d" 1 2) ⊣ 1 2

          Within a ~{ ~} iteration, ~^ stops the current iteration step
          if there are no more arguments to that step, but continuing
          with possible further steps and the rest of the format.  This
          can be used for instance to avoid a separator on the last
          iteration, or to adapt to variable length argument lists.

               (format #f "~{~d~^/~} go"    '(1 2 3))     ⇒ "1/2/3 go"
               (format #f "~:{ ~d~^~d~} go" '((1) (2 3))) ⇒ " 1 23 go"

          Within a ~?  sub-format, ~^ operates just on that sub-format.
          If it terminates the sub-format then the originating format
          will still continue.

               (format #t "~? items" "~d~^ ~d" '(1))   ⊣ 1 items
               (format #t "~? items" "~d~^ ~d" '(1 2)) ⊣ 1 2 items

          The parameters to ~^ (which are numbers) change the condition
          used to terminate.  For a single parameter, termination is
          when that value is zero (notice this makes plain ~^ equivalent
          to ~#^).  For two parameters, termination is when those two
          are equal.  For three parameters, termination is when VAL1 <=
          VAL2 and VAL2 <= VAL3.

     ~q
          Inquiry message.  Insert a copyright message into the output.

          ~:q inserts the format implementation version.


     It’s an error if there are not enough arguments for the escapes in
     the format string, but any excess arguments are ignored.

     Iterations ~{ ~} and conditionals ~[ ~; ~] can be nested, but must
     be properly nested, meaning the inner form must be entirely within
     the outer form.  So it’s not possible, for instance, to try to
     conditionalize the endpoint of an iteration.

          (format #t "~{ ~[ ... ~] ~}" ...)       ;; good
          (format #t "~{ ~[ ... ~} ... ~]" ...)   ;; bad

     The same applies to case conversions ~( ~), they must properly nest
     with respect to iterations and conditionals (though currently a
     case conversion cannot nest within another case conversion).

     When a sub-format (~?)  is used, that sub-format string must be
     self-contained.  It cannot for instance give a ~{ to begin an
     iteration form and have the ~} up in the originating format, or
     similar.


   Guile contains a ‘format’ procedure even when the module ‘(ice-9
format)’ is not loaded.  The default ‘format’ is ‘simple-format’ (*note*
Simple Output::), it doesn’t support all escape sequences documented in
this section, and will signal an error if you try to use one of them.
The reason for two versions is that the full ‘format’ is fairly large
and requires some time to load.  ‘simple-format’ is often adequate too.

     Note: Beware that when ‘(ice-9 format)’ is loaded, it replaces the
     binding for ‘format’ on the toplevel.  If your module loads another
     module that loads ‘(ice-9 format)’, then your module will see the
     ‘format’ function from ‘(ice-9 format)’, even if it does not itself
     import ‘(ice-9 format)’.

     _This is legacy behavior and may be removed in a future Guile
     version._

7.12 File Tree Walk
===================

The functions in this section traverse a tree of files and directories.
They come in two flavors: the first one is a high-level functional
interface, and the second one is similar to the C ‘ftw’ and ‘nftw’
routines (*note* (libc)Working with Directory Trees::).

     (use-modules (ice-9 ftw))

 -- Scheme Procedure: file-system-tree file-name [enter? [stat]]
     Return a tree of the form ‘(FILE-NAME STAT CHILDREN ...)’ where
     STAT is the result of ‘(STAT FILE-NAME)’ and CHILDREN are similar
     structures for each file contained in FILE-NAME when it designates
     a directory.

     The optional ENTER? predicate is invoked as ‘(ENTER? NAME STAT)’
     and should return true to allow recursion into directory NAME; the
     default value is a procedure that always returns ‘#t’.  When a
     directory does not match ENTER?, it nonetheless appears in the
     resulting tree, only with zero children.

     The STAT argument is optional and defaults to ‘lstat’, as for
     ‘file-system-fold’ (see below.)

     The example below shows how to obtain a hierarchical listing of the
     files under the ‘module/language’ directory in the Guile source
     tree, discarding their ‘stat’ info:

          (use-modules (ice-9 match))

          (define remove-stat
            ;; Remove the `stat' object the `file-system-tree' provides
            ;; for each file in the tree.
            (match-lambda
              ((name stat)              ; flat file
               name)
              ((name stat children ...) ; directory
               (list name (map remove-stat children)))))

          (let ((dir (string-append (assq-ref %guile-build-info 'top_srcdir)
                                    "/module/language")))
            (remove-stat (file-system-tree dir)))

          ⇒
          ("language"
           (("value" ("spec.go" "spec.scm"))
            ("scheme"
             ("spec.go"
              "spec.scm"
              "compile-tree-il.scm"
              "decompile-tree-il.scm"
              "decompile-tree-il.go"
              "compile-tree-il.go"))
            ("tree-il"
             ("spec.go"
              "fix-letrec.go"
              "inline.go"
              "fix-letrec.scm"
              "compile-glil.go"
              "spec.scm"
              "optimize.scm"
              "primitives.scm"
              ...))
            ...))

   It is often desirable to process directories entries directly, rather
than building up a tree of entries in memory, like ‘file-system-tree’
does.  The following procedure, a “combinator”, is designed to allow
directory entries to be processed directly as a directory tree is
traversed; in fact, ‘file-system-tree’ is implemented in terms of it.

 -- Scheme Procedure: file-system-fold enter? leaf down up skip error
          init file-name [stat]
     Traverse the directory at FILE-NAME, recursively, and return the
     result of the successive applications of the LEAF, DOWN, UP, and
     SKIP procedures as described below.

     Enter sub-directories only when ‘(ENTER? PATH STAT RESULT)’ returns
     true.  When a sub-directory is entered, call ‘(DOWN PATH STAT
     RESULT)’, where PATH is the path of the sub-directory and STAT the
     result of ‘(false-if-exception (STAT PATH))’; when it is left, call
     ‘(UP PATH STAT RESULT)’.

     For each file in a directory, call ‘(LEAF PATH STAT RESULT)’.

     When ENTER? returns ‘#f’, or when an unreadable directory is
     encountered, call ‘(SKIP PATH STAT RESULT)’.

     When FILE-NAME names a flat file, ‘(LEAF PATH STAT INIT)’ is
     returned.

     When an ‘opendir’ or STAT call fails, call ‘(ERROR PATH STAT ERRNO
     RESULT)’, with ERRNO being the operating system error number that
     was raised—e.g., ‘EACCES’—and STAT either ‘#f’ or the result of the
     STAT call for that entry, when available.

     The special ‘.’ and ‘..’ entries are not passed to these
     procedures.  The PATH argument to the procedures is a full file
     name—e.g., ‘"../foo/bar/gnu"’; if FILE-NAME is an absolute file
     name, then PATH is also an absolute file name.  Files and
     directories, as identified by their device/inode number pair, are
     traversed only once.

     The optional STAT argument defaults to ‘lstat’, which means that
     symbolic links are not followed; the ‘stat’ procedure can be used
     instead when symbolic links are to be followed (*note* stat: File
     System.).

     The example below illustrates the use of ‘file-system-fold’:

          (define (total-file-size file-name)
            "Return the size in bytes of the files under FILE-NAME (similar
          to `du --apparent-size' with GNU Coreutils.)"

            (define (enter? name stat result)
              ;; Skip version control directories.
              (not (member (basename name) '(".git" ".svn" "CVS"))))
            (define (leaf name stat result)
              ;; Return RESULT plus the size of the file at NAME.
              (+ result (stat:size stat)))

            ;; Count zero bytes for directories.
            (define (down name stat result) result)
            (define (up name stat result) result)

            ;; Likewise for skipped directories.
            (define (skip name stat result) result)

            ;; Ignore unreadable files/directories but warn the user.
            (define (error name stat errno result)
              (format (current-error-port) "warning: ~a: ~a~%"
                      name (strerror errno))
              result)

            (file-system-fold enter? leaf down up skip error
                                     0  ; initial counter is zero bytes
                                     file-name))

          (total-file-size ".")
          ⇒ 8217554

          (total-file-size "/dev/null")
          ⇒ 0

   The alternative C-like functions are described below.

 -- Scheme Procedure: scandir name [select? [entry<?]]
     Return the list of the names of files contained in directory NAME
     that match predicate SELECT? (by default, all files).  The returned
     list of file names is sorted according to ENTRY<?, which defaults
     to ‘string-locale<?’ such that file names are sorted in the
     locale’s alphabetical order (*note* Text Collation::).  Return ‘#f’
     when NAME is unreadable or is not a directory.

     This procedure is modeled after the C library function of the same
     name (*note* (libc)Scanning Directory Content::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: ftw startname proc ['hash-size n]
     Walk the file system tree descending from STARTNAME, calling PROC
     for each file and directory.

     Hard links and symbolic links are followed.  A file or directory is
     reported to PROC only once, and skipped if seen again in another
     place.  One consequence of this is that ‘ftw’ is safe against
     circularly linked directory structures.

     Each PROC call is ‘(PROC filename statinfo flag)’ and it should
     return ‘#t’ to continue, or any other value to stop.

     FILENAME is the item visited, being STARTNAME plus a further path
     and the name of the item.  STATINFO is the return from ‘stat’
     (*note* File System::) on FILENAME.  FLAG is one of the following
     symbols,

     ‘regular’
          FILENAME is a file, this includes special files like devices,
          named pipes, etc.

     ‘directory’
          FILENAME is a directory.

     ‘invalid-stat’
          An error occurred when calling ‘stat’, so nothing is known.
          STATINFO is ‘#f’ in this case.

     ‘directory-not-readable’
          FILENAME is a directory, but one which cannot be read and
          hence won’t be recursed into.

     ‘symlink’
          FILENAME is a dangling symbolic link.  Symbolic links are
          normally followed and their target reported, the link itself
          is reported if the target does not exist.

     The return value from ‘ftw’ is ‘#t’ if it ran to completion, or
     otherwise the non-‘#t’ value from PROC which caused the stop.

     Optional argument symbol ‘hash-size’ and an integer can be given to
     set the size of the hash table used to track items already visited.
     (*note* Hash Table Reference::)

     In the current implementation, returning non-‘#t’ from PROC is the
     only valid way to terminate ‘ftw’.  PROC must not use ‘throw’ or
     similar to escape.

 -- Scheme Procedure: nftw startname proc ['chdir] ['depth] ['hash-size
          n] ['mount] ['physical]
     Walk the file system tree starting at STARTNAME, calling PROC for
     each file and directory.  ‘nftw’ has extra features over the basic
     ‘ftw’ described above.

     Like ‘ftw’, hard links and symbolic links are followed.  A file or
     directory is reported to PROC only once, and skipped if seen again
     in another place.  One consequence of this is that ‘nftw’ is safe
     against circular linked directory structures.

     Each PROC call is ‘(PROC filename statinfo flag base level)’ and it
     should return ‘#t’ to continue, or any other value to stop.

     FILENAME is the item visited, being STARTNAME plus a further path
     and the name of the item.  STATINFO is the return from ‘stat’ on
     FILENAME (*note* File System::).  BASE is an integer offset into
     FILENAME which is where the basename for this item begins.  LEVEL
     is an integer giving the directory nesting level, starting from 0
     for the contents of STARTNAME (or that item itself if it’s a file).
     FLAG is one of the following symbols,

     ‘regular’
          FILENAME is a file, including special files like devices,
          named pipes, etc.

     ‘directory’
          FILENAME is a directory.

     ‘directory-processed’
          FILENAME is a directory, and its contents have all been
          visited.  This flag is given instead of ‘directory’ when the
          ‘depth’ option below is used.

     ‘invalid-stat’
          An error occurred when applying ‘stat’ to FILENAME, so nothing
          is known about it.  STATINFO is ‘#f’ in this case.

     ‘directory-not-readable’
          FILENAME is a directory, but one which cannot be read and
          hence won’t be recursed into.

     ‘stale-symlink’
          FILENAME is a dangling symbolic link.  Links are normally
          followed and their target reported, the link itself is
          reported if its target does not exist.

     ‘symlink’
          When the ‘physical’ option described below is used, this
          indicates FILENAME is a symbolic link whose target exists (and
          is not being followed).

     The following optional arguments can be given to modify the way
     ‘nftw’ works.  Each is passed as a symbol (and ‘hash-size’ takes a
     following integer value).

     ‘chdir’
          Change to the directory containing the item before calling
          PROC.  When ‘nftw’ returns the original current directory is
          restored.

          Under this option, generally the BASE parameter to each PROC
          call should be used to pick out the base part of the FILENAME.
          The FILENAME is still a path but with a changed directory it
          won’t be valid (unless the STARTNAME directory was absolute).

     ‘depth’
          Visit files “depth first”, meaning PROC is called for the
          contents of each directory before it’s called for the
          directory itself.  Normally a directory is reported first,
          then its contents.

          Under this option, the FLAG to PROC for a directory is
          ‘directory-processed’ instead of ‘directory’.

     ‘hash-size N’
          Set the size of the hash table used to track items already
          visited.  (*note* Hash Table Reference::)

     ‘mount’
          Don’t cross a mount point, meaning only visit items on the
          same file system as STARTNAME (ie. the same ‘stat:dev’).

     ‘physical’
          Don’t follow symbolic links, instead report them to PROC as
          ‘symlink’.  Dangling links (those whose target doesn’t exist)
          are still reported as ‘stale-symlink’.

     The return value from ‘nftw’ is ‘#t’ if it ran to completion, or
     otherwise the non-‘#t’ value from PROC which caused the stop.

     In the current implementation, returning non-‘#t’ from PROC is the
     only valid way to terminate ‘ftw’.  PROC must not use ‘throw’ or
     similar to escape.

   This module implements queues holding arbitrary scheme objects and
designed for efficient first-in / first-out operations.

   ‘make-q’ creates a queue, and objects are entered and removed with
‘enq!’ and ‘deq!’.  ‘q-push!’ and ‘q-pop!’ can be used too, treating the
front of the queue like a stack.


 -- Scheme Procedure: make-q
     Return a new queue.

 -- Scheme Procedure: q? obj
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ is a queue, or ‘#f’ if not.

     Note that queues are not a distinct class of objects but are
     implemented with cons cells.  For that reason certain list
     structures can get ‘#t’ from ‘q?’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: enq! q obj
     Add OBJ to the rear of Q, and return Q.

 -- Scheme Procedure: deq! q
 -- Scheme Procedure: q-pop! q
     Remove and return the front element from Q.  If Q is empty, a
     ‘q-empty’ exception is thrown.

     ‘deq!’ and ‘q-pop!’ are the same operation, the two names just let
     an application match ‘enq!’ with ‘deq!’, or ‘q-push!’ with
     ‘q-pop!’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: q-push! q obj
     Add OBJ to the front of Q, and return Q.

 -- Scheme Procedure: q-length q
     Return the number of elements in Q.

 -- Scheme Procedure: q-empty? q
     Return true if Q is empty.

 -- Scheme Procedure: q-empty-check q
     Throw a ‘q-empty’ exception if Q is empty.

 -- Scheme Procedure: q-front q
     Return the first element of Q (without removing it).  If Q is
     empty, a ‘q-empty’ exception is thrown.

 -- Scheme Procedure: q-rear q
     Return the last element of Q (without removing it).  If Q is empty,
     a ‘q-empty’ exception is thrown.

 -- Scheme Procedure: q-remove! q obj
     Remove all occurrences of OBJ from Q, and return Q.  OBJ is
     compared to queue elements using ‘eq?’.


   The ‘q-empty’ exceptions described above are thrown just as ‘(throw
'q-empty)’, there’s no message etc like an error throw.

   A queue is implemented as a cons cell, the ‘car’ containing a list of
queued elements, and the ‘cdr’ being the last cell in that list (for
ease of enqueuing).

     (LIST . LAST-CELL)

If the queue is empty, LIST is the empty list and LAST-CELL is ‘#f’.

   An application can directly access the queue list if desired, for
instance to search the elements or to insert at a specific point.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sync-q! q
     Recompute the LAST-CELL field in Q.

     All the operations above maintain LAST-CELL as described, so
     normally there’s no need for ‘sync-q!’.  But if an application
     modifies the queue LIST then it must either maintain LAST-CELL
     similarly, or call ‘sync-q!’ to recompute it.

7.14 Streams
============

This section documents Guile’s legacy stream module.  For a more
complete and portable stream library, *note* SRFI-41::.

   A stream represents a sequence of values, each of which is calculated
only when required.  This allows large or even infinite sequences to be
represented and manipulated with familiar operations like “car”, “cdr”,
“map” or “fold”.  In such manipulations only as much as needed is
actually held in memory at any one time.  The functions in this section
are available from

     (use-modules (ice-9 streams))

   Streams are implemented using promises (*note* Delayed Evaluation::),
which is how the underlying calculation of values is made only when
needed, and the values then retained so the calculation is not repeated.

Here is a simple example producing a stream of all odd numbers,

     (define odds (make-stream (lambda (state)
                                 (cons state (+ state 2)))
                               1))
     (stream-car odds)              ⇒ 1
     (stream-car (stream-cdr odds)) ⇒ 3

‘stream-map’ could be used to derive a stream of odd squares,

     (define (square n) (* n n))
     (define oddsquares (stream-map square odds))

   These are infinite sequences, so it’s not possible to convert them to
a list, but they could be printed (infinitely) with for example

     (stream-for-each (lambda (n sq)
                        (format #t "~a squared is ~a\n" n sq))
                      odds oddsquares)
     ⊣
     1 squared is 1
     3 squared is 9
     5 squared is 25
     7 squared is 49
     ...


 -- Scheme Procedure: make-stream proc initial-state
     Return a new stream, formed by calling PROC successively.

     Each call is ‘(PROC STATE)’, it should return a pair, the ‘car’
     being the value for the stream, and the ‘cdr’ being the new STATE
     for the next call.  For the first call STATE is the given
     INITIAL-STATE.  At the end of the stream, PROC should return some
     non-pair object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-car stream
     Return the first element from STREAM.  STREAM must not be empty.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-cdr stream
     Return a stream which is the second and subsequent elements of
     STREAM.  STREAM must not be empty.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream-null? stream
     Return true if STREAM is empty.

 -- Scheme Procedure: list->stream list
 -- Scheme Procedure: vector->stream vector
     Return a stream with the contents of LIST or VECTOR.

     LIST or VECTOR should not be modified subsequently, since it’s
     unspecified whether changes there will be reflected in the stream
     returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: port->stream port readproc
     Return a stream which is the values obtained by reading from PORT
     using READPROC.  Each read call is ‘(READPROC PORT)’, and it should
     return an EOF object (*note* Binary I/O::) at the end of input.

     For example a stream of characters from a file,

          (port->stream (open-input-file "/foo/bar.txt") read-char)

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream->list stream
     Return a list which is the entire contents of STREAM.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream->reversed-list stream
     Return a list which is the entire contents of STREAM, but in
     reverse order.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream->list&length stream
     Return two values (*note* Multiple Values::), being firstly a list
     which is the entire contents of STREAM, and secondly the number of
     elements in that list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream->reversed-list&length stream
     Return two values (*note* Multiple Values::) being firstly a list
     which is the entire contents of STREAM, but in reverse order, and
     secondly the number of elements in that list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: stream->vector stream
     Return a vector which is the entire contents of STREAM.

 -- Function: stream-fold proc init stream1 stream2 ...
     Apply PROC successively over the elements of the given streams,
     from first to last until the end of the shortest stream is reached.
     Return the result from the last PROC call.

     Each call is ‘(PROC elem1 elem2 ... prev)’, where each ELEM is from
     the corresponding STREAM.  PREV is the return from the previous
     PROC call, or the given INIT for the first call.

 -- Function: stream-for-each proc stream1 stream2 ...
     Call PROC on the elements from the given STREAMs.  The return value
     is unspecified.

     Each call is ‘(PROC elem1 elem2 ...)’, where each ELEM is from the
     corresponding STREAM.  ‘stream-for-each’ stops when it reaches the
     end of the shortest STREAM.

 -- Function: stream-map proc stream1 stream2 ...
     Return a new stream which is the results of applying PROC to the
     elements of the given STREAMs.

     Each call is ‘(PROC elem1 elem2 ...)’, where each ELEM is from the
     corresponding STREAM.  The new stream ends when the end of the
     shortest given STREAM is reached.

7.15 Buffered Input
===================

The following functions are provided by

     (use-modules (ice-9 buffered-input))

   A buffered input port allows a reader function to return chunks of
characters which are to be handed out on reading the port.  A notion of
further input for an application level logical expression is maintained
too, and passed through to the reader.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-buffered-input-port reader
     Create an input port which returns characters obtained from the
     given READER function.  READER is called (READER cont), and should
     return a string or an EOF object.

     The new port gives precisely the characters returned by READER,
     nothing is added, so if any newline characters or other separators
     are desired they must come from the reader function.

     The CONT parameter to READER is ‘#f’ for initial input, or ‘#t’
     when continuing an expression.  This is an application level
     notion, set with ‘set-buffered-input-continuation?!’ below.  If the
     user has entered a partial expression then it allows READER for
     instance to give a different prompt to show more is required.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-line-buffered-input-port reader
     Create an input port which returns characters obtained from the
     specified READER function, similar to ‘make-buffered-input-port’
     above, but where READER is expected to be a line-oriented.

     READER is called (READER cont), and should return a string or an
     EOF object as above.  Each string is a line of input without a
     newline character, the port code inserts a newline after each
     string.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-buffered-input-continuation?! port cont
     Set the input continuation flag for a given buffered input PORT.

     An application uses this by calling with a CONT flag of ‘#f’ when
     beginning to read a new logical expression.  For example with the
     Scheme ‘read’ function (*note* Scheme Read::),

          (define my-port (make-buffered-input-port my-reader))

          (set-buffered-input-continuation?! my-port #f)
          (let ((obj (read my-port)))
            ...

7.16 Expect
===========

The macros in this section are made available with:

     (use-modules (ice-9 expect))

   ‘expect’ is a macro for selecting actions based on the output from a
port.  The name comes from a tool of similar functionality by Don Libes.
Actions can be taken when a particular string is matched, when a timeout
occurs, or when end-of-file is seen on the port.  The ‘expect’ macro is
described below; ‘expect-strings’ is a front-end to ‘expect’ based on
regexec (see the regular expression documentation).

 -- Macro: expect-strings clause ...
     By default, ‘expect-strings’ will read from the current input port.
     The first term in each clause consists of an expression evaluating
     to a string pattern (regular expression).  As characters are read
     one-by-one from the port, they are accumulated in a buffer string
     which is matched against each of the patterns.  When a pattern
     matches, the remaining expression(s) in the clause are evaluated
     and the value of the last is returned.  For example:

          (with-input-from-file "/etc/passwd"
            (lambda ()
              (expect-strings
                ("^nobody" (display "Got a nobody user.\n")
                           (display "That's no problem.\n"))
                ("^daemon" (display "Got a daemon user.\n")))))

     The regular expression is compiled with the ‘REG_NEWLINE’ flag, so
     that the ^ and $ anchors will match at any newline, not just at the
     start and end of the string.

     There are two other ways to write a clause:

     The expression(s) to evaluate can be omitted, in which case the
     result of the regular expression match (converted to strings, as
     obtained from regexec with match-pick set to "") will be returned
     if the pattern matches.

     The symbol ‘=>’ can be used to indicate that the expression is a
     procedure which will accept the result of a successful regular
     expression match.  E.g.,

          ("^daemon" => write)
          ("^d(aemon)" => (lambda args (for-each write args)))
          ("^da(em)on" => (lambda (all sub)
                            (write all) (newline)
                            (write sub) (newline)))

     The order of the substrings corresponds to the order in which the
     opening brackets occur.

     A number of variables can be used to control the behaviour of
     ‘expect’ (and ‘expect-strings’).  Most have default top-level
     bindings to the value ‘#f’, which produces the default behaviour.
     They can be redefined at the top level or locally bound in a form
     enclosing the expect expression.

     ‘expect-port’
          A port to read characters from, instead of the current input
          port.
     ‘expect-timeout’
          ‘expect’ will terminate after this number of seconds,
          returning ‘#f’ or the value returned by expect-timeout-proc.
     ‘expect-timeout-proc’
          A procedure called if timeout occurs.  The procedure takes a
          single argument: the accumulated string.
     ‘expect-eof-proc’
          A procedure called if end-of-file is detected on the input
          port.  The procedure takes a single argument: the accumulated
          string.
     ‘expect-char-proc’
          A procedure to be called every time a character is read from
          the port.  The procedure takes a single argument: the
          character which was read.
     ‘expect-strings-compile-flags’
          Flags to be used when compiling a regular expression, which
          are passed to ‘make-regexp’ *Note* Regexp Functions::.  The
          default value is ‘regexp/newline’.
     ‘expect-strings-exec-flags’
          Flags to be used when executing a regular expression, which
          are passed to regexp-exec *Note* Regexp Functions::.  The
          default value is ‘regexp/noteol’, which prevents ‘$’ from
          matching the end of the string while it is still accumulating,
          but still allows it to match after a line break or at the end
          of file.

     Here’s an example using all of the variables:

          (let ((expect-port (open-input-file "/etc/passwd"))
                (expect-timeout 1)
                (expect-timeout-proc
                  (lambda (s) (display "Times up!\n")))
                (expect-eof-proc
                  (lambda (s) (display "Reached the end of the file!\n")))
                (expect-char-proc display)
                (expect-strings-compile-flags (logior regexp/newline regexp/icase))
                (expect-strings-exec-flags 0))
             (expect-strings
               ("^nobody"  (display "Got a nobody user\n"))))

 -- Macro: expect clause ...
     ‘expect’ is used in the same way as ‘expect-strings’, but tests are
     specified not as patterns, but as procedures.  The procedures are
     called in turn after each character is read from the port, with two
     arguments: the value of the accumulated string and a flag to
     indicate whether end-of-file has been reached.  The flag will
     usually be ‘#f’, but if end-of-file is reached, the procedures are
     called an additional time with the final accumulated string and
     ‘#t’.

     The test is successful if the procedure returns a non-false value.

     If the ‘=>’ syntax is used, then if the test succeeds it must
     return a list containing the arguments to be provided to the
     corresponding expression.

     In the following example, a string will only be matched at the
     beginning of the file:

          (let ((expect-port (open-input-file "/etc/passwd")))
            (expect
               ((lambda (s eof?) (string=? s "fnord!"))
                  (display "Got a nobody user!\n"))))

     The control variables described for ‘expect-strings’ also influence
     the behaviour of ‘expect’, with the exception of variables whose
     names begin with ‘expect-strings-’.

7.17 ‘sxml-match’: Pattern Matching of SXML
===========================================

The ‘(sxml match)’ module provides syntactic forms for pattern matching
of SXML trees, in a “by example” style reminiscent of the pattern
matching of the ‘syntax-rules’ and ‘syntax-case’ macro systems.  *Note*
SXML::, for more information on SXML.

   The following example(1) provides a brief illustration, transforming
a music album catalog language into HTML.

     (define (album->html x)
       (sxml-match x
         ((album (@ (title ,t)) (catalog (num ,n) (fmt ,f)) ...)
          `(ul (li ,t)
               (li (b ,n) (i ,f)) ...))))

   Three macros are provided: ‘sxml-match’, ‘sxml-match-let’, and
‘sxml-match-let*’.

   Compared to a standard s-expression pattern matcher (*note* Pattern
Matching::), ‘sxml-match’ provides the following benefits:

   • matching of SXML elements does not depend on any degree of
     normalization of the SXML;
   • matching of SXML attributes (within an element) is under-ordered;
     the order of the attributes specified within the pattern need not
     match the ordering with the element being matched;
   • all attributes specified in the pattern must be present in the
     element being matched; in the spirit that XML is ’extensible’, the
     element being matched may include additional attributes not
     specified in the pattern.

   The present module is a descendant of WebIt!, and was inspired by an
s-expression pattern matcher developed by Erik Hilsdale, Dan Friedman,
and Kent Dybvig at Indiana University.

Syntax
------

‘sxml-match’ provides ‘case’-like form for pattern matching of XML
nodes.

 -- Scheme Syntax: sxml-match input-expression clause1 clause2 ...
     Match INPUT-EXPRESSION, an SXML tree, according to the given
     CLAUSEs (one or more), each consisting of a pattern and one or more
     expressions to be evaluated if the pattern match succeeds.
     Optionally, each CLAUSE within ‘sxml-match’ may include a “guard
     expression”.

   The pattern notation is based on that of Scheme’s ‘syntax-rules’ and
‘syntax-case’ macro systems.  The grammar for the ‘sxml-match’ syntax is
given below:

match-form ::= (sxml-match input-expression
                 clause+)

clause ::= [node-pattern action-expression+]
         | [node-pattern (guard expression*) action-expression+]

node-pattern ::= literal-pattern
               | pat-var-or-cata
               | element-pattern
               | list-pattern

literal-pattern ::= string
                  | character
                  | number
                  | #t
                  | #f

attr-list-pattern ::= (@ attribute-pattern*)
                    | (@ attribute-pattern* . pat-var-or-cata)

attribute-pattern ::= (tag-symbol attr-val-pattern)

attr-val-pattern ::= literal-pattern
                   | pat-var-or-cata
                   | (pat-var-or-cata default-value-expr)

element-pattern ::= (tag-symbol attr-list-pattern?)
                  | (tag-symbol attr-list-pattern? nodeset-pattern)
                  | (tag-symbol attr-list-pattern?
                                nodeset-pattern? . pat-var-or-cata)

list-pattern ::= (list nodeset-pattern)
               | (list nodeset-pattern? . pat-var-or-cata)
               | (list)

nodeset-pattern ::= node-pattern
                  | node-pattern ...
                  | node-pattern nodeset-pattern
                  | node-pattern ... nodeset-pattern

pat-var-or-cata ::= (unquote var-symbol)
                  | (unquote [var-symbol*])
                  | (unquote [cata-expression -> var-symbol*])

   Within a list or element body pattern, ellipses may appear only once,
but may be followed by zero or more node patterns.

   Guard expressions cannot refer to the return values of catamorphisms.

   Ellipses in the output expressions must appear only in an expression
context; ellipses are not allowed in a syntactic form.

   The sections below illustrate specific aspects of the ‘sxml-match’
pattern matcher.

Matching XML Elements
---------------------

The example below illustrates the pattern matching of an XML element:

     (sxml-match '(e (@ (i 1)) 3 4 5)
       ((e (@ (i ,d)) ,a ,b ,c) (list d a b c))
       (,otherwise #f))

   Each clause in ‘sxml-match’ contains two parts: a pattern and one or
more expressions which are evaluated if the pattern is successfully
match.  The example above matches an element ‘e’ with an attribute ‘i’
and three children.

   Pattern variables must be “unquoted” in the pattern.  The above
expression binds D to ‘1’, A to ‘3’, B to ‘4’, and C to ‘5’.

Ellipses in Patterns
--------------------

As in ‘syntax-rules’, ellipses may be used to specify a repeated
pattern.  Note that the pattern ‘item ...’ specifies zero-or-more
matches of the pattern ‘item’.

   The use of ellipses in a pattern is illustrated in the code fragment
below, where nested ellipses are used to match the children of repeated
instances of an ‘a’ element, within an element ‘d’.

     (define x '(d (a 1 2 3) (a 4 5) (a 6 7 8) (a 9 10)))

     (sxml-match x
       ((d (a ,b ...) ...)
        (list (list b ...) ...)))

   The above expression returns a value of ‘((1 2 3) (4 5) (6 7 8) (9
10))’.

Ellipses in Quasiquote’d Output
-------------------------------

Within the body of an ‘sxml-match’ form, a slightly extended version of
quasiquote is provided, which allows the use of ellipses.  This is
illustrated in the example below.

     (sxml-match '(e 3 4 5 6 7)
       ((e ,i ... 6 7) `("start" ,(list 'wrap i) ... "end"))
       (,otherwise #f))

   The general pattern is that ‘`(something ,i ...)’ is rewritten as
‘`(something ,@i)’.

Matching Nodesets
-----------------

A nodeset pattern is designated by a list in the pattern, beginning the
identifier list.  The example below illustrates matching a nodeset.

     (sxml-match '("i" "j" "k" "l" "m")
       ((list ,a ,b ,c ,d ,e)
        `((p ,a) (p ,b) (p ,c) (p ,d) (p ,e))))

   This example wraps each nodeset item in an HTML paragraph element.
This example can be rewritten and simplified through using ellipsis:

     (sxml-match '("i" "j" "k" "l" "m")
       ((list ,i ...)
        `((p ,i) ...)))

   This version will match nodesets of any length, and wrap each item in
the nodeset in an HTML paragraph element.

Matching the “Rest” of a Nodeset
--------------------------------

Matching the “rest” of a nodeset is achieved by using a ‘. rest)’
pattern at the end of an element or nodeset pattern.

   This is illustrated in the example below:

     (sxml-match '(e 3 (f 4 5 6) 7)
       ((e ,a (f . ,y) ,d)
        (list a y d)))

   The above expression returns ‘(3 (4 5 6) 7)’.

Matching the Unmatched Attributes
---------------------------------

Sometimes it is useful to bind a list of attributes present in the
element being matched, but which do not appear in the pattern.  This is
achieved by using a ‘. rest)’ pattern at the end of the attribute list
pattern.  This is illustrated in the example below:

     (sxml-match '(a (@ (z 1) (y 2) (x 3)) 4 5 6)
       ((a (@ (y ,www) . ,qqq) ,t ,u ,v)
        (list www qqq t u v)))

   The above expression matches the attribute ‘y’ and binds a list of
the remaining attributes to the variable QQQ.  The result of the above
expression is ‘(2 ((z 1) (x 3)) 4 5 6)’.

   This type of pattern also allows the binding of all attributes:

     (sxml-match '(a (@ (z 1) (y 2) (x 3)))
       ((a (@ . ,qqq))
        qqq))

Default Values in Attribute Patterns
------------------------------------

It is possible to specify a default value for an attribute which is used
if the attribute is not present in the element being matched.  This is
illustrated in the following example:

     (sxml-match '(e 3 4 5)
       ((e (@ (z (,d 1))) ,a ,b ,c) (list d a b c)))

   The value ‘1’ is used when the attribute ‘z’ is absent from the
element ‘e’.

Guards in Patterns
------------------

Guards may be added to a pattern clause via the ‘guard’ keyword.  A
guard expression may include zero or more expressions which are
evaluated only if the pattern is matched.  The body of the clause is
only evaluated if the guard expressions evaluate to ‘#t’.

   The use of guard expressions is illustrated below:

     (sxml-match '(a 2 3)
       ((a ,n) (guard (number? n)) n)
       ((a ,m ,n) (guard (number? m) (number? n)) (+ m n)))

Catamorphisms
-------------

The example below illustrates the use of explicit recursion within an
‘sxml-match’ form.  This example implements a simple calculator for the
basic arithmetic operations, which are represented by the XML elements
‘plus’, ‘minus’, ‘times’, and ‘div’.

     (define simple-eval
       (lambda (x)
         (sxml-match x
           (,i (guard (integer? i)) i)
           ((plus ,x ,y) (+ (simple-eval x) (simple-eval y)))
           ((times ,x ,y) (* (simple-eval x) (simple-eval y)))
           ((minus ,x ,y) (- (simple-eval x) (simple-eval y)))
           ((div ,x ,y) (/ (simple-eval x) (simple-eval y)))
           (,otherwise (error "simple-eval: invalid expression" x)))))

   Using the catamorphism feature of ‘sxml-match’, a more concise
version of ‘simple-eval’ can be written.  The pattern ‘,(x)’ recursively
invokes the pattern matcher on the value bound in this position.

     (define simple-eval
       (lambda (x)
         (sxml-match x
           (,i (guard (integer? i)) i)
           ((plus ,(x) ,(y)) (+ x y))
           ((times ,(x) ,(y)) (* x y))
           ((minus ,(x) ,(y)) (- x y))
           ((div ,(x) ,(y)) (/ x y))
           (,otherwise (error "simple-eval: invalid expression" x)))))

Named-Catamorphisms
-------------------

It is also possible to explicitly name the operator in the “cata”
position.  Where ‘,(id*)’ recurs to the top of the current ‘sxml-match’,
‘,(cata -> id*)’ recurs to ‘cata’.  ‘cata’ must evaluate to a procedure
which takes one argument, and returns as many values as there are
identifiers following ‘->’.

   Named catamorphism patterns allow processing to be split into
multiple, mutually recursive procedures.  This is illustrated in the
example below: a transformation that formats a “TV Guide” into HTML.

     (define (tv-guide->html g)
       (define (cast-list cl)
         (sxml-match cl
           ((CastList (CastMember (Character (Name ,ch)) (Actor (Name ,a))) ...)
            `(div (ul (li ,ch ": " ,a) ...)))))
       (define (prog p)
         (sxml-match p
           ((Program (Start ,start-time) (Duration ,dur) (Series ,series-title)
                     (Description ,desc ...))
            `(div (p ,start-time
                     (br) ,series-title
                     (br) ,desc ...)))
           ((Program (Start ,start-time) (Duration ,dur) (Series ,series-title)
                     (Description ,desc ...)
                     ,(cast-list -> cl))
            `(div (p ,start-time
                     (br) ,series-title
                     (br) ,desc ...)
                  ,cl))))
       (sxml-match g
         ((TVGuide (@ (start ,start-date)
                      (end ,end-date))
                   (Channel (Name ,nm) ,(prog -> p) ...) ...)
          `(html (head (title "TV Guide"))
                 (body (h1 "TV Guide")
                       (div (h2 ,nm) ,p ...) ...)))))

‘sxml-match-let’ and ‘sxml-match-let*’
--------------------------------------

 -- Scheme Syntax: sxml-match-let ((pat expr) ...) expression0
          expression ...
 -- Scheme Syntax: sxml-match-let* ((pat expr) ...) expression0
          expression ...
     These forms generalize the ‘let’ and ‘let*’ forms of Scheme to
     allow an XML pattern in the binding position, rather than a simple
     variable.

   For example, the expression below:

     (sxml-match-let (((a ,i ,j) '(a 1 2)))
       (+ i j))

   binds the variables I and J to ‘1’ and ‘2’ in the XML value given.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This example is taken from a paper by Krishnamurthi et al.  Their
paper was the first to show the usefulness of the ‘syntax-rules’ style
of pattern matching for transformation of XML, though the language
described, XT3D, is an XML language.

7.18 The Scheme shell (scsh)
============================

An incomplete port of the Scheme shell (scsh) was once available for
Guile as a separate package.  However this code has bitrotten somewhat.
The pieces are available in Guile’s legacy CVS repository, which may be
browsed at
<http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/guile/guile-scsh/?root=guile>.

   For information about scsh see <http://www.scsh.net/>.

   This bitrotting is a bit of a shame, as there is a good deal of
well-written Scheme code in scsh.  Adopting this code and porting it to
current Guile should be an educational experience, in addition to
providing something of value to Guile folks.


File: guile.info,  Node: Curried Definitions,  Next: Statprof,  Prev: The Scheme shell (scsh),  Up: Guile Modules

7.19 Curried Definitions
========================

The macros in this section are provided by
     (use-modules (ice-9 curried-definitions))
and replace those provided by default.

   Prior to Guile 2.0, Guile provided a type of definition known
colloquially as a “curried definition”.  The idea is to extend the
syntax of ‘define’ so that you can conveniently define procedures that
return procedures, up to any desired depth.

   For example,
     (define ((foo x) y)
       (list x y))
   is a convenience form of
     (define foo
       (lambda (x)
         (lambda (y)
           (list x y))))

 -- Scheme Syntax: define (... (name args ...) ...) body ...
 -- Scheme Syntax: define* (... (name args ...) ...) body ...
 -- Scheme Syntax: define-public (... (name args ...) ...) body ...

     Create a top level variable NAME bound to the procedure with
     parameter list ARGS.  If NAME is itself a formal parameter list,
     then a higher order procedure is created using that
     formal-parameter list, and returning a procedure that has parameter
     list ARGS.  This nesting may occur to arbitrary depth.

     ‘define*’ is similar but the formal parameter lists take additional
     options as described in *note* lambda* and define*::.  For example,
          (define* ((foo #:keys (bar 'baz) (quux 'zot)) frotz #:rest rest)
            (list bar quux frotz rest))

          ((foo #:quux 'foo) 1 2 3 4 5)
          ⇒ (baz foo 1 (2 3 4 5))

     ‘define-public’ is similar to ‘define’ but it also adds NAME to the
     list of exported bindings of the current module.


File: guile.info,  Node: Statprof,  Next: SXML,  Prev: Curried Definitions,  Up: Guile Modules

7.20 Statprof
=============

Statprof is a statistical profiler for Guile.

   A simple use of statprof would look like this:

     (use-modules (statprof))
     (statprof (lambda ()
                 (map 1+ (iota 1000000))
                 #f))

   This would run the thunk with statistical profiling, finally
displaying a flat table of statistics which could look something like
this:

     %     cumulative   self
     time   seconds     seconds  procedure
      57.14  39769.73      0.07  ice-9/boot-9.scm:249:5:map1
      28.57      0.04      0.04  ice-9/boot-9.scm:1165:0:iota
      14.29      0.02      0.02  1+
       0.00      0.12      0.00  <current input>:2:10
     ---
     Sample count: 7
     Total time: 0.123490713 seconds (0.201983993 seconds in GC)

   All of the numerical data with the exception of the calls column is
statistically approximate.  In the following column descriptions, and in
all of statprof, “time” refers to execution time (both user and system),
not wall clock time.

   The ‘% time’ column indicates the percentage of the run-time time
spent inside the procedure itself (not counting children).  It is
calculated as ‘self seconds’, measuring the amount of time spent in the
procedure, divided by the total run-time.

   ‘cumulative seconds’ also counts time spent in children of a
function.  For recursive functions, this can exceed the total time, as
in our example above, because each activation on the stack adds to the
cumulative time.

   Finally, the GC time measures the time spent in the garbage
collector.  On systems with multiple cores, this time can be larger than
the run time, because it counts time spent in all threads, and will run
the “marking” phase of GC in parallel.  If GC time is a significant
fraction of the run time, that means that most time in your program is
spent allocating objects and cleaning up after those allocations.  To
speed up your program, one good place to start would be to look at how
to reduce the allocation rate.

   Statprof’s main mode of operation is as a statistical profiler.
However statprof can also run in a “precise” mode as well.  Pass the
‘#:count-calls? #t’ keyword argument to ‘statprof’ to record all calls:

     (use-modules (statprof))
     (statprof (lambda ()
                 (map 1+ (iota 1000000))
                 #f)
               #:count-calls? #t)

   The result has an additional ‘calls’ column:

     %     cumulative   self
     time   seconds    seconds   calls   procedure
      82.26      0.73      0.73 1000000  1+
      11.29 420925.80      0.10 1000001  ice-9/boot-9.scm:249:5:map1
       4.84      0.06      0.04       1  ice-9/boot-9.scm:1165:0:iota
     [...]
     ---
     Sample count: 62
     Total time: 0.893098065 seconds (1.222796536 seconds in GC)

   As you can see, the profile is perturbed: ‘1+’ ends up on top,
whereas it was not marked as hot in the earlier profile.  This is
because the overhead of call-counting unfairly penalizes calls.  Still,
this precise mode can be useful at times to do algorithmic optimizations
based on the precise call counts.

Implementation notes
====================

The profiler works by setting the unix profiling signal ‘ITIMER_PROF’ to
go off after the interval you define in the call to ‘statprof-reset’.
When the signal fires, a sampling routine runs which crawls up the
stack, recording all instruction pointers into a buffer.  After the
sample is complete, the profiler resets profiling timer to fire again
after the appropriate interval.

   Later, when profiling stops, that log buffer is analyzed to produce
the “self seconds” and “cumulative seconds” statistics.  A procedure at
the top of the stack counts toward “self” samples, and everything on the
stack counts towards “cumulative” samples.

   While the profiler is running it measures how much CPU time (system
and user – which is also what ‘ITIMER_PROF’ tracks) has elapsed while
code has been executing within the profiler.  Only run time counts
towards the profile, not wall-clock time.  For example, sleeping and
waiting for input or output do not cause the timer clock to advance.

Usage
=====

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof thunk [#:loop loop=1] [#:hz hz=100]
          [#:port port=(current-output-port)] [#:count-calls?
          count-calls?=#f] [#:display-style display-style='flat]
     Profile the execution of THUNK, and return its return values.

     The stack will be sampled HZ times per second, and the thunk itself
     will be called LOOP times.

     If COUNT-CALLS? is true, all procedure calls will be recorded.
     This operation is somewhat expensive.

     After the THUNK has been profiled, print out a profile to PORT.  If
     DISPLAY-STYLE is ‘flat’, the results will be printed as a flat
     profile.  Otherwise if DISPLAY-STYLE is ‘tree’, print the results
     as a tree profile.

     Note that ‘statprof’ requires a working profiling timer.  Some
     platforms do not support profiling timers.  ‘(provided?
     'ITIMER_PROF)’ can be used to check for support of profiling
     timers.

   Profiling can also be enabled and disabled manually.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-active?
     Returns ‘#t’ if ‘statprof-start’ has been called more times than
     ‘statprof-stop’, ‘#f’ otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-start
 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-stop
     Start or stop the profiler.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-reset sample-seconds sample-microseconds
          count-calls?
     Reset the profiling sample interval to SAMPLE-SECONDS and
     SAMPLE-MICROSECONDS.  If COUNT-CALLS? is true, arrange to
     instrument procedure calls as well as collecting statistical
     profiling data.

   If you use the manual ‘statprof-start’/‘statprof-stop’ interface, an
implicit statprof state will persist starting from the last call to
‘statprof-reset’, or the first call to ‘statprof-start’.  There are a
number of accessors to fetch statistics from this implicit state.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-accumulated-time
     Returns the time accumulated during the last statprof run.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-sample-count
     Returns the number of samples taken during the last statprof run.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-fold-call-data proc init
     Fold PROC over the call-data accumulated by statprof.  This
     procedure cannot be called while statprof is active.

     PROC will be called with arguments, CALL-DATA and PRIOR-RESULT.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-proc-call-data proc
     Returns the call-data associated with PROC, or ‘#f’ if none is
     available.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-call-data-name cd
 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-call-data-calls cd
 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-call-data-cum-samples cd
 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-call-data-self-samples cd
     Accessors for the fields in a statprof call-data object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-call-data->stats call-data
     Returns an object of type ‘statprof-stats’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-stats-proc-name stats
 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-stats-%-time-in-proc stats
 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-stats-cum-secs-in-proc stats
 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-stats-self-secs-in-proc stats
 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-stats-calls stats
 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-stats-self-secs-per-call stats
 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-stats-cum-secs-per-call stats
     Accessors for the fields in a ‘statprof-stats’ object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-display [port=(current-output-port)]
          [#:style style=flat]
     Displays a summary of the statistics collected.  Possible values
     for STYLE include:

     ‘flat’
          Display a traditional gprof-style flat profile.
     ‘anomalies’
          Find statistical anomalies in the data.
     ‘tree’
          Display a tree profile.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-fetch-stacks
     Returns a list of stacks, as they were captured since the last call
     to ‘statprof-reset’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: statprof-fetch-call-tree [#:precise precise?=#f]
     Return a call tree for the previous statprof run.
     
     The return value is a list of nodes.  A node is a list of the form:
     @code
      node ::= (@var{proc} @var{count} . @var{nodes})
     @end code
     
     The @var{proc} is a printable representation of a procedure, as a
     string.  If @var{precise?} is false, which is the default, then a node
     corresponds to a procedure invocation.  If it is true, then a node
     corresponds to a return point in a procedure.  Passing @code{#:precise?
     #t} allows a user to distinguish different source lines in a procedure,
     but usually it is too much detail, so it is off by default.

 -- Scheme Procedure: gcprof thunk [#:loop]
     Like the ‘statprof’ procedure, but instead of profiling CPU time,
     we profile garbage collection.

     The stack will be sampled soon after every garbage collection
     during the evaluation of THUNK, yielding an approximate idea of
     what is causing allocation in your program.

     Since GC does not occur very frequently, you may need to use the
     LOOP parameter, to cause THUNK to be called LOOP times.

7.21 SXML
=========

SXML is a native representation of XML in terms of standard Scheme data
types: lists, symbols, and strings.  For example, the simple XML
fragment:

     <parrot type="African Grey"><name>Alfie</name></parrot>

   may be represented with the following SXML:

     (parrot (@ (type "African Grey")) (name "Alfie"))

   SXML is very general, and is capable of representing all of XML.
Formally, this means that SXML is a conforming implementation of the XML
Information Set (http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/) standard.

   Guile includes several facilities for working with XML and SXML:
parsers, serializers, and transformers.

7.21.2 Reading and Writing XML
------------------------------

The ‘(sxml simple)’ module presents a basic interface for parsing XML
from a port into the Scheme SXML format, and for serializing it back to
text.

     (use-modules (sxml simple))

 -- Scheme Procedure: xml->sxml [string-or-port] [#:namespaces='()]
          [#:declare-namespaces?=#t] [#:trim-whitespace?=#f]
          [#:entities='()] [#:default-entity-handler=#f]
          [#:doctype-handler=#f]
     Use SSAX to parse an XML document into SXML. Takes one optional
     argument, STRING-OR-PORT, which defaults to the current input port.
     Returns the resulting SXML document.  If STRING-OR-PORT is a port,
     it will be left pointing at the next available character in the
     port.

   As is normal in SXML, XML elements parse as tagged lists.
Attributes, if any, are placed after the tag, within an ‘@’ element.
The root of the resulting XML will be contained in a special tag,
‘*TOP*’.  This tag will contain the root element of the XML, but also
any prior processing instructions.

     (xml->sxml "<foo/>")
     ⇒ (*TOP* (foo))
     (xml->sxml "<foo>text</foo>")
     ⇒ (*TOP* (foo "text"))
     (xml->sxml "<foo kind=\"bar\">text</foo>")
     ⇒ (*TOP* (foo (@ (kind "bar")) "text"))
     (xml->sxml "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?><foo/>")
     ⇒ (*TOP* (*PI* xml "version=\"1.0\"") (foo))

   All namespaces in the XML document must be declared, via ‘xmlns’
attributes.  SXML elements built from non-default namespaces will have
their tags prefixed with their URI. Users can specify custom prefixes
for certain namespaces with the ‘#:namespaces’ keyword argument to
‘xml->sxml’.

     (xml->sxml "<foo xmlns=\"http://example.org/ns1\">text</foo>")
     ⇒ (*TOP* (http://example.org/ns1:foo "text"))
     (xml->sxml "<foo xmlns=\"http://example.org/ns1\">text</foo>"
                #:namespaces '((ns1 . "http://example.org/ns1")))
     ⇒ (*TOP* (ns1:foo "text"))
     (xml->sxml "<foo xmlns:bar=\"http://example.org/ns2\"><bar:baz/></foo>"
                #:namespaces '((ns2 . "http://example.org/ns2")))
     ⇒ (*TOP* (foo (ns2:baz)))

   By default, namespaces passed to ‘xml->sxml’ are treated as if they
were declared on the root element.  Passing a false
‘#:declare-namespaces?’ argument will disable this behavior, requiring
in-document declarations of namespaces before use..

     (xml->sxml "<foo><ns2:baz/></foo>"
                #:namespaces '((ns2 . "http://example.org/ns2")))
     ⇒ (*TOP* (foo (ns2:baz)))
     (xml->sxml "<foo><ns2:baz/></foo>"
                #:namespaces '((ns2 . "http://example.org/ns2"))
                #:declare-namespaces? #f)
     ⇒ error: undeclared namespace: `bar'

   By default, all whitespace in XML is significant.  Passing the
‘#:trim-whitespace?’ keyword argument to ‘xml->sxml’ will trim
whitespace in front, behind and between elements, treating it as
“unsignificant”.  Whitespace in text fragments is left alone.

     (xml->sxml "<foo>\n<bar> Alfie the parrot! </bar>\n</foo>")
     ⇒ (*TOP* (foo "\n" (bar " Alfie the parrot! ") "\n"))
     (xml->sxml "<foo>\n<bar> Alfie the parrot! </bar>\n</foo>"
                #:trim-whitespace? #t)
     ⇒ (*TOP* (foo (bar " Alfie the parrot! ")))

   Parsed entities may be declared with the ‘#:entities’ keyword
argument, or handled with the ‘#:default-entity-handler’.  By default,
only the standard ‘&lt;’, ‘&gt;’, ‘&amp;’, ‘&apos;’ and ‘&quot;’
entities are defined, as well as the ‘&#N;’ and ‘&#xN;’ (decimal and
hexadecimal) numeric character entities.

     (xml->sxml "<foo>&amp;</foo>")
     ⇒ (*TOP* (foo "&"))
     (xml->sxml "<foo>&nbsp;</foo>")
     ⇒ error: undefined entity: nbsp
     (xml->sxml "<foo>&#xA0;</foo>")
     ⇒ (*TOP* (foo "\xa0"))
     (xml->sxml "<foo>&nbsp;</foo>"
                #:entities '((nbsp . "\xa0")))
     ⇒ (*TOP* (foo "\xa0"))
     (xml->sxml "<foo>&nbsp; &foo;</foo>"
                #:default-entity-handler
                (lambda (port name)
                  (case name
                    ((nbsp) "\xa0")
                    (else
                     (format (current-warning-port)
                             "~a:~a:~a: undefined entitity: ~a\n"
                             (or (port-filename port) "<unknown file>")
                             (port-line port) (port-column port)
                             name)
                     (symbol->string name)))))
     ⊣ <unknown file>:0:17: undefined entitity: foo
     ⇒ (*TOP* (foo "\xa0 foo"))

   By default, ‘xml->sxml’ skips over the ‘<!DOCTYPE>’ declaration, if
any.  This behavior can be overridden with the ‘#:doctype-handler’
argument, which should be a procedure of three arguments: the “docname”
(a symbol), “systemid” (a string), and the internal doctype subset (as a
string or ‘#f’ if not present).

   The handler should return keyword arguments as multiple values, as if
it were calling its continuation with keyword arguments.  The
continuation accepts the ‘#:entities’ and ‘#:namespaces’ keyword
arguments, in the same format that ‘xml->sxml’ itself takes.  These
entities and namespaces will be prepended to those given to the
‘xml->sxml’ invocation.

     (define (handle-foo docname systemid internal-subset)
       (case docname
         ((foo)
          (values #:entities '((greets . "<i>Hello, world!</i>"))))
         (else
          (values))))

     (xml->sxml "<!DOCTYPE foo><p>&greets;</p>"
                #:doctype-handler handle-foo)
     ⇒ (*TOP* (p (i "Hello, world!")))

   If the document has no doctype declaration, the DOCTYPE-HANDLER is
invoked with ‘#f’ for the three arguments.

   In the future, the continuation may accept other keyword arguments,
for example to validate the parsed SXML against the doctype.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sxml->xml tree [port]
     Serialize the SXML tree TREE as XML. The output will be written to
     the current output port, unless the optional argument PORT is
     present.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sxml->string sxml
     Detag an sxml tree SXML into a string.  Does not perform any
     formatting.

7.21.3 SSAX: A Functional XML Parsing Toolkit
---------------------------------------------

Guile’s XML parser is based on Oleg Kiselyov’s powerful XML parsing
toolkit, SSAX.

### 7.21.3.1 History
................

Back in the 1990s, when the world was young again and XML was the
solution to all of its problems, there were basically two kinds of XML
parsers out there: DOM parsers and SAX parsers.

   A DOM parser reads through an entire XML document, building up a tree
of “DOM objects” representing the document structure.  They are very
easy to use, but sometimes you don’t actually want all of the
information in a document; building an object tree is not necessary if
all you want to do is to count word frequencies in a document, for
example.

   SAX parsers were created to give the programmer more control on the
parsing process.  A programmer gives the SAX parser a number of
“callbacks”: functions that will be called on various features of the
XML stream as they are encountered.  SAX parsers are more efficient, but
much harder to use, as users typically have to manually maintain a stack
of open elements.

   Kiselyov realized that the SAX programming model could be made much
simpler if the callbacks were formulated not as a linear fold across the
features of the XML stream, but as a _tree fold_ over the structure
implicit in the XML. In this way, the user has a very convenient,
functional-style interface that can still generate optimal parsers.

   The ‘xml->sxml’ interface from the ‘(sxml simple)’ module is a
DOM-style parser built using SSAX, though it returns SXML instead of DOM
objects.

### 7.21.3.2 Implementation
.......................

‘(sxml ssax)’ is a package of low-to-high level lexing and parsing
procedures that can be combined to yield a SAX, a DOM, a validating
parser, or a parser intended for a particular document type.  The
procedures in the package can be used separately to tokenize or parse
various pieces of XML documents.  The package supports XML Namespaces,
internal and external parsed entities, user-controlled handling of
whitespace, and validation.  This module therefore is intended to be a
framework, a set of “Lego blocks” you can use to build a parser
following any discipline and performing validation to any degree.  As an
example of the parser construction, the source file includes a
semi-validating SXML parser.

   SSAX has a “sequential” feel of SAX yet a “functional style” of DOM.
Like a SAX parser, the framework scans the document only once and
permits incremental processing.  An application that handles document
elements in order can run as efficiently as possible.  _Unlike_ a SAX
parser, the framework does not require an application register stateful
callbacks and surrender control to the parser.  Rather, it is the
application that can drive the framework – calling its functions to get
the current lexical or syntax element.  These functions do not maintain
or mutate any state save the input port.  Therefore, the framework
permits parsing of XML in a pure functional style, with the input port
being a monad (or a linear, read-once parameter).

   Besides the PORT, there is another monad – SEED.  Most of the middle-
and high-level parsers are single-threaded through the SEED.  The
functions of this framework do not process or affect the SEED in any
way: they simply pass it around as an instance of an opaque datatype.
User functions, on the other hand, can use the seed to maintain user’s
state, to accumulate parsing results, etc.  A user can freely mix their
own functions with those of the framework.  On the other hand, the user
may wish to instantiate a high-level parser: ‘SSAX:make-elem-parser’ or
‘SSAX:make-parser’.  In the latter case, the user must provide functions
of specific signatures, which are called at predictable moments during
the parsing: to handle character data, element data, or processing
instructions (PI). The functions are always given the SEED, among other
parameters, and must return the new SEED.

   From a functional point of view, XML parsing is a combined
pre-post-order traversal of a “tree” that is the XML document itself.
This down-and-up traversal tells the user about an element when its
start tag is encountered.  The user is notified about the element once
more, after all element’s children have been handled.  The process of
XML parsing therefore is a fold over the raw XML document.  Unlike a
fold over trees defined in [1], the parser is necessarily
single-threaded – obviously as elements in a text XML document are laid
down sequentially.  The parser therefore is a tree fold that has been
transformed to accept an accumulating parameter [1,2].

   Formally, the denotational semantics of the parser can be expressed
as

      parser:: (Start-tag -> Seed -> Seed) ->
         (Start-tag -> Seed -> Seed -> Seed) ->
         (Char-Data -> Seed -> Seed) ->
         XML-text-fragment -> Seed -> Seed
      parser fdown fup fchar "<elem attrs> content </elem>" seed
       = fup "<elem attrs>" seed
      (parser fdown fup fchar "content" (fdown "<elem attrs>" seed))

      parser fdown fup fchar "char-data content" seed
       = parser fdown fup fchar "content" (fchar "char-data" seed)

      parser fdown fup fchar "elem-content content" seed
       = parser fdown fup fchar "content" (
      parser fdown fup fchar "elem-content" seed)

   Compare the last two equations with the left fold

      fold-left kons elem:list seed = fold-left kons list (kons elem seed)

   The real parser created by ‘SSAX:make-parser’ is slightly more
complicated, to account for processing instructions, entity references,
namespaces, processing of document type declaration, etc.

   The XML standard document referred to in this module is
<http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210.html>

   The present file also defines a procedure that parses the text of an
XML document or of a separate element into SXML, an S-expression-based
model of an XML Information Set.  SXML is also an Abstract Syntax Tree
of an XML document.  SXML is similar but not identical to DOM; SXML is
particularly suitable for Scheme-based XML/HTML authoring, SXPath
queries, and tree transformations.  See SXML.html for more details.
SXML is a term implementation of evaluation of the XML document [3].
The other implementation is context-passing.

   The present frameworks fully supports the XML Namespaces

SXML expression tree transformers
=================================

Pre-Post-order traversal of a tree and creation of a new tree
-------------------------------------------------------------

     pre-post-order:: <tree> x <bindings> -> <new-tree>

   where

      <bindings> ::= (<binding> ...)
      <binding> ::= (<trigger-symbol> *preorder* . <handler>) |
                    (<trigger-symbol> *macro* . <handler>) |
         (<trigger-symbol> <new-bindings> . <handler>) |
         (<trigger-symbol> . <handler>)
      <trigger-symbol> ::= XMLname | *text* | *default*
      <handler> :: <trigger-symbol> x [<tree>] -> <new-tree>

   The ‘pre-post-order’ function, in the ‘(sxml transform)’ module,
visits the nodes and nodelists pre-post-order (depth-first).  For each
‘<Node>’ of the form ‘(NAME <Node> ...)’, it looks up an association
with the given NAME among its <BINDINGS>.  If failed, ‘pre-post-order’
tries to locate a ‘*default*’ binding.  It’s an error if the latter
attempt fails as well.  Having found a binding, the ‘pre-post-order’
function first checks to see if the binding is of the form

      (<trigger-symbol> *preorder* . <handler>)

   If it is, the handler is ’applied’ to the current node.  Otherwise,
the pre-post-order function first calls itself recursively for each
child of the current node, with <NEW-BINDINGS> prepended to the
<BINDINGS> in effect.  The result of these calls is passed to the
<HANDLER> (along with the head of the current <NODE>).  To be more
precise, the handler is _applied_ to the head of the current node and
its processed children.  The result of the handler, which should also be
a ‘<tree>’, replaces the current <NODE>.  If the current <NODE> is a
text string or other atom, a special binding with a symbol ‘*text*’ is
looked up.

   A binding can also be of a form

      (<trigger-symbol> *macro* . <handler>)

   This is equivalent to ‘*preorder*’ described above.  However, the
result is re-processed again, with the current stylesheet.

### 7.21.4.2 Usage
..............

 -- Scheme Procedure: SRV:send-reply . fragments
     Output the FRAGMENTS to the current output port.

     The fragments are a list of strings, characters, numbers, thunks,
     ‘#f’, ‘#t’ – and other fragments.  The function traverses the tree
     depth-first, writes out strings and characters, executes thunks,
     and ignores ‘#f’ and ‘'()’.  The function returns ‘#t’ if anything
     was written at all; otherwise the result is ‘#f’ If ‘#t’ occurs
     among the fragments, it is not written out but causes the result of
     ‘SRV:send-reply’ to be ‘#t’.

‘(sxml fold)’ defines a number of variants of the “fold” algorithm for
use in transforming SXML trees.  Additionally it defines the layout

          PRE-LAYOUT-HANDLER is expected to use this information to

          LAYOUT
               the layout coming into the current node, before any kids
               were processed

          KLAYOUT
               the layout after processing all of the children

          KIDS
               the already-processed child nodes

          POST-HANDLER should return two values, the layout to pass to
          the next node and the final tree.

     TEXT-HANDLER

7.21.6 SXPath
-------------

### 7.21.6.1 Overview
.................

SXPath: SXML Query Language
===========================

SXPath is a query language for SXML, an instance of XML Information set
(Infoset) in the form of s-expressions.  See ‘(sxml ssax)’ for the
definition of SXML and more details.  SXPath is also a translation into
Scheme of an XML Path Language, XPath (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath).
XPath and SXPath describe means of selecting a set of Infoset’s items or
their properties.

   To facilitate queries, XPath maps the XML Infoset into an explicit
tree, and introduces important notions of a location path and a current,
context node.  A location path denotes a selection of a set of nodes
relative to a context node.  Any XPath tree has a distinguished, root
node – which serves as the context node for absolute location paths.
Location path is recursively defined as a location step joined with a
location path.  A location step is a simple query of the database
relative to a context node.  A step may include expressions that further
filter the selected set.  Each node in the resulting set is used as a
context node for the adjoining location path.  The result of the step is
a union of the sets returned by the latter location paths.

   The SXML representation of the XML Infoset (see SSAX.scm) is rather
suitable for querying as it is.  Bowing to the XPath specification, we
will refer to SXML information items as ’Nodes’:

         <Node> ::= <Element> | <attributes-coll> | <attrib>
               | "text string" | <PI>

   This production can also be described as

      <Node> ::= (name . <Nodeset>) | "text string"

   An (ordered) set of nodes is just a list of the constituent nodes:

         <Nodeset> ::= (<Node> ...)

   Nodesets, and Nodes other than text strings are both lists.  A
<Nodeset> however is either an empty list, or a list whose head is not a
symbol.  A symbol at the head of a node is either an XML name (in which
case it’s a tag of an XML element), or an administrative name such as
’@’.  This uniform list representation makes processing rather simple
and elegant, while avoiding confusion.  The multi-branch tree structure
formed by the mutually-recursive datatypes <Node> and <Nodeset> lends
itself well to processing by functional languages.

   A location path is in fact a composite query over an XPath tree or
its branch.  A singe step is a combination of a projection, selection or
a transitive closure.  Multiple steps are combined via join and union
operations.  This insight allows us to _elegantly_ implement XPath as a
sequence of projection and filtering primitives – converters – joined by
“combinators”.  Each converter takes a node and returns a nodeset which
is the result of the corresponding query relative to that node.  A
converter can also be called on a set of nodes.  In that case it returns
a union of the corresponding queries over each node in the set.  The
union is easily implemented as a list append operation as all nodes in a
SXML tree are considered distinct, by XPath conventions.  We also
preserve the order of the members in the union.  Query combinators are
high-order functions: they take converter(s) (which is a Node|Nodeset ->
Nodeset function) and compose or otherwise combine them.  We will be
concerned with only relative location paths [XPath]: an absolute
location path is a relative path applied to the root node.

   Similarly to XPath, SXPath defines full and abbreviated notations for
location paths.  In both cases, the abbreviated notation can be
mechanically expanded into the full form by simple rewriting rules.  In
the case of SXPath the corresponding rules are given in the
documentation of the ‘sxpath’ procedure.  *Note* SXPath procedure
documentation: sxpath-procedure-docs.

   The regression test suite at the end of the file ‘SXPATH-old.scm’
shows a representative sample of SXPaths in both notations, juxtaposed
with the corresponding XPath expressions.  Most of the samples are
borrowed literally from the XPath specification.

   Much of the following material is taken from the SXPath sources by
Oleg Kiselyov et al.

### 7.21.6.2 Basic Converters and Applicators
.........................................

A converter is a function mapping a nodeset (or a single node) to
another nodeset.  Its type can be represented like this:

     type Converter = Node|Nodeset -> Nodeset

   A converter can also play the role of a predicate: in that case, if a
converter, applied to a node or a nodeset, yields a non-empty nodeset,
the converter-predicate is deemed satisfied.  Likewise, an empty nodeset
is equivalent to ‘#f’ in denoting failure.

 -- Scheme Procedure: nodeset? x
     Return ‘#t’ if X is a nodeset.

 -- Scheme Procedure: node-typeof? crit
     This function implements a ’Node test’ as defined in Sec.  2.3 of
     the XPath document.  A node test is one of the components of a
     location step.  It is also a converter-predicate in SXPath.

     The function ‘node-typeof?’ takes a type criterion and returns a
     function, which, when applied to a node, will tell if the node
     satisfies the test.

     The criterion CRIT is a symbol, one of the following:

     ‘id’
          tests if the node has the right name (id)

     ‘@’
          tests if the node is an <attributes-coll>

     ‘*’
          tests if the node is an <Element>

     ‘*text*’
          tests if the node is a text node

     ‘*PI*’
          tests if the node is a PI (processing instruction) node

     ‘*any*’
          ‘#t’ for any type of node

 -- Scheme Procedure: node-eq? other
     A curried equivalence converter predicate that takes a node OTHER
     and returns a function that takes another node.  The two nodes are
     compared using ‘eq?’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: node-equal? other
     A curried equivalence converter predicate that takes a node OTHER
     and returns a function that takes another node.  The two nodes are
     compared using ‘equal?’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: node-pos n
     Select the N’th element of a nodeset and return as a singular
     nodeset.  If the N’th element does not exist, return an empty
     nodeset.  If N is a negative number the node is picked from the
     tail of the list.

          ((node-pos 1) nodeset)  ; return the the head of the nodeset (if exists)
          ((node-pos 2) nodeset)  ; return the node after that (if exists)
          ((node-pos -1) nodeset) ; selects the last node of a non-empty nodeset
          ((node-pos -2) nodeset) ; selects the last but one node, if exists.

 -- Scheme Procedure: filter pred?
     A filter applicator, which introduces a filtering context.  The
     argument converter PRED? is considered a predicate, with either
     ‘#f’ or ‘nil’ meaning failure.

 -- Scheme Procedure: take-until pred?
          take-until:: Converter -> Converter, or
          take-until:: Pred -> Node|Nodeset -> Nodeset

     Given a converter-predicate PRED? and a nodeset, apply the
     predicate to each element of the nodeset, until the predicate
     yields anything but ‘#f’ or ‘nil’.  Return the elements of the
     input nodeset that have been processed until that moment (that is,
     which fail the predicate).

     ‘take-until’ is a variation of the ‘filter’ above: ‘take-until’
     passes elements of an ordered input set up to (but not including)
     the first element that satisfies the predicate.  The nodeset
     returned by ‘((take-until (not pred)) nset)’ is a subset – to be
     more precise, a prefix – of the nodeset returned by ‘((filter pred)
     nset)’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: take-after pred?
          take-after:: Converter -> Converter, or
          take-after:: Pred -> Node|Nodeset -> Nodeset

     Given a converter-predicate PRED? and a nodeset, apply the
     predicate to each element of the nodeset, until the predicate
     yields anything but ‘#f’ or ‘nil’.  Return the elements of the
     input nodeset that have not been processed: that is, return the
     elements of the input nodeset that follow the first element that
     satisfied the predicate.

     ‘take-after’ along with ‘take-until’ partition an input nodeset
     into three parts: the first element that satisfies a predicate, all
     preceding elements and all following elements.

 -- Scheme Procedure: map-union proc lst
     Apply PROC to each element of LST and return the list of results.
     If PROC returns a nodeset, splice it into the result

     From another point of view, ‘map-union’ is a function
     ‘Converter->Converter’, which places an argument-converter in a
     joining context.

 -- Scheme Procedure: node-reverse node-or-nodeset
          node-reverse :: Converter, or
          node-reverse:: Node|Nodeset -> Nodeset

     Reverses the order of nodes in the nodeset.  This basic converter
     is needed to implement a reverse document order (see the XPath
     Recommendation).

 -- Scheme Procedure: node-trace title
          node-trace:: String -> Converter

     ‘(node-trace title)’ is an identity converter.  In addition it
     prints out the node or nodeset it is applied to, prefixed with the
     TITLE.  This converter is very useful for debugging.

### 7.21.6.3 Converter Combinators
..............................

Combinators are higher-order functions that transmogrify a converter or
glue a sequence of converters into a single, non-trivial converter.  The
goal is to arrive at converters that correspond to XPath location paths.

   From a different point of view, a combinator is a fixed, named
“pattern” of applying converters.  Given below is a complete set of such
patterns that together implement XPath location path specification.  As
it turns out, all these combinators can be built from a small number of
basic blocks: regular functional composition, ‘map-union’ and ‘filter’
applicators, and the nodeset union.

 -- Scheme Procedure: select-kids test-pred?
     ‘select-kids’ takes a converter (or a predicate) as an argument and
     returns another converter.  The resulting converter applied to a
     nodeset returns an ordered subset of its children that satisfy the
     predicate TEST-PRED?.

 -- Scheme Procedure: node-self pred?
     Similar to ‘select-kids’ except that the predicate PRED? is applied
     to the node itself rather than to its children.  The resulting
     nodeset will contain either one component, or will be empty if the
     node failed the predicate.

 -- Scheme Procedure: node-join . selectors
          node-join:: [LocPath] -> Node|Nodeset -> Nodeset, or
          node-join:: [Converter] -> Converter

     Join the sequence of location steps or paths as described above.

 -- Scheme Procedure: node-reduce . converters
          node-reduce:: [LocPath] -> Node|Nodeset -> Nodeset, or
          node-reduce:: [Converter] -> Converter

     A regular functional composition of converters.  From a different
     point of view, ‘((apply node-reduce converters) nodeset)’ is
     equivalent to ‘(foldl apply nodeset converters)’, i.e., folding, or
     reducing, a list of converters with the nodeset as a seed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: node-or . converters
          node-or:: [Converter] -> Converter

     This combinator applies all converters to a given node and produces
     the union of their results.  This combinator corresponds to a union
     (‘|’ operation) for XPath location paths.

 -- Scheme Procedure: node-closure test-pred?
          node-closure:: Converter -> Converter

     Select all _descendants_ of a node that satisfy a
     converter-predicate TEST-PRED?.  This combinator is similar to
     ‘select-kids’ but applies to grand...  children as well.  This
     combinator implements the ‘descendant::’ XPath axis.  Conceptually,
     this combinator can be expressed as

          (define (node-closure f)
            (node-or
              (select-kids f)
              (node-reduce (select-kids (node-typeof? '*)) (node-closure f))))

     This definition, as written, looks somewhat like a fixpoint, and it
     will run forever.  It is obvious however that sooner or later
     ‘(select-kids (node-typeof? '*))’ will return an empty nodeset.  At
     this point further iterations will no longer affect the result and
     can be stopped.

 -- Scheme Procedure: node-parent rootnode
          node-parent:: RootNode -> Converter

     ‘(node-parent rootnode)’ yields a converter that returns a parent
     of a node it is applied to.  If applied to a nodeset, it returns
     the list of parents of nodes in the nodeset.  The ROOTNODE does not
     have to be the root node of the whole SXML tree – it may be a root
     node of a branch of interest.

     Given the notation of Philip Wadler’s paper on semantics of XSLT,

       parent(x) = { y | y=subnode*(root), x=subnode(y) }

     Therefore, ‘node-parent’ is not the fundamental converter: it can
     be expressed through the existing ones.  Yet ‘node-parent’ is a
     rather convenient converter.  It corresponds to a ‘parent::’ axis
     of SXPath.  Note that the ‘parent::’ axis can be used with an
     attribute node as well.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sxpath path
     Evaluate an abbreviated SXPath.

          sxpath:: AbbrPath -> Converter, or
          sxpath:: AbbrPath -> Node|Nodeset -> Nodeset

     PATH is a list.  It is translated to the full SXPath according to
     the following rewriting rules:

          (sxpath '())
          ⇒ (node-join)

          (sxpath '(path-component ...))
          ⇒ (node-join (sxpath1 path-component) (sxpath '(...)))

          (sxpath1 '//)
          ⇒ (node-or
             (node-self (node-typeof? '*any*))
             (node-closure (node-typeof? '*any*)))

          (sxpath1 '(equal? x))
          ⇒ (select-kids (node-equal? x))

          (sxpath1 '(eq? x))
          ⇒ (select-kids (node-eq? x))

          (sxpath1 ?symbol)
          ⇒ (select-kids (node-typeof? ?symbol)

          (sxpath1 procedure)
          ⇒ procedure

          (sxpath1 '(?symbol ...))
          ⇒ (sxpath1 '((?symbol) ...))

          (sxpath1 '(path reducer ...))
          ⇒ (node-reduce (sxpath path) (sxpathr reducer) ...)

          (sxpathr number)
          ⇒ (node-pos number)

          (sxpathr path-filter)
          ⇒ (filter (sxpath path-filter))

7.21.7 (sxml ssax input-parse)
------------------------------

### 7.21.7.1 Overview
.................

A simple lexer.

   The procedures in this module surprisingly often suffice to parse an
input stream.  They either skip, or build and return tokens, according
to inclusion or delimiting semantics.  The list of characters to expect,
include, or to break at may vary from one invocation of a function to
another.  This allows the functions to easily parse even
context-sensitive languages.

   EOF is generally frowned on, and thrown up upon if encountered.
Exceptions are mentioned specifically.  The list of expected characters
(characters to skip until, or break-characters) may include an EOF
"character", which is to be coded as the symbol, ‘*eof*’.

   The input stream to parse is specified as a “port”, which is usually
the last (and optional) argument.  It defaults to the current input port
if omitted.

   If the parser encounters an error, it will throw an exception to the
key ‘parser-error’.  The arguments will be of the form ‘(PORT MESSAGE
SPECIALISING-MSG*)’.

   The first argument is a port, which typically points to the offending
character or its neighborhood.  You can then use ‘port-column’ and
‘port-line’ to query the current position.  MESSAGE is the description
of the error.  Other arguments supply more details about the problem.

7.21.8 (sxml apply-templates)
-----------------------------

### 7.21.8.1 Overview
.................

Pre-order traversal of a tree and creation of a new tree:

      apply-templates:: tree x <templates> -> <new-tree>

   where

      <templates> ::= (<template> ...)
      <template>  ::= (<node-test> <node-test> ... <node-test> . <handler>)
      <node-test> ::= an argument to node-typeof? above
      <handler>   ::= <tree> -> <new-tree>

   This procedure does a _normal_, pre-order traversal of an SXML tree.
It walks the tree, checking at each node against the list of matching
templates.

   If the match is found (which must be unique, i.e., unambiguous), the
corresponding handler is invoked and given the current node as an
argument.  The result from the handler, which must be a ‘<tree>’, takes
place of the current node in the resulting tree.  The name of the
function is not accidental: it resembles rather closely an
‘apply-templates’ function of XSLT.

7.22.1 (texinfo)
----------------

### 7.22.1.1 Overview
.................

Texinfo processing in scheme
----------------------------

This module parses texinfo into SXML. TeX will always be the processor
of choice for print output, of course.  However, although ‘makeinfo’
works well for info, its output in other formats is not very
customizable, and the program is not extensible as a whole.  This module
aims to provide an extensible framework for texinfo processing that
integrates texinfo into the constellation of SXML processing tools.

Notes on the SXML vocabulary
----------------------------

Consider the following texinfo fragment:

      @deffn Primitive set-car! pair value
      This function...
      @end deffn

   Logically, the category (Primitive), name (set-car!), and arguments
(pair value) are “attributes” of the deffn, with the description as the
content.  However, texinfo allows for @-commands within the arguments to
an environment, like ‘@deffn’, which means that texinfo “attributes” are
PCDATA. XML attributes, on the other hand, are CDATA. For this reason,
“attributes” of texinfo @-commands are called “arguments”, and are
grouped under the special element, ‘%’.

   Because ‘%’ is not a valid NCName, stexinfo is a superset of SXML. In
the interests of interoperability, this module provides a conversion
function to replace the ‘%’ with ‘texinfo-arguments’.

### 7.22.1.2 Usage
..............

 -- Function: call-with-file-and-dir filename proc
     Call the one-argument procedure PROC with an input port that reads
     from FILENAME.  During the dynamic extent of PROC’s execution, the
     current directory will be ‘(dirname FILENAME)’.  This is useful for
     parsing documents that can include files by relative path name.

 -- Variable: texi-command-specs

 -- Function: texi-command-depth command max-depth
     Given the texinfo command COMMAND, return its nesting level, or
     ‘#f’ if it nests too deep for MAX-DEPTH.

     Examples:

           (texi-command-depth 'chapter 4)        ⇒ 1
           (texi-command-depth 'top 4)            ⇒ 0
           (texi-command-depth 'subsection 4)     ⇒ 3
           (texi-command-depth 'appendixsubsec 4) ⇒ 3
           (texi-command-depth 'subsection 2)     ⇒ #f

 -- Function: texi-fragment->stexi string-or-port
     Parse the texinfo commands in STRING-OR-PORT, and return the
     resultant stexi tree.  The head of the tree will be the special
     command, ‘*fragment*’.

 -- Function: texi->stexi port
     Read a full texinfo document from PORT and return the parsed stexi
     tree.  The parsing will start at the ‘@settitle’ and end at ‘@bye’
     or EOF.

 -- Function: stexi->sxml tree
     Transform the stexi tree TREE into sxml.  This involves replacing
     the ‘%’ element that keeps the texinfo arguments with an element
     for each argument.

     FIXME: right now it just changes % to ‘texinfo-arguments’ – that
     doesn’t hang with the idea of making a dtd at some point

7.22.2 (texinfo docbook)
------------------------

### 7.22.2.1 Overview
.................

This module exports procedures for transforming a limited subset of the
SXML representation of docbook into stexi.  It is not complete by any
means.  The intention is to gather a number of routines and stylesheets
so that external modules can parse specific subsets of docbook, for
example that set generated by certain tools.

### 7.22.2.2 Usage
..............

 -- Variable: *sdocbook->stexi-rules*

 -- Variable: *sdocbook-block-commands*

 -- Function: sdocbook-flatten sdocbook
     "Flatten" a fragment of sdocbook so that block elements do not nest
     inside each other.

     Docbook is a nested format, where e.g.  a ‘refsect2’ normally
     appears inside a ‘refsect1’.  Logical divisions in the document are
     represented via the tree topology; a ‘refsect2’ element _contains_
     all of the elements in its section.

     On the contrary, texinfo is a flat format, in which sections are
     marked off by standalone section headers like ‘@subsection’, and
     block elements do not nest inside each other.

     This function takes a nested sdocbook fragment SDOCBOOK and
     flattens all of the sections, such that e.g.

           (refsect1 (refsect2 (para "Hello")))

     becomes

           ((refsect1) (refsect2) (para "Hello"))

     Oftentimes (always?)  sectioning elements have ‘<title>’ as their
     first element child; users interested in processing the ‘refsect*’
     elements into proper sectioning elements like ‘chapter’ might be
     interested in ‘replace-titles’ and ‘filter-empty-elements’.  *Note*
     replace-titles: texinfo docbook replace-titles, and *note*
     filter-empty-elements: texinfo docbook filter-empty-elements.

     Returns a nodeset; that is to say, an untagged list of stexi
     elements.  *Note* SXPath::, for the definition of a nodeset.

 -- Function: filter-empty-elements sdocbook
     Filters out empty elements in an sdocbook nodeset.  Mostly useful
     after running ‘sdocbook-flatten’.

 -- Function: replace-titles sdocbook-fragment
     Iterate over the sdocbook nodeset SDOCBOOK-FRAGMENT, transforming
     contiguous ‘refsect’ and ‘title’ elements into the appropriate
     texinfo sectioning command.  Most useful after having run
     ‘sdocbook-flatten’.

     For example:

           (replace-titles '((refsect1) (title "Foo") (para "Bar.")))
              ⇒ '((chapter "Foo") (para "Bar."))

7.22.3 (texinfo html)
---------------------

### 7.22.3.1 Overview
.................

This module implements transformation from ‘stexi’ to HTML. Note that
the output of ‘stexi->shtml’ is actually SXML with the HTML vocabulary.
This means that the output can be further processed, and that it must
eventually be serialized by ‘sxml->xml’.  *Note* Reading and Writing
XML::.

   References (i.e., the ‘@ref’ family of commands) are resolved by a
“ref-resolver”.  *Note* add-ref-resolver!: texinfo html
add-ref-resolver!.

### 7.22.3.2 Usage
..............

 -- Function: add-ref-resolver! proc
     Add PROC to the head of the list of ref-resolvers.  PROC will be
     expected to take the name of a node and the name of a manual and
     return the URL of the referent, or ‘#f’ to pass control to the next
     ref-resolver in the list.

     The default ref-resolver will return the concatenation of the
     manual name, ‘#’, and the node name.

 -- Function: stexi->shtml tree
     Transform the stexi TREE into shtml, resolving references via
     ref-resolvers.  See the module commentary for more details.

 -- Function: urlify str

7.22.4 (texinfo indexing)
-------------------------

### 7.22.4.1 Overview
.................

Given a piece of stexi, return an index of a specified variety.

   Note that currently, ‘stexi-extract-index’ doesn’t differentiate
between different kinds of index entries.  That’s a bug ;)

### 7.22.4.2 Usage
..............

 -- Function: stexi-extract-index tree manual-name kind
     Given an stexi tree TREE, index all of the entries of type KIND.
     KIND can be one of the predefined texinfo indices (‘concept’,
     ‘variable’, ‘function’, ‘key’, ‘program’, ‘type’) or one of the
     special symbols ‘auto’ or ‘all’.  ‘auto’ will scan the stext for a
     ‘(printindex)’ statement, and ‘all’ will generate an index from all
     entries, regardless of type.

     The returned index is a list of pairs, the CAR of which is the
     entry (a string) and the CDR of which is a node name (a string).

7.22.5 (texinfo string-utils)
-----------------------------

### 7.22.5.1 Overview
.................

Module ‘(texinfo string-utils)’ provides various string-related
functions useful to Guile’s texinfo support.

### 7.22.5.2 Usage
..............

 -- Function: escape-special-chars str special-chars escape-char
     Returns a copy of STR with all given special characters preceded by
     the given ESCAPE-CHAR.

     SPECIAL-CHARS can either be a single character, or a string
     consisting of all the special characters.

          ;; make a string regexp-safe...
           (escape-special-chars "***(Example String)***"
                                "[]()/*."
                                #\\)
          => "\\*\\*\\*\\(Example String\\)\\*\\*\\*"

          ;; also can escape a singe char...
           (escape-special-chars "richardt@vzavenue.net"
                                #\@
                                #\@)
          => "richardt@@vzavenue.net"

 -- Function: transform-string str match? replace [start] [end]
     Uses MATCH? against each character in STR, and performs a
     replacement on each character for which matches are found.

     MATCH? may either be a function, a character, a string, or ‘#t’.
     If MATCH? is a function, then it takes a single character as input,
     and should return ‘#t’ for matches.  MATCH? is a character, it is
     compared to each string character using ‘char=?’.  If MATCH? is a
     string, then any character in that string will be considered a
     match.  ‘#t’ will cause every character to be a match.

     If REPLACE is a function, it is called with the matched character
     as an argument, and the returned value is sent to the output string
     via ‘display’.  If REPLACE is anything else, it is sent through the
     output string via ‘display’.

     Note that the replacement for the matched characters does not need
     to be a single character.  That is what differentiates this
     function from ‘string-map’, and what makes it useful for
     applications such as converting ‘#\&’ to ‘"&amp;"’ in web page
     text.  Some other functions in this module are just wrappers around
     common uses of ‘transform-string’.  Transformations not possible
     with this function should probably be done with regular
     expressions.

     If START and END are given, they control which portion of the
     string undergoes transformation.  The entire input string is still
     output, though.  So, if START is ‘5’, then the first five
     characters of STR will still appear in the returned string.

          ; these two are equivalent...
           (transform-string str #\space #\-) ; change all spaces to -'s
           (transform-string str (lambda (c) (char=? #\space c)) #\-)

 -- Function: expand-tabs str [tab-size]
     Returns a copy of STR with all tabs expanded to spaces.  TAB-SIZE
     defaults to 8.

     Assuming tab size of 8, this is equivalent to:

           (transform-string str #\tab "        ")

 -- Function: center-string str [width] [chr] [rchr]
     Returns a copy of STR centered in a field of WIDTH characters.  Any
     needed padding is done by character CHR, which defaults to
     ‘#\space’.  If RCHR is provided, then the padding to the right will
     use it instead.  See the examples below.  left and RCHR on the
     right.  The default WIDTH is 80.  The default CHR and RCHR is
     ‘#\space’.  The string is never truncated.

           (center-string "Richard Todd" 24)
          => "      Richard Todd      "

           (center-string " Richard Todd " 24 #\=)
          => "===== Richard Todd ====="

           (center-string " Richard Todd " 24 #\< #\>)
          => "<<<<< Richard Todd >>>>>"

 -- Function: left-justify-string str [width] [chr]
     ‘left-justify-string str [width chr]’.  Returns a copy of STR
     padded with CHR such that it is left justified in a field of WIDTH
     characters.  The default WIDTH is 80.  Unlike ‘string-pad’ from
     srfi-13, the string is never truncated.

 -- Function: right-justify-string str [width] [chr]
     Returns a copy of STR padded with CHR such that it is right
     justified in a field of WIDTH characters.  The default WIDTH is 80.
     The default CHR is ‘#\space’.  Unlike ‘string-pad’ from srfi-13,
     the string is never truncated.

 -- Function: collapse-repeated-chars str [chr] [num]
     Returns a copy of STR with all repeated instances of CHR collapsed
     down to at most NUM instances.  The default value for CHR is
     ‘#\space’, and the default value for NUM is 1.

           (collapse-repeated-chars "H  e  l  l  o")
          => "H e l l o"
           (collapse-repeated-chars "H--e--l--l--o" #\-)
          => "H-e-l-l-o"
           (collapse-repeated-chars "H-e--l---l----o" #\- 2)
          => "H-e--l--l--o"

 -- Function: make-text-wrapper [#:line-width] [#:expand-tabs?]
          [#:tab-width] [#:collapse-whitespace?] [#:subsequent-indent]
          [#:initial-indent] [#:break-long-words?]
     Returns a procedure that will split a string into lines according
     to the given parameters.

     ‘#:line-width’
          This is the target length used when deciding where to wrap
          lines.  Default is 80.

     ‘#:expand-tabs?’
          Boolean describing whether tabs in the input should be
          expanded.  Default is #t.

     ‘#:tab-width’
          If tabs are expanded, this will be the number of spaces to
          which they expand.  Default is 8.

     ‘#:collapse-whitespace?’
          Boolean describing whether the whitespace inside the existing
          text should be removed or not.  Default is #t.

          If text is already well-formatted, and is just being wrapped
          to fit in a different width, then set this to ‘#f’.  This way,
          many common text conventions (such as two spaces between
          sentences) can be preserved if in the original text.  If the
          input text spacing cannot be trusted, then leave this setting
          at the default, and all repeated whitespace will be collapsed
          down to a single space.

     ‘#:initial-indent’
          Defines a string that will be put in front of the first line
          of wrapped text.  Default is the empty string, “”.

     ‘#:subsequent-indent’
          Defines a string that will be put in front of all lines of
          wrapped text, except the first one.  Default is the empty
          string, “”.

     ‘#:break-long-words?’
          If a single word is too big to fit on a line, this setting
          tells the wrapper what to do.  Defaults to #t, which will
          break up long words.  When set to #f, the line will be
          allowed, even though it is longer than the defined
          ‘#:line-width’.

     The return value is a procedure of one argument, the input string,
     which returns a list of strings, where each element of the list is
     one line.

 -- Function: fill-string str . kwargs
     Wraps the text given in string STR according to the parameters
     provided in KWARGS, or the default setting if they are not given.
     Returns a single string with the wrapped text.  Valid keyword
     arguments are discussed in ‘make-text-wrapper’.

 -- Function: string->wrapped-lines str . kwargs
     ‘string->wrapped-lines str keywds ...’.  Wraps the text given in
     string STR according to the parameters provided in KEYWDS, or the
     default setting if they are not given.  Returns a list of strings
     representing the formatted lines.  Valid keyword arguments are
     discussed in ‘make-text-wrapper’.

            "3.2"
            "26 September 2006"
            '(("Alyssa P Hacker" . "alyssa@example.com"))
            '(2004 2005 2006)
            "Free Software Foundation, Inc."
            "Standard GPL permissions blurb goes here")

 -- Function: package-stexi-generic-menu name entries
     Create a menu from a generic alist of entries, the car of which
     should be the node name, and the cdr the description.  As an
     exception, an entry of ‘#f’ will produce a separator.

 -- Function: package-stexi-standard-menu name modules
          module-descriptions extra-entries
     Create a standard top node and menu, suitable for processing by
     makeinfo.

 -- Function: package-stexi-extended-menu name module-pairs script-pairs
          extra-entries
     Create an "extended" menu, like the standard menu but with a
     section for scripts.

 -- Function: package-stexi-standard-prologue name filename category
          description copying titlepage menu
     Create a standard prologue, suitable for later serialization to
     texinfo and .info creation with makeinfo.

     Returns a list of stexinfo forms suitable for passing to
     ‘package-stexi-documentation’ as the prologue.  *Note* texinfo
     reflection package-stexi-documentation::, *note*
     package-stexi-standard-titlepage: texinfo reflection
     package-stexi-standard-titlepage, *note*
     package-stexi-standard-copying: texinfo reflection
     package-stexi-standard-copying, and *note*
     package-stexi-standard-menu: texinfo reflection
     package-stexi-standard-menu.

 -- Function: package-stexi-documentation modules name filename prologue
          epilogue [#:module-stexi-documentation-args] [#:scripts]
     Create stexi documentation for a “package”, where a package is a
     set of modules that is released together.

     MODULES is expected to be a list of module names, where a module
     name is a list of symbols.  The stexi that is returned will be
     titled NAME and a texinfo filename of FILENAME.

     PROLOGUE and EPILOGUE are lists of stexi forms that will be spliced
     into the output document before and after the generated modules
     documentation, respectively.  *Note* texinfo reflection
     package-stexi-standard-prologue::, to create a conventional GNU
     texinfo prologue.

     MODULE-STEXI-DOCUMENTATION-ARGS is an optional argument that, if
     given, will be added to the argument list when
     ‘module-texi-documentation’ is called.  For example, it might be
     useful to define a ‘#:docs-resolver’ argument.

 -- Function: package-stexi-documentation-for-include modules
          module-descriptions [#:module-stexi-documentation-args]
     Create stexi documentation for a “package”, where a package is a
     set of modules that is released together.

     MODULES is expected to be a list of module names, where a module
     name is a list of symbols.  Returns an stexinfo fragment.

     Unlike ‘package-stexi-documentation’, this function simply produces
     a menu and the module documentations instead of producing a full
     texinfo document.  This can be useful if you write part of your
     manual by hand, and just use ‘@include’ to pull in the
     automatically generated parts.

     MODULE-STEXI-DOCUMENTATION-ARGS is an optional argument that, if
     given, will be added to the argument list when
     ‘module-texi-documentation’ is called.  For example, it might be
     useful to define a ‘#:docs-resolver’ argument.

# 📜 8 GOOPS
*******

GOOPS is the object oriented extension to Guile.  Its implementation is
derived from STk-3.99.3 by Erick Gallesio and version 1.3 of Gregor
Kiczales’ ‘Tiny-Clos’.  It is very close in spirit to CLOS, the Common
Lisp Object System, but is adapted for the Scheme language.

   GOOPS is a full object oriented system, with classes, objects,
multiple inheritance, and generic functions with multi-method dispatch.
Furthermore its implementation relies on a meta object protocol — which
means that GOOPS’s core operations are themselves defined as methods on
relevant classes, and can be customised by overriding or redefining
those methods.

   To start using GOOPS you first need to import the ‘(oop goops)’
module.  You can do this at the Guile REPL by evaluating:

     (use-modules (oop goops))

File: guile.info,  Node: Class Definition,  Next: Instance Creation,  Prev: Copyright Notice,  Up: GOOPS

8.2 Class Definition
====================

A new class is defined with the ‘define-class’ syntax:

     (define-class CLASS (SUPERCLASS ...)
        SLOT-DESCRIPTION ...
        CLASS-OPTION ...)

   CLASS is the class being defined.  The list of SUPERCLASSes specifies
which existing classes, if any, to inherit slots and properties from.
“Slots” hold per-instance(1) data, for instances of that class — like
“fields” or “member variables” in other object oriented systems.  Each
SLOT-DESCRIPTION gives the name of a slot and optionally some
“properties” of this slot; for example its initial value, the name of a
function which will access its value, and so on.  Class options, slot
descriptions and inheritance are discussed more below.

 -- syntax: define-class name (super ...) slot-definition ...
          class-option ...
     Define a class called NAME that inherits from SUPERs, with direct
     slots defined by SLOT-DEFINITIONs and CLASS-OPTIONs.  The newly
     created class is bound to the variable name NAME in the current
     environment.

     Each SLOT-DEFINITION is either a symbol that names the slot or a
     list,

          (SLOT-NAME-SYMBOL . SLOT-OPTIONS)

     where SLOT-NAME-SYMBOL is a symbol and SLOT-OPTIONS is a list with
     an even number of elements.  The even-numbered elements of
     SLOT-OPTIONS (counting from zero) are slot option keywords; the
     odd-numbered elements are the corresponding values for those
     keywords.

     Each CLASS-OPTION is an option keyword and corresponding value.

   As an example, let us define a type for representing a complex number
in terms of two real numbers.(2)  This can be done with the following
class definition:

     (define-class <my-complex> (<number>)
        r i)

   This binds the variable ‘<my-complex>’ to a new class whose instances
will contain two slots.  These slots are called ‘r’ and ‘i’ and will
hold the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.  Note that this
class inherits from ‘<number>’, which is a predefined class.(3)

   Slot options are described in the next section.  The possible class
options are as follows.

 -- class option: #:metaclass metaclass
     The ‘#:metaclass’ class option specifies the metaclass of the class
     being defined.  METACLASS must be a class that inherits from
     ‘<class>’.  For the use of metaclasses, see *note* Metaobjects and
     the Metaobject Protocol:: and *note* Metaclasses::.

     If the ‘#:metaclass’ option is absent, GOOPS reuses or constructs a
     metaclass for the new class by calling ‘ensure-metaclass’ (*note*
     ensure-metaclass: Class Definition Protocol.).

 -- class option: #:name name
     The ‘#:name’ class option specifies the new class’s name.  This
     name is used to identify the class whenever related objects - the
     class itself, its instances and its subclasses - are printed.

     If the ‘#:name’ option is absent, GOOPS uses the first argument to
     ‘define-class’ as the class name.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Usually — but see also the ‘#:allocation’ slot option.

   (2) Of course Guile already provides complex numbers, and ‘<complex>’
is in fact a predefined class in GOOPS; but the definition here is still
useful as an example.

   (3) ‘<number>’ is the direct superclass of the predefined class
‘<complex>’; ‘<complex>’ is the superclass of ‘<real>’, and ‘<real>’ is
the superclass of ‘<integer>’.

8.3 Instance Creation and Slot Access
=====================================

An instance (or object) of a defined class can be created with ‘make’.
‘make’ takes one mandatory parameter, which is the class of the instance
to create, and a list of optional arguments that will be used to
initialize the slots of the new instance.  For instance the following
form

     (define c (make <my-complex>))

creates a new ‘<my-complex>’ object and binds it to the Scheme variable
‘c’.

 -- generic: make
 -- method: make (class <class>) initarg ...
     Create and return a new instance of class CLASS, initialized using
     INITARG ....

     In theory, INITARG ... can have any structure that is understood by
     whatever methods get applied when the ‘initialize’ generic function
     is applied to the newly allocated instance.

     In practice, specialized ‘initialize’ methods would normally call
     ‘(next-method)’, and so eventually the standard GOOPS ‘initialize’
     methods are applied.  These methods expect INITARGS to be a list
     with an even number of elements, where even-numbered elements
     (counting from zero) are keywords and odd-numbered elements are the
     corresponding values.

     GOOPS processes initialization argument keywords automatically for
     slots whose definition includes the ‘#:init-keyword’ option (*note*
     init-keyword: Slot Options.).  Other keyword value pairs can only
     be processed by an ‘initialize’ method that is specialized for the
     new instance’s class.  Any unprocessed keyword value pairs are
     ignored.

 -- generic: make-instance
 -- method: make-instance (class <class>) initarg ...
     ‘make-instance’ is an alias for ‘make’.

   The slots of the new complex number can be accessed using ‘slot-ref’
and ‘slot-set!’.  ‘slot-set!’ sets the value of an object slot and
‘slot-ref’ retrieves it.

     (slot-set! c 'r 10)
     (slot-set! c 'i 3)
     (slot-ref c 'r) ⇒ 10
     (slot-ref c 'i) ⇒ 3

   The ‘(oop goops describe)’ module provides a ‘describe’ function that
is useful for seeing all the slots of an object; it prints the slots and
their values to standard output.

     (describe c)
     ⊣
     #<<my-complex> 401d8638> is an instance of class <my-complex>
     Slots are:
          r = 10
          i = 3

8.4 Slot Options
================

When specifying a slot (in a ‘(define-class ...)’ form), various options
can be specified in addition to the slot’s name.  Each option is
specified by a keyword.  The list of possible keywords is as follows.

 -- slot option: #:init-value init-value
 -- slot option: #:init-form init-form
 -- slot option: #:init-thunk init-thunk
 -- slot option: #:init-keyword init-keyword
     These options provide various ways to specify how to initialize the
     slot’s value at instance creation time.

     INIT-VALUE specifies a fixed initial slot value (shared across all
     new instances of the class).

     INIT-THUNK specifies a thunk that will provide a default value for
     the slot.  The thunk is called when a new instance is created and
     should return the desired initial slot value.

     INIT-FORM specifies a form that, when evaluated, will return an
     initial value for the slot.  The form is evaluated each time that
     an instance of the class is created, in the lexical environment of
     the containing ‘define-class’ expression.

     INIT-KEYWORD specifies a keyword that can be used to pass an
     initial slot value to ‘make’ when creating a new instance.

     Note that, since an ‘init-value’ value is shared across all
     instances of a class, you should only use it when the initial value
     is an immutable value, like a constant.  If you want to initialize
     a slot with a fresh, independently mutable value, you should use
     ‘init-thunk’ or ‘init-form’ instead.  Consider the following
     example.

          (define-class <chbouib> ()
            (hashtab #:init-value (make-hash-table)))

     Here only one hash table is created and all instances of
     ‘<chbouib>’ have their ‘hashtab’ slot refer to it.  In order to
     have each instance of ‘<chbouib>’ refer to a new hash table, you
     should instead write:

          (define-class <chbouib> ()
            (hashtab #:init-thunk make-hash-table))

     or:

          (define-class <chbouib> ()
            (hashtab #:init-form (make-hash-table)))

     If more than one of these options is specified for the same slot,
     the order of precedence, highest first is

        • ‘#:init-keyword’, if INIT-KEYWORD is present in the options
          passed to ‘make’

        • ‘#:init-thunk’, ‘#:init-form’ or ‘#:init-value’.

     If the slot definition contains more than one initialization option
     of the same precedence, the later ones are ignored.  If a slot is
     not initialized at all, its value is unbound.

     In general, slots that are shared between more than one instance
     are only initialized at new instance creation time if the slot
     value is unbound at that time.  However, if the new instance
     creation specifies a valid init keyword and value for a shared
     slot, the slot is re-initialized regardless of its previous value.

     Note, however, that the power of GOOPS’ metaobject protocol means
     that everything written here may be customized or overridden for
     particular classes!  The slot initializations described here are
     performed by the least specialized method of the generic function
     ‘initialize’, whose signature is

          (define-method (initialize (object <object>) initargs) ...)

     The initialization of instances of any given class can be
     customized by defining a ‘initialize’ method that is specialized
     for that class, and the author of the specialized method may decide
     to call ‘next-method’ - which will result in a call to the next
     less specialized ‘initialize’ method - at any point within the
     specialized code, or maybe not at all.  In general, therefore, the
     initialization mechanisms described here may be modified or
     overridden by more specialized code, or may not be supported at all
     for particular classes.

 -- slot option: #:getter getter
 -- slot option: #:setter setter
 -- slot option: #:accessor accessor
     Given an object OBJ with slots named ‘foo’ and ‘bar’, it is always
     possible to read and write those slots by calling ‘slot-ref’ and
     ‘slot-set!’ with the relevant slot name; for example:

          (slot-ref OBJ 'foo)
          (slot-set! OBJ 'bar 25)

     The ‘#:getter’, ‘#:setter’ and ‘#:accessor’ options, if present,
     tell GOOPS to create generic function and method definitions that
     can be used to get and set the slot value more conveniently.
     GETTER specifies a generic function to which GOOPS will add a
     method for getting the slot value.  SETTER specifies a generic
     function to which GOOPS will add a method for setting the slot
     value.  ACCESSOR specifies an accessor to which GOOPS will add
     methods for both getting and setting the slot value.

     So if a class includes a slot definition like this:

          (c #:getter get-count #:setter set-count #:accessor count)

     GOOPS defines generic function methods such that the slot value can
     be referenced using either the getter or the accessor -

          (let ((current-count (get-count obj))) ...)
          (let ((current-count (count obj))) ...)

     - and set using either the setter or the accessor -

          (set-count obj (+ 1 current-count))
          (set! (count obj) (+ 1 current-count))

     Note that

        • with an accessor, the slot value is set using the generalized
          ‘set!’ syntax

        • in practice, it is unusual for a slot to use all three of
          these options: read-only, write-only and read-write slots
          would typically use only ‘#:getter’, ‘#:setter’ and
          ‘#:accessor’ options respectively.

     The binding of the specified names is done in the environment of
     the ‘define-class’ expression.  If the names are already bound (in
     that environment) to values that cannot be upgraded to generic
     functions, those values are overwritten when the ‘define-class’
     expression is evaluated.  For more detail, see *note*
     ensure-generic: Generic Function Internals.

 -- slot option: #:allocation allocation
     The ‘#:allocation’ option tells GOOPS how to allocate storage for
     the slot.  Possible values for ALLOCATION are

        • ‘#:instance’

          Indicates that GOOPS should create separate storage for this
          slot in each new instance of the containing class (and its
          subclasses).  This is the default.

        • ‘#:class’

          Indicates that GOOPS should create storage for this slot that
          is shared by all instances of the containing class (and its
          subclasses).  In other words, a slot in class C with
          allocation ‘#:class’ is shared by all INSTANCEs for which
          ‘(is-a? INSTANCE C)’.  This permits defining a kind of global
          variable which can be accessed only by (in)direct instances of
          the class which defines the slot.

        • ‘#:each-subclass’

          Indicates that GOOPS should create storage for this slot that
          is shared by all _direct_ instances of the containing class,
          and that whenever a subclass of the containing class is
          defined, GOOPS should create a new storage for the slot that
          is shared by all _direct_ instances of the subclass.  In other
          words, a slot with allocation ‘#:each-subclass’ is shared by
          all instances with the same ‘class-of’.

        • ‘#:virtual’

          Indicates that GOOPS should not allocate storage for this
          slot.  The slot definition must also include the ‘#:slot-ref’
          and ‘#:slot-set!’ options to specify how to reference and set
          the value for this slot.  See the example below.

     Slot allocation options are processed when defining a new class by
     the generic function ‘compute-get-n-set’, which is specialized by
     the class’s metaclass.  Hence new types of slot allocation can be
     implemented by defining a new metaclass and a method for
     ‘compute-get-n-set’ that is specialized for the new metaclass.  For
     an example of how to do this, see *note* Customizing Class
     Definition::.

 -- slot option: #:slot-ref getter
 -- slot option: #:slot-set! setter
     The ‘#:slot-ref’ and ‘#:slot-set!’ options must be specified if the
     slot allocation is ‘#:virtual’, and are ignored otherwise.

     GETTER should be a closure taking a single INSTANCE parameter that
     returns the current slot value.  SETTER should be a closure taking
     two parameters - INSTANCE and NEW-VAL - that sets the slot value to
     NEW-VAL.

8.5 Illustrating Slot Description
=================================

To illustrate slot description, we can redefine the ‘<my-complex>’ class
seen before.  A definition could be:

     (define-class <my-complex> (<number>)
        (r #:init-value 0 #:getter get-r #:setter set-r! #:init-keyword #:r)
        (i #:init-value 0 #:getter get-i #:setter set-i! #:init-keyword #:i))

With this definition, the ‘r’ and ‘i’ slots are set to 0 by default, and
can be initialised to other values by calling ‘make’ with the ‘#:r’ and
‘#:i’ keywords.  Also the generic functions ‘get-r’, ‘set-r!’, ‘get-i’
and ‘set-i!’ are automatically defined to read and write the slots.

     (define c1 (make <my-complex> #:r 1 #:i 2))
     (get-r c1) ⇒ 1
     (set-r! c1 12)
     (get-r c1) ⇒ 12
     (define c2 (make <my-complex> #:r 2))
     (get-r c2) ⇒ 2
     (get-i c2) ⇒ 0

   Accessors can both read and write a slot.  So, another definition of
the ‘<my-complex>’ class, using the ‘#:accessor’ option, could be:

     (define-class <my-complex> (<number>)
        (r #:init-value 0 #:accessor real-part #:init-keyword #:r)
        (i #:init-value 0 #:accessor imag-part #:init-keyword #:i))

With this definition, the ‘r’ slot can be read with:
     (real-part c)
and set with:
     (set! (real-part c) new-value)

   Suppose now that we want to manipulate complex numbers with both
rectangular and polar coordinates.  One solution could be to have a
definition of complex numbers which uses one particular representation
and some conversion functions to pass from one representation to the
other.  A better solution is to use virtual slots, like this:

     (define-class <my-complex> (<number>)
        ;; True slots use rectangular coordinates
        (r #:init-value 0 #:accessor real-part #:init-keyword #:r)
        (i #:init-value 0 #:accessor imag-part #:init-keyword #:i)
        ;; Virtual slots access do the conversion
        (m #:accessor magnitude #:init-keyword #:magn
           #:allocation #:virtual
           #:slot-ref (lambda (o)
                       (let ((r (slot-ref o 'r)) (i (slot-ref o 'i)))
                         (sqrt (+ (* r r) (* i i)))))
           #:slot-set! (lambda (o m)
                         (let ((a (slot-ref o 'a)))
                           (slot-set! o 'r (* m (cos a)))
                           (slot-set! o 'i (* m (sin a))))))
        (a #:accessor angle #:init-keyword #:angle
           #:allocation #:virtual
           #:slot-ref (lambda (o)
                       (atan (slot-ref o 'i) (slot-ref o 'r)))
           #:slot-set! (lambda(o a)
                        (let ((m (slot-ref o 'm)))
                           (slot-set! o 'r (* m (cos a)))
                           (slot-set! o 'i (* m (sin a)))))))


   In this class definition, the magnitude ‘m’ and angle ‘a’ slots are
virtual, and are calculated, when referenced, from the normal (i.e.
‘#:allocation #:instance’) slots ‘r’ and ‘i’, by calling the function
defined in the relevant ‘#:slot-ref’ option.  Correspondingly, writing
‘m’ or ‘a’ leads to calling the function defined in the ‘#:slot-set!’
option.  Thus the following expression

     (slot-set! c 'a 3)

permits to set the angle of the ‘c’ complex number.

     (define c (make <my-complex> #:r 12 #:i 20))
     (real-part c) ⇒ 12
     (angle c) ⇒ 1.03037682652431
     (slot-set! c 'i 10)
     (set! (real-part c) 1)
     (describe c)
     ⊣
     #<<my-complex> 401e9b58> is an instance of class <my-complex>
     Slots are:
          r = 1
          i = 10
          m = 10.0498756211209
          a = 1.47112767430373

   Since initialization keywords have been defined for the four slots,
we can now define the standard Scheme primitives ‘make-rectangular’ and
‘make-polar’.

     (define make-rectangular
        (lambda (x y) (make <my-complex> #:r x #:i y)))

     (define make-polar
        (lambda (x y) (make <my-complex> #:magn x #:angle y)))

8.6 Methods and Generic Functions
=================================

A GOOPS method is like a Scheme procedure except that it is specialized
for a particular set of argument classes, and will only be used when the
actual arguments in a call match the classes in the method definition.

     (define-method (+ (x <string>) (y <string>))
       (string-append x y))

     (+ "abc" "de") ⇒ "abcde"

   A method is not formally associated with any single class (as it is
in many other object oriented languages), because a method can be
specialized for a combination of several classes.  If you’ve studied
object orientation in non-Lispy languages, you may remember discussions
such as whether a method to stretch a graphical image around a surface
should be a method of the image class, with a surface as a parameter, or
a method of the surface class, with an image as a parameter.  In GOOPS
you’d just write

     (define-method (stretch (im <image>) (sf <surface>))
       ...)

and the question of which class the method is more associated with does
not need answering.

   There can simultaneously be several methods with the same name but
different sets of specializing argument classes; for example:

     (define-method (+ (x <string>) (y <string)) ...)
     (define-method (+ (x <matrix>) (y <matrix>)) ...)
     (define-method (+ (f <fish>) (b <bicycle>)) ...)
     (define-method (+ (a <foo>) (b <bar>) (c <baz>)) ...)

A generic function is a container for the set of such methods that a
program intends to use.

   If you look at a program’s source code, and see ‘(+ x y)’ somewhere
in it, conceptually what is happening is that the program at that point
calls a generic function (in this case, the generic function bound to
the identifier ‘+’).  When that happens, Guile works out which of the
generic function’s methods is the most appropriate for the arguments
that the function is being called with; then it evaluates the method’s
code with the arguments as formal parameters.  This happens every time
that a generic function call is evaluated — it isn’t assumed that a
given source code call will end up invoking the same method every time.

   Defining an identifier as a generic function is done with the
‘define-generic’ macro.  Definition of a new method is done with the
‘define-method’ macro.  Note that ‘define-method’ automatically does a
‘define-generic’ if the identifier concerned is not already a generic
function, so often an explicit ‘define-generic’ call is not needed.

 -- syntax: define-generic symbol
     Create a generic function with name SYMBOL and bind it to the
     variable SYMBOL.  If SYMBOL was previously bound to a Scheme
     procedure (or procedure-with-setter), the old procedure (and
     setter) is incorporated into the new generic function as its
     default procedure (and setter).  Any other previous value,
     including an existing generic function, is discarded and replaced
     by a new, empty generic function.

 -- syntax: define-method (generic parameter ...) body ...
     Define a method for the generic function or accessor GENERIC with
     parameters PARAMETERs and body BODY ....

     GENERIC is a generic function.  If GENERIC is a variable which is
     not yet bound to a generic function object, the expansion of
     ‘define-method’ will include a call to ‘define-generic’.  If
     GENERIC is ‘(setter GENERIC-WITH-SETTER)’, where
     GENERIC-WITH-SETTER is a variable which is not yet bound to a
     generic-with-setter object, the expansion will include a call to
     ‘define-accessor’.

     Each PARAMETER must be either a symbol or a two-element list
     ‘(SYMBOL CLASS)’.  The symbols refer to variables in the body forms
     that will be bound to the parameters supplied by the caller when
     calling this method.  The CLASSes, if present, specify the possible
     combinations of parameters to which this method can be applied.

     BODY ... are the bodies of the method definition.

   ‘define-method’ expressions look a little like Scheme procedure
definitions of the form

     (define (name formals ...) . body)

   The important difference is that each formal parameter, apart from
the possible “rest” argument, can be qualified by a class name: ‘FORMAL’
becomes ‘(FORMAL CLASS)’.  The meaning of this qualification is that the
method being defined will only be applicable in a particular generic
function invocation if the corresponding argument is an instance of
‘CLASS’ (or one of its subclasses).  If more than one of the formal
parameters is qualified in this way, then the method will only be
applicable if each of the corresponding arguments is an instance of its
respective qualifying class.

   Note that unqualified formal parameters act as though they are
qualified by the class ‘<top>’, which GOOPS uses to mean the superclass
of all valid Scheme types, including both primitive types and GOOPS
classes.

   For example, if a generic function method is defined with PARAMETERs
‘(s1 <square>)’ and ‘(n <number>)’, that method is only applicable to
invocations of its generic function that have two parameters where the
first parameter is an instance of the ‘<square>’ class and the second
parameter is a number.

8.6.1 Accessors
---------------

An accessor is a generic function that can also be used with the
generalized ‘set!’ syntax (*note* Procedures with Setters::).  Guile will
handle a call like

     (set! (accessor args...) value)

by calling the most specialized method of ‘accessor’ that matches the
classes of ‘args’ and ‘value’.  ‘define-accessor’ is used to bind an
identifier to an accessor.

 -- syntax: define-accessor symbol
     Create an accessor with name SYMBOL and bind it to the variable
     SYMBOL.  If SYMBOL was previously bound to a Scheme procedure (or
     procedure-with-setter), the old procedure (and setter) is
     incorporated into the new accessor as its default procedure (and
     setter).  Any other previous value, including an existing generic
     function or accessor, is discarded and replaced by a new, empty
     accessor.


File: guile.info,  Node: Extending Primitives,  Next: Merging Generics,  Prev: Accessors,  Up: Methods and Generic Functions

8.6.2 Extending Primitives
--------------------------

Many of Guile’s primitive procedures can be extended by giving them a
generic function definition that operates in conjunction with their
normal C-coded implementation.  When a primitive is extended in this
way, it behaves like a generic function with the C-coded implementation
as its default method.

   This extension happens automatically if a method is defined (by a
‘define-method’ call) for a variable whose current value is a primitive.
But it can also be forced by calling ‘enable-primitive-generic!’.

 -- primitive procedure: enable-primitive-generic! primitive
     Force the creation of a generic function definition for PRIMITIVE.

   Once the generic function definition for a primitive has been
created, it can be retrieved using ‘primitive-generic-generic’.

 -- primitive procedure: primitive-generic-generic primitive
     Return the generic function definition of PRIMITIVE.

     ‘primitive-generic-generic’ raises an error if PRIMITIVE is not a
     primitive with generic capability.

8.6.3 Merging Generics
----------------------

GOOPS generic functions and accessors often have short, generic names.
For example, if a vector package provides an accessor for the X
coordinate of a vector, that accessor may just be called ‘x’.  It
doesn’t need to be called, for example, ‘vector:x’, because GOOPS will
work out, when it sees code like ‘(x OBJ)’, that the vector-specific
method of ‘x’ should be called if OBJ is a vector.

   That raises the question, though, of what happens when different
packages define a generic function with the same name.  Suppose we work
with a graphical package which needs to use two independent vector
packages for 2D and 3D vectors respectively.  If both packages export
‘x’, what does the code using those packages end up with?

   *note* duplicate binding handlers: Creating Guile Modules. explains
how this is resolved for conflicting bindings in general.  For generics,
there is a special duplicates handler, ‘merge-generics’, which tells the
module system to merge generic functions with the same name.  Here is an
example:

     (define-module (math 2D-vectors)
       #:use-module (oop goops)
       #:export (x y ...))

     (define-module (math 3D-vectors)
       #:use-module (oop goops)
       #:export (x y z ...))

     (define-module (my-module)
       #:use-module (oop goops)
       #:use-module (math 2D-vectors)
       #:use-module (math 3D-vectors)
       #:duplicates (merge-generics))

   The generic function ‘x’ in ‘(my-module)’ will now incorporate all of
the methods of ‘x’ from both imported modules.

   To be precise, there will now be three distinct generic functions
named ‘x’: ‘x’ in ‘(math 2D-vectors)’, ‘x’ in ‘(math 3D-vectors)’, and
‘x’ in ‘(my-module)’; and these functions share their methods in an
interesting and dynamic way.

   To explain, let’s call the imported generic functions (in ‘(math
2D-vectors)’ and ‘(math 3D-vectors)’) the “ancestors”, and the merged
generic function (in ‘(my-module)’), the “descendant”.  The general rule
is that for any generic function G, the applicable methods are selected
from the union of the methods of G’s descendant functions, the methods
of G itself and the methods of G’s ancestor functions.

   Thus ancestor functions effectively share methods with their
descendants, and vice versa.  In the example above, ‘x’ in ‘(math
2D-vectors)’ will share the methods of ‘x’ in ‘(my-module)’ and vice
versa.(1)  Sharing is dynamic, so adding another new method to a
descendant implies adding it to that descendant’s ancestors too.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) But note that ‘x’ in ‘(math 2D-vectors)’ doesn’t share methods
with ‘x’ in ‘(math 3D-vectors)’, so modularity is still preserved.

8.6.4 Next-method
-----------------

When you call a generic function, with a particular set of arguments,
GOOPS builds a list of all the methods that are applicable to those
arguments and orders them by how closely the method definitions match
the actual argument types.  It then calls the method at the top of this
list.  If the selected method’s code wants to call on to the next method
in this list, it can do so by using ‘next-method’.

     (define-method (Test (a <integer>)) (cons 'integer (next-method)))
     (define-method (Test (a <number>))  (cons 'number  (next-method)))
     (define-method (Test a)             (list 'top))

   With these definitions,

     (Test 1)   ⇒ (integer number top)
     (Test 1.0) ⇒ (number top)
     (Test #t)  ⇒ (top)

   ‘next-method’ is always called as just ‘(next-method)’.  The
arguments for the next method call are always implicit, and always the
same as for the original method call.

   If you want to call on to a method with the same name but with a
different set of arguments (as you might with overloaded methods in C++,
for example), you do not use ‘next-method’, but instead simply write the
new call as usual:

     (define-method (Test (a <number>) min max)
       (if (and (>= a min) (<= a max))
           (display "Number is in range\n"))
       (Test a))

     (Test 2 1 10)
     ⊣
     Number is in range
     ⇒
     (integer number top)

   (You should be careful in this case that the ‘Test’ calls do not lead
to an infinite recursion, but this consideration is just the same as in
Scheme code in general.)


File: guile.info,  Node: Generic Function and Method Examples,  Next: Handling Invocation Errors,  Prev: Next-method,  Up: Methods and Generic Functions

8.6.5 Generic Function and Method Examples
------------------------------------------

Consider the following definitions:

     (define-generic G)
     (define-method (G (a <integer>) b) 'integer)
     (define-method (G (a <real>) b) 'real)
     (define-method (G a b) 'top)

   The ‘define-generic’ call defines G as a generic function.  The three
next lines define methods for G.  Each method uses a sequence of
“parameter specializers” that specify when the given method is
applicable.  A specializer permits to indicate the class a parameter
must belong to (directly or indirectly) to be applicable.  If no
specializer is given, the system defaults it to ‘<top>’.  Thus, the
first method definition is equivalent to

     (define-method (G (a <integer>) (b <top>)) 'integer)

   Now, let’s look at some possible calls to the generic function G:

     (G 2 3)    ⇒ integer
     (G 2 #t)   ⇒ integer
     (G 1.2 'a) ⇒ real
     (G #t #f)  ⇒ top
     (G 1 2 3)  ⇒ error (since no method exists for 3 parameters)

   The methods above use only one specializer per parameter list.  But
in general, any or all of a method’s parameters may be specialized.
Suppose we define now:

     (define-method (G (a <integer>) (b <number>))  'integer-number)
     (define-method (G (a <integer>) (b <real>))    'integer-real)
     (define-method (G (a <integer>) (b <integer>)) 'integer-integer)
     (define-method (G a (b <number>))              'top-number)

With these definitions:

     (G 1 2)   ⇒ integer-integer
     (G 1 1.0) ⇒ integer-real
     (G 1 #t)  ⇒ integer
     (G 'a 1)  ⇒ top-number

   As a further example we shall continue to define operations on the
‘<my-complex>’ class.  Suppose that we want to use it to implement
complex numbers completely.  For instance a definition for the addition
of two complex numbers could be

     (define-method (new-+ (a <my-complex>) (b <my-complex>))
       (make-rectangular (+ (real-part a) (real-part b))
                         (+ (imag-part a) (imag-part b))))

   To be sure that the ‘+’ used in the method ‘new-+’ is the standard
addition we can do:

     (define-generic new-+)

     (let ((+ +))
       (define-method (new-+ (a <my-complex>) (b <my-complex>))
         (make-rectangular (+ (real-part a) (real-part b))
                           (+ (imag-part a) (imag-part b)))))

   The ‘define-generic’ ensures here that ‘new-+’ will be defined in the
global environment.  Once this is done, we can add methods to the
generic function ‘new-+’ which make a closure on the ‘+’ symbol.  A
complete writing of the ‘new-+’ methods is shown in *note* Figure 8.1:
fig:newplus.

     (define-generic new-+)

     (let ((+ +))

       (define-method (new-+ (a <real>) (b <real>)) (+ a b))

       (define-method (new-+ (a <real>) (b <my-complex>))
         (make-rectangular (+ a (real-part b)) (imag-part b)))

       (define-method (new-+ (a <my-complex>) (b <real>))
         (make-rectangular (+ (real-part a) b) (imag-part a)))

       (define-method (new-+ (a <my-complex>) (b <my-complex>))
         (make-rectangular (+ (real-part a) (real-part b))
                           (+ (imag-part a) (imag-part b))))

       (define-method (new-+ (a <number>))  a)

       (define-method (new-+) 0)

       (define-method (new-+ . args)
         (new-+ (car args)
           (apply new-+ (cdr args)))))

     (set! + new-+)


Figure 8.1: Extending ‘+’ to handle complex numbers

   We take advantage here of the fact that generic function are not
obliged to have a fixed number of parameters.  The four first methods
implement dyadic addition.  The fifth method says that the addition of a
single element is this element itself.  The sixth method says that using
the addition with no parameter always return 0 (as is also true for the
primitive ‘+’).  The last method takes an arbitrary number of
parameters(1).  This method acts as a kind of ‘reduce’: it calls the
dyadic addition on the _car_ of the list and on the result of applying
it on its rest.  To finish, the ‘set!’ permits to redefine the ‘+’
symbol to our extended addition.

   To conclude our implementation (integration?)  of complex numbers, we
could redefine standard Scheme predicates in the following manner:

     (define-method (complex? c <my-complex>) #t)
     (define-method (complex? c)           #f)

     (define-method (number? n <number>) #t)
     (define-method (number? n)          #f)
     ...

   Standard primitives in which complex numbers are involved could also
be redefined in the same manner.

used for Scheme procedures.  In particular it can use the dot notation
or a symbol to denote an arbitrary number of parameters

8.6.6 Handling Invocation Errors
--------------------------------

If a generic function is invoked with a combination of parameters for
which there is no applicable method, GOOPS raises an error.

 -- generic: no-method
 -- method: no-method (gf <generic>) args
     When an application invokes a generic function, and no methods at
     all have been defined for that generic function, GOOPS calls the
     ‘no-method’ generic function.  The default method calls
     ‘goops-error’ with an appropriate message.

 -- generic: no-applicable-method
 -- method: no-applicable-method (gf <generic>) args
     When an application applies a generic function to a set of
     arguments, and no methods have been defined for those argument
     types, GOOPS calls the ‘no-applicable-method’ generic function.
     The default method calls ‘goops-error’ with an appropriate message.

 -- generic: no-next-method
 -- method: no-next-method (gf <generic>) args
     When a generic function method calls ‘(next-method)’ to invoke the
     next less specialized method for that generic function, and no less
     specialized methods have been defined for the current generic
     function arguments, GOOPS calls the ‘no-next-method’ generic
     function.  The default method calls ‘goops-error’ with an
     appropriate message.

8.7 Inheritance
===============

Here are some class definitions to help illustrate inheritance:

     (define-class A () a)
     (define-class B () b)
     (define-class C () c)
     (define-class D (A B) d a)
     (define-class E (A C) e c)
     (define-class F (D E) f)

   ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ have a null list of superclasses.  In this case, the
system will replace the null list by a list which only contains
‘<object>’, the root of all the classes defined by ‘define-class’.  ‘D’,
‘E’, ‘F’ use multiple inheritance: each class inherits from two
previously defined classes.  Those class definitions define a hierarchy
which is shown in *note* Figure 8.2: fig:hier.  In this figure, the class
‘<top>’ is also shown; this class is the superclass of all Scheme
objects.  In particular, ‘<top>’ is the superclass of all standard
Scheme types.

          <top>

Figure 8.2: A class hierarchy.

   When a class has superclasses, its set of slots is calculated by
taking the union of its own slots and those of all its superclasses.
Thus each instance of D will have three slots, ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘d’).  The
slots of a class can be discovered using the ‘class-slots’ primitive.
For instance,

     (class-slots A) ⇒ ((a))
     (class-slots E) ⇒ ((a) (e) (c))
     (class-slots F) ⇒ ((e) (c) (b) (d) (a) (f))

The ordering of the returned slots is not significant.

8.7.1 Class Precedence List
---------------------------

What happens when a class inherits from two or more superclasses that
have a slot with the same name but incompatible definitions — for
example, different init values or slot allocations?  We need a rule for
deciding which slot definition the derived class ends up with, and this
rule is provided by the class’s “Class Precedence List”.(1)

   Another problem arises when invoking a generic function, and there is
more than one method that could apply to the call arguments.  Here we
need a way of ordering the applicable methods, so that Guile knows which
method to use first, which to use next if that method calls
‘next-method’, and so on.  One of the ingredients for this ordering is
determining, for each given call argument, which of the specializing
classes, from each applicable method’s definition, is the most specific
for that argument; and here again the class precedence list helps.

   If inheritance was restricted such that each class could only have
one superclass — which is known as “single” inheritance — class ordering
would be easy.  The rule would be simply that a subclass is considered
more specific than its superclass.

   With multiple inheritance, ordering is less obvious, and we have to
impose an arbitrary rule to determine precedence.  Suppose we have

     (define-class X ()
        (x #:init-value 1))

     (define-class Y ()
        (x #:init-value 2))

     (define-class Z (X Y)
        (...))

Clearly the ‘Z’ class is more specific than ‘X’ or ‘Y’, for instances of
‘Z’.  But which is more specific out of ‘X’ and ‘Y’ — and hence, for the
definitions above, which ‘#:init-value’ will take effect when creating
an instance of ‘Z’?  The rule in GOOPS is that the superclasses listed
earlier are more specific than those listed later.  Hence ‘X’ is more
specific than ‘Y’, and the ‘#:init-value’ for slot ‘x’ in instances of
‘Z’ will be 1.

   Hence there is a linear ordering for a class and all its
superclasses, from most specific to least specific, and this ordering is
called the Class Precedence List of the class.

   In fact the rules above are not quite enough to always determine a
unique order, but they give an idea of how things work.  For example,
for the ‘F’ class shown in *note* Figure 8.2: fig:hier, the class
precedence list is

     (f d e a c b <object> <top>)

In cases where there is any ambiguity (like this one), it is a bad idea
for programmers to rely on exactly what the order is.  If the order for
some superclasses is important, it can be expressed directly in the
class definition.

   The precedence list of a class can be obtained by calling
‘class-precedence-list’.  This function returns a ordered list whose
first element is the most specific class.  For instance:

     (class-precedence-list B) ⇒ (#<<class> B 401b97c8>
                                          #<<class> <object> 401e4a10>
                                          #<<class> <top> 4026a9d8>)

Or for a more immediately readable result:

     (map class-name (class-precedence-list B)) ⇒ (B <object> <top>)

8.7.2 Sorting Methods
---------------------

Now, with the idea of the class precedence list, we can state precisely
how the possible methods are sorted when more than one of the methods of
a generic function are applicable to the call arguments.

   The rules are that
   • the applicable methods are sorted in order of specificity, and the
     most specific method is used first, then the next if that method
     calls ‘next-method’, and so on

   • a method M1 is more specific than another method M2 if the first
     specializing class that differs, between the definitions of M1 and
     M2, is more specific, in M1’s definition, for the corresponding
     actual call argument, than the specializing class in M2’s
     definition

   • a class C1 is more specific than another class C2, for an object of
     actual class C, if C1 comes before C2 in C’s class precedence list.

8.8 Introspection
=================

“Introspection”, or “reflection”, means being able to obtain information
dynamically about GOOPS objects.  It is perhaps best illustrated by
considering an object oriented language that does not provide any
introspection, namely C++.

   Nothing in C++ allows a running program to obtain answers to the
following types of question:

   • What are the data members of this object or class?

   • What classes does this class inherit from?

   • Is this method call virtual or non-virtual?

   • If I invoke ‘Employee::adjustHoliday()’, what class contains the
     ‘adjustHoliday()’ method that will be applied?

   In C++, answers to such questions can only be determined by looking
at the source code, if you have access to it.  GOOPS, on the other hand,
includes procedures that allow answers to these questions — or their
GOOPS equivalents — to be obtained dynamically, at run time.

8.8.1 Classes
-------------

A GOOPS class is itself an instance of the ‘<class>’ class, or of a
subclass of ‘<class>’.  The definition of the ‘<class>’ class has slots
that are used to describe the properties of a class, including the
following.

 -- primitive procedure: class-name class
     Return the name of class CLASS.  This is the value of CLASS’s
     ‘name’ slot.

 -- primitive procedure: class-direct-supers class
     Return a list containing the direct superclasses of CLASS.  This is
     the value of CLASS’s ‘direct-supers’ slot.

 -- primitive procedure: class-direct-slots class
     Return a list containing the slot definitions of the direct slots
     of CLASS.  This is the value of CLASS’s ‘direct-slots’ slot.

 -- primitive procedure: class-direct-subclasses class
     Return a list containing the direct subclasses of CLASS.  This is
     the value of CLASS’s ‘direct-subclasses’ slot.

 -- primitive procedure: class-direct-methods class
     Return a list of all the generic function methods that use CLASS as
     a formal parameter specializer.  This is the value of CLASS’s
     ‘direct-methods’ slot.

 -- primitive procedure: class-precedence-list class
     Return the class precedence list for class CLASS (*note* Class
     Precedence List::).  This is the value of CLASS’s ‘cpl’ slot.

 -- primitive procedure: class-slots class
     Return a list containing the slot definitions for all CLASS’s
     slots, including any slots that are inherited from superclasses.
     This is the value of CLASS’s ‘slots’ slot.

 -- procedure: class-subclasses class
     Return a list of all subclasses of CLASS.

 -- procedure: class-methods class
     Return a list of all methods that use CLASS or a subclass of CLASS
     as one of its formal parameter specializers.


File: guile.info,  Node: Instances,  Next: Slots,  Prev: Classes,  Up: Introspection

8.8.2 Instances
---------------

 -- primitive procedure: class-of value
     Return the GOOPS class of any Scheme VALUE.

 -- primitive procedure: instance? object
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJECT is any GOOPS instance, otherwise ‘#f’.

 -- procedure: is-a? object class
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJECT is an instance of CLASS or one of its
     subclasses.

   You can use the ‘is-a?’ predicate to ask whether any given value
belongs to a given class, or ‘class-of’ to discover the class of a given
value.  Note that when GOOPS is loaded (by code using the ‘(oop goops)’
module) built-in classes like ‘<string>’, ‘<list>’ and ‘<number>’ are
automatically set up, corresponding to all Guile Scheme types.

     (is-a? 2.3 <number>) ⇒ #t
     (is-a? 2.3 <real>) ⇒ #t
     (is-a? 2.3 <string>) ⇒ #f
     (is-a? '("a" "b") <string>) ⇒ #f
     (is-a? '("a" "b") <list>) ⇒ #t
     (is-a? (car '("a" "b")) <string>) ⇒ #t
     (is-a? <string> <class>) ⇒ #t
     (is-a? <class> <string>) ⇒ #f

     (class-of 2.3) ⇒ #<<class> <real> 908c708>
     (class-of #(1 2 3)) ⇒ #<<class> <vector> 908cd20>
     (class-of <string>) ⇒ #<<class> <class> 8bd3e10>
     (class-of <class>) ⇒ #<<class> <class> 8bd3e10>

8.8.3 Slots
-----------

 -- procedure: class-slot-definition class slot-name
     Return the slot definition for the slot named SLOT-NAME in class
     CLASS.  SLOT-NAME should be a symbol.

 -- procedure: slot-definition-name slot-def
     Extract and return the slot name from SLOT-DEF.

 -- procedure: slot-definition-options slot-def
     Extract and return the slot options from SLOT-DEF.

 -- procedure: slot-definition-allocation slot-def
     Extract and return the slot allocation option from SLOT-DEF.  This
     is the value of the ‘#:allocation’ keyword (*note* allocation: Slot
     Options.), or ‘#:instance’ if the ‘#:allocation’ keyword is absent.

 -- procedure: slot-definition-getter slot-def
     Extract and return the slot getter option from SLOT-DEF.  This is
     the value of the ‘#:getter’ keyword (*note* getter: Slot Options.),
     or ‘#f’ if the ‘#:getter’ keyword is absent.

 -- procedure: slot-definition-setter slot-def
     Extract and return the slot setter option from SLOT-DEF.  This is
     the value of the ‘#:setter’ keyword (*note* setter: Slot Options.),
     or ‘#f’ if the ‘#:setter’ keyword is absent.

 -- procedure: slot-definition-accessor slot-def
     Extract and return the slot accessor option from SLOT-DEF.  This is
     the value of the ‘#:accessor’ keyword (*note* accessor: Slot
     Options.), or ‘#f’ if the ‘#:accessor’ keyword is absent.

 -- procedure: slot-definition-init-value slot-def
     Extract and return the slot init-value option from SLOT-DEF.  This
     is the value of the ‘#:init-value’ keyword (*note* init-value: Slot
     Options.), or the unbound value if the ‘#:init-value’ keyword is
     absent.

 -- procedure: slot-definition-init-form slot-def
     Extract and return the slot init-form option from SLOT-DEF.  This
     is the value of the ‘#:init-form’ keyword (*note* init-form: Slot
     Options.), or the unbound value if the ‘#:init-form’ keyword is
     absent.

 -- procedure: slot-definition-init-thunk slot-def
     Extract and return the slot init-thunk option from SLOT-DEF.  This
     is the value of the ‘#:init-thunk’ keyword (*note* init-thunk: Slot
     Options.), or ‘#f’ if the ‘#:init-thunk’ keyword is absent.

 -- procedure: slot-definition-init-keyword slot-def
     Extract and return the slot init-keyword option from SLOT-DEF.
     This is the value of the ‘#:init-keyword’ keyword (*note*
     init-keyword: Slot Options.), or ‘#f’ if the ‘#:init-keyword’
     keyword is absent.

 -- procedure: slot-init-function class slot-name
     Return the initialization function for the slot named SLOT-NAME in
     class CLASS.  SLOT-NAME should be a symbol.

     The returned initialization function incorporates the effects of
     the standard ‘#:init-thunk’, ‘#:init-form’ and ‘#:init-value’ slot
     options.  These initializations can be overridden by the
     ‘#:init-keyword’ slot option or by a specialized ‘initialize’
     method, so, in general, the function returned by
     ‘slot-init-function’ may be irrelevant.  For a fuller discussion,
     see *note* init-value: Slot Options.


File: guile.info,  Node: Generic Functions,  Next: Accessing Slots,  Prev: Slots,  Up: Introspection

8.8.4 Generic Functions
-----------------------

A generic function is an instance of the ‘<generic>’ class, or of a
subclass of ‘<generic>’.  The definition of the ‘<generic>’ class has
slots that are used to describe the properties of a generic function.

 -- primitive procedure: generic-function-name gf
     Return the name of generic function GF.

 -- primitive procedure: generic-function-methods gf
     Return a list of the methods of generic function GF.  This is the
     value of GF’s ‘methods’ slot.

   Similarly, a method is an instance of the ‘<method>’ class, or of a
subclass of ‘<method>’; and the definition of the ‘<method>’ class has
slots that are used to describe the properties of a method.

 -- primitive procedure: method-generic-function method
     Return the generic function that METHOD belongs to.  This is the
     value of METHOD’s ‘generic-function’ slot.

 -- primitive procedure: method-specializers method
     Return a list of METHOD’s formal parameter specializers .  This is
     the value of METHOD’s ‘specializers’ slot.

 -- primitive procedure: method-procedure method
     Return the procedure that implements METHOD.  This is the value of
     METHOD’s ‘procedure’ slot.

 -- generic: method-source
 -- method: method-source (m <method>)
     Return an expression that prints to show the definition of method
     M.

          (define-generic cube)

          (define-method (cube (n <number>))
            (* n n n))

          (map method-source (generic-function-methods cube))
          ⇒
          ((method ((n <number>)) (* n n n)))

8.8.5 Accessing Slots
---------------------

Any slot, regardless of its allocation, can be queried, referenced and
set using the following four primitive procedures.

 -- primitive procedure: slot-exists? obj slot-name
     Return ‘#t’ if OBJ has a slot with name SLOT-NAME, otherwise ‘#f’.

 -- primitive procedure: slot-bound? obj slot-name
     Return ‘#t’ if the slot named SLOT-NAME in OBJ has a value,
     otherwise ‘#f’.

     ‘slot-bound?’ calls the generic function ‘slot-missing’ if OBJ does
     not have a slot called SLOT-NAME (*note* slot-missing: Accessing
     Slots.).

 -- primitive procedure: slot-ref obj slot-name
     Return the value of the slot named SLOT-NAME in OBJ.

     ‘slot-ref’ calls the generic function ‘slot-missing’ if OBJ does
     not have a slot called SLOT-NAME (*note* slot-missing: Accessing
     Slots.).

     ‘slot-ref’ calls the generic function ‘slot-unbound’ if the named
     slot in OBJ does not have a value (*note* slot-unbound: Accessing
     Slots.).

 -- primitive procedure: slot-set! obj slot-name value
     Set the value of the slot named SLOT-NAME in OBJ to VALUE.

     ‘slot-set!’ calls the generic function ‘slot-missing’ if OBJ does
     not have a slot called SLOT-NAME (*note* slot-missing: Accessing
     Slots.).

   GOOPS stores information about slots in classes.  Internally, all of
these procedures work by looking up the slot definition for the slot
named SLOT-NAME in the class ‘(class-of OBJ)’, and then using the slot
definition’s “getter” and “setter” closures to get and set the slot
value.

   The next four procedures differ from the previous ones in that they
take the class as an explicit argument, rather than assuming ‘(class-of
OBJ)’.  Therefore they allow you to apply the “getter” and “setter”
closures of a slot definition in one class to an instance of a different
class.

 -- primitive procedure: slot-exists-using-class? class obj slot-name
     Return ‘#t’ if CLASS has a slot definition for a slot with name
     SLOT-NAME, otherwise ‘#f’.

 -- primitive procedure: slot-bound-using-class? class obj slot-name
     Return ‘#t’ if applying ‘slot-ref-using-class’ to the same
     arguments would call the generic function ‘slot-unbound’, otherwise
     ‘#f’.

     ‘slot-bound-using-class?’ calls the generic function ‘slot-missing’
     if CLASS does not have a slot definition for a slot called
     SLOT-NAME (*note* slot-missing: Accessing Slots.).

 -- primitive procedure: slot-ref-using-class class obj slot-name
     Apply the “getter” closure for the slot named SLOT-NAME in CLASS to
     OBJ, and return its result.

     ‘slot-ref-using-class’ calls the generic function ‘slot-missing’ if
     CLASS does not have a slot definition for a slot called SLOT-NAME
     (*note* slot-missing: Accessing Slots.).

     ‘slot-ref-using-class’ calls the generic function ‘slot-unbound’ if
     the application of the “getter” closure to OBJ returns an unbound
     value (*note* slot-unbound: Accessing Slots.).

 -- primitive procedure: slot-set-using-class! class obj slot-name value
     Apply the “setter” closure for the slot named SLOT-NAME in CLASS to
     OBJ and VALUE.

     ‘slot-set-using-class!’ calls the generic function ‘slot-missing’
     if CLASS does not have a slot definition for a slot called
     SLOT-NAME (*note* slot-missing: Accessing Slots.).

   Slots whose allocation is per-class rather than per-instance can be
referenced and set without needing to specify any particular instance.

 -- procedure: class-slot-ref class slot-name
     Return the value of the slot named SLOT-NAME in class CLASS.  The
     named slot must have ‘#:class’ or ‘#:each-subclass’ allocation
     (*note* allocation: Slot Options.).

     If there is no such slot with ‘#:class’ or ‘#:each-subclass’
     allocation, ‘class-slot-ref’ calls the ‘slot-missing’ generic
     function with arguments CLASS and SLOT-NAME.  Otherwise, if the
     slot value is unbound, ‘class-slot-ref’ calls the ‘slot-unbound’
     generic function, with the same arguments.

 -- procedure: class-slot-set! class slot-name value
     Set the value of the slot named SLOT-NAME in class CLASS to VALUE.
     The named slot must have ‘#:class’ or ‘#:each-subclass’ allocation
     (*note* allocation: Slot Options.).

     If there is no such slot with ‘#:class’ or ‘#:each-subclass’
     allocation, ‘class-slot-ref’ calls the ‘slot-missing’ generic
     function with arguments CLASS and SLOT-NAME.

   When a ‘slot-ref’ or ‘slot-set!’ call specifies a non-existent slot
name, or tries to reference a slot whose value is unbound, GOOPS calls
one of the following generic functions.

 -- generic: slot-missing
 -- method: slot-missing (class <class>) slot-name
 -- method: slot-missing (class <class>) (object <object>) slot-name
 -- method: slot-missing (class <class>) (object <object>) slot-name
          value
     When an application attempts to reference or set a class or
     instance slot by name, and the slot name is invalid for the
     specified CLASS or OBJECT, GOOPS calls the ‘slot-missing’ generic
     function.

     The default methods all call ‘goops-error’ with an appropriate
     message.

 -- generic: slot-unbound
 -- method: slot-unbound (object <object>)
 -- method: slot-unbound (class <class>) slot-name
 -- method: slot-unbound (class <class>) (object <object>) slot-name
     When an application attempts to reference a class or instance slot,
     and the slot’s value is unbound, GOOPS calls the ‘slot-unbound’
     generic function.

     The default methods all call ‘goops-error’ with an appropriate
     message.

8.9 Error Handling
==================

The procedure ‘goops-error’ is called to raise an appropriate error by
the default methods of the following generic functions:

   • ‘slot-missing’ (*note* slot-missing: Accessing Slots.)

   • ‘slot-unbound’ (*note* slot-unbound: Accessing Slots.)

   • ‘no-method’ (*note* no-method: Handling Invocation Errors.)

   • ‘no-applicable-method’ (*note* no-applicable-method: Handling
     Invocation Errors.)

   • ‘no-next-method’ (*note* no-next-method: Handling Invocation
     Errors.)

   If you customize these functions for particular classes or
metaclasses, you may still want to use ‘goops-error’ to signal any error
conditions that you detect.

 -- procedure: goops-error format-string arg ...
     Raise an error with key ‘goops-error’ and error message constructed
     from FORMAT-STRING and ARG ....  Error message formatting is as
     done by ‘scm-error’.

8.10 GOOPS Object Miscellany
============================

Here we cover some points about GOOPS objects that aren’t substantial
enough to merit sections on their own.

Object Equality
---------------

When GOOPS is loaded, ‘eqv?’, ‘equal?’ and ‘=’ become generic functions,
and you can define methods for them, specialized for your own classes,
so as to control what the various kinds of equality mean for your
classes.

   For example, the ‘assoc’ procedure, for looking up an entry in an
alist, is specified as using ‘equal?’ to determine when the car of an
entry in the alist is the same as the key parameter that ‘assoc’ is
called with.  Hence, if you had defined a new class, and wanted to use
instances of that class as the keys in an alist, you could define a
method for ‘equal?’, for your class, to control ‘assoc’’s lookup
precisely.

Cloning Objects
---------------

 -- generic: shallow-clone
 -- method: shallow-clone (self <object>)
     Return a “shallow” clone of SELF.  The default method makes a
     shallow clone by allocating a new instance and copying slot values
     from self to the new instance.  Each slot value is copied either as
     an immediate value or by reference.

 -- generic: deep-clone
 -- method: deep-clone (self <object>)
     Return a “deep” clone of SELF.  The default method makes a deep
     clone by allocating a new instance and copying or cloning slot
     values from self to the new instance.  If a slot value is an
     instance (satisfies ‘instance?’), it is cloned by calling
     ‘deep-clone’ on that value.  Other slot values are copied either as
     immediate values or by reference.

Write and Display
-----------------

 -- primitive generic: write object port
 -- primitive generic: display object port
     When GOOPS is loaded, ‘write’ and ‘display’ become generic
     functions with special methods for printing

        • objects - instances of the class ‘<object>’

        • foreign objects - instances of the class ‘<foreign-object>’

        • classes - instances of the class ‘<class>’

        • generic functions - instances of the class ‘<generic>’

        • methods - instances of the class ‘<method>’.

     ‘write’ and ‘display’ print non-GOOPS values in the same way as the
     Guile primitive ‘write’ and ‘display’ functions.

   In addition to the cases mentioned, you can of course define ‘write’
and ‘display’ methods for your own classes, to customize how instances
of those classes are printed.

8.11 The Metaobject Protocol
============================

At this point, we’ve said about as much as can be said about GOOPS
without having to confront the idea of the metaobject protocol.  There
are a couple more topics that could be discussed in isolation first —
class redefinition, and changing the class of existing instances — but
in practice developers using them will be advanced enough to want to
understand the metaobject protocol too, and will probably be using the
protocol to customize exactly what happens during these events.

   So let’s plunge in.  GOOPS is based on a “metaobject protocol” (aka
“MOP”) derived from the ones used in CLOS (the Common Lisp Object
System), tiny-clos (a small Scheme implementation of a subset of CLOS
functionality) and STKlos.

   The MOP underlies many possible GOOPS customizations — such as
defining an ‘initialize’ method to customize the initialization of
instances of an application-defined class — and an understanding of the
MOP makes it much easier to explain such customizations in a precise
way.  And at a deeper level, understanding the MOP is a key part of
understanding GOOPS, and of taking full advantage of GOOPS’ power, by
customizing the behaviour of GOOPS itself.

8.11.1 Metaobjects and the Metaobject Protocol
----------------------------------------------

The building blocks of GOOPS are classes, slot definitions, instances,
generic functions and methods.  A class is a grouping of inheritance
relations and slot definitions.  An instance is an object with slots
that are allocated following the rules implied by its class’s
superclasses and slot definitions.  A generic function is a collection
of methods and rules for determining which of those methods to apply
when the generic function is invoked.  A method is a procedure and a set
of specializers that specify the type of arguments to which the
procedure is applicable.

   Of these entities, GOOPS represents classes, generic functions and
methods as “metaobjects”.  In other words, the values in a GOOPS program
that describe classes, generic functions and methods, are themselves
instances (or “objects”) of special GOOPS classes that encapsulate the
behaviour, respectively, of classes, generic functions, and methods.

   (The other two entities are slot definitions and instances.  Slot
definitions are not strictly instances, but every slot definition is
associated with a GOOPS class that specifies the behaviour of the slot
as regards accessibility and protection from garbage collection.
Instances are of course objects in the usual sense, and there is no
benefit from thinking of them as metaobjects.)

   The “metaobject protocol” (or “MOP”) is the specification of the
generic functions which determine the behaviour of these metaobjects and
the circumstances in which these generic functions are invoked.

   For a concrete example of what this means, consider how GOOPS
calculates the set of slots for a class that is being defined using
‘define-class’.  The desired set of slots is the union of the new
class’s direct slots and the slots of all its superclasses.  But
‘define-class’ itself does not perform this calculation.  Instead, there
is a method of the ‘initialize’ generic function that is specialized for
instances of type ‘<class>’, and it is this method that performs the
slot calculation.

   ‘initialize’ is a generic function which GOOPS calls whenever a new
instance is created, immediately after allocating memory for a new
instance, in order to initialize the new instance’s slots.  The sequence
of steps is as follows.

   • ‘define-class’ uses ‘make’ to make a new instance of the ‘<class>’
     class, passing as initialization arguments the superclasses, slot
     definitions and class options that were specified in the
     ‘define-class’ form.

   • ‘make’ allocates memory for the new instance, and invokes the
     ‘initialize’ generic function to initialize the new instance’s
     slots.

   • The ‘initialize’ generic function applies the method that is
     specialized for instances of type ‘<class>’, and this method
     performs the slot calculation.

   In other words, rather than being hardcoded in ‘define-class’, the
default behaviour of class definition is encapsulated by generic
function methods that are specialized for the class ‘<class>’.

   It is possible to create a new class that inherits from ‘<class>’,
which is called a “metaclass”, and to write a new ‘initialize’ method
that is specialized for instances of the new metaclass.  Then, if the
‘define-class’ form includes a ‘#:metaclass’ class option whose value is
the new metaclass, the class that is defined by the ‘define-class’ form
will be an instance of the new metaclass rather than of the default
‘<class>’, and will be defined in accordance with the new ‘initialize’
method.  Thus the default slot calculation, as well as any other aspect
of the new class’s relationship with its superclasses, can be modified
or overridden.

   In a similar way, the behaviour of generic functions can be modified
or overridden by creating a new class that inherits from the standard
generic function class ‘<generic>’, writing appropriate methods that are
specialized to the new class, and creating new generic functions that
are instances of the new class.

   The same is true for method metaobjects.  And the same basic
mechanism allows the application class author to write an ‘initialize’
method that is specialized to their application class, to initialize
instances of that class.

   Such is the power of the MOP. Note that ‘initialize’ is just one of a
large number of generic functions that can be customized to modify the
behaviour of application objects and classes and of GOOPS itself.  Each
following section covers a particular area of GOOPS functionality, and
describes the generic functions that are relevant for customization of
that area.

8.11.2 Metaclasses
------------------

A “metaclass” is the class of an object which represents a GOOPS class.
Put more succinctly, a metaclass is a class’s class.

   Most GOOPS classes have the metaclass ‘<class>’ and, by default, any
new class that is created using ‘define-class’ has the metaclass
‘<class>’.

   But what does this really mean?  To find out, let’s look in more
detail at what happens when a new class is created using ‘define-class’:

     (define-class <my-class> (<object>) . slots)

Guile expands this to something like:

     (define <my-class> (class (<object>) . slots))

which in turn expands to:

     (define <my-class>
       (make <class> #:dsupers (list <object>) #:slots slots))

   As this expansion makes clear, the resulting value of ‘<my-class>’ is
an instance of the class ‘<class>’ with slot values specifying the
superclasses and slot definitions for the class ‘<my-class>’.
(‘#:dsupers’ and ‘#:slots’ are initialization keywords for the ‘dsupers’
and ‘dslots’ slots of the ‘<class>’ class.)

   Now suppose that you want to define a new class with a metaclass
other than the default ‘<class>’.  This is done by writing:

     (define-class <my-class2> (<object>)
        slot ...
        #:metaclass <my-metaclass>)

and Guile expands _this_ to something like:

     (define <my-class2>
       (make <my-metaclass> #:dsupers (list <object>) #:slots slots))

   In this case, the value of ‘<my-class2>’ is an instance of the more
specialized class ‘<my-metaclass>’.  Note that ‘<my-metaclass>’ itself
must previously have been defined as a subclass of ‘<class>’.  For a
full discussion of when and how it is useful to define new metaclasses,
see *note* MOP Specification::.

   Now let’s make an instance of ‘<my-class2>’:

     (define my-object (make <my-class2> ...))

   All of the following statements are correct expressions of the
relationships between ‘my-object’, ‘<my-class2>’, ‘<my-metaclass>’ and
‘<class>’.

   • ‘my-object’ is an instance of the class ‘<my-class2>’.

   • ‘<my-class2>’ is an instance of the class ‘<my-metaclass>’.

   • ‘<my-metaclass>’ is an instance of the class ‘<class>’.

   • The class of ‘my-object’ is ‘<my-class2>’.

   • The class of ‘<my-class2>’ is ‘<my-metaclass>’.

   • The class of ‘<my-metaclass>’ is ‘<class>’.

8.11.3 MOP Specification
------------------------

The aim of the MOP specification in this chapter is to specify all the
customizable generic function invocations that can be made by the
standard GOOPS syntax, procedures and methods, and to explain the
protocol for customizing such invocations.

   A generic function invocation is customizable if the types of the
arguments to which it is applied are not completely determined by the
lexical context in which the invocation appears.  For example, the
‘(initialize INSTANCE INITARGS)’ invocation in the default
‘make-instance’ method is customizable, because the type of the
‘INSTANCE’ argument is determined by the class that was passed to
‘make-instance’.

   (Whereas — to give a counter-example — the ‘(make <generic> #:name
',name)’ invocation in ‘define-generic’ is not customizable, because all
of its arguments have lexically determined types.)

   When using this rule to decide whether a given generic function
invocation is customizable, we ignore arguments that are expected to be
handled in method definitions as a single “rest” list argument.

   For each customizable generic function invocation, the “invocation
protocol” is explained by specifying

   • what, conceptually, the applied method is intended to do

   • what assumptions, if any, the caller makes about the applied
     method’s side effects

   • what the caller expects to get as the applied method’s return
     value.

8.11.4 Instance Creation Protocol
---------------------------------

‘make <class> . INITARGS’ (method)

   • ‘allocate-instance CLASS INITARGS’ (generic)

     The applied ‘allocate-instance’ method should allocate storage for
     a new instance of class CLASS and return the uninitialized
     instance.

   • ‘initialize INSTANCE INITARGS’ (generic)

     INSTANCE is the uninitialized instance returned by
     ‘allocate-instance’.  The applied method should initialize the new
     instance in whatever sense is appropriate for its class.  The
     method’s return value is ignored.

   ‘make’ itself is a generic function.  Hence the ‘make’ invocation
itself can be customized in the case where the new instance’s metaclass
is more specialized than the default ‘<class>’, by defining a ‘make’
method that is specialized to that metaclass.

   Normally, however, the method for classes with metaclass ‘<class>’
will be applied.  This method calls two generic functions:

   • (allocate-instance CLASS .  INITARGS)

   • (initialize INSTANCE .  INITARGS)

   ‘allocate-instance’ allocates storage for and returns the new
instance, uninitialized.  You might customize ‘allocate-instance’, for
example, if you wanted to provide a GOOPS wrapper around some other
object programming system.

   To do this, you would create a specialized metaclass, which would act
as the metaclass for all classes and instances from the other system.
Then define an ‘allocate-instance’ method, specialized to that
metaclass, which calls a Guile primitive C function (or FFI code), which
in turn allocates the new instance using the interface of the other
object system.

   In this case, for a complete system, you would also need to customize
a number of other generic functions like ‘make’ and ‘initialize’, so
that GOOPS knows how to make classes from the other system, access
instance slots, and so on.

   ‘initialize’ initializes the instance that is returned by
‘allocate-instance’.  The standard GOOPS methods perform initializations
appropriate to the instance class.

   • At the least specialized level, the method for instances of type
     ‘<object>’ performs internal GOOPS instance initialization, and
     initializes the instance’s slots according to the slot definitions
     and any slot initialization keywords that appear in INITARGS.

   • The method for instances of type ‘<class>’ calls ‘(next-method)’,
     then performs the class initializations described in *note* Class
     Definition Protocol::.

   • and so on for generic functions, methods, operator classes ...

   Similarly, you can customize the initialization of instances of any
application-defined class by defining an ‘initialize’ method specialized
to that class.

   Imagine a class whose instances’ slots need to be initialized at
instance creation time by querying a database.  Although it might be
possible to achieve this a combination of ‘#:init-thunk’ keywords and
closures in the slot definitions, it may be neater to write an
‘initialize’ method for the class that queries the database once and
initializes all the dependent slot values according to the results.

8.11.5 Class Definition Protocol
--------------------------------

Here is a summary diagram of the syntax, procedures and generic
functions that may be involved in class definition.

‘define-class’ (syntax)

   • ‘class’ (syntax)

        • ‘make-class’ (procedure)

             • ‘ensure-metaclass’ (procedure)

             • ‘make METACLASS ...’ (generic)

                  • ‘allocate-instance’ (generic)

                  • ‘initialize’ (generic)

                       • ‘compute-cpl’ (generic)

                            • ‘compute-std-cpl’ (procedure)

                       • ‘compute-slots’ (generic)

                       • ‘compute-get-n-set’ (generic)

                       • ‘compute-getter-method’ (generic)

                       • ‘compute-setter-method’ (generic)

   • ‘class-redefinition’ (generic)

        • ‘remove-class-accessors’ (generic)

        • ‘update-direct-method!’ (generic)

        • ‘update-direct-subclass!’ (generic)

   Wherever a step above is marked as “generic”, it can be customized,
and the detail shown below it is only “correct” insofar as it describes
what the default method of that generic function does.  For example, if
you write an ‘initialize’ method, for some metaclass, that does not call
‘next-method’ and does not call ‘compute-cpl’, then ‘compute-cpl’ will
not be called when a class is defined with that metaclass.

   A ‘(define-class ...)’ form (*note* Class Definition::) expands to an
expression which

   • checks that it is being evaluated only at top level

   • defines any accessors that are implied by the SLOT-DEFINITIONs

   • uses ‘class’ to create the new class

   • checks for a previous class definition for NAME and, if found,
     handles the redefinition by invoking ‘class-redefinition’ (*note*
     Redefining a Class::).

 -- syntax: class name (super ...) slot-definition ... class-option ...
     Return a newly created class that inherits from SUPERs, with direct
     slots defined by SLOT-DEFINITIONs and CLASS-OPTIONs.  For the
     format of SLOT-DEFINITIONs and CLASS-OPTIONs, see *note*
     define-class: Class Definition.

‘class’ expands to an expression which

   • processes the class and slot definition options to check that they
     are well-formed, to convert the ‘#:init-form’ option to an
     ‘#:init-thunk’ option, to supply a default environment parameter
     (the current top-level environment) and to evaluate all the bits
     that need to be evaluated

   • calls ‘make-class’ to create the class with the processed and
     evaluated parameters.

 -- procedure: make-class supers slots class-option ...
     Return a newly created class that inherits from SUPERS, with direct
     slots defined by SLOTS and CLASS-OPTIONs.  For the format of SLOTS
     and CLASS-OPTIONs, see *note* define-class: Class Definition, except
     note that for ‘make-class’, SLOTS is a separate list of slot
     definitions.

‘make-class’

   • adds ‘<object>’ to the SUPERS list if SUPERS is empty or if none of
     the classes in SUPERS have ‘<object>’ in their class precedence
     list

   • defaults the ‘#:environment’, ‘#:name’ and ‘#:metaclass’ options,
     if they are not specified by OPTIONS, to the current top-level
     environment, the unbound value, and ‘(ensure-metaclass SUPERS)’
     respectively

   • checks for duplicate classes in SUPERS and duplicate slot names in
     SLOTS, and signals an error if there are any duplicates

   • calls ‘make’, passing the metaclass as the first parameter and all
     other parameters as option keywords with values.

 -- procedure: ensure-metaclass supers env
     Return a metaclass suitable for a class that inherits from the list
     of classes in SUPERS.  The returned metaclass is the union by
     inheritance of the metaclasses of the classes in SUPERS.

     In the simplest case, where all the SUPERS are straightforward
     classes with metaclass ‘<class>’, the returned metaclass is just
     ‘<class>’.

     For a more complex example, suppose that SUPERS contained one class
     with metaclass ‘<operator-class>’ and one with metaclass
     ‘<foreign-object-class>’.  Then the returned metaclass would be a
     class that inherits from both ‘<operator-class>’ and
     ‘<foreign-object-class>’.

     If SUPERS is the empty list, ‘ensure-metaclass’ returns the default
     GOOPS metaclass ‘<class>’.

     GOOPS keeps a list of the metaclasses created by
     ‘ensure-metaclass’, so that each required type of metaclass only
     has to be created once.

     The ‘env’ parameter is ignored.

 -- generic: make metaclass initarg ...
     METACLASS is the metaclass of the class being defined, either taken
     from the ‘#:metaclass’ class option or computed by
     ‘ensure-metaclass’.  The applied method must create and return the
     fully initialized class metaobject for the new class definition.

   The ‘(make METACLASS INITARG ...)’ invocation is a particular case of
the instance creation protocol covered in the previous section.  It will
create an class metaobject with metaclass METACLASS.  By default, this
metaobject will be initialized by the ‘initialize’ method that is
specialized for instances of type ‘<class>’.

   The ‘initialize’ method for classes (signature ‘(initialize <class>
initargs)’) calls the following generic functions.

   • ‘compute-cpl CLASS’ (generic)

     The applied method should compute and return the class precedence
     list for CLASS as a list of class metaobjects.  When ‘compute-cpl’
     is called, the following CLASS metaobject slots have all been
     initialized: ‘name’, ‘direct-supers’, ‘direct-slots’,
     ‘direct-subclasses’ (empty), ‘direct-methods’.  The value returned
     by ‘compute-cpl’ will be stored in the ‘cpl’ slot.

   • ‘compute-slots CLASS’ (generic)

     The applied method should compute and return the slots (union of
     direct and inherited) for CLASS as a list of slot definitions.
     When ‘compute-slots’ is called, all the CLASS metaobject slots
     mentioned for ‘compute-cpl’ have been initialized, plus the
     following: ‘cpl’, ‘redefined’ (‘#f’), ‘environment’.  The value
     returned by ‘compute-slots’ will be stored in the ‘slots’ slot.

   • ‘compute-get-n-set CLASS SLOT-DEF’ (generic)

     ‘initialize’ calls ‘compute-get-n-set’ for each slot computed by
     ‘compute-slots’.  The applied method should compute and return a
     pair of closures that, respectively, get and set the value of the
     specified slot.  The get closure should have arity 1 and expect a
     single argument that is the instance whose slot value is to be
     retrieved.  The set closure should have arity 2 and expect two
     arguments, where the first argument is the instance whose slot
     value is to be set and the second argument is the new value for
     that slot.  The closures should be returned in a two element list:
     ‘(list GET SET)’.

     The closures returned by ‘compute-get-n-set’ are stored as part of
     the value of the CLASS metaobject’s ‘getters-n-setters’ slot.
     Specifically, the value of this slot is a list with the same number
     of elements as there are slots in the class, and each element looks
     either like

          (SLOT-NAME-SYMBOL INIT-FUNCTION . INDEX)

     or like

          (SLOT-NAME-SYMBOL INIT-FUNCTION GET SET)

     Where the get and set closures are replaced by INDEX, the slot is
     an instance slot and INDEX is the slot’s index in the underlying
     structure: GOOPS knows how to get and set the value of such slots
     and so does not need specially constructed get and set closures.
     Otherwise, GET and SET are the closures returned by
     ‘compute-get-n-set’.

     The structure of the ‘getters-n-setters’ slot value is important
     when understanding the next customizable generic functions that
     ‘initialize’ calls...

   • ‘compute-getter-method CLASS GNS’ (generic)

     ‘initialize’ calls ‘compute-getter-method’ for each of the class’s
     slots (as determined by ‘compute-slots’) that includes a ‘#:getter’
     or ‘#:accessor’ slot option.  GNS is the element of the CLASS
     metaobject’s ‘getters-n-setters’ slot that specifies how the slot
     in question is referenced and set, as described above under
     ‘compute-get-n-set’.  The applied method should create and return a
     method that is specialized for instances of type CLASS and uses the
     get closure to retrieve the slot’s value.  ‘initialize’ uses
     ‘add-method!’ to add the returned method to the generic function
     named by the slot definition’s ‘#:getter’ or ‘#:accessor’ option.

   • ‘compute-setter-method CLASS GNS’ (generic)

     ‘compute-setter-method’ is invoked with the same arguments as
     ‘compute-getter-method’, for each of the class’s slots that
     includes a ‘#:setter’ or ‘#:accessor’ slot option.  The applied
     method should create and return a method that is specialized for
     instances of type CLASS and uses the set closure to set the slot’s
     value.  ‘initialize’ then uses ‘add-method!’ to add the returned
     method to the generic function named by the slot definition’s
     ‘#:setter’ or ‘#:accessor’ option.

8.11.6 Customizing Class Definition
-----------------------------------

If the metaclass of the new class is something more specialized than the
default ‘<class>’, then the type of CLASS in the calls above is more
specialized than ‘<class>’, and hence it becomes possible to define
generic function methods, specialized for the new class’s metaclass,
that can modify or override the default behaviour of ‘initialize’,
‘compute-cpl’ or ‘compute-get-n-set’.

   ‘compute-cpl’ computes the class precedence list (“CPL”) for the new
class (*note* Class Precedence List::), and returns it as a list of class
objects.  The CPL is important because it defines a superclass ordering
that is used, when a generic function is invoked upon an instance of the
class, to decide which of the available generic function methods is the
most specific.  Hence ‘compute-cpl’ could be customized in order to
modify the CPL ordering algorithm for all classes with a special
metaclass.

   The default CPL algorithm is encapsulated by the ‘compute-std-cpl’
procedure, which is called by the default ‘compute-cpl’ method.

 -- procedure: compute-std-cpl class
     Compute and return the class precedence list for CLASS according to
     the algorithm described in *note* Class Precedence List::.

   ‘compute-slots’ computes and returns a list of all slot definitions
for the new class.  By default, this list includes the direct slot
definitions from the ‘define-class’ form, plus the slot definitions that
are inherited from the new class’s superclasses.  The default
‘compute-slots’ method uses the CPL computed by ‘compute-cpl’ to
calculate this union of slot definitions, with the rule that slots
inherited from superclasses are shadowed by direct slots with the same
name.  One possible reason for customizing ‘compute-slots’ would be to
implement an alternative resolution strategy for slot name conflicts.

   ‘compute-get-n-set’ computes the low-level closures that will be used
to get and set the value of a particular slot, and returns them in a
list with two elements.

   The closures returned depend on how storage for that slot is
allocated.  The standard ‘compute-get-n-set’ method, specialized for
classes of type ‘<class>’, handles the standard GOOPS values for the
‘#:allocation’ slot option (*note* allocation: Slot Options.).  By
defining a new ‘compute-get-n-set’ method for a more specialized
metaclass, it is possible to support new types of slot allocation.

   Suppose you wanted to create a large number of instances of some
class with a slot that should be shared between some but not all
instances of that class - say every 10 instances should share the same
slot storage.  The following example shows how to implement and use a
new type of slot allocation to do this.

     (define-class <batched-allocation-metaclass> (<class>))

     (let ((batch-allocation-count 0)
           (batch-get-n-set #f))
       (define-method (compute-get-n-set
                          (class <batched-allocation-metaclass>) s)
         (case (slot-definition-allocation s)
           ((#:batched)
            ;; If we've already used the same slot storage for 10 instances,
            ;; reset variables.
            (if (= batch-allocation-count 10)
                (begin
                  (set! batch-allocation-count 0)
                  (set! batch-get-n-set #f)))
            ;; If we don't have a current pair of get and set closures,
            ;; create one.  make-closure-variable returns a pair of closures
            ;; around a single Scheme variable - see goops.scm for details.
            (or batch-get-n-set
                (set! batch-get-n-set (make-closure-variable)))
            ;; Increment the batch allocation count.
            (set! batch-allocation-count (+ batch-allocation-count 1))
            batch-get-n-set)

           ;; Call next-method to handle standard allocation types.
           (else (next-method)))))

     (define-class <class-using-batched-slot> ()
       ...
       (c #:allocation #:batched)
       ...
       #:metaclass <batched-allocation-metaclass>)

   The usage of ‘compute-getter-method’ and ‘compute-setter-method’ is
described in *note* Class Definition Protocol::.

   ‘compute-cpl’ and ‘compute-get-n-set’ are called by the standard
‘initialize’ method for classes whose metaclass is ‘<class>’.  But
‘initialize’ itself can also be modified, by defining an ‘initialize’
method specialized to the new class’s metaclass.  Such a method could
complete override the standard behaviour, by not calling ‘(next-method)’
at all, but more typically it would perform additional class
initialization steps before and/or after calling ‘(next-method)’ for the
standard behaviour.

‘define-method’ (syntax)

   • ‘add-method! TARGET METHOD’ (generic)

‘define-method’ invokes the ‘add-method!’ generic function to handle
adding the new method to a variety of possible targets.  GOOPS includes
methods to handle TARGET as

   • a generic function (the most common case)

   • a procedure

   • a primitive generic (*note* Extending Primitives::)

   By defining further methods for ‘add-method!’, you can theoretically
handle adding methods to further types of target.

   • calls ‘make’ with metaclass ‘<method>’ and the specializers and
     closure using the ‘#:specializers’ and ‘#:procedure’ keywords.

 -- procedure: make-method specializers procedure
     Make a method using SPECIALIZERS and PROCEDURE.

     SPECIALIZERS should be a list of classes that specifies the
     parameter combinations to which this method will be applicable.

     PROCEDURE should be the closure that will applied to the generic
     function parameters when this method is invoked.

‘make-method’ is a simple wrapper around ‘make’ with metaclass
‘<method>’.

 -- generic: add-method! target method
     Generic function for adding method METHOD to TARGET.

 -- method: add-method! (generic <generic>) (method <method>)
     Add method METHOD to the generic function GENERIC.

 -- method: add-method! (proc <procedure>) (method <method>)
     If PROC is a procedure with generic capability (*note*
     generic-capability?: Extending Primitives.), upgrade it to a
     primitive generic and add METHOD to its generic function
     definition.

 -- method: add-method! (pg <primitive-generic>) (method <method>)
     Add method METHOD to the generic function definition of PG.

     Implementation: ‘(add-method! (primitive-generic-generic pg)
     method)’.

 -- method: add-method! (whatever <top>) (method <method>)
     Raise an error indicating that WHATEVER is not a valid generic
     function.

8.11.9 Generic Function Internals
---------------------------------

‘define-generic’ calls ‘ensure-generic’ to upgrade a pre-existing
procedure value, or ‘make’ with metaclass ‘<generic>’ to create a new
generic function.

   ‘define-accessor’ calls ‘ensure-accessor’ to upgrade a pre-existing
procedure value, or ‘make-accessor’ to create a new accessor.

 -- procedure: ensure-generic old-definition [name]
     Return a generic function with name NAME, if possible by using or
     upgrading OLD-DEFINITION.  If unspecified, NAME defaults to ‘#f’.

     If OLD-DEFINITION is already a generic function, it is returned
     unchanged.

     If OLD-DEFINITION is a Scheme procedure or procedure-with-setter,
     ‘ensure-generic’ returns a new generic function that uses
     OLD-DEFINITION for its default procedure and setter.

     Otherwise ‘ensure-generic’ returns a new generic function with no
     defaults and no methods.

 -- procedure: make-generic [name]
     Return a new generic function with name ‘(car NAME)’.  If
     unspecified, NAME defaults to ‘#f’.

   ‘ensure-generic’ calls ‘make’ with metaclasses ‘<generic>’ and
‘<generic-with-setter>’, depending on the previous value of the variable
that it is trying to upgrade.

   ‘make-generic’ is a simple wrapper for ‘make’ with metaclass
‘<generic>’.

 -- procedure: ensure-accessor proc [name]
     Return an accessor with name NAME, if possible by using or
     upgrading PROC.  If unspecified, NAME defaults to ‘#f’.

     If PROC is already an accessor, it is returned unchanged.

     If PROC is a Scheme procedure, procedure-with-setter or generic
     function, ‘ensure-accessor’ returns an accessor that reuses the
     reusable elements of PROC.

     Otherwise ‘ensure-accessor’ returns a new accessor with no defaults
     and no methods.

 -- procedure: make-accessor [name]
     Return a new accessor with name ‘(car NAME)’.  If unspecified, NAME
     defaults to ‘#f’.

   ‘ensure-accessor’ calls ‘make’ with metaclass
‘<generic-with-setter>’, as well as calls to ‘ensure-generic’,
‘make-accessor’ and (tail recursively) ‘ensure-accessor’.

   ‘make-accessor’ calls ‘make’ twice, first with metaclass ‘<generic>’
to create a generic function for the setter, then with metaclass
‘<generic-with-setter>’ to create the accessor, passing the setter
generic function as the value of the ‘#:setter’ keyword.

8.11.10 Generic Function Invocation
-----------------------------------

There is a detailed and customizable protocol involved in the process of
invoking a generic function — i.e., in the process of deciding which of
the generic function’s methods are applicable to the current arguments,
and which one of those to apply.  Here is a summary diagram of the
generic functions involved.

‘apply-generic’ (generic)

   • ‘no-method’ (generic)

   • ‘compute-applicable-methods’ (generic)

   • ‘sort-applicable-methods’ (generic)

        • ‘method-more-specific?’ (generic)

   • ‘apply-methods’ (generic)

        • ‘apply-method’ (generic)

        • ‘no-next-method’ (generic)

   • ‘no-applicable-method’

   We do not yet have full documentation for these.  Please refer to the
code (‘oop/goops.scm’) for details.

8.12 Redefining a Class
=======================

Suppose that a class ‘<my-class>’ is defined using ‘define-class’ (*note*
define-class: Class Definition.), with slots that have accessor
functions, and that an application has created several instances of
‘<my-class>’ using ‘make’ (*note* make: Instance Creation.).  What then
happens if ‘<my-class>’ is redefined by calling ‘define-class’ again?

* Redefinable Classes::
* Default Class Redefinition Behaviour::
* Customizing Class Redefinition::


File: guile.info,  Node: Redefinable Classes,  Next: Default Class Redefinition Behaviour,  Up: Redefining a Class

8.12.1 Redefinable Classes
--------------------------

The ability for a class to be redefined is a choice for a class author
to make.  By default, classes in GOOPS are _not_ redefinable.  A
redefinable class is an instance of ‘<redefinable-class>’; that is to
say, a class with ‘<redefinable-class>’ as its metaclass.  Accordingly,
to define a redefinable class, add ‘#:metaclass <redefinable-class>’ to
its class definition:

     (define-class <foo> ()
       #:metaclass <redefinable-class>)

   Note that any subclass of ‘<foo>’ is also redefinable, without the
need to explicitly pass the ‘#:metaclass’ argument, so you only need to
specify ‘#:metaclass’ for the roots of your application’s class
hierarchy.

     (define-class <bar> (<foo>))
     (class-of <bar>) ⇒ <redefinable-class>

   Note that prior to Guile 3.0, all GOOPS classes were redefinable in
theory.  In practice, attempting to, for example, redefine ‘<class>’
itself would almost certainly not do what you want.  Still, redefinition
is an interesting capability when building long-lived resilient systems,
so GOOPS does offer this facility.


File: guile.info,  Node: Default Class Redefinition Behaviour,  Next: Customizing Class Redefinition,  Prev: Redefinable Classes,  Up: Redefining a Class

8.12.2 Default Class Redefinition Behaviour
-------------------------------------------

When a class is defined using ‘define-class’ and the class name was
previously defined, by default the new binding just replaces the old
binding.  This is the normal behavior for ‘define’.  However if both the
old and new bindings are redefinable classes (instances of
‘<redefinable-class>’), then the class will be updated in place, and its
instances lazily migrated over.

   The way that the class is updated and the way that the instances
migrate over are of course part of the meta-object protocol.  However
the default behavior usually suffices, and it goes as follows.

   • All existing direct instances of ‘<my-class>’ are converted to be
     instances of the new class.  This is achieved by preserving the
     values of slots that exist in both the old and new definitions, and
     initializing the values of new slots in the usual way (*note* make:
     Instance Creation.).

   • All existing subclasses of ‘<my-class>’ are redefined, as though
     the ‘define-class’ expressions that defined them were re-evaluated
     following the redefinition of ‘<my-class>’, and the class
     redefinition process described here is applied recursively to the
     redefined subclasses.

   • Once all of its instances and subclasses have been updated, the
     class metaobject previously bound to the variable ‘<my-class>’ is
     no longer needed and so can be allowed to be garbage collected.

   To keep things tidy, GOOPS also needs to do a little housekeeping on
methods that are associated with the redefined class.

   • Slot accessor methods for slots in the old definition should be
     removed from their generic functions.  They will be replaced by
     accessor methods for the slots of the new class definition.

   • Any generic function method that uses the old ‘<my-class>’
     metaobject as one of its formal parameter specializers must be
     updated to refer to the new ‘<my-class>’ metaobject.  (Whenever a
     new generic function method is defined, ‘define-method’ adds the
     method to a list stored in the class metaobject for each class used
     as a formal parameter specializer, so it is easy to identify all
     the methods that must be updated when a class is redefined.)

   If this class redefinition strategy strikes you as rather
counter-intuitive, bear in mind that it is derived from similar
behaviour in other object systems such as CLOS, and that experience in
those systems has shown it to be very useful in practice.

   Also bear in mind that, like most of GOOPS’ default behaviour, it can
be customized...


File: guile.info,  Node: Customizing Class Redefinition,  Prev: Default Class Redefinition Behaviour,  Up: Redefining a Class

8.12.3 Customizing Class Redefinition
-------------------------------------

When ‘define-class’ notices that a class is being redefined, it
constructs the new class metaobject as usual, then invokes the
‘class-redefinition’ generic function with the old and new classes as
arguments.  Therefore, if the old or new classes have metaclasses other
than the default ‘<redefinable-class>’, class redefinition behaviour can
be customized by defining a ‘class-redefinition’ method that is
specialized for the relevant metaclasses.

 -- generic: class-redefinition
     Handle the class redefinition from OLD to NEW, and return the new
     class metaobject that should be bound to the variable specified by
     ‘define-class’’s first argument.

 -- method: class-redefinition (old <top>) (new <class>)
     Not all classes are redefinable, and not all previous bindings are
     classes.  *Note* Redefinable Classes::.  This default method just
     returns NEW.

 -- method: class-redefinition (old <redefinable-class>) (new
          <redefinable-class>)
     This method implements GOOPS’ default class redefinition behaviour,
     as described in *note* Default Class Redefinition Behaviour::.
     Returns the metaobject for the new class definition.

   The ‘class-redefinition’ method for classes with metaclass
‘<redefinable-class>’ calls the following generic functions, which could
of course be individually customized.

 -- generic: remove-class-accessors! old
     The default ‘remove-class-accessors!’ method removes the accessor
     methods of the old class from all classes which they specialize.

 -- generic: update-direct-method! method old new
     The default ‘update-direct-method!’ method substitutes the new
     class for the old in all methods specialized to the old class.

 -- generic: update-direct-subclass! subclass old new
     The default ‘update-direct-subclass!’ method invokes
     ‘class-redefinition’ recursively to handle the redefinition of
     subclasses.

   An alternative class redefinition strategy could be to leave all
existing instances as instances of the old class, but accepting that the
old class is now “nameless”, since its name has been taken over by the
new definition.  In this strategy, any existing subclasses could also be
left as they are, on the understanding that they inherit from a nameless
superclass.

   This strategy is easily implemented in GOOPS, by defining a new
metaclass, that will be used as the metaclass for all classes to which
the strategy should apply, and then defining a ‘class-redefinition’
method that is specialized for this metaclass:

     (define-class <can-be-nameless> (<redefinable-class>))

     (define-method (class-redefinition (old <can-be-nameless>)
                                        (new <class>))
       new)

   When customization can be as easy as this, aren’t you glad that GOOPS
implements the far more difficult strategy as its default!


File: guile.info,  Node: Changing the Class of an Instance,  Prev: Redefining a Class,  Up: GOOPS

8.13 Changing the Class of an Instance
======================================

When a redefinable class is redefined, any existing instance of the
redefined class will be modified for the new class definition before the
next time that any of the instance’s slots is referenced or set.  GOOPS
modifies each instance by calling the generic function ‘change-class’.

   More generally, you can change the class of an existing instance at
any time by invoking the generic function ‘change-class’ with two
arguments: the instance and the new class.

   The default method for ‘change-class’ decides how to implement the
change of class by looking at the slot definitions for the instance’s
existing class and for the new class.  If the new class has slots with
the same name as slots in the existing class, the values for those slots
are preserved.  Slots that are present only in the existing class are
discarded.  Slots that are present only in the new class are initialized
using the corresponding slot definition’s init function (*note*
slot-init-function: Classes.).

 -- generic: change-class instance new-class

 -- method: change-class (obj <object>) (new <redefinable-class>)
     Modify instance OBJ to make it an instance of class NEW.  OBJ
     itself must already be an instance of a redefinable class.

     The value of each of OBJ’s slots is preserved only if a similarly
     named slot exists in NEW; any other slot values are discarded.

     The slots in NEW that do not correspond to any of OBJ’s
     pre-existing slots are initialized according to NEW’s slot
     definitions’ init functions.

   The default ‘change-class’ method also invokes another generic
function, ‘update-instance-for-different-class’, as the last thing that
it does before returning.  The applied
‘update-instance-for-different-class’ method can make any further
adjustments to NEW-INSTANCE that are required to complete or modify the
change of class.  The return value from the applied method is ignored.

 -- generic: update-instance-for-different-class old-instance
          new-instance
     A generic function that can be customized to put finishing touches
     to an instance whose class has just been changed.  The default
     ‘update-instance-for-different-class’ method does nothing.

   Customized change of class behaviour can be implemented by defining
‘change-class’ methods that are specialized either by the class of the
instances to be modified or by the metaclass of the new class.

# 📜 9 Guile Implementation
**********************

At some point, after one has been programming in Scheme for some time,
another level of Scheme comes into view: its implementation.  Knowledge
of how Scheme can be implemented turns out to be necessary to become an
expert hacker.  As Peter Norvig notes in his retrospective on PAIP(1),
“The expert Lisp programmer eventually develops a good ‘efficiency
model’.”

   By this Norvig means that over time, the Lisp hacker eventually
develops an understanding of how much her code “costs” in terms of space
and time.

   This chapter describes Guile as an implementation of Scheme: its
history, how it represents and evaluates its data, and its compiler.
This knowledge can help you to make that step from being one who is
merely familiar with Scheme to being a real hacker.

9.1 A Brief History of Guile
============================

Guile is an artifact of historical processes, both as code and as a
community of hackers.  It is sometimes useful to know this history when
hacking the source code, to know about past decisions and future
directions.

   Of course, the real history of Guile is written by the hackers
hacking and not the writers writing, so we round up the section with a
note on current status and future directions.

File: guile.info,  Node: The Emacs Thesis,  Next: Early Days,  Up: History

9.1.1 The Emacs Thesis
----------------------

The story of Guile is the story of bringing the development experience
of Emacs to the mass of programs on a GNU system.

   Emacs, when it was first created in its GNU form in 1984, was a new
take on the problem of “how to make a program”.  The Emacs thesis is
that it is delightful to create composite programs based on an
orthogonal kernel written in a low-level language together with a
powerful, high-level extension language.

   Extension languages foster extensible programs, programs which adapt
readily to different users and to changing times.  Proof of this can be
seen in Emacs’ current and continued existence, spanning more than a
quarter-century.

   Besides providing for modification of a program by others, extension
languages are good for _intension_ as well.  Programs built in “the
Emacs way” are pleasurable and easy for their authors to flesh out with
the features that they need.

   After the Emacs experience was appreciated more widely, a number of
hackers started to consider how to spread this experience to the rest of
the GNU system.  It was clear that the easiest way to Emacsify a program
would be to embed a shared language implementation into it.


File: guile.info,  Node: Early Days,  Next: A Scheme of Many Maintainers,  Prev: The Emacs Thesis,  Up: History

9.1.2 Early Days
----------------

Tom Lord was the first to fully concentrate his efforts on an embeddable
language runtime, which he named “GEL”, the GNU Extension Language.

   GEL was the product of converting SCM, Aubrey Jaffer’s implementation
of Scheme, into something more appropriate to embedding as a library.
(SCM was itself based on an implementation by George Carrette, SIOD.)

   Lord managed to convince Richard Stallman to dub GEL the official
extension language for the GNU project.  It was a natural fit, given
that Scheme was a cleaner, more modern Lisp than Emacs Lisp.  Part of
the argument was that eventually when GEL became more capable, it could
gain the ability to execute other languages, especially Emacs Lisp.

   Due to a naming conflict with another programming language, Lee
Thomas suggested a new name for GEL: “Guile”.  Besides being a recursive
acronym, “Guile” craftily follows the naming of its ancestors,
“Planner”, “Conniver”, and “Schemer”.  (The latter was truncated to
“Scheme” due to a 6-character file name limit on an old operating
system.)  Finally, “Guile” suggests “guy-ell”, or “Guy L. Steele”, who,
together with Gerald Sussman, originally discovered Scheme.

   Around the same time that Guile (then GEL) was readying itself for
public release, another extension language was gaining in popularity,
Tcl.  Many developers found advantages in Tcl because of its shell-like
syntax and its well-developed graphical widgets library, Tk.  Also, at
the time there was a large marketing push promoting Tcl as a “universal
extension language”.

   Richard Stallman, as the primary author of GNU Emacs, had a
particular vision of what extension languages should be, and Tcl did not
seem to him to be as capable as Emacs Lisp.  He posted a criticism to
the comp.lang.tcl newsgroup, sparking one of the internet’s legendary
flamewars.  As part of these discussions, retrospectively dubbed the
“Tcl Wars”, he announced the Free Software Foundation’s intent to
promote Guile as the extension language for the GNU project.

   It is a common misconception that Guile was created as a reaction to
Tcl.  While it is true that the public announcement of Guile happened at
the same time as the “Tcl wars”, Guile was created out of a condition
that existed outside the polemic.  Indeed, the need for a powerful
language to bridge the gap between extension of existing applications
and a more fully dynamic programming environment is still with us today.

9.1.3 A Scheme of Many Maintainers
----------------------------------

Surveying the field, it seems that Scheme implementations correspond
with their maintainers on an N-to-1 relationship.  That is to say, that
those people that implement Schemes might do so on a number of
occasions, but that the lifetime of a given Scheme is tied to the
maintainership of one individual.

   Guile is atypical in this regard.

   Tom Lord maintained Guile for its first year and a half or so,
corresponding to the end of 1994 through the middle of 1996.  The
releases made in this time constitute an arc from SCM as a standalone
program to Guile as a reusable, embeddable library, but passing through
a explosion of features: embedded Tcl and Tk, a toolchain for compiling
and disassembling Java, addition of a C-like syntax, creation of a
module system, and a start at a rich POSIX interface.

   Only some of those features remain in Guile.  There were ongoing
tensions between providing a small, embeddable language, and one which
had all of the features (e.g. a graphical toolkit) that a modern Emacs
might need.  In the end, as Guile gained in uptake, the development team
decided to focus on depth, documentation and orthogonality rather than
on breadth.  This has been the focus of Guile ever since, although there
is a wide range of third-party libraries for Guile.

   Jim Blandy presided over that period of stabilization, in the three
years until the end of 1999, when he too moved on to other projects.
Since then, Guile has had a group maintainership.  The first group was
Maciej Stachowiak, Mikael Djurfeldt, and Marius Vollmer, with Vollmer
staying on the longest.  By late 2007, Marius had mostly moved on to
other things, so Neil Jerram and Ludovic Courtès stepped up to take on
the primary maintenance responsibility.  Neil and Ludovic were joined by
Andy Wingo in late 2009, allowing Neil to step away, and Mark Weaver
joined shortly thereafter.  After spending more than 5 years in the
role, Mark stepped down as well, leaving Ludovic and Andy as the current
co-maintainers of Guile as of January 2020.

   Of course, a large part of the actual work on Guile has come from
other contributors too numerous to mention, but without whom the world
would be a poorer place.

9.1.4 A Timeline of Selected Guile Releases
-------------------------------------------

guile-i — 4 February 1995
     SCM, turned into a library.

guile-ii — 6 April 1995
     A low-level module system was added.  Tcl/Tk support was added,
     allowing extension of Scheme by Tcl or vice versa.  POSIX support
     was improved, and there was an experimental stab at Java
     integration.

guile-iii — 18 August 1995
     The C-like syntax, ctax, was improved, but mostly this release
     featured a start at the task of breaking Guile into pieces.

1.0 — 5 January 1997
     ‘#f’ was distinguished from ‘'()’.  User-level, cooperative
     multi-threading was added.  Source-level debugging became more
     useful, and programmer’s and user’s manuals were begun.  The module
     system gained a high-level interface, which is still used today in
     more or less the same form.

1.1 — 16 May 1997
1.2 — 24 June 1997
     Support for Tcl/Tk and ctax were split off as separate packages,
     and have remained there since.  Guile became more compatible with
     SCSH, and more useful as a UNIX scripting language.  Libguile could
     now be built as a shared library, and third-party extensions
     written in C became loadable via dynamic linking.

1.3.0 — 19 October 1998
     Command-line editing became much more pleasant through the use of
     the readline library.  The initial support for internationalization
     via multi-byte strings was removed; 10 years were to pass before
     proper internationalization would land again.  Initial Emacs Lisp
     support landed, ports gained better support for file descriptors,
     and fluids were added.

1.3.2 — 20 August 1999
1.3.4 — 25 September 1999
1.4 — 21 June 2000
     A long list of lispy features were added: hooks, Common Lisp’s
     ‘format’, optional and keyword procedure arguments, ‘getopt-long’,
     sorting, random numbers, and many other fixes and enhancements.
     Guile also gained an interactive debugger, interactive help, and
     better backtraces.

1.6 — 6 September 2002
     Guile gained support for the R5RS standard, and added a number of
     SRFI modules.  The module system was expanded with programmatic
     support for identifier selection and renaming.  The GOOPS object
     system was merged into Guile core.

1.8 — 20 February 2006
     Guile’s arbitrary-precision arithmetic switched to use the GMP
     library, and added support for exact rationals.  Guile’s embedded
     user-space threading was removed in favor of POSIX pre-emptive
     threads, providing true multiprocessing.  Gettext support was
     added, and Guile’s C API was cleaned up and orthogonalized in a
     massive way.

2.0 — 16 February 2010
     A virtual machine was added to Guile, along with the associated
     compiler and toolchain.  Support for internationalization was
     finally reimplemented, in terms of unicode, locales, and
     libunistring.  Running Guile instances became controllable and
     debuggable from within Emacs, via Geiser.  Guile caught up to
     features found in a number of other Schemes: SRFI-18 threads,
     module-hygienic macros, a profiler, tracer, and debugger, SSAX XML
     integration, bytevectors, a dynamic FFI, delimited continuations,
     module versions, and partial support for R6RS.

2.2 — 15 March 2017
     The virtual machine and introduced in 2.0 was completely rewritten,
     along with much of the compiler and toolchain.  This speeds up many
     Guile programs as well as reducing startup time and memory usage.
     Guile’s POSIX multithreading was improved, stacks became
     dynamically expandable, the ports facility gained support for
     non-blocking I/O.

3.0 – January 2020
     Guile gained support for native code generation via a simple
     just-in-time (JIT) compiler, further improving the speed of its
     virtual machine.  The compiler itself gained a number of new
     optimizations: inlining of top-level bindings, better closure
     optimization, and better unboxing of integer and floating-point
     values.  R7RS support was added, and R6RS support improved.  The
     exception facility (throw and catch) was rewritten in terms of
     SRFI-34 exception handlers.

9.1.5 Status, or: Your Help Needed
----------------------------------

Guile has achieved much of what it set out to achieve, but there is much
remaining to do.

   There is still the old problem of bringing existing applications into
a more Emacs-like experience.  Guile has had some successes in this
respect, but still most applications in the GNU system are without Guile
integration.

   Getting Guile to those applications takes an investment, the
“hacktivation energy” needed to wire Guile into a program that only pays
off once it is good enough to enable new kinds of behavior.  This would
be a great way for new hackers to contribute: take an application that
you use and that you know well, think of something that it can’t yet do,
and figure out a way to integrate Guile and implement that task in
Guile.

   With time, perhaps this exposure can reverse itself, whereby programs
can run under Guile instead of vice versa, eventually resulting in the
Emacsification of the entire GNU system.  Indeed, this is the reason for
the naming of the many Guile modules that live in the ‘ice-9’ namespace,
a nod to the fictional substance in Kurt Vonnegut’s novel, Cat’s Cradle,
capable of acting as a seed crystal to crystallize the mass of software.

   Implicit to this whole discussion is the idea that dynamic languages
are somehow better than languages like C. While languages like C have
their place, Guile’s take on this question is that yes, Scheme is more
expressive than C, and more fun to write.  This realization carries an
imperative with it to write as much code in Scheme as possible rather
than in other languages.

   These days it is possible to write extensible applications almost
entirely from high-level languages, through byte-code and native
compilation, speed gains in the underlying hardware, and foreign call
interfaces in the high-level language.  Smalltalk systems are like this,
as are Common Lisp-based systems.  While there already are a number of
pure-Guile applications out there, in the past users have still needed
to drop down to C for some tasks: interfacing to system libraries that
don’t have prebuilt Guile interfaces, and for some tasks requiring high
performance.  With the arrival of native code generation via a JIT
compiler in Guile 3.0, most of these older applications can now be
updated to move more C code to Scheme.

   Still, even with an all-Guile application, sometimes you want to
provide an opportunity for users to extend your program from a language
with a syntax that is closer to C, or to Python.  Another interesting
idea to consider is compiling e.g. Python to Guile.  It’s not that
far-fetched of an idea: see for example IronPython or JRuby.

   Also, there’s Emacs itself.  Guile’s Emacs Lisp support has reached
an excellent level of correctness, robustness, and speed.  However there
is still work to do to finish its integration into Emacs itself.  This
will give lots of exciting things to Emacs: native threads, a real
object system, more sophisticated types, cleaner syntax, and access to
all of the Guile extensions.

   Finally, so much of the world’s computation is performed in web
browsers that it makes sense to ask ourselves what the
Guile-on-the-web-client story is.  With the advent of WebAssembly, there
may finally be a reasonable compilation target that’s present on almost
all user-exposed devices.  Especially with the upcoming proposals to
allow for tail calls, delimited continuations, and GC-managed objects,
Scheme might once again have a place in the web browser.  Get to it!

9.2 Data Representation
=======================

Scheme is a latently-typed language; this means that the system cannot,
in general, determine the type of a given expression at compile time.
Types only become apparent at run time.  Variables do not have fixed
types; a variable may hold a pair at one point, an integer at the next,
and a thousand-element vector later.  Instead, values, not variables,
have fixed types.

   In order to implement standard Scheme functions like ‘pair?’ and
‘string?’ and provide garbage collection, the representation of every
value must contain enough information to accurately determine its type
at run time.  Often, Scheme systems also use this information to
determine whether a program has attempted to apply an operation to an
inappropriately typed value (such as taking the ‘car’ of a string).

   Because variables, pairs, and vectors may hold values of any type,
Scheme implementations use a uniform representation for values — a
single type large enough to hold either a complete value or a pointer to
a complete value, along with the necessary typing information.

   The following sections will present a simple typing system, and then
make some refinements to correct its major weaknesses.  We then conclude
with a discussion of specific choices that Guile has made regarding
garbage collection and data representation.

9.2.1 A Simple Representation
-----------------------------

The simplest way to represent Scheme values in C would be to represent
each value as a pointer to a structure containing a type indicator,
followed by a union carrying the real value.  Assuming that ‘SCM’ is the
name of our universal type, we can write:

     enum type { integer, pair, string, vector, ... };

     typedef struct value *SCM;

     struct value {
       enum type type;
       union {
         int integer;
         struct { SCM car, cdr; } pair;
         struct { int length; char *elts; } string;
         struct { int length; SCM  *elts; } vector;
         ...
       } value;
     };
   with the ellipses replaced with code for the remaining Scheme types.

   This representation is sufficient to implement all of Scheme’s
semantics.  If X is an ‘SCM’ value:
   • To test if X is an integer, we can write ‘X->type == integer’.
   • To find its value, we can write ‘X->value.integer’.
   • To test if X is a vector, we can write ‘X->type == vector’.
   • If we know X is a vector, we can write ‘X->value.vector.elts[0]’ to
     refer to its first element.
   • If we know X is a pair, we can write ‘X->value.pair.car’ to extract
     its car.


File: guile.info,  Node: Faster Integers,  Next: Cheaper Pairs,  Prev: A Simple Representation,  Up: Data Representation

9.2.2 Faster Integers
---------------------

Unfortunately, the above representation has a serious disadvantage.  In
order to return an integer, an expression must allocate a ‘struct
value’, initialize it to represent that integer, and return a pointer to
it.  Furthermore, fetching an integer’s value requires a memory
reference, which is much slower than a register reference on most
processors.  Since integers are extremely common, this representation is
too costly, in both time and space.  Integers should be very cheap to
create and manipulate.

   One possible solution comes from the observation that, on many
architectures, heap-allocated data (i.e., what you get when you call
‘malloc’) must be aligned on an eight-byte boundary.  (Whether or not
the machine actually requires it, we can write our own allocator for
‘struct value’ objects that assures this is true.)  In this case, the
lower three bits of the structure’s address are known to be zero.

   This gives us the room we need to provide an improved representation
for integers.  We make the following rules:
   • If the lower three bits of an ‘SCM’ value are zero, then the SCM
     value is a pointer to a ‘struct value’, and everything proceeds as
     before.
   • Otherwise, the ‘SCM’ value represents an integer, whose value
     appears in its upper bits.

   Here is C code implementing this convention:
     enum type { pair, string, vector, ... };

     typedef struct value *SCM;

     struct value {
       enum type type;
       union {
         struct { SCM car, cdr; } pair;
         struct { int length; char *elts; } string;
         struct { int length; SCM  *elts; } vector;
         ...
       } value;
     };

     #define POINTER_P(x) (((int) (x) & 7) == 0)
     #define INTEGER_P(x) (! POINTER_P (x))

     #define GET_INTEGER(x)  ((int) (x) >> 3)
     #define MAKE_INTEGER(x) ((SCM) (((x) << 3) | 1))

   Notice that ‘integer’ no longer appears as an element of ‘enum type’,
and the union has lost its ‘integer’ member.  Instead, we use the
‘POINTER_P’ and ‘INTEGER_P’ macros to make a coarse classification of
values into integers and non-integers, and do further type testing as
before.

   Here’s how we would answer the questions posed above (again, assume X
is an ‘SCM’ value):
   • To test if X is an integer, we can write ‘INTEGER_P (X)’.
   • To find its value, we can write ‘GET_INTEGER (X)’.
   • To test if X is a vector, we can write:
            POINTER_P (X) && X->type == vector
     Given the new representation, we must make sure X is truly a
     pointer before we dereference it to determine its complete type.
   • If we know X is a vector, we can write ‘X->value.vector.elts[0]’ to
     refer to its first element, as before.
   • If we know X is a pair, we can write ‘X->value.pair.car’ to extract
     its car, just as before.

   This representation allows us to operate more efficiently on integers
than the first.  For example, if X and Y are known to be integers, we
can compute their sum as follows:
     MAKE_INTEGER (GET_INTEGER (X) + GET_INTEGER (Y))
   Now, integer math requires no allocation or memory references.  Most
real Scheme systems actually implement addition and other operations
using an even more efficient algorithm, but this essay isn’t about
bit-twiddling.  (Hint: how do you decide when to overflow to a bignum?
How would you do it in assembly?)


File: guile.info,  Node: Cheaper Pairs,  Next: Conservative GC,  Prev: Faster Integers,  Up: Data Representation

9.2.3 Cheaper Pairs
-------------------

However, there is yet another issue to confront.  Most Scheme heaps
contain more pairs than any other type of object; Jonathan Rees said at
one point that pairs occupy 45% of the heap in his Scheme
implementation, Scheme 48.  However, our representation above spends
three ‘SCM’-sized words per pair — one for the type, and two for the CAR
and CDR.  Is there any way to represent pairs using only two words?

   Let us refine the convention we established earlier.  Let us assert
that:
   • If the bottom three bits of an ‘SCM’ value are ‘#b000’, then it is
     a pointer, as before.
   • If the bottom three bits are ‘#b001’, then the upper bits are an
     integer.  This is a bit more restrictive than before.
   • If the bottom two bits are ‘#b010’, then the value, with the bottom
     three bits masked out, is the address of a pair.

   Here is the new C code:
     enum type { string, vector, ... };

     typedef struct value *SCM;

     struct value {
       enum type type;
       union {
         struct { int length; char *elts; } string;
         struct { int length; SCM  *elts; } vector;
         ...
       } value;
     };

     struct pair {
       SCM car, cdr;
     };

     #define POINTER_P(x) (((int) (x) & 7) == 0)

     #define INTEGER_P(x)  (((int) (x) & 7) == 1)
     #define GET_INTEGER(x)  ((int) (x) >> 3)
     #define MAKE_INTEGER(x) ((SCM) (((x) << 3) | 1))

     #define PAIR_P(x) (((int) (x) & 7) == 2)
     #define GET_PAIR(x) ((struct pair *) ((int) (x) & ~7))

   Notice that ‘enum type’ and ‘struct value’ now only contain
provisions for vectors and strings; both integers and pairs have become
special cases.  The code above also assumes that an ‘int’ is large
enough to hold a pointer, which isn’t generally true.

   Our list of examples is now as follows:
   • To test if X is an integer, we can write ‘INTEGER_P (X)’; this is
     as before.
   • To find its value, we can write ‘GET_INTEGER (X)’, as before.
   • To test if X is a vector, we can write:
            POINTER_P (X) && X->type == vector
     We must still make sure that X is a pointer to a ‘struct value’
     before dereferencing it to find its type.
   • If we know X is a vector, we can write ‘X->value.vector.elts[0]’ to
     refer to its first element, as before.
   • We can write ‘PAIR_P (X)’ to determine if X is a pair, and then
     write ‘GET_PAIR (X)->car’ to refer to its car.

   This change in representation reduces our heap size by 15%.  It also
makes it cheaper to decide if a value is a pair, because no memory
references are necessary; it suffices to check the bottom two bits of
the ‘SCM’ value.  This may be significant when traversing lists, a
common activity in a Scheme system.

   Again, most real Scheme systems use a slightly different
implementation; for example, if GET_PAIR subtracts off the low bits of
‘x’, instead of masking them off, the optimizer will often be able to
combine that subtraction with the addition of the offset of the
structure member we are referencing, making a modified pointer as fast
to use as an unmodified pointer.

9.2.4 Conservative Garbage Collection
-------------------------------------

Aside from the latent typing, the major source of constraints on a
Scheme implementation’s data representation is the garbage collector.
The collector must be able to traverse every live object in the heap, to
determine which objects are not live, and thus collectable.

   There are many ways to implement this.  Guile’s garbage collection is
built on a library, the Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage
collector (BDW-GC). The BDW-GC “just works”, for the most part.  But
since it is interesting to know how these things work, we include here a
high-level description of what the BDW-GC does.

   Garbage collection has two logical phases: a “mark” phase, in which
the set of live objects is enumerated, and a “sweep” phase, in which
objects not traversed in the mark phase are collected.  Correct
functioning of the collector depends on being able to traverse the
entire set of live objects.

   In the mark phase, the collector scans the system’s global variables
and the local variables on the stack to determine which objects are
immediately accessible by the C code.  It then scans those objects to
find the objects they point to, and so on.  The collector logically sets
a “mark bit” on each object it finds, so each object is traversed only
once.

   When the collector can find no unmarked objects pointed to by marked
objects, it assumes that any objects that are still unmarked will never
be used by the program (since there is no path of dereferences from any
global or local variable that reaches them) and deallocates them.

   In the above paragraphs, we did not specify how the garbage collector
finds the global and local variables; as usual, there are many different
approaches.  Frequently, the programmer must maintain a list of pointers
to all global variables that refer to the heap, and another list
(adjusted upon entry to and exit from each function) of local variables,
for the collector’s benefit.

   The list of global variables is usually not too difficult to
maintain, since global variables are relatively rare.  However, an
explicitly maintained list of local variables (in the author’s personal
experience) is a nightmare to maintain.  Thus, the BDW-GC uses a
technique called “conservative garbage collection”, to make the local
variable list unnecessary.

   The trick to conservative collection is to treat the C stack as an
ordinary range of memory, and assume that _every_ word on the C stack is
a pointer into the heap.  Thus, the collector marks all objects whose
addresses appear anywhere in the C stack, without knowing for sure how
that word is meant to be interpreted.

   In addition to the stack, the BDW-GC will also scan static data
sections.  This means that global variables are also scanned when
looking for live Scheme objects.

   Obviously, such a system will occasionally retain objects that are
actually garbage, and should be freed.  In practice, this is not a
problem, as the set of conservatively-scanned locations is fixed; the
Scheme stack is maintained apart from the C stack, and is scanned
precisely (as opposed to conservatively).  The GC-managed heap is also
partitioned into parts that can contain pointers (such as vectors) and
parts that can’t (such as bytevectors), limiting the potential for
confusing a raw integer with a pointer to a live object.

   Interested readers should see the BDW-GC web page at
<http://www.hboehm.info/gc/>, for more information on conservative GC in
general and the BDW-GC implementation in particular.

9.2.5 The SCM Type in Guile
---------------------------

Guile classifies Scheme objects into two kinds: those that fit entirely
within an ‘SCM’, and those that require heap storage.

   The former class are called “immediates”.  The class of immediates
includes small integers, characters, boolean values, the empty list, the
mysterious end-of-file object, and some others.

   The remaining types are called, not surprisingly, “non-immediates”.
They include pairs, procedures, strings, vectors, and all other data
types in Guile.  For non-immediates, the ‘SCM’ word contains a pointer
to data on the heap, with further information about the object in
question is stored in that data.

   This section describes how the ‘SCM’ type is actually represented and
used at the C level.  Interested readers should see ‘libguile/scm.h’ for
an exposition of how Guile stores type information.

   In fact, there are two basic C data types to represent objects in
Guile: ‘SCM’ and ‘scm_t_bits’.

File: guile.info,  Node: Relationship Between SCM and scm_t_bits,  Next: Immediate Objects,  Up: The SCM Type in Guile

### 9.2.5.1 Relationship Between ‘SCM’ and ‘scm_t_bits’
...................................................

A variable of type ‘SCM’ is guaranteed to hold a valid Scheme object.  A
variable of type ‘scm_t_bits’, on the other hand, may hold a
representation of a ‘SCM’ value as a C integral type, but may also hold
any C value, even if it does not correspond to a valid Scheme object.

   For a variable X of type ‘SCM’, the Scheme object’s type information
is stored in a form that is not directly usable.  To be able to work on
the type encoding of the scheme value, the ‘SCM’ variable has to be
transformed into the corresponding representation as a ‘scm_t_bits’
variable Y by using the ‘SCM_UNPACK’ macro.  Once this has been done,
the type of the scheme object X can be derived from the content of the
bits of the ‘scm_t_bits’ value Y, in the way illustrated by the example
earlier in this chapter (*note* Cheaper Pairs::).  Conversely, a valid
bit encoding of a Scheme value as a ‘scm_t_bits’ variable can be
transformed into the corresponding ‘SCM’ value using the ‘SCM_PACK’
macro.

### 9.2.5.2 Immediate Objects
.........................

A Scheme object may either be an immediate, i.e. carrying all necessary
information by itself, or it may contain a reference to a “heap object”
which is, as the name implies, data on the heap.  Although in general it
should be irrelevant for user code whether an object is an immediate or
not, within Guile’s own code the distinction is sometimes of importance.
Thus, the following low level macro is provided:

 -- Macro: int SCM_IMP (SCM X)
     A Scheme object is an immediate if it fulfills the ‘SCM_IMP’
     predicate, otherwise it holds an encoded reference to a heap
     object.  The result of the predicate is delivered as a C style
     boolean value.  User code and code that extends Guile should
     normally not be required to use this macro.

Summary:
   • Given a Scheme object X of unknown type, check first with ‘SCM_IMP
     (X)’ if it is an immediate object.
   • If so, all of the type and value information can be determined from
     the ‘scm_t_bits’ value that is delivered by ‘SCM_UNPACK (X)’.

   There are a number of special values in Scheme, most of them
documented elsewhere in this manual.  It’s not quite the right place to
put them, but for now, here’s a list of the C names given to some of
these values:

 -- Macro: SCM SCM_EOL
     The Scheme empty list object, or “End Of List” object, usually
     written in Scheme as ‘'()’.

 -- Macro: SCM SCM_EOF_VAL
     The Scheme end-of-file value.  It has no standard written
     representation, for obvious reasons.

 -- Macro: SCM SCM_UNSPECIFIED
     The value returned by some (but not all) expressions that the
     Scheme standard says return an “unspecified” value.

     This is sort of a weirdly literal way to take things, but the
     standard read-eval-print loop prints nothing when the expression
     returns this value, so it’s not a bad idea to return this when you
     can’t think of anything else helpful.

 -- Macro: SCM SCM_UNDEFINED
     The “undefined” value.  Its most important property is that is not
     equal to any valid Scheme value.  This is put to various internal
     uses by C code interacting with Guile.

     For example, when you write a C function that is callable from
     Scheme and which takes optional arguments, the interpreter passes
     ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’ for any arguments you did not receive.

     We also use this to mark unbound variables.

 -- Macro: int SCM_UNBNDP (SCM X)
     Return true if X is ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’.  Note that this is not a check
     to see if X is ‘SCM_UNBOUND’.  History will not be kind to us.


File: guile.info,  Node: Non-Immediate Objects,  Next: Allocating Heap Objects,  Prev: Immediate Objects,  Up: The SCM Type in Guile

### 9.2.5.3 Non-Immediate Objects
.............................

A Scheme object of type ‘SCM’ that does not fulfill the ‘SCM_IMP’
predicate holds an encoded reference to a heap object.  This reference
can be decoded to a C pointer to a heap object using the
‘SCM_UNPACK_POINTER’ macro.  The encoding of a pointer to a heap object
into a ‘SCM’ value is done using the ‘SCM_PACK_POINTER’ macro.

   Before Guile 2.0, Guile had a custom garbage collector that allocated
heap objects in units of 2-word “cells”.  With the move to the BDW-GC
collector in Guile 2.0, Guile can allocate heap objects of any size, and
the concept of a cell is now obsolete.  Still, we mention it here as the
name still appears in various low-level interfaces.

 -- Macro: scm_t_bits * SCM_UNPACK_POINTER (SCM X)
 -- Macro: scm_t_cell * SCM2PTR (SCM X)
     Extract and return the heap object pointer from a non-immediate
     ‘SCM’ object X.  The name ‘SCM2PTR’ is deprecated but still common.

 -- Macro: SCM_PACK_POINTER (scm_t_bits * X)
 -- Macro: SCM PTR2SCM (scm_t_cell * X)
     Return a ‘SCM’ value that encodes a reference to the heap object
     pointer X.  The name ‘PTR2SCM’ is deprecated but still common.

   Note that it is also possible to transform a non-immediate ‘SCM’
value by using ‘SCM_UNPACK’ into a ‘scm_t_bits’ variable.  However, the
result of ‘SCM_UNPACK’ may not be used as a pointer to a heap object:
only ‘SCM_UNPACK_POINTER’ is guaranteed to transform a ‘SCM’ object into
a valid pointer to a heap object.  Also, it is not allowed to apply
‘SCM_PACK_POINTER’ to anything that is not a valid pointer to a heap
object.

Summary:
   • Only use ‘SCM_UNPACK_POINTER’ on ‘SCM’ values for which ‘SCM_IMP’
     is false!
   • Don’t use ‘(scm_t_cell *) SCM_UNPACK (X)’!  Use ‘SCM_UNPACK_POINTER
     (X)’ instead!
   • Don’t use ‘SCM_PACK_POINTER’ for anything but a heap object
     pointer!

### 9.2.5.4 Allocating Heap Objects
...............................

Heap objects are heap-allocated data pointed to by non-immediate ‘SCM’
value.  The first word of the heap object should contain a type code.
The object may be any number of words in length, and is generally
scanned by the garbage collector for additional unless the object was
allocated using a “pointerless” allocation function.

   You should generally not need these functions, unless you are
implementing a new data type, and thoroughly understand the code in
‘<libguile/scm.h>’.

   If you just want to allocate pairs, use ‘scm_cons’.

 -- Function: SCM scm_words (scm_t_bits word_0, uint32_t n_words)
     Allocate a new heap object containing N_WORDS, and initialize the
     first slot to WORD_0, and return a non-immediate ‘SCM’ value
     encoding a pointer to the object.  Typically WORD_0 will contain
     the type tag.

   There are also deprecated but common variants of ‘scm_words’ that use
the term “cell” to indicate 2-word objects.

 -- Function: SCM scm_cell (scm_t_bits word_0, scm_t_bits word_1)
     Allocate a new 2-word heap object, initialize the two slots with
     WORD_0 and WORD_1, and return it.  Just like calling ‘scm_words
     (WORD_0, 2)’, then initializing the second slot to WORD_1.

     Note that WORD_0 and WORD_1 are of type ‘scm_t_bits’.  If you want
     to pass a ‘SCM’ object, you need to use ‘SCM_UNPACK’.

 -- Function: SCM scm_double_cell (scm_t_bits word_0, scm_t_bits word_1,
          scm_t_bits word_2, scm_t_bits word_3)
     Like ‘scm_cell’, but allocates a 4-word heap object.

### 9.2.5.5 Heap Object Type Information
....................................

Heap objects contain a type tag and are followed by a number of
word-sized slots.  The interpretation of the object contents depends on
the type of the object.

 -- Macro: scm_t_bits SCM_CELL_TYPE (SCM X)
     Extract the first word of the heap object pointed to by X.  This
     value holds the information about the cell type.

 -- Macro: void SCM_SET_CELL_TYPE (SCM X, scm_t_bits T)
     For a non-immediate Scheme object X, write the value T into the
     first word of the heap object referenced by X.  The value T must
     hold a valid cell type.

### 9.2.5.6 Accessing Heap Object Fields
....................................

For a non-immediate Scheme object X, the object type can be determined
by using the ‘SCM_CELL_TYPE’ macro described in the previous section.
For each different type of heap object it is known which fields hold
tagged Scheme objects and which fields hold untagged raw data.  To
access the different fields appropriately, the following macros are
provided.

 -- Macro: scm_t_bits SCM_CELL_WORD (SCM X, unsigned int N)
 -- Macro: scm_t_bits SCM_CELL_WORD_0 (X)
 -- Macro: scm_t_bits SCM_CELL_WORD_1 (X)
 -- Macro: scm_t_bits SCM_CELL_WORD_2 (X)
 -- Macro: scm_t_bits SCM_CELL_WORD_3 (X)
     Deliver the field N of the heap object referenced by the
     non-immediate Scheme object X as raw untagged data.  Only use this
     macro for fields containing untagged data; don’t use it for fields
     containing tagged ‘SCM’ objects.

9.3 A Virtual Machine for Guile
===============================

Enough about data—how does Guile run code?

   Code is a grammatical production of a language.  Sometimes these
languages are implemented using interpreters: programs that run
along-side the program being interpreted, dynamically translating the
high-level code to low-level code.  Sometimes these languages are
implemented using compilers: programs that translate high-level programs
to equivalent low-level code, and pass on that low-level code to some
other language implementation.  Each of these languages can be thought
to be virtual machines: they offer programs an abstract machine on which
to run.

   Guile implements a number of interpreters and compilers on different
language levels.  For example, there is an interpreter for the Scheme
language that is itself implemented as a Scheme program compiled to a
bytecode for a low-level virtual machine shipped with Guile.  That
virtual machine is implemented by both an interpreter—a C program that
interprets the bytecodes—and a compiler—a C program that dynamically
translates bytecode programs to native machine code(1).

   This section describes the language implemented by Guile’s bytecode
virtual machine, as well as some examples of translations of Scheme
programs to Guile’s VM.

9.3.1 Why a VM?
---------------

For a long time, Guile only had a Scheme interpreter, implemented in C.
Guile’s interpreter operated directly on the S-expression representation
of Scheme source code.

   But while the interpreter was highly optimized and hand-tuned, it
still performed many needless computations during the course of
evaluating a Scheme expression.  For example, application of a function
to arguments needlessly consed up the arguments in a list.  Evaluation
of an expression like ‘(f x y)’ always had to figure out whether F was a
procedure, or a special form like ‘if’, or something else.  The
interpreter represented the lexical environment as a heap data
structure, so every evaluation caused allocation, which was of course
slow.  Et cetera.

   The solution to the slow-interpreter problem was to compile the
higher-level language, Scheme, into a lower-level language for which all
of the checks and dispatching have already been done—the code is instead
stripped to the bare minimum needed to “do the job”.

   The question becomes then, what low-level language to choose?  There
are many options.  We could compile to native code directly, but that
poses portability problems for Guile, as it is a highly cross-platform
project.

   So we want the performance gains that compilation provides, but we
also want to maintain the portability benefits of a single code path.
The obvious solution is to compile to a virtual machine that is present
on all Guile installations.

   The easiest (and most fun) way to depend on a virtual machine is to
implement the virtual machine within Guile itself.  Guile contains a
bytecode interpreter (written in C) and a Scheme to bytecode compiler
(written in Scheme).  This way the virtual machine provides what Scheme
needs (tail calls, multiple values, ‘call/cc’) and can provide optimized
inline instructions for Guile as well (GC-managed allocations, type
checks, etc.).

   Guile also includes a just-in-time (JIT) compiler to translate
bytecode to native code.  Because Guile embeds a portable code
generation library (<https://gitlab.com/wingo/lightening>), we keep the
benefits of portability while also benefitting from fast native code.
To avoid too much time spent in the JIT compiler itself, Guile is tuned
to only emit machine code for bytecode that is called often.

   The rest of this section describes that VM that Guile implements, and
the compiled procedures that run on it.

   Before moving on, though, we should note that though we spoke of the
interpreter in the past tense, Guile still has an interpreter.  The
difference is that before, it was Guile’s main Scheme implementation,
and so was implemented in highly optimized C; now, it is actually
implemented in Scheme, and compiled down to VM bytecode, just like any
other program.  (There is still a C interpreter around, used to
bootstrap the compiler, but it is not normally used at runtime.)

   The upside of implementing the interpreter in Scheme is that we
preserve tail calls and multiple-value handling between interpreted and
compiled code, and with advent of the JIT compiler in Guile 3.0 we reach
the speed of the old hand-tuned C implementation; it’s the best of both
worlds.

   Also note that this decision to implement a bytecode compiler does
not preclude ahead-of-time native compilation.  More possibilities are
discussed in *note* Extending the Compiler::.


File: guile.info,  Node: VM Concepts,  Next: Stack Layout,  Prev: Why a VM?,  Up: A Virtual Machine for Guile

9.3.2 VM Concepts
-----------------

The bytecode in a Scheme procedure is interpreted by a virtual machine
(VM). Each thread has its own instantiation of the VM. The virtual
machine executes the sequence of instructions in a procedure.

   Each VM instruction starts by indicating which operation it is, and
then follows by encoding its source and destination operands.  Each
procedure declares that it has some number of local variables, including
the function arguments.  These local variables form the available
operands of the procedure, and are accessed by index.

   The local variables for a procedure are stored on a stack.  Calling a
procedure typically enlarges the stack, and returning from a procedure
shrinks it.  Stack memory is exclusive to the virtual machine that owns
it.

   In addition to their stacks, virtual machines also have access to the
global memory (modules, global bindings, etc) that is shared among other
parts of Guile, including other VMs.

   The registers that a VM has are as follows:

   • ip - Instruction pointer
   • sp - Stack pointer
   • fp - Frame pointer

   In other architectures, the instruction pointer is sometimes called
the “program counter” (pc).  This set of registers is pretty typical for
virtual machines; their exact meanings in the context of Guile’s VM are
described in the next section.


File: guile.info,  Node: Stack Layout,  Next: Variables and the VM,  Prev: VM Concepts,  Up: A Virtual Machine for Guile

9.3.3 Stack Layout
------------------

The stack of Guile’s virtual machine is composed of “frames”.  Each
frame corresponds to the application of one compiled procedure, and
contains storage space for arguments, local variables, and some
bookkeeping information (such as what to do after the frame is
finished).

   While the compiler is free to do whatever it wants to, as long as the
semantics of a computation are preserved, in practice every time you
call a function, a new frame is created.  (The notable exception of
course is the tail call case, *note* Tail Calls::.)

   The structure of the top stack frame is as follows:

        | ...previous frame locals...  |
        +==============================+ <- fp + 3
        | Dynamic link                 |
        +------------------------------+
        | Virtual return address (vRA) |
        +------------------------------+
        | Machine return address (mRA) |
        +==============================+ <- fp
        | Local 0                      |
        +------------------------------+
        | Local 1                      |
        +------------------------------+
        | ...                          |
        +------------------------------+
        | Local N-1                    |
        \------------------------------/ <- sp

   In the above drawing, the stack grows downward.  At the beginning of
a function call, the procedure being applied is in local 0, followed by
the arguments from local 1.  After the procedure checks that it is being
passed a compatible set of arguments, the procedure allocates some
additional space in the frame to hold variables local to the function.

   Note that once a value in a local variable slot is no longer needed,
Guile is free to re-use that slot.  This applies to the slots that were
initially used for the callee and arguments, too.  For this reason,
backtraces in Guile aren’t always able to show all of the arguments: it
could be that the slot corresponding to that argument was re-used by
some other variable.

   The “virtual return address” is the ‘ip’ that was in effect before
this program was applied.  When we return from this activation frame, we
will jump back to this ‘ip’.  Likewise, the “dynamic link” is the offset
of the ‘fp’ that was in effect before this program was applied, relative
to the current ‘fp’.

   There are two return addresses: the virtual return address (vRA), and
the machine return address (mRA). The vRA is always present and
indicates a bytecode address.  The mRA is only present when a call is
made from a function with machine code (e.g.  a function that has been
JIT-compiled).

   To prepare for a non-tail application, Guile’s VM will emit code that
shuffles the function to apply and its arguments into appropriate stack
slots, with three free slots below them.  The call then initializes
those free slots to hold the machine return address (or NULL), the
virtual return address, and the offset to the previous frame pointer
(‘fp’).  It then gets the ‘ip’ for the function being called and adjusts
‘fp’ to point to the new call frame.

   In this way, the dynamic link links the current frame to the previous
frame.  Computing a stack trace involves traversing these frames.

   Each stack local in Guile is 64 bits wide, even on 32-bit
architectures.  This allows Guile to preserve its uniform treatment of
stack locals while allowing for unboxed arithmetic on 64-bit integers
and floating-point numbers.  *Note* Instruction Set::, for more on
unboxed arithmetic.

   As an implementation detail, we actually store the dynamic link as an
offset and not an absolute value because the stack can move at runtime
as it expands or during partial continuation calls.  If it were an
absolute value, we would have to walk the frames, relocating frame
pointers.


File: guile.info,  Node: Variables and the VM,  Next: VM Programs,  Prev: Stack Layout,  Up: A Virtual Machine for Guile

9.3.4 Variables and the VM
--------------------------

Consider the following Scheme code as an example:

       (define (foo a)
         (lambda (b) (vector foo a b)))

   Within the lambda expression, ‘foo’ is a top-level variable, ‘a’ is a
lexically captured variable, and ‘b’ is a local variable.

   Another way to refer to ‘a’ and ‘b’ is to say that ‘a’ is a “free”
variable, since it is not defined within the lambda, and ‘b’ is a
“bound” variable.  These are the terms used in the “lambda calculus”, a
mathematical notation for describing functions.  The lambda calculus is
useful because it is a language in which to reason precisely about
functions and variables.  It is especially good at describing scope
relations, and it is for that reason that we mention it here.

   Guile allocates all variables on the stack.  When a lexically
enclosed procedure with free variables—a “closure”—is created, it copies
those variables into its free variable vector.  References to free
variables are then redirected through the free variable vector.

   If a variable is ever ‘set!’, however, it will need to be
heap-allocated instead of stack-allocated, so that different closures
that capture the same variable can see the same value.  Also, this
allows continuations to capture a reference to the variable, instead of
to its value at one point in time.  For these reasons, ‘set!’ variables
are allocated in “boxes”—actually, in variable cells.  *Note*
Variables::, for more information.  References to ‘set!’ variables are
indirected through the boxes.

   Thus perhaps counterintuitively, what would seem “closer to the
metal”, viz ‘set!’, actually forces an extra memory allocation and
indirection.  Sometimes Guile’s optimizer can remove this allocation,
but not always.

   Going back to our example, ‘b’ may be allocated on the stack, as it
is never mutated.

   ‘a’ may also be allocated on the stack, as it too is never mutated.
Within the enclosed lambda, its value will be copied into (and
referenced from) the free variables vector.

   ‘foo’ is a top-level variable, because ‘foo’ is not lexically bound
in this example.

9.3.5 Compiled Procedures are VM Programs
-----------------------------------------

By default, when you enter in expressions at Guile’s REPL, they are
first compiled to bytecode.  Then that bytecode is executed to produce a
value.  If the expression evaluates to a procedure, the result of this
process is a compiled procedure.

   A compiled procedure is a compound object consisting of its bytecode
and a reference to any captured lexical variables.  In addition, when a
procedure is compiled, it has associated metadata written to side
tables, for instance a line number mapping, or its docstring.  You can
pick apart these pieces with the accessors in ‘(system vm program)’.
*Note* Compiled Procedures::, for a full API reference.

   A procedure may reference data that was statically allocated when the
procedure was compiled.  For example, a pair of immediate objects (*note*
Immediate Objects::) can be allocated directly in the memory segment
that contains the compiled bytecode, and accessed directly by the
bytecode.

   Another use for statically allocated data is to serve as a cache for
a bytecode.  Top-level variable lookups are handled in this way; the
first time a top-level binding is referenced, the resolved variable will
be stored in a cache.  Thereafter all access to the variable goes
through the cache cell.  The variable’s value may change in the future,
but the variable itself will not.

   We can see how these concepts tie together by disassembling the ‘foo’
function we defined earlier to see what is going on:

     scheme@(guile-user)> (define (foo a) (lambda (b) (vector foo a b)))
     scheme@(guile-user)> ,x foo

       38    (handle-interrupts)
       39    (return-values)

   The first thing to notice is that the bytecode is at a fairly low
level.  When a program is compiled from Scheme to bytecode, it is
expressed in terms of more primitive operations.  As such, there can be
more instructions than you might expect.

   The first chunk of instructions is the outer ‘foo’ procedure.  It is
followed by the code for the contained closure.  The code can look
daunting at first glance, but with practice it quickly becomes
comprehensible, and indeed being able to read bytecode is an important
step to understanding the low-level performance of Guile programs.

   The ‘foo’ function begins with a prelude.  The ‘instrument-entry’
bytecode increments a counter associated with the function.  If the
counter reaches a certain threshold, Guile will emit machine code
(“JIT-compile”) for ‘foo’.  Emitting machine code is fairly cheap but it
does take time, so it’s not something you want to do for every function.
Using a per-function counter and a global threshold allows Guile to
spend time JIT-compiling only the “hot” functions.

   Next in the prelude is an argument-checking instruction, which checks
that it was called with only 1 argument (plus the callee function itself
makes 2) and then reserves stack space for an additional 1 local.

   Then from ‘ip’ 3 to 11, we allocate a new closure by allocating a
three-word object, initializing its first word to store a type tag,
setting its second word to its code pointer, and finally at ‘ip’ 11,
storing local value 1 (the ‘a’ argument) into the third word (the first
free variable).

   Before returning, ‘foo’ “resets the frame” to hold only one local
(the return value), runs any pending interrupts (*note* Asyncs::) and
then returns.

   Note that local variables in Guile’s virtual machine are usually
addressed relative to the stack pointer, which leads to a pleasantly
efficient ‘sp[N]’ access.  However it can make the disassembly hard to
read, because the ‘sp’ can change during the function, and because
incoming arguments are relative to the ‘fp’, not the ‘sp’.

   To know what ‘fp’-relative slot corresponds to an ‘sp’-relative
reference, scan up in the disassembly until you get to a “N slots”
annotation; in our case, 3, indicating that the frame has space for 3
slots.  Thus a zero-indexed ‘sp’-relative slot of 2 corresponds to the
‘fp’-relative slot of 0, which initially held the value of the closure
being called.  This means that Guile doesn’t need the value of the
closure to compute its result, and so slot 0 was free for re-use, in
this case for the result of making a new closure.

   A closure is code with data.  As you can see, making the closure
involved making an object (‘ip’ 3), putting a code pointer in it (‘ip’ 8
and 10), and putting in the closure’s free variable (‘ip’ 11).

   The second stanza disassembles the code for the closure.  After the
prelude, all of the code between ‘ip’ 5 and 24 is related to loading the
toplevel variable ‘foo’ into slot 1.  This lookup happens only once, and
is associated with a cache; after the first run, the value in the cache
will be a bound variable, and the code will jump from ‘ip’ 7 to 26.  On
the first run, Guile gets the module associated with the function, calls
out to a run-time routine to look up the variable, and checks that the
variable is bound before initializing the cache.  Either way, ‘ip’ 26
dereferences the variable into local 2.

   What follows is the allocation and initialization of the vector
return value.  ‘Ip’ 27 does the allocation, and the following two
instructions initialize the type-and-length tag for the object’s first
word.  ‘Ip’ 32 sets word 1 of the object (the first vector slot) to the
value of ‘foo’; ‘ip’ 33 fetches the closure variable for ‘a’, then in
‘ip’ 34 stores it in the second vector slot; and finally, in ‘ip’ 35,
local ‘b’ is stored to the third vector slot.  This is followed by the
return sequence.

9.3.6 Object File Format
------------------------

To compile a file to disk, we need a format in which to write the
compiled code to disk, and later load it into Guile.  A good “object
file format” has a number of characteristics:

   • Above all else, it should be very cheap to load a compiled file.
   • It should be possible to statically allocate constants in the file.
     For example, a bytevector literal in source code can be emitted
     directly into the object file.
   • The compiled file should enable maximum code and data sharing
     between different processes.
   • The compiled file should contain debugging information, such as
     line numbers, but that information should be separated from the
     code itself.  It should be possible to strip debugging information
     if space is tight.

   These characteristics are not specific to Scheme.  Indeed, mainstream
languages like C and C++ have solved this issue many times in the past.
Guile builds on their work by adopting ELF, the object file format of
GNU and other Unix-like systems, as its object file format.  Although
Guile uses ELF on all platforms, we do not use platform support for ELF.
Guile implements its own linker and loader.  The advantage of using ELF
is not sharing code, but sharing ideas.  ELF is simply a well-designed
object file format.

   An ELF file has two meta-tables describing its contents.  The first
meta-table is for the loader, and is called the “program table” or
sometimes the “segment table”.  The program table divides the file into
big chunks that should be treated differently by the loader.  Mostly the
difference between these “segments” is their permissions.

   Typically all segments of an ELF file are marked as read-only, except
that part that represents modifiable static data or static data that
needs load-time initialization.  Loading an ELF file is as simple as
mmapping the thing into memory with read-only permissions, then using
the segment table to mark a small sub-region of the file as writable.
This writable section is typically added to the root set of the garbage
collector as well.

   One ELF segment is marked as “dynamic”, meaning that it has data of
interest to the loader.  Guile uses this segment to record the Guile
version corresponding to this file.  There is also an entry in the
dynamic segment that points to the address of an initialization thunk
that is run to perform any needed link-time initialization.  (This is
like dynamic relocations for normal ELF shared objects, except that we
compile the relocations as a procedure instead of having the loader
interpret a table of relocations.)  Finally, the dynamic segment marks
the location of the “entry thunk” of the object file.  This thunk is
returned to the caller of ‘load-thunk-from-memory’ or
‘load-thunk-from-file’.  When called, it will execute the “body” of the
compiled expression.

   The other meta-table in an ELF file is the “section table”.  Whereas
the program table divides an ELF file into big chunks for the loader,
the section table specifies small sections for use by introspective
tools like debuggers or the like.  One segment (program table entry)
typically contains many sections.  There may be sections outside of any
segment, as well.

   Typical sections in a Guile ‘.go’ file include:

‘.rtl-text’
     Bytecode.
‘.data’
     Data that needs initialization, or which may be modified at

9.3.7 Instruction Set
---------------------

There are currently about 150 instructions in Guile’s virtual machine.
These instructions represent atomic units of a program’s execution.
Ideally, they perform one task without conditional branches, then
dispatch to the next instruction in the stream.

   Instructions themselves are composed of 1 or more 32-bit units.  The
low 8 bits of the first word indicate the opcode, and the rest of
instruction describe the operands.  There are a number of different ways
operands can be encoded.

‘sN’
     An unsigned N-bit integer, indicating the ‘sp’-relative index of a
     local variable.
‘fN’
     An unsigned N-bit integer, indicating the ‘fp’-relative index of a
     local variable.  Used when a continuation accepts a variable number
     of values, to shuffle received values into known locations in the
     frame.
‘cN’
     An unsigned N-bit integer, indicating a constant value.
‘l24’
     An offset from the current ‘ip’, in 32-bit units, as a signed
     24-bit value.  Indicates a bytecode address, for a relative jump.
‘zi16’
‘i16’
‘i32’
     An immediate Scheme value (*note* Immediate Objects::), encoded
     directly in 16 or 32 bits.  ‘zi16’ is sign-extended; the others are
     zero-extended.
‘a32’
‘b32’
     An immediate Scheme value, encoded as a pair of 32-bit words.
     ‘a32’ and ‘b32’ values always go together on the same opcode, and
     indicate the high and low bits, respectively.  Normally only used
     on 64-bit systems.
‘n32’
     A statically allocated non-immediate.  The address of the
     non-immediate is encoded as a signed 32-bit integer, and indicates
     a relative offset in 32-bit units.  Think of it as ‘SCM x = ip +
     offset’.
‘r32’
     Indirect scheme value, like ‘n32’ but indirected.  Think of it as
     ‘SCM *x = ip + offset’.
‘l32’
‘lo32’
     An ip-relative address, as a signed 32-bit integer.  Could indicate
     a bytecode address, as in ‘make-closure’, or a non-immediate
     address, as with ‘static-patch!’.

     ‘l32’ and ‘lo32’ are the same from the perspective of the virtual
     machine.  The difference is that an assembler might want to allow
     an ‘lo32’ address to be specified as a label and then some number
     of words offset from that label, for example when patching a field
     of a statically allocated object.
‘v32:x8-l24’
     Almost all VM instructions have a fixed size.  The ‘jtable’
     instruction used to perform optimized ‘case’ branches is an
     exception, which uses a ‘v32’ trailing word to indicate the number
     of additional words in the instruction, which themselves are
     encoded as ‘x8-l24’ values.
‘b1’
     A boolean value: 1 for true, otherwise 0.
‘xN’
     An ignored sequence of N bits.

   An instruction is specified by giving its name, then describing its
operands.  The operands are packed by 32-bit words, with earlier
operands occupying the lower bits.

   For example, consider the following instruction specification:

 -- Instruction: call f24:PROC x8:_ c24:NLOCALS

   The first word in the instruction will start with the 8-bit value
corresponding to the CALL opcode in the low bits, followed by PROC as a
24-bit value.  The second word starts with 8 dead bits, followed by the
index as a 24-bit immediate value.

   For instructions with operands that encode references to the stack,
the interpretation of those stack values is up to the instruction
itself.  Most instructions expect their operands to be tagged SCM values
(‘scm’ representation), but some instructions expect unboxed integers
(‘u64’ and ‘s64’ representations) or floating-point numbers (‘f64’
representation).  It is assumed that the bits for a ‘u64’ value are the
same as those for an ‘s64’ value, and that ‘s64’ values are stored in
two’s complement.

   Instructions have static types: they must receive their operands in
the format they expect.  It’s up to the compiler to ensure this is the
case.

   Unless otherwise mentioned, all operands and results are in the ‘scm’
representation.

### 9.3.7.1 Call and Return Instructions
....................................

As described earlier (*note* Stack Layout::), Guile’s calling convention
is that arguments are passed and values returned on the stack.

   For calls, both in tail position and in non-tail position, we require
that the procedure and the arguments already be shuffled into place
before the call instruction.  “Into place” for a tail call means that
the procedure should be in slot 0, relative to the ‘fp’, and the
arguments should follow.  For a non-tail call, if the procedure is in
‘fp’-relative slot N, the arguments should follow from slot N+1, and
there should be three free slots between N-1 and N-3 in which to save
the mRA, vRA, and ‘fp’.

   Returning values is similar.  Multiple-value returns should have
values already shuffled down to start from ‘fp’-relative slot 0 before
emitting ‘return-values’.

   In both calls and returns, the ‘sp’ is used to indicate to the callee
or caller the number of arguments or return values, respectively.  After
receiving return values, it is the caller’s responsibility to “restore
the frame” by resetting the ‘sp’ to its former value.

 -- Instruction: call f24:PROC x8:_ c24:NLOCALS
     Call a procedure.  PROC is the local corresponding to a procedure.
     The three values below PROC will be overwritten by the saved call
     frame data.  The new frame will have space for NLOCALS locals: one
     for the procedure, and the rest for the arguments which should
     already have been pushed on.

     When the call returns, execution proceeds with the next
     instruction.  There may be any number of values on the return
     stack; the precise number can be had by subtracting the address of
     PROC-1 from the post-call ‘sp’.

 -- Instruction: call-label f24:PROC x8:_ c24:NLOCALS l32:LABEL
     Call a procedure in the same compilation unit.

     This instruction is just like ‘call’, except that instead of
     dereferencing PROC to find the call target, the call target is
     known to be at LABEL, a signed 32-bit offset in 32-bit units from
     the current ‘ip’.  Since PROC is not dereferenced, it may be some
     other representation of the closure.

 -- Instruction: tail-call x24:_
     Tail-call a procedure.  Requires that the procedure and all of the
     arguments have already been shuffled into position, and that the
     frame has already been reset to the number of arguments to the
     call.

 -- Instruction: tail-call-label x24:_ l32:LABEL
     Tail-call a known procedure.  As ‘call’ is to ‘call-label’,
     ‘tail-call’ is to ‘tail-call-label’.

 -- Instruction: return-values x24:_
     Return a number of values from a call frame.  The return values
     should have already been shuffled down to a contiguous array
     starting at slot 0, and the frame already reset.

 -- Instruction: receive f12:DST f12:PROC x8:_ c24:NLOCALS
     Receive a single return value from a call whose procedure was in
     PROC, asserting that the call actually returned at least one value.
     Afterwards, resets the frame to NLOCALS locals.

 -- Instruction: receive-values f24:PROC b1:ALLOW-EXTRA? x7:_
          c24:NVALUES
     Receive a return of multiple values from a call whose procedure was
     in PROC.  If fewer than NVALUES values were returned, signal an
     error.  Unless ALLOW-EXTRA? is true, require that the number of
     return values equals NVALUES exactly.  After ‘receive-values’ has
     run, the values can be copied down via ‘mov’, or used in place.

### 9.3.7.2 Function Prologue Instructions
......................................

A function call in Guile is very cheap: the VM simply hands control to
the procedure.  The procedure itself is responsible for asserting that
it has been passed an appropriate number of arguments.  This strategy
allows arbitrarily complex argument parsing idioms to be developed,
without harming the common case.

   For example, only calls to keyword-argument procedures “pay” for the
cost of parsing keyword arguments.  (At the time of this writing,
calling procedures with keyword arguments is typically two to four times
as costly as calling procedures with a fixed set of arguments.)

 -- Instruction: assert-nargs-ee c24:EXPECTED
 -- Instruction: assert-nargs-ge c24:EXPECTED
 -- Instruction: assert-nargs-le c24:EXPECTED
     If the number of actual arguments is not ‘==’, ‘>=’, or ‘<=’
     EXPECTED, respectively, signal an error.

     The number of arguments is determined by subtracting the stack
     pointer from the frame pointer (‘fp - sp’).  *Note* Stack Layout::,
     for more details on stack frames.  Note that EXPECTED includes the
     procedure itself.

 -- Instruction: arguments<=? c24:EXPECTED
     Set the ‘LESS_THAN’, ‘EQUAL’, or ‘NONE’ comparison result values if
     the number of arguments is respectively less than, equal to, or
     greater than EXPECTED.

 -- Instruction: positional-arguments<=? c24:NREQ x8:_ c24:EXPECTED
     Set the ‘LESS_THAN’, ‘EQUAL’, or ‘NONE’ comparison result values if
     the number of positional arguments is respectively less than, equal
     to, or greater than EXPECTED.  The first NREQ arguments are
     positional arguments, as are the subsequent arguments that are not
     keywords.

   The ‘arguments<=?’ and ‘positional-arguments<=?’ instructions are
used to implement multiple arities, as in ‘case-lambda’.  *Note*
Case-lambda::, for more information.  *Note* Branch Instructions::, for
more on comparison results.

 -- Instruction: bind-kwargs c24:NREQ c8:FLAGS c24:NREQ-AND-OPT x8:_
          c24:NTOTAL n32:KW-OFFSET
     FLAGS is a bitfield, whose lowest bit is ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS, second
     bit is HAS-REST, and whose following six bits are unused.

     Find the last positional argument, and shuffle all the rest above
     NTOTAL.  Initialize the intervening locals to ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’.
     Then load the constant at KW-OFFSET words from the current IP, and
     use it and the ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS flag to bind keyword arguments.  If
     HAS-REST, collect all shuffled arguments into a list, and store it
     in NREQ-AND-OPT.  Finally, clear the arguments that we shuffled up.

     The parsing is driven by a keyword arguments association list,
     looked up using KW-OFFSET.  The alist is a list of pairs of the
     form ‘(KW . INDEX)’, mapping keyword arguments to their local slot
     indices.  Unless ‘allow-other-keys’ is set, the parser will signal
     an error if an unknown key is found.

     A macro-mega-instruction.

 -- Instruction: bind-optionals f24:NLOCALS
     Expand the current frame to have at least NLOCALS locals, filling
     in any fresh values with ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’.  If the frame has more
     than NLOCALS locals, it is left as it is.

 -- Instruction: bind-rest f24:DST
     Collect any arguments at or above DST into a list, and store that
     list at DST.

 -- Instruction: alloc-frame c24:NLOCALS
     Ensure that there is space on the stack for NLOCALS local
     variables.  The value of any new local is undefined.

 -- Instruction: reset-frame c24:NLOCALS
     Like ‘alloc-frame’, but doesn’t check that the stack is big enough,
     and doesn’t initialize values to ‘SCM_UNDEFINED’.  Used to reset
     the frame size to something less than the size that was previously
     set via alloc-frame.

 -- Instruction: assert-nargs-ee/locals c12:EXPECTED c12:NLOCALS
     Equivalent to a sequence of ‘assert-nargs-ee’ and ‘allocate-frame’.
     The number of locals reserved is EXPECTED + NLOCALS.

### 9.3.7.3 Shuffling Instructions
..............................

These instructions are used to move around values on the stack.

 -- Instruction: mov s12:DST s12:SRC
 -- Instruction: long-mov s24:DST x8:_ s24:SRC
     Copy a value from one local slot to another.

     As discussed previously, procedure arguments and local variables
     are allocated to local slots.  Guile’s compiler tries to avoid
     shuffling variables around to different slots, which often makes
     ‘mov’ instructions redundant.  However there are some cases in
     which shuffling is necessary, and in those cases, ‘mov’ is the
     thing to use.

 -- Instruction: long-fmov f24:DST x8:_ f24:SRC
     Copy a value from one local slot to another, but addressing slots
     relative to the ‘fp’ instead of the ‘sp’.  This is used when
     shuffling values into place after multiple-value returns.

 -- Instruction: push s24:SRC
     Bump the stack pointer by one word, and fill it with the value from
     slot SRC.  The offset to SRC is calculated before the stack pointer
     is adjusted.

   The ‘push’ instruction is used when another instruction is unable to
address an operand because the operand is encoded with fewer than 24
bits.  In that case, Guile’s assembler will transparently emit code that
temporarily pushes any needed operands onto the stack, emits the
original instruction to address those now-near variables, then shuffles
the result (if any) back into place.

 -- Instruction: pop s24:DST
     Pop the stack pointer, storing the value that was there in slot
     DST.  The offset to DST is calculated after the stack pointer is
     adjusted.

 -- Instruction: drop c24:COUNT
     Pop the stack pointer by COUNT words, discarding any values that
     were stored there.

 -- Instruction: shuffle-down f12:FROM f12:TO
     Shuffle down values from FROM to TO, reducing the frame size by
     FROM-TO slots.  Part of the internal implementation of
     ‘call-with-values’, ‘values’, and ‘apply’.

 -- Instruction: expand-apply-argument x24:_
     Take the last local in a frame and expand it out onto the stack, as
     for the last argument to ‘apply’.

### 9.3.7.4 Trampoline Instructions
...............................

Though most applicable objects in Guile are procedures implemented in
bytecode, not all are.  There are primitives, continuations, and other
procedure-like objects that have their own calling convention.  Instead
of adding special cases to the ‘call’ instruction, Guile wraps these
other applicable objects in VM trampoline procedures, then provides
special support for these objects in bytecode.

   Trampoline procedures are typically generated by Guile at runtime,
for example in response to a call to ‘scm_c_make_gsubr’.  As such, a
compiler probably shouldn’t emit code with these instructions.  However,
it’s still interesting to know how these things work, so we document
these trampoline instructions here.

 -- Instruction: subr-call c24:IDX
     Call a subr, passing all locals in this frame as arguments, and
     storing the results on the stack, ready to be returned.

 -- Instruction: foreign-call c12:CIF-IDX c12:PTR-IDX
     Call a foreign function.  Fetch the CIF and foreign pointer from
     CIF-IDX and PTR-IDX closure slots of the callee.  Arguments are
     taken from the stack, and results placed on the stack, ready to be
     returned.

 -- Instruction: builtin-ref s12:DST c12:IDX
     Load a builtin stub by index into DST.

### 9.3.7.5 Non-Local Control Flow Instructions
...........................................

 -- Instruction: capture-continuation s24:DST
     Capture the current continuation, and write it to DST.  Part of the
     implementation of ‘call/cc’.

 -- Instruction: continuation-call c24:CONTREGS
     Return to a continuation, nonlocally.  The arguments to the
     continuation are taken from the stack.  CONTREGS is a free variable
     containing the reified continuation.

 -- Instruction: abort x24:_
     Abort to a prompt handler.  The tag is expected in slot 1, and the
     rest of the values in the frame are returned to the prompt handler.
     This corresponds to a tail application of ‘abort-to-prompt’.

     If no prompt can be found in the dynamic environment with the given
     tag, an error is signalled.  Otherwise all arguments are passed to
     the prompt’s handler, along with the captured continuation, if
     necessary.

     If the prompt’s handler can be proven to not reference the captured
     continuation, no continuation is allocated.  This decision happens
     dynamically, at run-time; the general case is that the continuation
     may be captured, and thus resumed.  A reinstated continuation will
     have its arguments pushed on the stack from slot 0, as if from a
     multiple-value return, and control resumes in the caller.  Thus to
     the calling function, a call to ‘abort-to-prompt’ looks like any
     other function call.

 -- Instruction: compose-continuation c24:CONT
     Compose a partial continuation with the current continuation.  The
     arguments to the continuation are taken from the stack.  CONT is a
     free variable containing the reified continuation.

 -- Instruction: prompt s24:TAG b1:ESCAPE-ONLY? x7:_ f24:PROC-SLOT x8:_
          l24:HANDLER-OFFSET
     Push a new prompt on the dynamic stack, with a tag from TAG and a
     handler at HANDLER-OFFSET words from the current IP.

     If an abort is made to this prompt, control will jump to the
     handler.  The handler will expect a multiple-value return as if
     from a call with the procedure at PROC-SLOT, with the reified
     partial continuation as the first argument, followed by the values
     returned to the handler.  If control returns to the handler, the
     prompt is already popped off by the abort mechanism.  (Guile’s
     ‘prompt’ implements Felleisen’s “–F–” operator.)

     If ESCAPE-ONLY? is nonzero, the prompt will be marked as
     escape-only, which allows an abort to this prompt to avoid reifying
     the continuation.

     *Note* Prompts::, for more information on prompts.

 -- Instruction: throw s12:KEY s12:ARGS
     Raise an error by throwing to KEY and ARGS.  ARGS should be a list.

 -- Instruction: throw/value s24:VALUE n32:KEY-SUBR-AND-MESSAGE
 -- Instruction: throw/value+data s24:VALUE n32:KEY-SUBR-AND-MESSAGE
     Raise an error, indicating VAL as the bad value.
     KEY-SUBR-AND-MESSAGE should be a vector, where the first element is
     the symbol to which to throw, the second is the procedure in which
     to signal the error (a string) or ‘#f’, and the third is a format
     string for the message, with one template.  These instructions do
     not fall through.

     Both of these instructions throw to a key with four arguments: the
     procedure that indicates the error (or ‘#f’, the format string, a
     list with VALUE, and either ‘#f’ or the list with VALUE as the last
     argument respectively.

### 9.3.7.6 Instrumentation Instructions
....................................

 -- Instruction: instrument-entry x24__ n32:DATA
 -- Instruction: instrument-loop x24__ n32:DATA
     Increase execution counter for this function and potentially tier
     up to the next JIT level.  DATA is an offset to a structure
     recording execution counts and the next-level JIT code
     corresponding to this function.  The increment values are currently
     30 for ‘instrument-entry’ and 2 for ‘instrument-loop’.

     ‘instrument-entry’ will also run the apply hook, if VM hooks are
     enabled.

 -- Instruction: handle-interrupts x24:_
     Handle pending asynchronous interrupts (asyncs).  *Note* Asyncs::.
     The compiler inserts ‘handle-interrupts’ instructions before any
     call, return, or loop back-edge.

 -- Instruction: return-from-interrupt x24:_
     A special instruction to return from a call and also pop off the
     stack frame from the call.  Used when returning from asynchronous
     interrupts.

### 9.3.7.7 Intrinsic Call Instructions
...................................

Guile’s instruction set is low-level.  This is good because the separate
components of, say, a ‘vector-ref’ operation might be able to be
optimized out, leaving only the operations that need to be performed at
run-time.

   However some macro-operations may need to perform large amounts of
computation at run-time to handle all the edge cases, and whose
micro-operation components aren’t amenable to optimization.
Residualizing code for the entire macro-operation would lead to code
bloat with no benefit.

   In this kind of a case, Guile’s VM calls out to “intrinsics”:
run-time routines written in the host language (currently C, possibly
more in the future if Guile gains more run-time targets like
WebAssembly).  There is one instruction for each instrinsic prototype;
the intrinsic is specified by index in the instruction.

 -- Instruction: call-thread x24:_ c32:IDX
     Call the ‘void’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing the
     current ‘scm_thread*’ as the argument.

 -- Instruction: call-thread-scm s24:A c32:IDX
     Call the ‘void’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing the
     current ‘scm_thread*’ and the ‘scm’ local A as arguments.

 -- Instruction: call-thread-scm-scm s12:A s12:B c32:IDX
     Call the ‘void’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing the

 -- Instruction: call-scm-sz-u32 s12:A s12:B c32:IDX
     Call the ‘void’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing the
     locals A, B, and C as arguments.  A is a ‘scm’ value, while B and C
     are raw ‘u64’ values which fit into ‘size_t’ and ‘uint32_t’ types,
     respectively.

 -- Instruction: call-scm<-thread s24:DST c32:IDX
     Call the ‘SCM’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing the
     current ‘scm_thread*’ as the argument.  Place the result in DST.

 -- Instruction: call-scm<-u64 s12:DST s12:A c32:IDX
     Call the ‘SCM’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing ‘u64’
     local A as the argument.  Place the result in DST.

 -- Instruction: call-scm<-s64 s12:DST s12:A c32:IDX
     Call the ‘SCM’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing ‘s64’
     local A as the argument.  Place the result in DST.

 -- Instruction: call-scm<-scm s12:DST s12:A c32:IDX
     Call the ‘SCM’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing ‘scm’
     local A as the argument.  Place the result in DST.

 -- Instruction: call-u64<-scm s12:DST s12:A c32:IDX

 -- Instruction: call-s64<-scm s12:DST s12:A c32:IDX
     Call the ‘int64_t’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing
     ‘scm’ local A as the argument.  Place the ‘s64’ result in DST.

 -- Instruction: call-f64<-scm s12:DST s12:A c32:IDX
     Call the ‘double’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing
     ‘scm’ local A as the argument.  Place the ‘f64’ result in DST.

 -- Instruction: call-scm<-scm-scm s8:DST s8:A s8:B c32:IDX
     Call the ‘SCM’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing ‘scm’
     locals A and B as arguments.  Place the ‘scm’ result in DST.

 -- Instruction: call-scm<-scm-uimm s8:DST s8:A c8:B c32:IDX
     Call the ‘SCM’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing ‘scm’
     local A and ‘uint8_t’ immediate B as arguments.  Place the ‘scm’
     result in DST.

 -- Instruction: call-scm<-thread-scm s12:DST s12:A c32:IDX
     Call the ‘SCM’-returning instrinsic with index IDX, passing the
     current ‘scm_thread*’ and ‘scm’ local A as arguments.  Place the

     Intrinsics for use by the baseline compiler.  The usual strategy
     for CPS compilation is to expose the component parts of e.g.
     ‘vector-ref’ so that the compiler can learn from them and eliminate
     needless bits.  However in the non-optimizing baseline compiler,
     that’s just overhead, so we have some intrinsics that encapsulate
     all the usual type checks.

### 9.3.7.8 Constant Instructions
.............................

The following instructions load literal data into a program.  There are
two kinds.

   The first set of instructions loads immediate values.  These
instructions encode the immediate directly into the instruction stream.

 -- Instruction: make-immediate s8:DST zi16:LOW-BITS
     Make an immediate whose low bits are LOW-BITS, sign-extended.

 -- Instruction: make-short-immediate s8:DST i16:LOW-BITS
     Make an immediate whose low bits are LOW-BITS, and whose top bits
     are 0.

 -- Instruction: make-long-immediate s24:DST i32:LOW-BITS
     Make an immediate whose low bits are LOW-BITS, and whose top bits
     are 0.

 -- Instruction: make-long-long-immediate s24:DST a32:HIGH-BITS
          b32:LOW-BITS
     Make an immediate with HIGH-BITS and LOW-BITS.

   Non-immediate constant literals are referenced either directly or
indirectly.  For example, Guile knows at compile-time what the layout of
a string will be like, and arranges to embed that object directly in the
compiled image.  A reference to a string will use ‘make-non-immediate’
to treat a pointer into the compilation unit as a ‘scm’ value directly.

 -- Instruction: make-non-immediate s24:DST n32:OFFSET
     Load a pointer to statically allocated memory into DST.  The
     object’s memory will be found OFFSET 32-bit words away from the
     current instruction pointer.  Whether the object is mutable or
     immutable depends on where it was allocated by the compiler, and
     loaded by the loader.

   Sometimes you need to load up a code pointer into a register; for
this, use ‘load-label’.

 -- Instruction: load-label s24:DST l32:OFFSET
     Load a label OFFSET words away from the current ‘ip’ and write it
     to DST.  OFFSET is a signed 32-bit integer.

   Finally, Guile supports a number of unboxed data types, with their
associate constant loaders.

 -- Instruction: load-f64 s24:DST au32:HIGH-BITS au32:LOW-BITS
     Load a double-precision floating-point value formed by joining
     HIGH-BITS and LOW-BITS, and write it to DST.

 -- Instruction: load-u64 s24:DST au32:HIGH-BITS au32:LOW-BITS
     Load an unsigned 64-bit integer formed by joining HIGH-BITS and
     LOW-BITS, and write it to DST.

 -- Instruction: load-s64 s24:DST au32:HIGH-BITS au32:LOW-BITS
     Load a signed 64-bit integer formed by joining HIGH-BITS and
     LOW-BITS, and write it to DST.

   Some objects must be unique across the whole system.  This is the
case for symbols and keywords.  For these objects, Guile arranges to
initialize them when the compilation unit is loaded, storing them into a
slot in the image.  References go indirectly through that slot.
‘static-ref’ is used in this case.

 -- Instruction: static-ref s24:DST r32:OFFSET
     Load a SCM value into DST.  The SCM value will be fetched from
     memory, OFFSET 32-bit words away from the current instruction
     pointer.  OFFSET is a signed value.

   Fields of non-immediates may need to be fixed up at load time,
because we do not know in advance at what address they will be loaded.
This is the case, for example, for a pair containing a non-immediate in
one of its fields.  ‘static-set!’ and ‘static-patch!’ are used in these
situations.

 -- Instruction: static-set! s24:SRC lo32:OFFSET
     Store a SCM value into memory, OFFSET 32-bit words away from the
     current instruction pointer.  OFFSET is a signed value.

 -- Instruction: static-patch! x24:_ lo32:DST-OFFSET l32:SRC-OFFSET
     Patch a pointer at DST-OFFSET to point to SRC-OFFSET.  Both offsets
     are signed 32-bit values, indicating a memory address as a number
     of 32-bit words away from the current instruction pointer.

All offsets to branch instructions are 24-bit signed numbers, which
count 32-bit units.  This gives Guile effectively a 26-bit address range
for relative jumps.

 -- Instruction: j l24:OFFSET
     Add OFFSET to the current instruction pointer.

 -- Instruction: jl l24:OFFSET
     If the last comparison result is ‘LESS_THAN’, add OFFSET, a signed
     24-bit number, to the current instruction pointer.

 -- Instruction: je l24:OFFSET
     If the last comparison result is ‘EQUAL’, add OFFSET, a signed
     24-bit number, to the current instruction pointer.

 -- Instruction: jnl l24:OFFSET
     If the last comparison result is not ‘LESS_THAN’, add OFFSET, a
     signed 24-bit number, to the current instruction pointer.

 -- Instruction: jne l24:OFFSET
     If the last comparison result is not ‘EQUAL’, add OFFSET, a signed
     24-bit number, to the current instruction pointer.

 -- Instruction: jge l24:OFFSET
     If the last comparison result is ‘NONE’, add OFFSET, a signed
     24-bit number, to the current instruction pointer.

     This is intended for use after a ‘<?’ comparison, and is different
     from ‘jnl’ in the way it handles not-a-number (NaN) values: ‘<?’
     sets ‘INVALID’ instead of ‘NONE’ if either value is a NaN. For
     exact numbers, ‘jge’ is the same as ‘jnl’.

 -- Instruction: jnge l24:OFFSET
     If the last comparison result is not ‘NONE’, add OFFSET, a signed
     24-bit number, to the current instruction pointer.

     This is intended for use after a ‘<?’ comparison, and is different
     from ‘jl’ in the way it handles not-a-number (NaN) values: ‘<?’
     sets ‘INVALID’ instead of ‘NONE’ if either value is a NaN. For
     exact numbers, ‘jnge’ is the same as ‘jl’.

 -- Instruction: jtable s24:IDX v32:LENGTH [x8:_ l24:OFFSET]...
     Branch to an entry in a table, as in C’s ‘switch’ statement.  IDX
     is a ‘u64’ local indicating which entry to branch to.  The
     immediate LEN indicates the number of entries in the table, and
     should be greater than or equal to 1.  The last entry in the table
     is the "catch-all" entry.  The OFFSET...  values are signed 24-bit
     immediates (‘l24’ encoding), indicating a memory address as a
     number of 32-bit words away from the current instruction pointer.

### 9.3.7.16 Raw Memory Access Instructions
.......................................

Bytevector operations correspond closely to what the current hardware
can do, so it makes sense to inline them to VM instructions, providing a
clear path for eventual native compilation.  Without this, Scheme
programs would need other primitives for accessing raw bytes – but these
primitives are as good as any.

 -- Instruction: u8-ref s8:DST s8:PTR s8:IDX
 -- Instruction: s8-ref s8:DST s8:PTR s8:IDX
 -- Instruction: u16-ref s8:DST s8:PTR s8:IDX
 -- Instruction: s16-ref s8:DST s8:PTR s8:IDX
 -- Instruction: u32-ref s8:DST s8:PTR s8:IDX
 -- Instruction: s32-ref s8:DST s8:PTR s8:IDX
 -- Instruction: u64-ref s8:DST s8:PTR s8:IDX
 -- Instruction: s64-ref s8:DST s8:PTR s8:IDX
 -- Instruction: f32-ref s8:DST s8:PTR s8:IDX
 -- Instruction: f64-ref s8:DST s8:PTR s8:IDX

     Fetch the item at byte offset IDX from the raw pointer local PTR,
     and store it in DST.  All accesses use native endianness.

     The IDX value should be an unboxed unsigned 64-bit integer.

     The results are all written to the stack as unboxed values, either
     as signed 64-bit integers, unsigned 64-bit integers, or IEEE double
     floating point numbers.

 -- Instruction: u8-set! s8:PTR s8:IDX s8:VAL
 -- Instruction: s8-set! s8:PTR s8:IDX s8:VAL
 -- Instruction: u16-set! s8:PTR s8:IDX s8:VAL
 -- Instruction: s16-set! s8:PTR s8:IDX s8:VAL
 -- Instruction: u32-set! s8:PTR s8:IDX s8:VAL
 -- Instruction: s32-set! s8:PTR s8:IDX s8:VAL
 -- Instruction: u64-set! s8:PTR s8:IDX s8:VAL
 -- Instruction: s64-set! s8:PTR s8:IDX s8:VAL
 -- Instruction: f32-set! s8:PTR s8:IDX s8:VAL
 -- Instruction: f64-set! s8:PTR s8:IDX s8:VAL

     Store VAL into memory pointed to by raw pointer local PTR, at byte
     offset IDX.  Multibyte values are written using native endianness.

     The IDX value should be an unboxed unsigned 64-bit integer.

     The VAL values are all unboxed, either as signed 64-bit integers,
     unsigned 64-bit integers, or IEEE double floating point numbers.

9.3.8 Just-In-Time Native Code
------------------------------

The final piece of Guile’s virtual machine is a just-in-time (JIT)
compiler from bytecode instructions to native code.  It is faster to run
a function when its bytecode instructions are compiled to native code,
compared to having the VM interpret the instructions.

   The JIT compiler runs automatically, triggered by counters associated
with each function.  The counter increments when functions are called
and during each loop iteration.  Once a function’s counter passes a
certain value, the function gets JIT-compiled.  *Note* Instrumentation
Instructions::, for full details.

   Guile’s JIT compiler is what is known as a “template JIT”. This kind
of JIT is very simple: for each instruction in a function, the JIT
compiler will emit a generic sequence of machine code corresponding to
the instruction kind, specializing that generic template to reference
the specific operands of the instruction being compiled.

   The strength of a template JIT is principally that it is very fast at
emitting code.  It doesn’t need to do any time-consuming analysis on the
bytecode that it is compiling to do its job.

   A template JIT is also very predictable: the native code emitted by a
template JIT has the same performance characteristics of the
corresponding bytecode, only that it runs faster.  In theory you could
even generate the template-JIT machine code ahead of time, as it doesn’t
depend on any value seen at run-time.

   This predictability makes it possible to reason about the performance
of a system in terms of bytecode, knowing that the conclusions apply to
native code emitted by a template JIT.

   Because the machine code corresponding to an instruction always
performs the same tasks that the interpreter would do for that
instruction, bytecode and a template JIT also allows Guile programmers
to debug their programs in terms of the bytecode model.  When a Guile
programmer sets a breakpoint, Guile will disable the JIT for the thread
being debugged, falling back to the interpreter (which has the
corresponding code to run the hooks).  *Note* VM Hooks::.

   To emit native code, Guile uses a forked version of GNU Lightning.
This "Lightening" effort, spun out as a separate project, aims to build
on the back-end support from GNU Lightning, but adapting the API and
behavior of the library to match Guile’s needs.  This code is included
in the Guile source distribution.  For more information, see
<https://gitlab.com/wingo/lightening>.  As of mid-2019, Lightening
supports code generation for the x86-64, ia32, ARMv7, and AArch64
architectures.

   The weaknesses of a template JIT are two-fold.  Firstly, as a simple
back-end that has to run fast, a template JIT doesn’t have time to do
analysis that could help it generate better code, notably global
register allocation and instruction selection.

   However this is a minor weakness compared to the inability to perform
significant, speculative program transformations.  For example, Guile
could see that in an expression ‘(f x)’, that in practice F always
refers to the same function.  An advanced JIT compiler would
speculatively inline F into the call-site, along with a dynamic check to
make sure that the assertion still held.  But as a template JIT doesn’t
pay attention to values only known at run-time, it can’t make this
transformation.

   This limitation is mitigated in part by Guile’s robust ahead-of-time
compiler which can already perform significant optimizations when it can
prove they will always be valid, and its low-level bytecode which is
able to represent the effect of those optimizations (e.g.  elided
type-checks).  *Note* Compiling to the Virtual Machine::, for more on
Guile’s compiler.

   An ahead-of-time Scheme-to-bytecode strategy, complemented by a
template JIT, also particularly suits the somewhat static nature of
Scheme.  Scheme programmers often write code in a way that makes the
identity of free variable references lexically apparent.  For example,
the ‘(f x)’ expression could appear within a ‘(let ((f (lambda (x) (1+
x)))) ...)’ expression, or we could see that ‘f’ was imported from a
particular module where we know its binding.  Ahead-of-time compilation
techniques can work well for a language like Scheme where there is
little polymorphism and much first-order programming.  They do not work
so well for a language like JavaScript, which is highly mutable at
run-time and difficult to analyze due to method calls (which are
effectively higher-order calls).

   All that said, a template JIT works well for Guile at this point.
It’s only a few thousand lines of maintainable code, it speeds up Scheme
programs, and it keeps the bulk of the Guile Scheme implementation
written in Scheme itself.  The next step is probably to add
ahead-of-time native code emission to the back-end of the compiler
written in Scheme, to take advantage of the opportunity to do global
register allocation and instruction selection.  Once this is working, it
can allow Guile to experiment with speculative optimizations in Scheme
as well.  *Note* Extending the Compiler::, for more on future directions.

   Finally, note that there are a few environment variables that can be
tweaked to make JIT compilation happen sooner, later, or never.  *Note*
Environment Variables::, for more.

9.4 Compiling to the Virtual Machine
====================================

Compilers!  The word itself inspires excitement and awe, even among
experienced practitioners.  But a compiler is just a program: an
eminently hackable thing.  This section aims to describe Guile’s
compiler in such a way that interested Scheme hackers can feel
comfortable reading and extending it.

File: guile.info,  Node: Compiler Tower,  Next: The Scheme Compiler,  Up: Compiling to the Virtual Machine

9.4.1 Compiler Tower
--------------------

Guile’s compiler is quite simple – its _compilers_, to put it more
accurately.  Guile defines a tower of languages, starting at Scheme and
progressively simplifying down to languages that resemble the VM
instruction set (*note* Instruction Set::).

   Each language knows how to compile to the next, so each step is
simple and understandable.  Furthermore, this set of languages is not
hardcoded into Guile, so it is possible for the user to add new
high-level languages, new passes, or even different compilation targets.

   Languages are registered in the module, ‘(system base language)’:

     (use-modules (system base language))

   They are registered with the ‘define-language’ form.

 -- Scheme Syntax: define-language [#:name] [#:title] [#:reader]
          [#:printer] [#:parser=#f] [#:compilers='()]
          [#:decompilers='()] [#:evaluator=#f] [#:joiner=#f]
          [#:for-humans?=#t]
          [#:make-default-environment=make-fresh-user-module]
          [#:lowerer=#f] [#:analyzer=#f] [#:compiler-chooser=#f]
     Define a language.

     This syntax defines a ‘<language>’ object, bound to NAME in the
     current environment.  In addition, the language will be added to
     the global language set.  For example, this is the language
     definition for Scheme:

          (define-language scheme
            #:title  "Scheme"
            #:reader      (lambda (port env) ...)
            #:compilers   `((tree-il . ,compile-tree-il))
            #:decompilers `((tree-il . ,decompile-tree-il))
            #:evaluator (lambda (x module) (primitive-eval x))
            #:printer   write
            #:make-default-environment (lambda () ...))

   The interesting thing about having languages defined this way is that
they present a uniform interface to the read-eval-print loop.  This
allows the user to change the current language of the REPL:

     scheme@(guile-user)> ,language tree-il
     Happy hacking with Tree Intermediate Language!  To switch back, type `,L scheme'.
     tree-il@(guile-user)> ,L scheme
     Happy hacking with Scheme!  To switch back, type `,L tree-il'.
     scheme@(guile-user)>

   Languages can be looked up by name, as they were above.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lookup-language name
     Looks up a language named NAME, autoloading it if necessary.

     Languages are autoloaded by looking for a variable named NAME in a
     module named ‘(language NAME spec)’.

     The language object will be returned, or ‘#f’ if there does not
     exist a language with that name.

   When Guile goes to compile Scheme to bytecode, it will ask the Scheme
language to choose a compiler from Scheme to the next language on the
path from Scheme to bytecode.  Performing this computation recursively
builds transformations from a flexible chain of compilers.  The next
link will be obtained by invoking the language’s compiler chooser, or if
not present, from the language’s compilers field.

   A language can specify an analyzer, which is run before a term of
that language is lowered and compiled.  This is where compiler warnings
are issued.

   If a language specifies a lowerer, that procedure is called on
expressions before compilation.  This is where optimizations and
canonicalizations go.

   Finally a language’s compiler translates a lowered term from one
language to the next one in the chain.

   There is a notion of a “current language”, which is maintained in the
‘current-language’ parameter, defined in the core ‘(guile)’ module.
This language is normally Scheme, and may be rebound by the user.  The
run-time compilation interfaces (*note* Read/Load/Eval/Compile::) also
allow you to choose other source and target languages.

   The normal tower of languages when compiling Scheme goes like this:

   • Scheme
   • Tree Intermediate Language (Tree-IL)
   • Continuation-Passing Style (CPS)
   • Bytecode

   As discussed before (*note* Object File Format::), bytecode is in ELF
format, ready to be serialized to disk.  But when compiling Scheme at
run time, you want a Scheme value: for example, a compiled procedure.
For this reason, so as not to break the abstraction, Guile defines a
fake language at the bottom of the tower:

   • Value

   Compiling to ‘value’ loads the bytecode into a procedure, turning
cold bytes into warm code.

   Perhaps this strangeness can be explained by example: ‘compile-file’
defaults to compiling to bytecode, because it produces object code that
has to live in the barren world outside the Guile runtime; but ‘compile’
defaults to compiling to ‘value’, as its product re-enters the Guile
world.

   Indeed, the process of compilation can circulate through these
different worlds indefinitely, as shown by the following quine:

     ((lambda (x) ((compile x) x)) '(lambda (x) ((compile x) x)))

9.4.2 The Scheme Compiler
-------------------------

The job of the Scheme compiler is to expand all macros and all of Scheme
to its most primitive expressions.  The definition of “primitive
expression” is given by the inventory of constructs provided by Tree-IL,
the target language of the Scheme compiler: procedure calls,
conditionals, lexical references, and so on.  This is described more
fully in the next section.

   The tricky and amusing thing about the Scheme-to-Tree-IL compiler is
that it is completely implemented by the macro expander.  Since the
macro expander has to run over all of the source code already in order
to expand macros, it might as well do the analysis at the same time,
producing Tree-IL expressions directly.

   Because this compiler is actually the macro expander, it is
extensible.  Any macro which the user writes becomes part of the
compiler.

   The Scheme-to-Tree-IL expander may be invoked using the generic
‘compile’ procedure:

     (compile '(+ 1 2) #:from 'scheme #:to 'tree-il)
     ⇒
     #<tree-il (call (toplevel +) (const 1) (const 2))>

   ‘(compile FOO #:from 'scheme #:to 'tree-il)’ is entirely equivalent
to calling the macro expander as ‘(macroexpand FOO 'c '(compile load
eval))’.  *Note* Macro Expansion::.  ‘compile-tree-il’, the procedure
dispatched by ‘compile’ to ‘'tree-il’, is a small wrapper around
‘macroexpand’, to make it conform to the general form of compiler
procedures in Guile’s language tower.

   Compiler procedures take three arguments: an expression, an
environment, and a keyword list of options.  They return three values:
the compiled expression, the corresponding environment for the target
language, and a “continuation environment”.  The compiled expression and
environment will serve as input to the next language’s compiler.  The
“continuation environment” can be used to compile another expression
from the same source language within the same module.

   For example, you might compile the expression, ‘(define-module
(foo))’.  This will result in a Tree-IL expression and environment.  But
if you compiled a second expression, you would want to take into account
the compile-time effect of compiling the previous expression, which puts
the user in the ‘(foo)’ module.  That is the purpose of the
“continuation environment”; you would pass it as the environment when
compiling the subsequent expression.

   For Scheme, an environment is a module.  By default, the ‘compile’
and ‘compile-file’ procedures compile in a fresh module, such that
bindings and macros introduced by the expression being compiled are
isolated:

     (eq? (current-module) (compile '(current-module)))
     ⇒ #f

     (compile '(define hello 'world))
     (defined? 'hello)
     ⇒ #f

     (define / *)
     (eq? (compile '/) /)
     ⇒ #f

   Similarly, changes to the ‘current-reader’ fluid (*note*
‘current-reader’: Loading.) are isolated:

     (compile '(fluid-set! current-reader (lambda args 'fail)))
     (fluid-ref current-reader)
     ⇒ #f

   Nevertheless, having the compiler and “compilee” share the same name
space can be achieved by explicitly passing ‘(current-module)’ as the
compilation environment:

     (define hello 'world)
     (compile 'hello #:env (current-module))
     ⇒ world

9.4.3 Tree-IL
-------------

Tree Intermediate Language (Tree-IL) is a structured intermediate
language that is close in expressive power to Scheme.  It is an
expanded, pre-analyzed Scheme.

   Tree-IL is “structured” in the sense that its representation is based
on records, not S-expressions.  This gives a rigidity to the language
that ensures that compiling to a lower-level language only requires a
limited set of transformations.  For example, the Tree-IL type ‘<const>’
is a record type with two fields, ‘src’ and ‘exp’.  Instances of this
type are created via ‘make-const’.  Fields of this type are accessed via
the ‘const-src’ and ‘const-exp’ procedures.  There is also a predicate,
‘const?’.  *Note* Records::, for more information on records.

   All Tree-IL types have a ‘src’ slot, which holds source location
information for the expression.  This information, if present, will be
residualized into the compiled object code, allowing backtraces to show
source information.  The format of ‘src’ is the same as that returned by
Guile’s ‘source-properties’ function.  *Note* Source Properties::, for
more information.

   Although Tree-IL objects are represented internally using records,
there is also an equivalent S-expression external representation for
each kind of Tree-IL. For example, the S-expression representation of
‘#<const src: #f exp: 3>’ expression would be:

     (const 3)

   Users may program with this format directly at the REPL:

     scheme@(guile-user)> ,language tree-il
     Happy hacking with Tree Intermediate Language!  To switch back, type `,L scheme'.
     tree-il@(guile-user)> (call (primitive +) (const 32) (const 10))
     ⇒ 42

   The ‘src’ fields are left out of the external representation.

   One may create Tree-IL objects from their external representations
via calling ‘parse-tree-il’, the reader for Tree-IL. If any source
information is attached to the input S-expression, it will be propagated
to the resulting Tree-IL expressions.  This is probably the easiest way
to compile to Tree-IL: just make the appropriate external
representations in S-expression format, and let ‘parse-tree-il’ take
care of the rest.

 -- Scheme Variable: <void> src
 -- External Representation: (void)
     An empty expression.  In practice, equivalent to Scheme’s ‘(if #f
     #f)’.

 -- Scheme Variable: <const> src exp
 -- External Representation: (const EXP)
     A constant.

 -- Scheme Variable: <primitive-ref> src name
 -- External Representation: (primitive NAME)
     A reference to a “primitive”.  A primitive is a procedure that,
     when compiled, may be open-coded.  For example, ‘cons’ is usually
     recognized as a primitive, so that it compiles down to a single
     instruction.

     Compilation of Tree-IL usually begins with a pass that resolves
     some ‘<module-ref>’ and ‘<toplevel-ref>’ expressions to
     ‘<primitive-ref>’ expressions.  The actual compilation pass has
     special cases for calls to certain primitives, like ‘apply’ or
     ‘cons’.

 -- Scheme Variable: <lexical-ref> src name gensym
 -- External Representation: (lexical NAME GENSYM)
     A reference to a lexically-bound variable.  The NAME is the
     original name of the variable in the source program.  GENSYM is a
     unique identifier for this variable.

 -- Scheme Variable: <lexical-set> src name gensym exp
 -- External Representation: (set! (lexical NAME GENSYM) EXP)
     Sets a lexically-bound variable.

 -- Scheme Variable: <module-ref> src mod name public?
 -- External Representation: (@ MOD NAME)
 -- External Representation: (@@ MOD NAME)
     A reference to a variable in a specific module.  MOD should be the
     name of the module, e.g. ‘(guile-user)’.

     If PUBLIC? is true, the variable named NAME will be looked up in
     MOD’s public interface, and serialized with ‘@’; otherwise it will
     be looked up among the module’s private bindings, and is serialized
     with ‘@@’.

 -- Scheme Variable: <module-set> src mod name public? exp
 -- External Representation: (set! (@ MOD NAME) EXP)
 -- External Representation: (set! (@@ MOD NAME) EXP)
     Sets a variable in a specific module.

 -- Scheme Variable: <toplevel-ref> src name
 -- External Representation: (toplevel NAME)
     References a variable from the current procedure’s module.

 -- Scheme Variable: <toplevel-set> src name exp
 -- External Representation: (set! (toplevel NAME) EXP)
     Sets a variable in the current procedure’s module.

 -- Scheme Variable: <toplevel-define> src name exp
 -- External Representation: (define NAME EXP)
     Defines a new top-level variable in the current procedure’s module.

 -- Scheme Variable: <conditional> src test then else
 -- External Representation: (if TEST THEN ELSE)
     A conditional.  Note that ELSE is not optional.

 -- Scheme Variable: <call> src proc args
 -- External Representation: (call PROC . ARGS)
     A procedure call.

 -- Scheme Variable: <primcall> src name args
 -- External Representation: (primcall NAME . ARGS)
     A call to a primitive.  Equivalent to ‘(call (primitive NAME) .
     ARGS)’.  This construct is often more convenient to generate and
     analyze than ‘<call>’.

     As part of the compilation process, instances of ‘(call (primitive
     NAME) . ARGS)’ are transformed into primcalls.

 -- Scheme Variable: <seq> src head tail
 -- External Representation: (seq HEAD TAIL)
     A sequence.  The semantics is that HEAD is evaluated first, and any
     resulting values are ignored.  Then TAIL is evaluated, in tail
     position.

 -- Scheme Variable: <lambda> src meta body
 -- External Representation: (lambda META BODY)
     A closure.  META is an association list of properties for the
     procedure.  BODY is a single Tree-IL expression of type
     ‘<lambda-case>’.  As the ‘<lambda-case>’ clause can chain to an
     alternate clause, this makes Tree-IL’s ‘<lambda>’ have the
     expressiveness of Scheme’s ‘case-lambda’.

 -- Scheme Variable: <lambda-case> req opt rest kw inits gensyms body
          alternate
 -- External Representation: (lambda-case ((REQ OPT REST KW INITS
          GENSYMS) BODY) [ALTERNATE])
     One clause of a ‘case-lambda’.  A ‘lambda’ expression in Scheme is
     treated as a ‘case-lambda’ with one clause.

     REQ is a list of the procedure’s required arguments, as symbols.
     OPT is a list of the optional arguments, or ‘#f’ if there are no
     optional arguments.  REST is the name of the rest argument, or
     ‘#f’.

     KW is a list of the form, ‘(ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS? (KEYWORD NAME VAR)
     ...)’, where KEYWORD is the keyword corresponding to the argument
     named NAME, and whose corresponding gensym is VAR, or ‘#f’ if there
     are no keyword arguments.  INITS are tree-il expressions
     corresponding to all of the optional and keyword arguments,
     evaluated to bind variables whose value is not supplied by the
     procedure caller.  Each INIT expression is evaluated in the lexical
     context of previously bound variables, from left to right.

     GENSYMS is a list of gensyms corresponding to all arguments: first
     all of the required arguments, then the optional arguments if any,
     then the rest argument if any, then all of the keyword arguments.

     BODY is the body of the clause.  If the procedure is called with an
     appropriate number of arguments, BODY is evaluated in tail
     position.  Otherwise, if there is an ALTERNATE, it should be a
     ‘<lambda-case>’ expression, representing the next clause to try.
     If there is no ALTERNATE, a wrong-number-of-arguments error is
     signaled.

 -- Scheme Variable: <let> src names gensyms vals exp
 -- External Representation: (let NAMES GENSYMS VALS EXP)
     Lexical binding, like Scheme’s ‘let’.  NAMES are the original
     binding names, GENSYMS are gensyms corresponding to the NAMES, and
     VALS are Tree-IL expressions for the values.  EXP is a single
     Tree-IL expression.

 -- Scheme Variable: <letrec> in-order? src names gensyms vals exp
 -- External Representation: (letrec NAMES GENSYMS VALS EXP)
 -- External Representation: (letrec* NAMES GENSYMS VALS EXP)
     A version of ‘<let>’ that creates recursive bindings, like Scheme’s
     ‘letrec’, or ‘letrec*’ if IN-ORDER? is true.

 -- Scheme Variable: <prompt> escape-only? tag body handler
 -- External Representation: (prompt ESCAPE-ONLY? TAG BODY HANDLER)
     A dynamic prompt.  Instates a prompt named TAG, an expression,
     during the dynamic extent of the execution of BODY, also an
     expression.  If an abort occurs to this prompt, control will be
     passed to HANDLER, also an expression, which should be a procedure.
     The first argument to the handler procedure will be the captured
     continuation, followed by all of the values passed to the abort.
     If ESCAPE-ONLY? is true, the handler should be a ‘<lambda>’ with a
     single ‘<lambda-case>’ body expression with no optional or keyword
     arguments, and no alternate, and whose first argument is
     unreferenced.  *Note* Prompts::, for more information.

 -- Scheme Variable: <abort> tag args tail
 -- External Representation: (abort TAG ARGS TAIL)
     An abort to the nearest prompt with the name TAG, an expression.
     ARGS should be a list of expressions to pass to the prompt’s
     handler, and TAIL should be an expression that will evaluate to a
     list of additional arguments.  An abort will save the partial
     continuation, which may later be reinstated, resulting in the
     ‘<abort>’ expression evaluating to some number of values.

   There are two Tree-IL constructs that are not normally produced by
higher-level compilers, but instead are generated during the
source-to-source optimization and analysis passes that the Tree-IL
compiler does.  Users should not generate these expressions directly,
unless they feel very clever, as the default analysis pass will generate
them as necessary.

 -- Scheme Variable: <let-values> src names gensyms exp body
 -- External Representation: (let-values NAMES GENSYMS EXP BODY)
     Like Scheme’s ‘receive’ – binds the values returned by evaluating
     ‘exp’ to the ‘lambda’-like bindings described by GENSYMS.  That is
     to say, GENSYMS may be an improper list.

     ‘<let-values>’ is an optimization of a ‘<call>’ to the primitive,
     ‘call-with-values’.

 -- Scheme Variable: <fix> src names gensyms vals body
 -- External Representation: (fix NAMES GENSYMS VALS BODY)
     Like ‘<letrec>’, but only for VALS that are unset ‘lambda’
     expressions.

     ‘fix’ is an optimization of ‘letrec’ (and ‘let’).

   Tree-IL is a convenient compilation target from source languages.  It
can be convenient as a medium for optimization, though CPS is usually
better.  The strength of Tree-IL is that it does not fix order of
evaluation, so it makes some code motion a bit easier.

   Optimization passes performed on Tree-IL currently include:

   • Open-coding (turning toplevel-refs into primitive-refs, and calls
     to primitives to primcalls)
   • Partial evaluation (comprising inlining, copy propagation, and
     constant folding)

9.4.4 Continuation-Passing Style
--------------------------------

Continuation-passing style (CPS) is Guile’s principal intermediate
language, bridging the gap between languages for people and languages
for machines.  CPS gives a name to every part of a program: every
control point, and every intermediate value.  This makes it an excellent
medium for reasoning about programs, which is the principal job of a
compiler.

### 9.4.4.1 An Introduction to CPS
..............................

Consider the following Scheme expression:

     (begin
       (display "The sum of 32 and 10 is: ")
       (display 42)
       (newline))

   Let us identify all of the sub-expressions in this expression,
annotating them with unique labels:

     (begin
       (display "The sum of 32 and 10 is: ")
       |k1      k2
       k0
       (display 42)
       |k4      k5
       k3
       (newline))
       |k7
       k6

   Each of these labels identifies a point in a program.  One label may
be the continuation of another label.  For example, the continuation of
‘k7’ is ‘k6’.  This is because after evaluating the value of ‘newline’,
performed by the expression labelled ‘k7’, we continue to apply it in
‘k6’.

   Which expression has ‘k0’ as its continuation?  It is either the
expression labelled ‘k1’ or the expression labelled ‘k2’.  Scheme does
not have a fixed order of evaluation of arguments, though it does
guarantee that they are evaluated in some order.  Unlike general Scheme,
continuation-passing style makes evaluation order explicit.  In Guile,
this choice is made by the higher-level language compilers.

   Let us assume a left-to-right evaluation order.  In that case the
continuation of ‘k1’ is ‘k2’, and the continuation of ‘k2’ is ‘k0’.

   With this example established, we are ready to give an example of CPS
in Scheme:

     (lambda (ktail)
       (let ((k1 (lambda ()
                   (let ((k2 (lambda (proc)
                               (let ((k0 (lambda (arg0)
                                           (proc k4 arg0))))
                                 (k0 "The sum of 32 and 10 is: ")))))
                     (k2 display))))
             (k4 (lambda _
                   (let ((k5 (lambda (proc)
                               (let ((k3 (lambda (arg0)
                                           (proc k7 arg0))))
                                 (k3 42)))))
                     (k5 display))))
             (k7 (lambda _
                   (let ((k6 (lambda (proc)
                               (proc ktail))))
                     (k6 newline)))))
         (k1))

   Holy code explosion, Batman!  What’s with all the lambdas?  Indeed,
CPS is by nature much more verbose than “direct-style” intermediate
languages like Tree-IL. At the same time, CPS is simpler than full
Scheme, because it makes things more explicit.

   In the original program, the expression labelled ‘k0’ is in effect
context.  Any values it returns are ignored.  In Scheme, this fact is
implicit.  In CPS, we can see it explicitly by noting that its
continuation, ‘k4’, takes any number of values and ignores them.
Compare this to ‘k2’, which takes a single value; in this way we can say
that ‘k1’ is in a “value” context.  Likewise ‘k6’ is in tail context
with respect to the expression as a whole, because its continuation is
the tail continuation, ‘ktail’.  CPS makes these details manifest, and
gives them names.

### 9.4.4.2 CPS in Guile
....................

Guile’s CPS language is composed of “continuations”.  A continuation is
a labelled program point.  If you are used to traditional compilers,
think of a continuation as a trivial basic block.  A program is a “soup”
of continuations, represented as a map from labels to continuations.

   Like basic blocks, each continuation belongs to only one function.
Some continuations are special, like the continuation corresponding to a
function’s entry point, or the continuation that represents the tail of
a function.  Others contain a “term”.  A term contains an “expression”,
which evaluates to zero or more values.  The term also records the
continuation to which it will pass its values.  Some terms, like
conditional branches, may continue to one of a number of continuations.

   Continuation labels are small integers.  This makes it easy to sort
them and to group them into sets.  Whenever a term refers to a
continuation, it does so by name, simply recording the label of the
continuation.  Continuation labels are unique among the set of labels in
a program.

   Variables are also named by small integers.  Variable names are
unique among the set of variables in a program.

   For example, a simple continuation that receives two values and adds
them together can be matched like this, using the ‘match’ form from
‘(ice-9 match)’:

     (match cont
       (($ $kargs (x-name y-name) (x-var y-var)
           ($ $continue k src ($ $primcall '+ #f (x-var y-var))))
        (format #t "Add ~a and ~a and pass the result to label ~a"
                x-var y-var k)))

   Here we see the most common kind of continuation, ‘$kargs’, which
binds some number of values to variables and then evaluates a term.

 -- CPS Continuation: $kargs names vars term
     Bind the incoming values to the variables VARS, with original names
     NAMES, and then evaluate TERM.

   The NAMES of a ‘$kargs’ are just for debugging, and will end up
residualized in the object file for use by the debugger.

   The TERM in a ‘$kargs’ is always a ‘$continue’, which evaluates an
expression and continues to a continuation.

 -- CPS Term: $continue k src exp
     Evaluate the expression EXP and pass the resulting values (if any)
     to the continuation labelled K.  The source information associated
     with the expression may be found in SRC, which is either an alist
     as in ‘source-properties’ or is ‘#f’ if there is no associated
     source.

   There are a number of expression kinds.  Above you see an example of
‘$primcall’.

 -- CPS Expression: $primcall name param args
     Perform the primitive operation identified by ‘name’, a well-known
     symbol, passing it the arguments ARGS, and pass all resulting
     values to the continuation.

     PARAM is a constant parameter whose interpretation is up to the
     primcall in question.  Usually it’s ‘#f’ but for a primcall that
     might need some compile-time constant information – such as
     ‘add/immediate’, which adds a constant number to a value – the
     parameter holds this information.

     The set of available primitives includes many primitives known to
     Tree-IL and then some more; see the source code for details.  Note
     that some Tree-IL primcalls need to be converted to a sequence of
     lower-level CPS primcalls.  Again, see ‘(language tree-il
     compile-cps)’ for full details.

   The variables that are used by ‘$primcall’, or indeed by any
expression, must be defined before the expression is evaluated.  An
equivalent way of saying this is that predecessor ‘$kargs’
continuation(s) that bind the variables(s) used by the expression must
“dominate” the continuation that uses the expression: definitions
dominate uses.  This condition is trivially satisfied in our example
above, but in general to determine the set of variables that are in
“scope” for a given term, you need to do a flow analysis to see what
continuations dominate a term.  The variables that are in scope are
those variables defined by the continuations that dominate a term.

   Here is an inventory of the kinds of expressions in Guile’s CPS
language, besides ‘$primcall’ which has already been described.  Recall
that all expressions are wrapped in a ‘$continue’ term which specifies
their continuation.

 -- CPS Expression: $const val
     Continue with the constant value VAL.

 -- CPS Expression: $prim name
     Continue with the procedure that implements the primitive operation
     named by NAME.

 -- CPS Expression: $call proc args
     Call PROC with the arguments ARGS, and pass all values to the
     continuation.  PROC and the elements of the ARGS list should all be
     variable names.  The continuation identified by the term’s K should
     be a ‘$kreceive’ or a ‘$ktail’ instance.

 -- CPS Expression: $values args
     Pass the values named by the list ARGS to the continuation.

 -- CPS Expression: $prompt escape? tag handler

   There are two sub-languages of CPS, “higher-order CPS” and
“first-order CPS”. The difference is that in higher-order CPS, there are
‘$fun’ and ‘$rec’ expressions that bind functions or mutually-recursive
functions in the implicit scope of their use sites.  Guile transforms
higher-order CPS into first-order CPS by “closure conversion”, which
chooses representations for all closures and which arranges to access
free variables through the implicit closure parameter that is passed to
every function call.

 -- CPS Expression: $fun body
     Continue with a procedure.  BODY names the entry point of the
     function, which should be a ‘$kfun’.  This expression kind is only
     valid in higher-order CPS, which is the CPS language before closure
     conversion.

 -- CPS Expression: $rec names vars funs
     Continue with a set of mutually recursive procedures denoted by
     NAMES, VARS, and FUNS.  NAMES is a list of symbols, VARS is a list
     of variable names (unique integers), and FUNS is a list of ‘$fun’
     values.  Note that the ‘$kargs’ continuation should also define
     NAMES/VARS bindings.

   The contification pass will attempt to transform the functions
declared in a ‘$rec’ into local continuations.  Any remaining ‘$fun’
instances are later removed by the closure conversion pass.  If the
function has no free variables, it gets allocated as a constant.

 -- CPS Expression: $const-fun label
     A constant which is a function whose entry point is LABEL.  As a
     constant, instances of ‘$const-fun’ with the same LABEL will not
     allocate; the space for the function is allocated as part of the
     compilation unit.

     In practice, ‘$const-fun’ expressions are reified by CPS-conversion
     for functions whose call sites are not all visible within the
     compilation unit and which have no free variables.  This expression
     kind is part of first-order CPS.

   Otherwise, if the closure has free variables, it will be allocated at
its definition site via an ‘allocate-words’ primcall and its free
variables initialized there.  The code pointer in the closure is
initialized from a ‘$code’ expression.

 -- CPS Expression: $code label
     Continue with the value of LABEL, which should denote some ‘$kfun’
     continuation in the program.  Used when initializing the code
     pointer of closure objects.

   However, If the closure can be proven to never escape its scope then
other lighter-weight representations can be chosen.  Additionally, if
all call sites are known, closure conversion will hard-wire the calls by
lowering ‘$call’ to ‘$callk’.

 -- CPS Expression: $callk label proc args
     Like ‘$call’, but for the case where the call target is known to be
     in the same compilation unit.  LABEL should denote some ‘$kfun’
     continuation in the program.  In this case the PROC is simply an
     additional argument, since it is not used to determine the call
     target at run-time.

   To summarize: a ‘$continue’ is a CPS term that continues to a single
label.  But there are other kinds of CPS terms that can continue to a
different number of labels: ‘$branch’, ‘$switch’, ‘$throw’, and
‘$prompt’.

 -- CPS Term: $branch kf kt src op param args
     Evaluate the branching primcall OP, with arguments ARGS and
     constant parameter PARAM, and continue to KT with zero values if
     the test is true.  Otherwise continue to KF.

     The ‘$branch’ term is like a ‘$continue’ term with a ‘$primcall’
     expression, except that instead of binding a value and continuing
     to a single label, the result of the test is not bound but instead
     used to choose the continuation label.

     The set of operations (corresponding to OP values) that are valid
     in a $BRANCH is limited.  In the general case, bind the result of a
     test expression to a variable, and then make a ‘$branch’ on a
     ‘true?’ op referencing that variable.  The optimizer should inline
     the branch if possible.

 -- CPS Term: $switch kf kt* src arg
     Continue to a label in the list K* according to the index argument
     ARG, or to the default continuation KF if ARG is greater than or
     equal to the length K*.  The index variable ARG is an unboxed,
     unsigned 64-bit value.

     The ‘$switch’ term is like C’s ‘switch’ statement.  The compiler to
     CPS can generate a ‘$switch’ term directly, if the source language
     has such a concept, or it can rely on the CPS optimizer to turn
     appropriate chains of ‘$branch’ statements to ‘$switch’ instances,
     which is what the Scheme compiler does.

 -- CPS Term: $throw src op param args
     Throw a non-resumable exception.  Throw terms do not continue at
     all.  The usual value of OP is ‘throw’, with two arguments KEY and
     ARGS.  There are also some specific primcalls that compile to the
     VM ‘throw/value’ and ‘throw/value+data’ instructions; see the code
     for full details.

     The advantage of having ‘$throw’ as a term is that, because it does
     not continue, this allows the optimizer to gather more information
     from type predicates.  For example, if the predicate is ‘char?’ and
     the KF continues to a throw, the set of labels dominated by KT is
     larger than if the throw notationally continued to some label that
     would never be reached by the throw.

 -- CPS Term: $prompt k kh src escape? tag
     Push a prompt on the stack identified by the variable name TAG,
     which may be escape-only if ESCAPE? is true, and continue to KH
     with zero values.  If the body aborts to this prompt, control will
     proceed at the continuation labelled KH, which should be a
     ‘$kreceive’ continuation.  Prompts are later popped by ‘pop-prompt’
     primcalls.

   At this point we have described terms, expressions, and the most
common kind of continuation, ‘$kargs’.  ‘$kargs’ is used when the
predecessors of the continuation can be instructed to pass the values
where the continuation wants them.  For example, if a ‘$kargs’
continuation K binds a variable V, and the compiler decides to allocate
V to slot 6, all predecessors of K should put the value for V in slot 6
before jumping to K.  One situation in which this isn’t possible is
receiving values from function calls.  Guile has a calling convention
for functions which currently places return values on the stack.  A
continuation of a call must check that the number of values returned
from a function matches the expected number of values, and then must
shuffle or collect those values to named variables.  ‘$kreceive’ denotes
this kind of continuation.

 -- CPS Continuation: $kreceive arity k
     Receive values on the stack.  Parse them according to ARITY, and
     then proceed with the parsed values to the ‘$kargs’ continuation
     labelled K.  As a limitation specific to ‘$kreceive’, ARITY may
     only contain required and rest arguments.

   ‘$arity’ is a helper data structure used by ‘$kreceive’ and also by
‘$kclause’, described below.

 -- CPS Data: $arity req opt rest kw allow-other-keys?
     A data type declaring an arity.  REQ and OPT are lists of source
     names of required and optional arguments, respectively.  REST is
     either the source name of the rest variable, or ‘#f’ if this arity
     does not accept additional values.  KW is a list of the form
     ‘((KEYWORD NAME VAR) ...)’, describing the keyword arguments.
     ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS? is true if other keyword arguments are allowed
     and false otherwise.

     Note that all of these names with the exception of the VARs in the
     KW list are source names, not unique variable names.

   Additionally, there are three specific kinds of continuations that
are only used in function entries.

 -- CPS Continuation: $kfun src meta self tail clause
     Declare a function entry.  SRC is the source information for the
     procedure declaration, and META is the metadata alist as described
     above in Tree-IL’s ‘<lambda>’.  SELF is a variable bound to the
     procedure being called, and which may be used for self-references.
     TAIL is the label of the ‘$ktail’ for this function, corresponding
     to the function’s tail continuation.  CLAUSE is the label of the
     first ‘$kclause’ for the first ‘case-lambda’ clause in the
     function, or otherwise ‘#f’.

 -- CPS Continuation: $ktail
     A tail continuation.

 -- CPS Continuation: $kclause arity cont alternate
     A clause of a function with a given arity.  Applications of a
     function with a compatible set of actual arguments will continue to
     the continuation labelled CONT, a ‘$kargs’ instance representing
     the clause body.  If the arguments are incompatible, control
     proceeds to ALTERNATE, which is a ‘$kclause’ for the next clause,
     or ‘#f’ if there is no next clause.

### 9.4.4.3 Building CPS
....................

Unlike Tree-IL, the CPS language is built to be constructed and
deconstructed with abstract macros instead of via procedural
constructors or accessors, or instead of S-expression matching.

   Deconstruction and matching is handled adequately by the ‘match’ form
from ‘(ice-9 match)’.  *Note* Pattern Matching::.  Construction is
handled by a set of mutually builder macros: ‘build-term’, ‘build-cont’,
and ‘build-exp’.

   In the following interface definitions, consider ‘term’ and ‘exp’ to
be built by ‘build-term’ or ‘build-exp’, respectively.  Consider any
other name to be evaluated as a Scheme expression.  Many of these forms
recognize ‘unquote’ in some contexts, to splice in a previously-built
value; see the specifications below for full details.

 -- Scheme Syntax: build-term ,val
 -- Scheme Syntax: build-term ($continue k src exp)
 -- Scheme Syntax: build-exp ,val
 -- Scheme Syntax: build-exp ($const val)
 -- Scheme Syntax: build-exp ($prim name)
 -- Scheme Syntax: build-exp ($fun kentry)
 -- Scheme Syntax: build-exp ($const-fun kentry)

 -- Scheme Syntax: build-cont ($kreceive req rest kargs)
 -- Scheme Syntax: build-cont ($kfun src meta self ktail kclause)
 -- Scheme Syntax: build-cont ($kclause ,arity kbody kalt)
 -- Scheme Syntax: build-cont ($kclause (req opt rest kw aok?) kbody)
     Construct a CPS term, expression, or continuation.

   There are a few more miscellaneous interfaces as well.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-arity req opt rest kw allow-other-keywords?
     A procedural constructor for ‘$arity’ objects.

 -- Scheme Syntax: rewrite-term val (pat term) ...
 -- Scheme Syntax: rewrite-exp val (pat exp) ...
 -- Scheme Syntax: rewrite-cont val (pat cont) ...
     Match VAL against the series of patterns PAT..., using ‘match’.
     The body of the matching clause should be a template in the syntax
     of ‘build-term’, ‘build-exp’, or ‘build-cont’, respectively.



File: guile.info,  Node: CPS Soup,  Next: Compiling CPS,  Prev: Building CPS,  Up: Continuation-Passing Style

### 9.4.4.4 CPS Soup
................

We describe programs in Guile’s CPS language as being a kind of “soup”
because all continuations in the program are mixed into the same “pot”,
so to speak, without explicit markers as to what function or scope a
continuation is in.  A program in CPS is a map from continuation labels
to continuation values.  As discussed in the introduction, a
continuation label is an integer.  No label may be negative.

   As a matter of convention, label 0 should map to the ‘$kfun’
continuation of the entry to the program, which should be a function of
no arguments.  The body of a function consists of the labelled
continuations that are reachable from the function entry.  A program can
refer to other functions, either via ‘$fun’ and ‘$rec’ in higher-order
CPS, or via ‘$const-fun’, ‘$callk’, and allocated closures in
first-order CPS. The program logically contains all continuations of all
functions reachable from the entry function.  A compiler pass may leave
unreachable continuations in a program; subsequent compiler passes
should ensure that their transformations and analyses only take
reachable continuations into account.  It’s OK though if transformation
runs over all continuations if including the unreachable continuations
has no effect on the transformations on the live continuations.

   The “soup” itself is implemented as an “intmap”, a functional
array-mapped trie specialized for integer keys.  Intmaps associate
integers with values of any kind.  Currently intmaps are a private data
structure only used by the CPS phase of the compiler.  To work with
intmaps, load the ‘(language cps intmap)’ module:

     (use-modules (language cps intmap))

   Intmaps are functional data structures, so there is no constructor as
such: one can simply start with the empty intmap and add entries to it.

     (intmap? empty-intmap) ⇒ #t
     (define x (intmap-add empty-intmap 42 "hi"))
     (intmap? x) ⇒ #t
     (intmap-ref x 42) ⇒ "hi"
     (intmap-ref x 43) ⇒ error: 43 not present
     (intmap-ref x 43 (lambda (k) "yo!")) ⇒ "yo"
     (intmap-add x 42 "hej") ⇒ error: 42 already present

   ‘intmap-ref’ and ‘intmap-add’ are the core of the intmap interface.
There is also ‘intmap-replace’, which replaces the value associated with
a given key, requiring that the key was present already, and
‘intmap-remove’, which removes a key from an intmap.

   Intmaps have a tree-like structure that is well-suited to set
operations such as union and intersection, so there are also the binary
‘intmap-union’ and ‘intmap-intersect’ procedures.  If the result is
equivalent to either argument, that argument is returned as-is; in that
way, one can detect whether the set operation produced a new result
simply by checking with ‘eq?’.  This makes intmaps useful when computing
fixed points.

   If a key is present in both intmaps and the associated values are not
the same in the sense of ‘eq?’, the resulting value is determined by a
“meet” procedure, which is the optional last argument to ‘intmap-union’,
‘intmap-intersect’, and also to ‘intmap-add’, ‘intmap-replace’, and
similar functions.  The meet procedure will be called with the two
values and should return the intersected or unioned value in some
domain-specific way.  If no meet procedure is given, the default meet
procedure will raise an error.

   To traverse over the set of values in an intmap, there are the
‘intmap-next’ and ‘intmap-prev’ procedures.  For example, if intmap X
has one entry mapping 42 to some value, we would have:

     (intmap-next x) ⇒ 42
     (intmap-next x 0) ⇒ 42
     (intmap-next x 42) ⇒ 42
     (intmap-next x 43) ⇒ #f
     (intmap-prev x) ⇒ 42
     (intmap-prev x 42) ⇒ 42
     (intmap-prev x 41) ⇒ #f

   There is also the ‘intmap-fold’ procedure, which folds over keys and
values in the intmap from lowest to highest value, and
‘intmap-fold-right’ which does so in the opposite direction.  These
procedures may take up to 3 seed values.  The number of values that the
fold procedure returns is the number of seed values.

     (define q (intmap-add (intmap-add empty-intmap 1 2) 3 4))
     (intmap-fold acons q '()) ⇒ ((3 . 4) (1 . 2))
     (intmap-fold-right acons q '()) ⇒ ((1 . 2) (3 . 4))

   When an entry in an intmap is updated (removed, added, or changed), a
new intmap is created that shares structure with the original intmap.
This operation ensures that the result of existing computations is not
affected by future computations: no mutation is ever visible to user
code.  This is a great property in a compiler data structure, as it lets
us hold a copy of a program before a transformation and use it while we
build a post-transformation program.  Updating an intmap is O(log N) in
the size of the intmap.

   However, the O(log N) allocation costs are sometimes too much,
especially in cases when we know that we can just update the intmap in
place.  As an example, say we have an intmap mapping the integers 1 to
100 to the integers 42 to 141.  Let’s say that we want to transform this
map by adding 1 to each value.  There is already an efficient
‘intmap-map’ procedure in the ‘(language cps utils)’ module, but if we
didn’t know about that we might do:

     (define (intmap-increment map)
       (let lp ((k 0) (map map))
         (let ((k (intmap-next map k)))
           (if k
               (let ((v (intmap-ref map k)))
                 (lp (1+ k) (intmap-replace map k (1+ v))))
               map))))

   Observe that the intermediate values created by ‘intmap-replace’ are
completely invisible to the program – only the last result of
‘intmap-replace’ value is needed.  The rest might as well share state
with the last one, and we could update in place.  Guile allows this kind
of interface via “transient intmaps”, inspired by Clojure’s transient
interface (<http://clojure.org/transients>).

   The in-place ‘intmap-add!’ and ‘intmap-replace!’ procedures return
transient intmaps.  If one of these in-place procedures is called on a
normal persistent intmap, a new transient intmap is created.  This is an
O(1) operation.  In all other respects the interface is like their
persistent counterparts, ‘intmap-add’ and ‘intmap-replace’.  If an
in-place procedure is called on a transient intmap, the intmap is
mutated in-place and the same value is returned.

   If a persistent operation like ‘intmap-add’ is called on a transient
intmap, the transient’s mutable substructure is then marked as
persistent, and ‘intmap-add’ then runs on a new persistent intmap
sharing structure but not state with the original transient.  Mutating a
transient will cause enough copying to ensure that it can make its
change, but if part of its substructure is already “owned” by it, no
more copying is needed.

   We can use transients to make ‘intmap-increment’ more efficient.  The
two changed elements have been marked *like this*.

     (define (intmap-increment map)
       (let lp ((k 0) (map map))
         (let ((k (intmap-next map k)))
           (if k
               (let ((v (intmap-ref map k)))
                 (lp (1+ k) (*intmap-replace!* map k (1+ v))))
               (*persistent-intmap* map)))))

   Be sure to tag the result as persistent using the ‘persistent-intmap’
procedure to prevent the mutability from leaking to other parts of the
program.  For added paranoia, you could call ‘persistent-intmap’ on the
incoming map, to ensure that if it were already transient, that the
mutations in the body of ‘intmap-increment’ wouldn’t affect the incoming
value.

   In summary, programs in CPS are intmaps whose values are
continuations.  See the source code of ‘(language cps utils)’ for a
number of useful facilities for working with CPS values.

### 9.4.4.5 Compiling CPS
.....................

Compiling CPS in Guile has three phases: conversion, optimization, and
code generation.

   CPS conversion is the process of taking a higher-level language and
compiling it to CPS. Source languages can do this directly, or they can
convert to Tree-IL (which is probably easier) and let Tree-IL convert to
CPS later.  Going through Tree-IL has the advantage of running Tree-IL
optimization passes, like partial evaluation.  Also, the compiler from
Tree-IL to CPS handles assignment conversion, in which assigned local
variables (in Tree-IL, locals that are ‘<lexical-set>’) are converted to
being boxed values on the heap.  *Note* Variables and the VM::.

   After CPS conversion, Guile runs some optimization passes over the
CPS. Most optimization in Guile is done on the CPS language.  The one
major exception is partial evaluation, which for historic reasons is
done on Tree-IL.

   The major optimization performed on CPS is contification, in which
functions that are always called with the same continuation are
incorporated directly into a function’s body.  This opens up space for
more optimizations, and turns procedure calls into ‘goto’.  It can also
make loops out of recursive function nests.  Guile also does dead code
elimination, common subexpression elimination, loop peeling and
invariant code motion, and range and type inference.

   The rest of the optimization passes are really cleanups and
canonicalizations.  CPS spans the gap between high-level languages and
low-level bytecodes, which allows much of the compilation process to be
expressed as source-to-source transformations.  Such is the case for
closure conversion, in which references to variables that are free in a
function are converted to closure references, and in which functions are
converted to closures.  There are a few more passes to ensure that the
only primcalls left in the term are those that have a corresponding
instruction in the virtual machine, and that their continuations expect
the right number of values.

   Finally, the backend of the CPS compiler emits bytecode for each
function, one by one.  To do so, it determines the set of live variables
at all points in the function.  Using this liveness information, it
allocates stack slots to each variable, such that a variable can live in
one slot for the duration of its lifetime, without shuffling.  (Of
course, variables with disjoint lifetimes can share a slot.)  Finally
the backend emits code, typically just one VM instruction, for each
continuation in the function.

9.4.5 Bytecode
--------------

As mentioned before, Guile compiles all code to bytecode, and that
bytecode is contained in ELF images.  *Note* Object File Format::, for
more on Guile’s use of ELF.

   To produce a bytecode image, Guile provides an assembler and a
linker.

   The assembler, defined in the ‘(system vm assembler)’ module, has a
relatively straightforward imperative interface.  It provides a
‘make-assembler’ function to instantiate an assembler and a set of
‘emit-INST’ procedures to emit instructions of each kind.

   The ‘emit-INST’ procedures are actually generated at compile-time
from a machine-readable description of the VM. With a few exceptions for
certain operand types, each operand of an emit procedure corresponds to
an operand of the corresponding instruction.

   Consider ‘allocate-words’, from *note* Memory Access Instructions::.
It is documented as:

 -- Instruction: allocate-words s12:DST s12:NWORDS

   Therefore the emit procedure has the form:

 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-allocate-words asm dst nwords

   All emit procedure take the assembler as their first argument, and
return no useful values.

   The argument types depend on the operand types.  *Note* Instruction
Set::.  Most are integers within a restricted range, though labels are
generally expressed as opaque symbols.  Besides the emitters that
correspond to instructions, there are a few additional helpers defined
in the assembler module.

 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-label asm label
     Define a label at the current program point.

 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-source asm source
     Associate SOURCE with the current program point.

 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-cache-ref asm dst key
 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-cache-set! asm key val
     Macro-instructions to implement compilation-unit caches.  A single
     cache cell corresponding to KEY will be allocated for the
     compilation unit.

 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-load-constant asm dst constant
     Load the Scheme datum CONSTANT into DST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-begin-program asm label properties
 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-end-program asm
     Delimit the bounds of a procedure, with the given LABEL and the
     metadata PROPERTIES.

 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-load-static-procedure asm dst label
     Load a procedure with the given LABEL into local DST.  This
     macro-instruction should only be used with procedures without free
     variables – procedures that are not closures.

 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-begin-standard-arity asm req nlocals
          alternate
 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-begin-opt-arity asm req opt rest nlocals
          alternate
 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-begin-kw-arity asm req opt rest kw-indices
          allow-other-keys? nlocals alternate
 -- Scheme Procedure: emit-end-arity asm
     Delimit a clause of a procedure.

   The linker is a complicated beast.  Hackers interested in how it
works would do well do read Ian Lance Taylor’s series of articles on
linkers.  Searching the internet should find them easily.  From the
user’s perspective, there is only one knob to control: whether the
resulting image will be written out to a file or not.  If the user
passes ‘#:to-file? #t’ as part of the compiler options (*note* The Scheme
Compiler::), the linker will align the resulting segments on page
boundaries, and otherwise not.

 -- Scheme Procedure: link-assembly asm #:page-aligned?=#t
     Link an ELF image, and return the bytevector.  If PAGE-ALIGNED? is
     true, Guile will align the segments with different permissions on
     page-sized boundaries, in order to maximize code sharing between
     different processes.  Otherwise, padding is minimized, to minimize
     address space consumption.

   To write an image to disk, just use ‘put-bytevector’ from ‘(ice-9
binary-ports)’.

   Compiling object code to the fake language, ‘value’, is performed via
loading objcode into a program, then executing that thunk with respect
to the compilation environment.  Normally the environment propagates
through the compiler transparently, but users may specify the
compilation environment manually as well, as a module.  Procedures to
load images can be found in the ‘(system vm loader)’ module:

     (use-modules (system vm loader))

 -- Scheme Variable: load-thunk-from-file file
 -- C Function: scm_load_thunk_from_file (file)
     Load object code from a file named FILE.  The file will be mapped
     into memory via ‘mmap’, so this is a very fast operation.

 -- Scheme Variable: load-thunk-from-memory bv
 -- C Function: scm_load_thunk_from_memory (bv)
     Load object code from a bytevector.  The data will be copied out of
     the bytevector in order to ensure proper alignment of embedded
     Scheme values.

   Additionally there are procedures to find the ELF image for a given
pointer, or to list all mapped ELF images:

 -- Scheme Variable: find-mapped-elf-image ptr
     Given the integer value PTR, find and return the ELF image that
     contains that pointer, as a bytevector.  If no image is found,
     return ‘#f’.  This routine is mostly used by debuggers and other
     introspective tools.

 -- Scheme Variable: all-mapped-elf-images
     Return all mapped ELF images, as a list of bytevectors.

9.4.6 Writing New High-Level Languages
--------------------------------------

In order to integrate a new language LANG into Guile’s compiler system,
one has to create the module ‘(language LANG spec)’ containing the
language definition and referencing the parser, compiler and other
routines processing it.  The module hierarchy in ‘(language brainfuck)’
defines a very basic Brainfuck implementation meant to serve as
easy-to-understand example on how to do this.  See for instance
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck> for more information about the
Brainfuck language itself.


File: guile.info,  Node: Extending the Compiler,  Prev: Writing New High-Level Languages,  Up: Compiling to the Virtual Machine

9.4.7 Extending the Compiler
----------------------------

At this point we take a detour from the impersonal tone of the rest of
the manual.  Admit it: if you’ve read this far into the compiler
internals manual, you are a junkie.  Perhaps a course at your university
left you unsated, or perhaps you’ve always harbored a desire to hack the
holy of computer science holies: a compiler.  Well you’re in good
company, and in a good position.  Guile’s compiler needs your help.

   There are many possible avenues for improving Guile’s compiler.
Probably the most important improvement, speed-wise, will be some form
of optimized ahead-of-time native compilation with global register
allocation.  A first pass could simply extend the compiler to also emit
machine code in addition to bytecode, pre-filling the corresponding JIT
data structures referenced by the ‘instrument-entry’ bytecodes.  *Note*
Instrumentation Instructions::.

   The compiler also needs help at the top end, adding new high-level
compilers.  We have JavaScript and Emacs Lisp mostly complete, but they
could use some love; Lua would be nice as well, but whatever language it
is that strikes your fancy would be welcome too.

   Compilers are for hacking, not for admiring or for complaining about.
Get to it!

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
