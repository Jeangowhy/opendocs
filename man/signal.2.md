SIGNAL(2)                           Linux Programmer's Manual                          SIGNAL(2)

NAME
       signal - ANSI C signal handling

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);

       sighandler_t signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler);

DESCRIPTION
       The  behavior  of  signal() varies across UNIX versions, and has also varied historically
       across different versions of Linux.  Avoid its use: use sigaction(2) instead.  See Porta‐
       bility below.

       signal()  sets  the disposition of the signal signum to handler, which is either SIG_IGN,
       SIG_DFL, or the address of a programmer-defined function (a "signal handler").

       If the signal signum is delivered to the process, then one of the following happens:

       *  If the disposition is set to SIG_IGN, then the signal is ignored.

       *  If the disposition is set to SIG_DFL, then the default action associated with the sig‐
          nal (see signal(7)) occurs.

       *  If the disposition is set to a function, then first either the disposition is reset to
          SIG_DFL, or the signal is blocked (see Portability below), and then handler is  called
          with  argument  signum.  If invocation of the handler caused the signal to be blocked,
          then the signal is unblocked upon return from the handler.

       The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught or ignored.

RETURN VALUE
       signal() returns the previous value of the signal handler, or SIG_ERR on error.   In  the
       event of an error, errno is set to indicate the cause.

ERRORS
       EINVAL signum is invalid.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C89, C99.

NOTES
       The effects of signal() in a multithreaded process are unspecified.

       According  to  POSIX,  the  behavior of a process is undefined after it ignores a SIGFPE,
       SIGILL, or SIGSEGV signal that was not generated by kill(2) or raise(3).   Integer  divi‐
       sion  by zero has undefined result.  On some architectures it will generate a SIGFPE sig‐
       nal.  (Also dividing the most negative integer by -1 may generate SIGFPE.)  Ignoring this
       signal might lead to an endless loop.

       See  sigaction(2)  for  details  on  what  happens when the disposition SIGCHLD is set to
       SIG_IGN.

       See signal-safety(7) for a list of the async-signal-safe functions  that  can  be  safely
       called from inside a signal handler.

       The use of sighandler_t is a GNU extension, exposed if _GNU_SOURCE is defined; glibc also
       defines (the  BSD-derived)  sig_t  if  _BSD_SOURCE  (glibc  2.19  and  earlier)  or  _DE‐
       FAULT_SOURCE (glibc 2.19 and later) is defined.  Without use of such a type, the declara‐
       tion of signal() is the somewhat harder to read:

           void ( *signal(int signum, void (*handler)(int)) ) (int);

   Portability
       The only portable use of signal() is to set a signal's disposition to SIG_DFL or SIG_IGN.
       The  semantics when using signal() to establish a signal handler vary across systems (and
       POSIX.1 explicitly permits this variation); do not use it for this purpose.

       POSIX.1 solved the portability mess by specifying sigaction(2), which  provides  explicit
       control  of the semantics when a signal handler is invoked; use that interface instead of
       signal().

       In the original UNIX systems, when a handler that was established using signal() was  in‐
       voked  by  the  delivery  of  a  signal,  the disposition of the signal would be reset to
       SIG_DFL, and the system did not block delivery of further instances of the signal.   This
       is equivalent to calling sigaction(2) with the following flags:

           sa.sa_flags = SA_RESETHAND | SA_NODEFER;

       System V  also  provides  these  semantics for signal().  This was bad because the signal
       might be delivered again before the handler had a chance to reestablish itself.  Further‐
       more,  rapid  deliveries  of the same signal could result in recursive invocations of the
       handler.

       BSD improved on this situation, but unfortunately also changed the semantics of  the  ex‐
       isting  signal() interface while doing so.  On BSD, when a signal handler is invoked, the
       signal disposition is not reset, and further instances of the signal are blocked from be‐
       ing delivered while the handler is executing.  Furthermore, certain blocking system calls
       are automatically restarted if interrupted by a signal handler (see signal(7)).  The  BSD
       semantics are equivalent to calling sigaction(2) with the following flags:

           sa.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;

       The situation on Linux is as follows:

       * The kernel's signal() system call provides System V semantics.

       * By  default,  in  glibc  2 and later, the signal() wrapper function does not invoke the
         kernel system call.  Instead, it calls sigaction(2) using flags that supply BSD  seman‐
         tics.   This  default  behavior is provided as long as a suitable feature test macro is
         defined: _BSD_SOURCE on glibc 2.19 and earlier or _DEFAULT_SOURCE  in  glibc  2.19  and
         later.  (By default, these macros are defined; see feature_test_macros(7) for details.)
         If such a feature test macro is not defined, then signal() provides System V semantics.
