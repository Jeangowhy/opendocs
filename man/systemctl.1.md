SYSTEMCTL(1)                                systemctl                               SYSTEMCTL(1)

NAME
========================================================
   systemctl - Control the systemd system and service manager

SYNOPSIS
========================================================
   systemctl [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [UNIT...]

DESCRIPTION
========================================================
   systemctl may be used to introspect and control the state of the "systemd" system and
   service manager. Please refer to systemd(1) for an introduction into the basic concepts
   and functionality this tool manages.

COMMANDS
========================================================
   The following commands are understood:

Unit Commands
   list-units [PATTERN...]
       List units that systemd currently has in memory. This includes units that are either
       referenced directly or through a dependency, units that are pinned by applications
       programmatically, or units that were active in the past and have failed. By default
       only units which are active, have pending jobs, or have failed are shown; this can be
       changed with option --all. If one or more PATTERNs are specified, only units matching
       one of them are shown. The units that are shown are additionally filtered by --type=
       and --state= if those options are specified.

       Produces output similar to

             UNIT                         LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
             sys-module-fuse.device       loaded active plugged /sys/module/fuse
             -.mount                      loaded active mounted Root Mount
             boot-efi.mount               loaded active mounted /boot/efi
             systemd-journald.service     loaded active running Journal Service
             systemd-logind.service       loaded active running Login Service
           ‚óè user@1000.service            loaded failed failed  User Manager for UID 1000
             ...
             systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer loaded active waiting Daily Cleanup of Temporary Directories

           LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
           ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
           SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

           123 loaded units listed. Pass --all to see loaded but inactive units, too.
           To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.

       The header and the last unit of a given type are underlined if the terminal supports
       that. A colored dot is shown next to services which were masked, not found, or
       otherwise failed.

       The LOAD column shows the load state, one of loaded, not-found, bad-setting, error,
       masked. The ACTIVE columns shows the general unit state, one of active, reloading,
       inactive, failed, activating, deactivating. The SUB column shows the
       unit-type-specific detailed state of the unit, possible values vary by unit type. The
       list of possible LOAD, ACTIVE, and SUB states is not constant and new systemd
       releases may both add and remove values.

           systemctl --state=help

       command maybe be used to display the current set of possible values.

       This is the default command.

   list-sockets [PATTERN...]
       List socket units currently in memory, ordered by listening address. If one or more
       PATTERNs are specified, only socket units matching one of them are shown. Produces
       output similar to

           LISTEN           UNIT                        ACTIVATES
           /dev/initctl     systemd-initctl.socket      systemd-initctl.service
           ...
           [::]:22          sshd.socket                 sshd.service
           kobject-uevent 1 systemd-udevd-kernel.socket systemd-udevd.service

           5 sockets listed.

       Note: because the addresses might contains spaces, this output is not suitable for
       programmatic consumption.

       Also see --show-types, --all, and --state=.

   list-timers [PATTERN...]
       List timer units currently in memory, ordered by the time they elapse next. If one or
       more PATTERNs are specified, only units matching one of them are shown. Produces
       output similar to

           NEXT                         LEFT          LAST                         PASSED     UNIT                         ACTIVATES

       NEXT shows the next time the timer will run.

       LEFT shows how long till the next time the timer runs.

       LAST shows the last time the timer ran.

       PASSED shows how long has passed since the timer last ran.

       UNIT shows the name of the timer

       ACTIVATES shows the name the service the timer activates when it runs.

       Also see --all and --state=.

   start PATTERN...
       Start (activate) one or more units specified on the command line.

       Note that unit glob patterns expand to names of units currently in memory. Units
       which are not active and are not in a failed state usually are not in memory, and
       will not be matched by any pattern. In addition, in case of instantiated units,
       systemd is often unaware of the instance name until the instance has been started.
       Therefore, using glob patterns with start has limited usefulness. Also, secondary
       alias names of units are not considered.

       Option --all may be used to also operate on inactive units which are referenced by
       other loaded units. Note that this is not the same as operating on "all" possible
       units, because as the previous paragraph describes, such a list is ill-defined.
       Nevertheless, systemctl start --all GLOB may be useful if all the units that should
       match the pattern are pulled in by some target which is known to be loaded.

   stop PATTERN...
       Stop (deactivate) one or more units specified on the command line.

       This command will fail if the unit does not exist or if stopping of the unit is
       prohibited (see RefuseManualStop= in systemd.unit(5)). It will not fail if any of the
       commands configured to stop the unit (ExecStop=, etc.) fail, because the manager will
       still forcibly terminate the unit.

   reload PATTERN...
       Asks all units listed on the command line to reload their configuration. Note that
       this will reload the service-specific configuration, not the unit configuration file
       of systemd. If you want systemd to reload the configuration file of a unit, use the
       daemon-reload command. In other words: for the example case of Apache, this will
       reload Apache's httpd.conf in the web server, not the apache.service systemd unit
       file.

       This command should not be confused with the daemon-reload command.

   restart PATTERN...
       Stop and then start one or more units specified on the command line. If the units are
       not running yet, they will be started.

       Note that restarting a unit with this command does not necessarily flush out all of
       the unit's resources before it is started again. For example, the per-service file
       descriptor storage facility (see FileDescriptorStoreMax= in systemd.service(5)) will
       remain intact as long as the unit has a job pending, and is only cleared when the
       unit is fully stopped and no jobs are pending anymore. If it is intended that the
       file descriptor store is flushed out, too, during a restart operation an explicit
       systemctl stop command followed by systemctl start should be issued.

   try-restart PATTERN...
       Stop and then start one or more units specified on the command line if the units are
       running. This does nothing if units are not running.

   reload-or-restart PATTERN...
       Reload one or more units if they support it. If not, stop and then start them
       instead. If the units are not running yet, they will be started.

   try-reload-or-restart PATTERN...
       Reload one or more units if they support it. If not, stop and then start them
       instead. This does nothing if the units are not running.

   isolate UNIT
       Start the unit specified on the command line and its dependencies and stop all
       others, unless they have IgnoreOnIsolate=yes (see systemd.unit(5)). If a unit name
       with no extension is given, an extension of ".target" will be assumed.

       This is similar to changing the runlevel in a traditional init system. The isolate
       command will immediately stop processes that are not enabled in the new unit,
       possibly including the graphical environment or terminal you are currently using.

       Note that this is allowed only on units where AllowIsolate= is enabled. See
       systemd.unit(5) for details.

   kill PATTERN...
       Send a signal to one or more processes of the unit. Use --kill-who= to select which
       process to kill. Use --signal= to select the signal to send.

   clean PATTERN...
       Remove the configuration, state, cache, logs or runtime data of the specified units.
       Use --what= to select which kind of resource to remove. For service units this may be
       used to remove the directories configured with ConfigurationDirectory=,
       StateDirectory=, CacheDirectory=, LogsDirectory= and RuntimeDirectory=, see
       systemd.exec(5) for details. For timer units this may be used to clear out the
       persistent timestamp data if Persistent= is used and --what=state is selected, see
       systemd.timer(5). This command only applies to units that use either of these
       settings. If --what= is not specified, both the cache and runtime data are removed
       (as these two types of data are generally redundant and reproducible on the next
       invocation of the unit).

   is-active PATTERN...
       Check whether any of the specified units are active (i.e. running). Returns an exit
       code 0 if at least one is active, or non-zero otherwise. Unless --quiet is specified,
       this will also print the current unit state to standard output.

   is-failed PATTERN...
       Check whether any of the specified units are in a "failed" state. Returns an exit
       code 0 if at least one has failed, non-zero otherwise. Unless --quiet is specified,
       this will also print the current unit state to standard output.

   status [PATTERN...|PID...]]
       Show terse runtime status information about one or more units, followed by most
       recent log data from the journal. If no units are specified, show system status. If
       combined with --all, also show the status of all units (subject to limitations
       specified with -t). If a PID is passed, show information about the unit the process
       belongs to.

       This function is intended to generate human-readable output. If you are looking for
       computer-parsable output, use show instead. By default, this function only shows 10
       lines of output and ellipsizes lines to fit in the terminal window. This can be
       changed with --lines and --full, see above. In addition, journalctl --unit=NAME or
       journalctl --user-unit=NAME use a similar filter for messages and might be more
       convenient.

       systemd implicitly loads units as necessary, so just running the status will attempt
       to load a file. The command is thus not useful for determining if something was
       already loaded or not. The units may possibly also be quickly unloaded after the
       operation is completed if there's no reason to keep it in memory thereafter.

       Example 1. Example output from systemctl status

           $ systemctl status bluetooth

       The dot ("‚óè") uses color on supported terminals to summarize the unit state at a
       glance. White indicates an "inactive" or "deactivating" state. Red indicates a
       "failed" or "error" state and green indicates an "active", "reloading" or
       "activating" state.

       The "Loaded:" line in the output will show "loaded" if the unit has been loaded into
       memory. Other possible values for "Loaded:" include: "error" if there was a problem
       loading it, "not-found" if not unit file was found for this unit, "bad-setting" if an
       essential unit file setting could not be parsed and "masked" if the unit file has
       been masked. Along with showing the path to the unit file, this line will also show
       the enablement state. Enabled commands start at boot. See the full table of possible
       enablement states ‚Äî including the definition of "masked" ‚Äî in the documentation for
       the is-enabled command.

       The "Active:" line shows active state. The value is usually "active" or "inactive".
       Active could mean started, bound, plugged in, etc depending on the unit type. The
       unit could also be in process of changing states, reporting a state of "activating"
       or "deactivating". A special "failed" state is entered when the service failed in
       some way, such as a crash, exiting with an error code or timing out. If the failed
       state is entered the cause will be logged for later reference.

   show [PATTERN...|JOB...]
       Show properties of one or more units, jobs, or the manager itself. If no argument is
       specified, properties of the manager will be shown. If a unit name is specified,
       properties of the unit are shown, and if a job ID is specified, properties of the job
       are shown. By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use --all to show those too.
       To select specific properties to show, use --property=. This command is intended to
       be used whenever computer-parsable output is required. Use status if you are looking
       for formatted human-readable output.

       Many properties shown by systemctl show map directly to configuration settings of the
       system and service manager and its unit files. Note that the properties shown by the
       command are generally more low-level, normalized versions of the original
       configuration settings and expose runtime state in addition to configuration. For
       example, properties shown for service units include the service's current main
       process identifier as "MainPID" (which is runtime state), and time settings are
       always exposed as properties ending in the "...USec" suffix even if a matching
       configuration options end in "...Sec", because microseconds is the normalized time
       unit used by the system and service manager.

   cat PATTERN...
       Show backing files of one or more units. Prints the "fragment" and "drop-ins" (source
       files) of units. Each file is preceded by a comment which includes the file name.
       Note that this shows the contents of the backing files on disk, which may not match
       the system manager's understanding of these units if any unit files were updated on
       disk and the daemon-reload command wasn't issued since.

   set-property UNIT PROPERTY=VALUE...
       Set the specified unit properties at runtime where this is supported. This allows
       changing configuration parameter properties such as resource control settings at
       runtime. Not all properties may be changed at runtime, but many resource control
       settings (primarily those in systemd.resource-control(5)) may. The changes are
       applied immediately, and stored on disk for future boots, unless --runtime is passed,
       in which case the settings only apply until the next reboot. The syntax of the
       property assignment follows closely the syntax of assignments in unit files.

       Example: systemctl set-property foobar.service CPUWeight=200

       If the specified unit appears to be inactive, the changes will be only stored on disk
       as described previously hence they will be effective when the unit will be started.

       Note that this command allows changing multiple properties at the same time, which is
       preferable over setting them individually.

       Example: systemctl set-property foobar.service CPUWeight=200 MemoryMax=2G
       IPAccounting=yes

       Like with unit file configuration settings, assigning an empty setting usually resets
       a property to its defaults.

       Example: systemctl set-property avahi-daemon.service IPAddressDeny=

   help PATTERN...|PID...
       Show manual pages for one or more units, if available. If a PID is given, the manual
       pages for the unit the process belongs to are shown.

   reset-failed [PATTERN...]
       Reset the "failed" state of the specified units, or if no unit name is passed, reset
       the state of all units. When a unit fails in some way (i.e. process exiting with
       non-zero error code, terminating abnormally or timing out), it will automatically
       enter the "failed" state and its exit code and status is recorded for introspection
       by the administrator until the service is stopped/re-started or reset with this
       command.

       In addition to resetting the "failed" state of a unit it also resets various other
       per-unit properties: the start rate limit counter of all unit types is reset to zero,
       as is the restart counter of service units. Thus, if a unit's start limit (as
       configured with StartLimitIntervalSec=/StartLimitBurst=) is hit and the unit refuses
       to be started again, use this command to make it startable again.

   list-dependencies [UNIT...]
       Shows units required and wanted by the specified units. This recursively lists units
       following the Requires=, Requisite=, ConsistsOf=, Wants=, BindsTo= dependencies. If
       no units are specified, default.target is implied.

       By default, only target units are recursively expanded. When --all is passed, all
       other units are recursively expanded as well.

       Options --reverse, --after, --before may be used to change what types of dependencies
       are shown.

       Note that this command only lists units currently loaded into memory by the service
       manager. In particular, this command is not suitable to get a comprehensive list at
       all reverse dependencies on a specific unit, as it won't list the dependencies
       declared by units currently not loaded.

Unit File Commands
   list-unit-files [PATTERN...]
       List unit files installed on the system, in combination with their enablement state
       (as reported by is-enabled). If one or more PATTERNs are specified, only unit files
       whose name matches one of them are shown (patterns matching unit file system paths
       are not supported).

   enable UNIT..., enable PATH...
       Enable one or more units or unit instances. This will create a set of symlinks, as
       encoded in the "[Install]" sections of the indicated unit files. After the symlinks
       have been created, the system manager configuration is reloaded (in a way equivalent
       to daemon-reload), in order to ensure the changes are taken into account immediately.
       Note that this does not have the effect of also starting any of the units being
       enabled. If this is desired, combine this command with the --now switch, or invoke
       start with appropriate arguments later. Note that in case of unit instance enablement
       (i.e. enablement of units of the form foo@bar.service), symlinks named the same as
       instances are created in the unit configuration directory, however they point to the
       single template unit file they are instantiated from.

       This command expects either valid unit names (in which case various unit file
       directories are automatically searched for unit files with appropriate names), or
       absolute paths to unit files (in which case these files are read directly). If a
       specified unit file is located outside of the usual unit file directories, an
       additional symlink is created, linking it into the unit configuration path, thus
       ensuring it is found when requested by commands such as start. The file system where
       the linked unit files are located must be accessible when systemd is started (e.g.
       anything underneath /home or /var is not allowed, unless those directories are
       located on the root file system).

       This command will print the file system operations executed. This output may be
       suppressed by passing --quiet.

       Note that this operation creates only the symlinks suggested in the "[Install]"
       section of the unit files. While this command is the recommended way to manipulate
       the unit configuration directory, the administrator is free to make additional
       changes manually by placing or removing symlinks below this directory. This is
       particularly useful to create configurations that deviate from the suggested default
       installation. In this case, the administrator must make sure to invoke daemon-reload
       manually as necessary, in order to ensure the changes are taken into account.

       Enabling units should not be confused with starting (activating) units, as done by
       the start command. Enabling and starting units is orthogonal: units may be enabled
       without being started and started without being enabled. Enabling simply hooks the
       unit into various suggested places (for example, so that the unit is automatically
       started on boot or when a particular kind of hardware is plugged in). Starting
       actually spawns the daemon process (in case of service units), or binds the socket
       (in case of socket units), and so on.

       Depending on whether --system, --user, --runtime, or --global is specified, this
       enables the unit for the system, for the calling user only, for only this boot of the
       system, or for all future logins of all users. Note that in the last case, no systemd
       daemon configuration is reloaded.

       Using enable on masked units is not supported and results in an error.

   disable UNIT...
       Disables one or more units. This removes all symlinks to the unit files backing the
       specified units from the unit configuration directory, and hence undoes any changes
       made by enable or link. Note that this removes all symlinks to matching unit files,
       including manually created symlinks, and not just those actually created by enable or
       link. Note that while disable undoes the effect of enable, the two commands are
       otherwise not symmetric, as disable may remove more symlinks than a prior enable
       invocation of the same unit created.

       This command expects valid unit names only, it does not accept paths to unit files.

       In addition to the units specified as arguments, all units are disabled that are
       listed in the Also= setting contained in the "[Install]" section of any of the unit
       files being operated on.

       This command implicitly reloads the system manager configuration after completing the
       operation. Note that this command does not implicitly stop the units that are being
       disabled. If this is desired, either combine this command with the --now switch, or
       invoke the stop command with appropriate arguments later.

       This command will print information about the file system operations (symlink
       removals) executed. This output may be suppressed by passing --quiet.

       This command honors --system, --user, --runtime and --global in a similar way as
       enable.

   reenable UNIT...
       Reenable one or more units, as specified on the command line. This is a combination
       of disable and enable and is useful to reset the symlinks a unit file is enabled with
       to the defaults configured in its "[Install]" section. This command expects a unit
       name only, it does not accept paths to unit files.

   preset UNIT...
       Reset the enable/disable status one or more unit files, as specified on the command
       line, to the defaults configured in the preset policy files. This has the same effect
       as disable or enable, depending how the unit is listed in the preset files.

       Use --preset-mode= to control whether units shall be enabled and disabled, or only
       enabled, or only disabled.

       If the unit carries no install information, it will be silently ignored by this
       command.  UNIT must be the real unit name, any alias names are ignored silently.

       For more information on the preset policy format, see systemd.preset(5). For more
       information on the concept of presets, please consult the Preset[1] document.

   preset-all
       Resets all installed unit files to the defaults configured in the preset policy file
       (see above).

       Use --preset-mode= to control whether units shall be enabled and disabled, or only
       enabled, or only disabled.

   is-enabled UNIT...
       Checks whether any of the specified unit files are enabled (as with enable). Returns
       an exit code of 0 if at least one is enabled, non-zero otherwise. Prints the current
       enable status (see table). To suppress this output, use --quiet. To show installation
       targets, use --full.

   mask UNIT...
       Mask one or more units, as specified on the command line. This will link these unit
       files to /dev/null, making it impossible to start them. This is a stronger version of
       disable, since it prohibits all kinds of activation of the unit, including enablement
       and manual activation. Use this option with care. This honors the --runtime option to
       only mask temporarily until the next reboot of the system. The --now option may be
       used to ensure that the units are also stopped. This command expects valid unit names
       only, it does not accept unit file paths.

   unmask UNIT...
       Unmask one or more unit files, as specified on the command line. This will undo the
       effect of mask. This command expects valid unit names only, it does not accept unit
       file paths.

   link PATH...
       Link a unit file that is not in the unit file search paths into the unit file search
       path. This command expects an absolute path to a unit file. The effect of this may be
       undone with disable. The effect of this command is that a unit file is made available
       for commands such as start, even though it is not installed directly in the unit
       search path. The file system where the linked unit files are located must be
       accessible when systemd is started (e.g. anything underneath /home or /var is not
       allowed, unless those directories are located on the root file system).

   revert UNIT...
       Revert one or more unit files to their vendor versions. This command removes drop-in
       configuration files that modify the specified units, as well as any user-configured
       unit file that overrides a matching vendor supplied unit file. Specifically, for a
       unit "foo.service" the matching directories "foo.service.d/" with all their contained
       files are removed, both below the persistent and runtime configuration directories
       (i.e. below /etc/systemd/system and /run/systemd/system); if the unit file has a
       vendor-supplied version (i.e. a unit file located below /usr) any matching persistent
       or runtime unit file that overrides it is removed, too. Note that if a unit file has
       no vendor-supplied version (i.e. is only defined below /etc/systemd/system or
       /run/systemd/system, but not in a unit file stored below /usr), then it is not
       removed. Also, if a unit is masked, it is unmasked.

       Effectively, this command may be used to undo all changes made with systemctl edit,
       systemctl set-property and systemctl mask and puts the original unit file with its
       settings back in effect.

   add-wants TARGET UNIT..., add-requires TARGET UNIT...
       Adds "Wants=" or "Requires=" dependencies, respectively, to the specified TARGET for
       one or more units.

       This command honors --system, --user, --runtime and --global in a way similar to
       enable.

   edit UNIT...
       Edit a drop-in snippet or a whole replacement file if --full is specified, to extend
       or override the specified unit.

       Depending on whether --system (the default), --user, or --global is specified, this
       command creates a drop-in file for each unit either for the system, for the calling
       user, or for all futures logins of all users. Then, the editor (see the "Environment"
       section below) is invoked on temporary files which will be written to the real
       location if the editor exits successfully.

       If --full is specified, this will copy the original units instead of creating drop-in
       files.

       If --force is specified and any units do not already exist, new unit files will be
       opened for editing.

       If --runtime is specified, the changes will be made temporarily in /run and they will
       be lost on the next reboot.

       If the temporary file is empty upon exit, the modification of the related unit is
       canceled.

       After the units have been edited, systemd configuration is reloaded (in a way that is
       equivalent to daemon-reload).

       Note that this command cannot be used to remotely edit units and that you cannot
       temporarily edit units which are in /etc, since they take precedence over /run.

   get-default
       Return the default target to boot into. This returns the target unit name
       default.target is aliased (symlinked) to.

   set-default TARGET
       Set the default target to boot into. This sets (symlinks) the default.target alias to
       the given target unit.

       List jobs that are in progress. If one or more PATTERNs are specified, only jobs for
       units matching one of them are shown.

       When combined with --after or --before the list is augmented with information on
       which other job each job is waiting for, and which other jobs are waiting for it, see
       above.

   cancel JOB...
       Cancel one or more jobs specified on the command line by their numeric job IDs. If no
       job ID is specified, cancel all pending jobs.

Environment Commands
   show-environment
       Dump the systemd manager environment block. This is the environment block that is
       passed to all processes the manager spawns. The environment block will be dumped in
       straight-forward form suitable for sourcing into most shells. If no special
       characters or whitespace is present in the variable values, no escaping is performed,
       and the assignments have the form "VARIABLE=value". If whitespace or characters which
       have special meaning to the shell are present, dollar-single-quote escaping is used,
       and assignments have the form "VARIABLE=$'value'". This syntax is known to be
       supported by bash(1), zsh(1), ksh(1), and busybox(1)'s ash(1), but not dash(1) or
       fish(1).

   set-environment VARIABLE=VALUE...
       Set one or more systemd manager environment variables, as specified on the command
       line.

   unset-environment VARIABLE...
       Unset one or more systemd manager environment variables. If only a variable name is
       specified, it will be removed regardless of its value. If a variable and a value are
       specified, the variable is only removed if it has the specified value.

   import-environment [VARIABLE...]
       Import all, one or more environment variables set on the client into the systemd
       manager environment block. If no arguments are passed, the entire environment block
       is imported. Otherwise, a list of one or more environment variable names should be
       passed, whose client-side values are then imported into the manager's environment
       block.

Manager State Commands
   daemon-reload
       Reload the systemd manager configuration. This will rerun all generators (see
       systemd.generator(7)), reload all unit files, and recreate the entire dependency
       tree. While the daemon is being reloaded, all sockets systemd listens on behalf of
       user configuration will stay accessible.

       This command should not be confused with the reload command.

   daemon-reexec
       Reexecute the systemd manager. This will serialize the manager state, reexecute the
       process and deserialize the state again. This command is of little use except for
       debugging and package upgrades. Sometimes, it might be helpful as a heavy-weight
       daemon-reload. While the daemon is being reexecuted, all sockets systemd listening on
       behalf of user configuration will stay accessible.

   log-level [LEVEL]
       If no argument is given, print the current log level of the manager. If an optional
       argument LEVEL is provided, then the command changes the current log level of the
       manager to LEVEL (accepts the same values as --log-level= described in systemd(1)).

   log-target [TARGET]
       If no argument is given, print the current log target of the manager. If an optional
       argument TARGET is provided, then the command changes the current log target of the
       manager to TARGET (accepts the same values as --log-target=, described in
       systemd(1)).

   service-watchdogs [yes|no]
       If no argument is given, print the current state of service runtime watchdogs of the
       manager. If an optional boolean argument is provided, then globally enables or
       disables the service runtime watchdogs (WatchdogSec=) and emergency actions (e.g.
       OnFailure= or StartLimitAction=); see systemd.service(5). The hardware watchdog is
       not affected by this setting.

System Commands
   is-system-running
       Checks whether the system is operational. This returns success (exit code 0) when the
       system is fully up and running, specifically not in startup, shutdown or maintenance
       mode, and with no failed services. Failure is returned otherwise (exit code
       non-zero). In addition, the current state is printed in a short string to standard
       output, see the table below. Use --quiet to suppress this output.

       Use --wait to wait until the boot process is completed before printing the current
       state and returning the appropriate error status. If --wait is in use, states
       initializing or starting will not be reported, instead the command will block until a
       later state (such as running or degraded) is reached.

   default
       Enter default mode. This is equivalent to systemctl isolate default.target. This
       operation is blocking by default, use --no-block to request asynchronous behavior.

   rescue
       Enter rescue mode. This is equivalent to systemctl isolate rescue.target. This
       operation is blocking by default, use --no-block to request asynchronous behavior.

   emergency
       Enter emergency mode. This is equivalent to systemctl isolate emergency.target. This
       operation is blocking by default, use --no-block to request asynchronous behavior.

   halt
       Shut down and halt the system. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl start
       halt.target --job-mode=replace-irreversibly --no-block, but also prints a wall
       message to all users. This command is asynchronous; it will return after the halt
       operation is enqueued, without waiting for it to complete. Note that this operation
       will simply halt the OS kernel after shutting down, leaving the hardware powered on.
       Use systemctl poweroff for powering off the system (see below).

       If combined with --force, shutdown of all running services is skipped, however all
       processes are killed and all file systems are unmounted or mounted read-only,
       immediately followed by the system halt. If --force is specified twice, the operation
       is immediately executed without terminating any processes or unmounting any file
       systems. This may result in data loss. Note that when --force is specified twice the
       halt operation is executed by systemctl itself, and the system manager is not
       contacted. This means the command should succeed even when the system manager has
       crashed.

   poweroff
       Shut down and power-off the system. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl start
       poweroff.target --job-mode=replace-irreversibly --no-block, but also prints a wall
       message to all users. This command is asynchronous; it will return after the
       power-off operation is enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.

       If combined with --force, shutdown of all running services is skipped, however all
       processes are killed and all file systems are unmounted or mounted read-only,
       immediately followed by the powering off. If --force is specified twice, the
       operation is immediately executed without terminating any processes or unmounting any
       file systems. This may result in data loss. Note that when --force is specified twice
       the power-off operation is executed by systemctl itself, and the system manager is
       not contacted. This means the command should succeed even when the system manager has
       crashed.

   reboot [arg]
       Shut down and reboot the system. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl start
       reboot.target --job-mode=replace-irreversibly --no-block, but also prints a wall
       message to all users. This command is asynchronous; it will return after the reboot
       operation is enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.

       If combined with --force, shutdown of all running services is skipped, however all
       processes are killed and all file systems are unmounted or mounted read-only,
       immediately followed by the reboot. If --force is specified twice, the operation is
       immediately executed without terminating any processes or unmounting any file
       systems. This may result in data loss. Note that when --force is specified twice the
       reboot operation is executed by systemctl itself, and the system manager is not
       contacted. This means the command should succeed even when the system manager has
       crashed.

       If the optional argument arg is given, it will be passed as the optional argument to
       the reboot(2) system call. The value is architecture and firmware specific. As an
       example, "recovery" might be used to trigger system recovery, and "fota" might be
       used to trigger a ‚Äúfirmware over the air‚Äù update.

   kexec
       Shut down and reboot the system via kexec. This is equivalent to systemctl start
       kexec.target --job-mode=replace-irreversibly --no-block. This command is
       asynchronous; it will return after the reboot operation is enqueued, without waiting
       for it to complete.

       If combined with --force, shutdown of all running services is skipped, however all
       processes are killed and all file systems are unmounted or mounted read-only,
       immediately followed by the reboot.

   exit [EXIT_CODE]
       Ask the service manager to quit. This is only supported for user service managers
       (i.e. in conjunction with the --user option) or in containers and is equivalent to
       poweroff otherwise. This command is asynchronous; it will return after the exit
       operation is enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.

       The service manager will exit with the specified exit code, if EXIT_CODE is passed.

   switch-root ROOT [INIT]
       Switches to a different root directory and executes a new system manager process
       below it. This is intended for usage in initial RAM disks ("initrd"), and will
       transition from the initrd's system manager process (a.k.a. "init" process) to the
       main system manager process which is loaded from the actual host volume. This call
       takes two arguments: the directory that is to become the new root directory, and the
       path to the new system manager binary below it to execute as PID 1. If the latter is
       omitted or the empty string, a systemd binary will automatically be searched for and
       used as init. If the system manager path is omitted, equal to the empty string or
       identical to the path to the systemd binary, the state of the initrd's system manager
       process is passed to the main system manager, which allows later introspection of the
       state of the services involved in the initrd boot phase.

   suspend
       Suspend the system. This will trigger activation of the special target unit
       suspend.target. This command is asynchronous, and will return after the suspend
       operation is successfully enqueued. It will not wait for the suspend/resume cycle to
       complete.

   hibernate
       Hibernate the system. This will trigger activation of the special target unit
       hibernate.target. This command is asynchronous, and will return after the hibernation
       operation is successfully enqueued. It will not wait for the hibernate/thaw cycle to
       complete.

   hybrid-sleep
       Hibernate and suspend the system. This will trigger activation of the special target
       unit hybrid-sleep.target. This command is asynchronous, and will return after the
       hybrid sleep operation is successfully enqueued. It will not wait for the
       sleep/wake-up cycle to complete.

   suspend-then-hibernate
       Suspend the system and hibernate it after the delay specified in systemd-sleep.conf.
       This will trigger activation of the special target unit
       suspend-then-hibernate.target. This command is asynchronous, and will return after
       the hybrid sleep operation is successfully enqueued. It will not wait for the
       sleep/wake-up or hibernate/thaw cycle to complete.

Parameter Syntax
   Unit commands listed above take either a single unit name (designated as UNIT), or
   multiple unit specifications (designated as PATTERN...). In the first case, the unit name
   with or without a suffix must be given. If the suffix is not specified (unit name is
   "abbreviated"), systemctl will append a suitable suffix, ".service" by default, and a
   type-specific suffix in case of commands which operate only on specific unit types. For
   example,

       # systemctl start sshd

   and

       # systemctl start sshd.service

   are equivalent, as are

       # systemctl isolate default

   and

       # systemctl isolate default.target

   Note that (absolute) paths to device nodes are automatically converted to device unit
   names, and other (absolute) paths to mount unit names.

       # systemctl status /dev/sda
       # systemctl status /home

   are equivalent to:

       # systemctl status dev-sda.device
       # systemctl status home.mount

   In the second case, shell-style globs will be matched against the primary names of all
   units currently in memory; literal unit names, with or without a suffix, will be treated
   as in the first case. This means that literal unit names always refer to exactly one
   unit, but globs may match zero units and this is not considered an error.

   Glob patterns use fnmatch(3), so normal shell-style globbing rules are used, and "*",
   "?", "[]" may be used. See glob(7) for more details. The patterns are matched against the
   primary names of units currently in memory, and patterns which do not match anything are
   silently skipped. For example:

       # systemctl stop sshd@*.service

   will stop all sshd@.service instances. Note that alias names of units, and units that
   aren't in memory are not considered for glob expansion.

   For unit file commands, the specified UNIT should be the name of the unit file (possibly
   abbreviated, see above), or the absolute path to the unit file:

       # systemctl enable foo.service

   or

       # systemctl link /path/to/foo.service

OPTIONS
========================================================
   The following options are understood:

   -t, --type=
       The argument should be a comma-separated list of unit types such as service and
       socket.

       If one of the arguments is a unit type, when listing units, limit display to certain
       unit types. Otherwise, units of all types will be shown.

       As a special case, if one of the arguments is help, a list of allowed values will be
       printed and the program will exit.

   --state=
       The argument should be a comma-separated list of unit LOAD, SUB, or ACTIVE states.
       When listing units, show only those in the specified states. Use --state=failed to
       show only failed units.

       As a special case, if one of the arguments is help, a list of allowed values will be
       printed and the program will exit.

   -p, --property=
       When showing unit/job/manager properties with the show command, limit display to
       properties specified in the argument. The argument should be a comma-separated list
       of property names, such as "MainPID". Unless specified, all known properties are
       shown. If specified more than once, all properties with the specified names are
       shown. Shell completion is implemented for property names.

       For the manager itself, systemctl show will show all available properties. Those
       properties are documented in systemd-system.conf(5).

       Properties for units vary by unit type, so showing any unit (even a non-existent one)
       is a way to list properties pertaining to this type. Similarly, showing any job will
       list properties pertaining to all jobs. Properties for units are documented in
       systemd.unit(5), and the pages for individual unit types systemd.service(5),
       systemd.socket(5), etc.

   -a, --all
       When listing units with list-units, also show inactive units and units which are
       following other units. When showing unit/job/manager properties, show all properties
       regardless whether they are set or not.

       To list all units installed in the file system, use the list-unit-files command
       instead.

       When listing units with list-dependencies, recursively show dependencies of all
       dependent units (by default only dependencies of target units are shown).

       When used with status, show journal messages in full, even if they include
       unprintable characters or are very long. By default, fields with unprintable
       characters are abbreviated as "blob data". (Note that the pager may escape
       unprintable characters again.)

   -r, --recursive
       When listing units, also show units of local containers. Units of local containers
       will be prefixed with the container name, separated by a single colon character
       (":").

   --reverse
       Show reverse dependencies between units with list-dependencies, i.e. follow
       dependencies of type WantedBy=, RequiredBy=, PartOf=, BoundBy=, instead of Wants= and
       similar.

   --after
       With list-dependencies, show the units that are ordered before the specified unit. In
       other words, recursively list units following the After= dependency.

       Note that any After= dependency is automatically mirrored to create a Before=
       dependency. Temporal dependencies may be specified explicitly, but are also created
       implicitly for units which are WantedBy= targets (see systemd.target(5)), and as a
       result of other directives (for example RequiresMountsFor=). Both explicitly and
       implicitly introduced dependencies are shown with list-dependencies.

       When passed to the list-jobs command, for each printed job show which other jobs are
       waiting for it. May be combined with --before to show both the jobs waiting for each
       job as well as all jobs each job is waiting for.

   --before
       With list-dependencies, show the units that are ordered after the specified unit. In
       other words, recursively list units following the Before= dependency.

       When passed to the list-jobs command, for each printed job show which other jobs it
       is waiting for. May be combined with --after to show both the jobs waiting for each
       job as well as all jobs each job is waiting for.

   --with-dependencies
       When used with status, cat, list-units, and list-unit-files, those commands print all
       specified units and the dependencies of those units.

       Options --reverse, --after, --before may be used to change what types of dependencies
       are shown.

   -l, --full
       Do not ellipsize unit names, process tree entries, journal output, or truncate unit
       descriptions in the output of status, list-units, list-jobs, and list-timers.

       Also, show installation targets in the output of is-enabled.

   --value
       When printing properties with show, only print the value, and skip the property name
       and "=".

   --show-types
       When showing sockets, show the type of the socket.

   --job-mode=
       When queuing a new job, this option controls how to deal with already queued jobs. It
       takes one of "fail", "replace", "replace-irreversibly", "isolate",
       "ignore-dependencies", "ignore-requirements", "flush", or "triggering". Defaults to
       "replace", except when the isolate command is used which implies the "isolate" job
       mode.

       If "fail" is specified and a requested operation conflicts with a pending job (more
       specifically: causes an already pending start job to be reversed into a stop job or
       vice versa), cause the operation to fail.

       If "replace" (the default) is specified, any conflicting pending job will be
       replaced, as necessary.

       If "replace-irreversibly" is specified, operate like "replace", but also mark the new
       jobs as irreversible. This prevents future conflicting transactions from replacing
       these jobs (or even being enqueued while the irreversible jobs are still pending).
       Irreversible jobs can still be cancelled using the cancel command. This job mode
       should be used on any transaction which pulls in shutdown.target.

       "isolate" is only valid for start operations and causes all other units to be stopped
       when the specified unit is started. This mode is always used when the isolate command
       is used.

       "flush" will cause all queued jobs to be canceled when the new job is enqueued.

       If "ignore-dependencies" is specified, then all unit dependencies are ignored for
       this new job and the operation is executed immediately. If passed, no required units
       of the unit passed will be pulled in, and no ordering dependencies will be honored.
       This is mostly a debugging and rescue tool for the administrator and should not be
       used by applications.

       "ignore-requirements" is similar to "ignore-dependencies", but only causes the
       requirement dependencies to be ignored, the ordering dependencies will still be
       honored.

       "triggering" may only be used with systemctl stop. In this mode, the specified unit
       and any active units that trigger it are stopped. See the discussion of Triggers= in
       systemd.unit(5) for more information about triggering units.

   -T, --show-transaction
       When enqueuing a unit job (for example as effect of a systemctl start invocation or
       similar), show brief information about all jobs enqueued, covering both the requested
       job and any added because of unit dependencies. Note that the output will only
       include jobs immediately part of the transaction requested. It is possible that
       service start-up program code run as effect of the enqueued jobs might request
       further jobs to be pulled in. This means that completion of the listed jobs might
       ultimately entail more jobs than the listed ones.

   --fail
       Shorthand for --job-mode=fail.

       When used with the kill command, if no units were killed, the operation results in an
       error.

   -i, --ignore-inhibitors
       When system shutdown or a sleep state is requested, ignore inhibitor locks.
       Applications can establish inhibitor locks to avoid that certain important operations
       (such as CD burning or suchlike) are interrupted by system shutdown or a sleep state.
       Any user may take these locks and privileged users may override these locks. If any
       locks are taken, shutdown and sleep state requests will normally fail (unless
       privileged) and a list of active locks is printed. However, if --ignore-inhibitors is
       specified, the established locks are ignored and not shown, and the operation
       attempted anyway, possibly requiring additional privileges.

   --dry-run
       Just print what would be done. Currently supported by verbs halt, poweroff, reboot,
       kexec, suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-hibernate, default, rescue,
       emergency, and exit.

   -q, --quiet
       Suppress printing of the results of various commands and also the hints about
       truncated log lines. This does not suppress output of commands for which the printed
       output is the only result (like show). Errors are always printed.

   --no-block
       Do not synchronously wait for the requested operation to finish. If this is not
       specified, the job will be verified, enqueued and systemctl will wait until the
       unit's start-up is completed. By passing this argument, it is only verified and
       enqueued. This option may not be combined with --wait.

   --wait
       Synchronously wait for started units to terminate again. This option may not be
       combined with --no-block. Note that this will wait forever if any given unit never
       terminates (by itself or by getting stopped explicitly); particularly services which
       use "RemainAfterExit=yes".

       When used with is-system-running, wait until the boot process is completed before
       returning.

   --user
       Talk to the service manager of the calling user, rather than the service manager of
       the system.

   --system
       Talk to the service manager of the system. This is the implied default.

   --failed
       List units in failed state. This is equivalent to --state=failed.

   --no-wall
       Do not send wall message before halt, power-off and reboot.

   --global
       When used with enable and disable, operate on the global user configuration
       directory, thus enabling or disabling a unit file globally for all future logins of
       all users.

   --no-reload
       When used with enable and disable, do not implicitly reload daemon configuration
       after executing the changes.

   --no-ask-password
       When used with start and related commands, disables asking for passwords. Background
       services may require input of a password or passphrase string, for example to unlock
       system hard disks or cryptographic certificates. Unless this option is specified and
       the command is invoked from a terminal, systemctl will query the user on the terminal
       for the necessary secrets. Use this option to switch this behavior off. In this case,
       the password must be supplied by some other means (for example graphical password
       agents) or the service might fail. This also disables querying the user for
       authentication for privileged operations.

   --kill-who=
       When used with kill, choose which processes to send a signal to. Must be one of main,
       control or all to select whether to kill only the main process, the control process
       or all processes of the unit. The main process of the unit is the one that defines
       the life-time of it. A control process of a unit is one that is invoked by the
       manager to induce state changes of it. For example, all processes started due to the
       ExecStartPre=, ExecStop= or ExecReload= settings of service units are control
       processes. Note that there is only one control process per unit at a time, as only
       one state change is executed at a time. For services of type Type=forking, the
       initial process started by the manager for ExecStart= is a control process, while the
       process ultimately forked off by that one is then considered the main process of the
       unit (if it can be determined). This is different for service units of other types,
       where the process forked off by the manager for ExecStart= is always the main process
       itself. A service unit consists of zero or one main process, zero or one control
       process plus any number of additional processes. Not all unit types manage processes
       of these types however. For example, for mount units, control processes are defined
       (which are the invocations of /bin/mount and /bin/umount), but no main process is
       defined. If omitted, defaults to all.

   -s, --signal=
       When used with kill, choose which signal to send to selected processes. Must be one
       of the well-known signal specifiers such as SIGTERM, SIGINT or SIGSTOP. If omitted,
       defaults to SIGTERM.

   --what=
       Select what type of per-unit resources to remove when the clean command is invoked,
       see below. Takes one of configuration, state, cache, logs, runtime to select the type
       of resource. This option may be specified more than once, in which case all specified
       resource types are removed. Also accepts the special value all as a shortcut for
       specifying all five resource types. If this option is not specified defaults to the
       combination of cache and runtime, i.e. the two kinds of resources that are generally
       considered to be redundant and can be reconstructed on next invocation.

   -f, --force
       When used with enable, overwrite any existing conflicting symlinks.

       When used with edit, create all of the specified units which do not already exist.

       When used with halt, poweroff, reboot or kexec, execute the selected operation
       without shutting down all units. However, all processes will be killed forcibly and
       all file systems are unmounted or remounted read-only. This is hence a drastic but
       relatively safe option to request an immediate reboot. If --force is specified twice
       for these operations (with the exception of kexec), they will be executed
       immediately, without terminating any processes or unmounting any file systems.
       Warning: specifying --force twice with any of these operations might result in data
       loss. Note that when --force is specified twice the selected operation is executed by
       systemctl itself, and the system manager is not contacted. This means the command
       should succeed even when the system manager has crashed.

   --message=
       When used with halt, poweroff or reboot, set a short message explaining the reason
       for the operation. The message will be logged together with the default shutdown
       message.

   --now
       When used with enable, the units will also be started. When used with disable or
       mask, the units will also be stopped. The start or stop operation is only carried out
       when the respective enable or disable operation has been successful.

   --root=
       When used with enable/disable/is-enabled (and related commands), use the specified
       root path when looking for unit files. If this option is present, systemctl will
       operate on the file system directly, instead of communicating with the systemd daemon
       to carry out changes.

   --runtime
       When used with enable, disable, edit, (and related commands), make changes only
       temporarily, so that they are lost on the next reboot. This will have the effect that
       changes are not made in subdirectories of /etc but in /run, with identical immediate
       effects, however, since the latter is lost on reboot, the changes are lost too.

       Similarly, when used with set-property, make changes only temporarily, so that they
       are lost on the next reboot.

   --preset-mode=
       Takes one of "full" (the default), "enable-only", "disable-only". When used with the
       preset or preset-all commands, controls whether units shall be disabled and enabled
       according to the preset rules, or only enabled, or only disabled.

   -n, --lines=
       When used with status, controls the number of journal lines to show, counting from
       the most recent ones. Takes a positive integer argument, or 0 to disable journal
       output. Defaults to 10.

   -o, --output=
       When used with status, controls the formatting of the journal entries that are shown.
       For the available choices, see journalctl(1). Defaults to "short".

   --firmware-setup
       When used with the reboot command, indicate to the system's firmware to reboot into
       the firmware setup interface. Note that this functionality is not available on all
       systems.

   --boot-loader-menu=
       When used with the reboot command, indicate to the system's boot loader to show the
       boot loader menu on the following boot. Takes a time value as parameter ‚Äî indicating
       the menu time-out. Pass zero in order to disable the menu time-out. Note that not all
       boot loaders support this functionality.

   --boot-loader-entry=
       When used with the reboot command, indicate to the system's boot loader to boot into
       a specific boot loader entry on the following boot. Takes a boot loader entry
       identifier as argument, or "help" in order to list available entries. Note that not
       all boot loaders support this functionality.

   --plain
       When used with list-dependencies, list-units or list-machines, the output is printed
       as a list instead of a tree, and the bullet circles are omitted.

   -H, --host=
       Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username and hostname
       separated by "@", to connect to. The hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port
       ssh is listening on, separated by ":", and then a container name, separated by "/",
       which connects directly to a specific container on the specified host. This will use
       SSH to talk to the remote machine manager instance. Container names may be enumerated
       with machinectl -H HOST. Put IPv6 addresses in brackets.

   -M, --machine=
       Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to connect to.

   --no-pager
       Do not pipe output into a pager.

   --no-legend
       Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with hints.

   -h, --help
       Print a short help text and exit.

   --version
       Print a short version string and exit.

EXIT STATUS
========================================================
   On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

   systemctl uses the return codes defined by LSB, as defined in LSB 3.0.0[2].

   The mapping of LSB service states to systemd unit states is imperfect, so it is better to
   not rely on those return values but to look for specific unit states and substates
   instead.

ENVIRONMENT
========================================================
   $SYSTEMD_EDITOR
       Editor to use when editing units; overrides $EDITOR and $VISUAL. If neither
       $SYSTEMD_EDITOR nor $EDITOR nor $VISUAL are present or if it is set to an empty
       string or if their execution failed, systemctl will try to execute well known editors
       in this order: editor(1), nano(1), vim(1), vi(1).

   $SYSTEMD_PAGER
       Pager to use when --no-pager is not given; overrides $PAGER. If neither
       $SYSTEMD_PAGER nor $PAGER are set, a set of well-known pager implementations are
       tried in turn, including less(1) and more(1), until one is found. If no pager
       implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this environment variable
       to an empty string or the value "cat" is equivalent to passing --no-pager.

   $SYSTEMD_LESS
       Override the options passed to less (by default "FRSXMK").

       Users might want to change two options in particular:

       K
           This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is pressed. To
           allow less to handle Ctrl+C itself to switch back to the pager command prompt,
           unset this option.

           If the value of $SYSTEMD_LESS does not include "K", and the pager that is invoked
           is less, Ctrl+C will be ignored by the executable, and needs to be handled by the
           pager.

       X
           This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and
           deinitialization strings to the terminal. It is set by default to allow command
           output to remain visible in the terminal even after the pager exits.
           Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from working, in particular
           paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

       See less(1) for more discussion.

   $SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET
       Override the charset passed to less (by default "utf-8", if the invoking terminal is
       determined to be UTF-8 compatible).

   $SYSTEMD_COLORS
       The value must be a boolean. Controls whether colorized output should be generated.
       This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and
       what the console is connected to.

   $SYSTEMD_URLIFY
       The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in
       the output for terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override
       the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and other conditions.
