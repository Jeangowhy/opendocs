~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to install the
`enchant <https://www.abisource.com/projects/enchant/>`__ library that
is used by ``pyenchant`` for spelling.

macOS:
^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

    brew install enchant

After that:

Fork & Clone the repository:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

    git@github.com:your-github-username/django-cms.git

Switch to the django-cms directory:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

    cd django-cms/docs

********
Overview
********

django CMS is a modern web publishing platform built with `Django`_, the web application framework "for
perfectionists with deadlines".

django CMS offers out-of-the-box support for the common features you'd expect
from a CMS, but can also be easily customised and extended by developers to
create a site that is tailored to their precise needs.

***************
Why django CMS?
***************

django CMS is a well-tested CMS platform that powers sites both large and
small. Here are a few of the key features:

* robust internationalisation (i18n) support for creating multilingual sites
* front-end editing, providing rapid access to the content management interface
* support for a variety of editors with advanced text editing features.
* a flexible plugins system that lets developers put powerful tools at the
  fingertips of editors, without overwhelming them with a difficult interface

* ...and much more

There are other capable Django-based CMS platforms but here's why you should
consider django CMS:

* thorough documentation
* easy and comprehensive integration into existing projects - django CMS isn't a monolithic application
* a healthy, active and supportive developer community
* a strong culture of good code, including an emphasis on automated testing

###############
Getting Started
###############

The pages in this section of the documentation are aimed at the newcomer to
django CMS. They're designed to help you get started quickly, and show how
easy it is to work with django CMS as a developer who wants to customise it and
get it working according to their own requirements.

These tutorials take you step-by-step through some key aspects of this work.
They're not intended to explain the :doc:`topics in depth </topics/index>`, or
provide :doc:`reference material </reference/index>`, but they will leave you
with a good idea of what is possible to achieve in just a few steps, and how
to go about it.

Once you're familiar with the basics presented in these tutorials, you'll find
the more in-depth coverage of the same topics in the :doc:`How-to
</how_to/index>` section.

The tutorials follow a logical progression, starting from installation of django CMS and the
creation of a brand new project, and build on each other, so it's recommended to work through them
in the order presented here.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    :numbered:

    01-install
    02-templates_placeholders
    03-integrating_applications
    04-plugins
    05-apphooks
    06-toolbar
    07-menu
    08-wizards
    09-third_party

If you want to install django CMS into an existing project, or prefer to configure django CMS by
hand, rather than using the automated installer, see :doc:`/how_to/install` and then follow the
rest of the tutorials.

Either way, you'll be able to find support and help from the numerous friendly members of the
django CMS community, either on our `Discourse forum <https://discourse.django-cms.org>`_ or `our
Slack group <https://www.django-cms.org/slack>`_.

######################
Installing django CMS
######################

The setup is incredibly simple, and in this django CMS tutorial, we‚Äôll take you through
the first five steps to help get you started.

*****************************
What you need to get started
*****************************

First of all, you don‚Äôt need to be a senior developer or have prior experience as a developer
with Django or Python to create your first django CMS demo website. The added benefit of django CMS, is it‚Äôs free.

Before we begin the django CMS tutorial, you will need to know that there are several ways to
install django CMS for free.

1. You can either set up a project on `Divio Cloud <https://www.django-cms.org/en/blog/2020/07/08/simple-django-cms-installation-with-divio-cloud/>`_, which is fast and useful for people without a technical background and a good starting point to experience the CMS User Interface.

2. As another option, you can set up the project `using docker <https://www.django-cms.org/en/blog/2021/01/19/how-you-spin-up-a-django-cms-project-in-less-than-5-minutes/>`_. It is a good way for a developer locally without an external vendor and we use this option in this django CMS demo.

3. The last option is to install :ref:`django CMS manually by using virtualenv <installation>`. This option is a good way for developers that want to install everything by hand to understand better and have full control.

For the sake of this demonstration we will use Option 2, please read on.

************************
Setup Docker (Step 1)
************************

Install docker from `here <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_

****************************************
Run the demo project in docker (Step 2)
****************************************

Info: The `demo project <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-quickstart>`_ is a minimal
django project with some additional requirements in the requirements.txt.

Open the terminal application on your computer and go to a safe folder (i.e. cd ~/Projects), then:


::

      git clone https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-quickstart.git
      cd django-cms-quickstart
      docker compose build web
      docker compose up -d database_default
      docker compose run web python manage.py migrate
      docker compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser
      docker compose up -d

During the installation process, you will be prompted to enter your email address and set a username and password.
Open your browser and insert ``http://localhost:8000/admin`` there you should be invited to login
and continue with Step 4: create your first page

********************************
Create your first page (Step 3)
********************************

* Once you login you can press Create on the top right.
* Then you will see a pop-up window where the ‚ÄúNew page‚Äù is marked blue.
* Press New Page and select Next.

   :alt: create a page with django cms
   :width: 400
   :align: center


After selecting Next, you will add in your title and some basic text content for the new page,
click Create.

   :alt: create a page with django cms
   :width: 400
   :align: center

Here is your newly created page.

*********************************
Publish your first page (Step 4)
*********************************

The page we just created is just a draft and needs to be published once you finish.
As an editor, only you can see and edit your drafts, other visitors to your site will only see your published pages.

Press "Publish page now."

.. image:: https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/_images/django_cms_demo_page.png
   :alt: publish a page with django cms
   :width: 400
   :align: center

To edit the page, you can switch back into editing mode using the "Edit" button, and
return to the published version of the page using the "view published" button.

In the editing mode, you can double-click on the paragraph of the text to change it,
add formatting, and save it again. Any changes that are made after publishing are saved to a draft and will not be visible until you re-publish.

Congratulations, you now have installed django CMS and created your first page.

If you need to log in at any time, append ``?edit`` to the URL and hit Return. This will enable the
toolbar, from where you can log in and manage your website.

########################
Templates & Placeholders
########################

In this tutorial we'll introduce Placeholders, and we're also going to show how
you can make your own HTML templates CMS-ready.


*********
Templates
*********

You can use HTML templates to customise the look of your website, define
Placeholders to mark sections for managed content and use special tags to
generate menus and more.

You can define multiple templates, with different layouts or built-in
components, and choose them for each page as required. A page's template
can be switched for another at any time.

You'll find the site's templates in ``django-cms-quickstart/backend/templates``.

By default, pages in your site will use the ``fullwidth.html`` template, the first one listed in
the project's ``settings.py`` ``CMS_TEMPLATES`` tuple:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    CMS_TEMPLATES = (
        ## Customize this
        ('fullwidth.html', 'Fullwidth'),
        ('sidebar_left.html', 'Sidebar Left'),
        ('sidebar_right.html', 'Sidebar Right')
    )


************
Placeholders
************

Placeholders are an easy way to define sections in an HTML template that will
be filled with content from the database when the page is rendered. This
content is edited using django CMS's frontend editing mechanism, using Django
template tags.

``fullwidth.html`` contains a single placeholder, ``{% placeholder "content" %}``.

You'll also see ``{% load cms_tags %}`` in that file - ``cms_tags`` is the
required template tag library.

If you're not already familiar with Django template tags, you can find out more in the `Django documentation
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/>`_.

Add a couple of new placeholders to ``fullwidth.html``, ``{% placeholder "feature" %}`` and ``{%
placeholder "splashbox" %}`` inside the ``{% block content %}`` section. For example:

.. code-block:: html+django
   :emphasize-lines: 2,4

    {% block content %}
        {% placeholder "feature" %}
        {% placeholder "content" %}
        {% placeholder "splashbox" %}
    {% endblock content %}

If you switch to *Structure* mode (*button in the upper-right corner of the page*), you'll see the new placeholders available for use.

.... image:: /introduction/images/new-placeholder.png

.. image:: https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/_images/new-placeholder.png
   :alt: the new 'splashbox' placeholder
   :align: center


*******************
Static Placeholders
*******************

The content of the placeholders we've encountered so far is different for
every page. Sometimes though you'll want to have a section on your website
which should be the same on every single page, such as a footer block.

You *could* hard-code your footer into the template, but it would be nicer to be
able to manage it through the CMS. This is what **static placeholders** are for.

Static placeholders are an easy way to display the same content on multiple
locations on your website. Static placeholders act almost like normal
placeholders, except for the fact that once a static placeholder is created and
you added content to it, it will be saved globally. Even when you remove the
static placeholders from a template, you can reuse them later.

So let's add a footer to all our pages. Since we want our footer on every
single page, we should add it to our **base template**
(``mysite/templates/base.html``). Place it near the end of the HTML ``<body>`` element:

.. code-block:: html+django
   :emphasize-lines: 1-3

        <footer>
          {% static_placeholder 'footer' %}
        </footer>


        {% render_block "js" %}
    </body>

Save the template and return to your browser. Refresh any page in Structure mode, and you'll
see the new static placeholder.

.... image:: /introduction/images/static-placeholder.png

.. image:: https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/_images/static-placeholder.png
   :alt: a static placeholder
   :align: center

..  note::

    To reduce clutter in the interface, the plugins in static placeholders are hidden by default.
    Click or tap on the name of the static placeholder to reveal/hide them.

If you add some content to the new static placeholder in the usual way, you'll see that it
appears on your site's other pages too.


***************
Rendering Menus
***************

In order to render the CMS's menu in your template you can use the :doc:`show_menu
</reference/navigation>` tag.

Any template that uses ``show_menu`` must load the CMS's ``menu_tags`` library
first:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load menu_tags %}

The menu we use in ``mysite/templates/base.html`` is:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <ul class="nav">
        {% show_menu 0 100 100 100 %}
    </ul>

The options control the levels of the site hierarchy that are displayed in the menu tree - but you don't need to worry about exactly what they do at this stage.

Next we'll look at :ref:`integrating_applications`.


===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/introduction/03-integrating_applications.rst
===================================================

:sequential_nav: both

.. _integrating_applications:

########################
Integrating applications
########################

All the following sections of this tutorial are concerned with different ways of integrating other
applications into django CMS. The ease with which other applications can be built into django CMS
sites is an important feature of the system.

Integrating applications doesn't merely mean installing them alongside django CMS, so that they peacefully co-exist. It
means using django CMS's features to build them into a single coherent web project that speeds up the work of managing
the site, and makes possible richer and more automated publishing.

It's key to the way that django CMS integration works that **it doesn't require you to modify your other applications**
unless you want to. This is particularly important when you're using third-party applications and don't want to have to
maintain your own forked versions of them. (The only exception to this is if you decide to build django CMS features
directly into the applications themselves, for example when using :ref:`placeholders in other applications
<placeholders_outside_cms>`.)

For this tutorial, we're going to take a basic Django `opinion poll application
<https://github.com/divio/django-polls>`_ and integrate it into the CMS.

So we will:

* incorporate the Polls application into the project
* create a second, independent, *Polls/CMS Integration* application to manage the integration

This way we can integrate the Polls application without having to change anything in it.


*************************************
Incorporate the ``polls`` application
*************************************

Install ``polls``
=================

Install the application from its GitHub repository using ``pip``::

    pip install git+http://git@github.com/divio/django-polls.git#egg=polls

Let's add this application to our project. Add ``'polls'`` to the end of ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in
your project's `settings.py` (see the note on :ref:`installed_apps` about ordering ).

Add the ``poll`` URL configuration to ``urlpatterns`` in the project's ``urls.py``:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    urlpatterns += i18n_patterns(
        re_path(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        re_path(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls')),
        re_path(r'^', include('cms.urls')),
    )

Note that it must be included **before** the line for the django CMS URLs. django CMS's URL pattern
needs to be last, because it "swallows up" anything that hasn't already been matched by a previous
pattern.

Now run the application's migrations:

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py migrate polls

At this point you should be able to log in to the Django
admin - ``http://localhost:8000/admin/`` - and find the Polls application.

.... image:: /introduction/images/polls-admin.png

.. image:: https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/_images/polls-admin.png
   :alt: the polls application admin
   :width: 400
   :align: center

Create a new **Poll**, for example:

* **Question**: *Which browser do you prefer?*

  **Choices**:

    * *Safari*
    * *Firefox*
    * *Chrome*

Now if you visit ``http://localhost:8000/en/polls/``, you should be able to see the published poll
and submit a response.

.... image:: /introduction/images/polls-unintegrated.png

.. image:: https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/_images/polls-unintegrated.png
   :alt: the polls application
   :width: 400
   :align: center


Improve the templates for Polls
===============================

You'll have noticed that in the Polls application we only have minimal templates, and no navigation or styling.

Our django CMS pages on the other hand have access to a number of default templates in the project, all of which
extend one called ``base.html``. So, let's improve this by overriding the polls application's base template.

We'll do this in the *project* directory.

In ``mysite/templates``, add ``polls/base.html``, containing:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends 'base.html' %}

    {% block content %}
        {% block polls_content %}
        {% endblock %}
    {% endblock %}

Refresh the ``/polls/`` page again, which should now be properly integrated into the site.

.... image:: /introduction/images/polls-integrated.png

.. image:: https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/_images/polls-integrated.png
   :alt: the polls application, integrated
   :width: 400
   :align: center



**************************************************
Set up a new ``polls_cms_integration`` application
**************************************************

So far, however, the Polls application has been integrated into the project, but not into django CMS itself. The two
applications are completely independent. They cannot make use of each other's data or functionality.

Let's create the new *Polls/CMS Integration* application where we will bring them together.


Create the application
======================

Create a new package at the project root called ``polls_cms_integration``::

    python manage.py startapp polls_cms_integration

Our workspace now looks like this::

    tutorial-project/
        media/
        mysite/
        polls_cms_integration/  # the newly-created application
            __init__.py
            admin.py
            models.py
            migrations.py
            tests.py
            views.py
        static/
        manage.py
        project.db
        requirements.txt


Add it to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
============================

Next is to integrate the ``polls_cms_integration`` application into the project.

Add ``polls_cms_integration`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``  - and now we're ready to use it to begin
integrating Polls with django CMS. We'll start by :ref:`developing a Polls plugin <plugins_tutorial>`.

.. note::

    **Adding templates to the project or to the application?**

    Earlier, we added new templates to the project. We could equally well have have added ``templates/polls/base.html``
    inside ``polls_cms_integration``. After all, that's where we're going to be doing all the other integration work.

    However, we'd now have an application that makes assumptions about the name of the template it should extend (see
    the first line of the ``base.html`` template we created) which might not be correct for a different project.

    Also, we'd have to make sure that ``polls_cms_integration`` came *before* ``polls`` in ``INSTALLED_APPS``,
    otherwise the templates in ``polls_cms_integration`` would not in fact override the ones in ``polls``. Putting
    them in the project guarantees that they will override those in all applications.

    Either way of doing it is reasonable, as long as you understand their implications.


===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/introduction/04-plugins.rst
===================================================

:sequential_nav: both

.. _plugins_tutorial:

#######
Plugins
#######

In this tutorial we're going to take a basic Django opinion poll application and integrate it into
the CMS.


*********************************
Create a plugin model
*********************************

In the ``models.py`` of ``polls_cms_integration`` add the following:

..  code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from cms.models import CMSPlugin
    from polls.models import Poll


    class PollPluginModel(CMSPlugin):
        poll = models.ForeignKey(Poll, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.poll.question


This creates a plugin model class; these all inherit from the
:class:`cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin` base class.

.. note::

    django CMS plugins inherit from :class:`cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin` (or a
    sub-class thereof) and not :class:`models.Model <django.db.models.Model>`.

Create and run migrations:

..  code-block:: bash

    python manage.py makemigrations polls_cms_integration
    python manage.py migrate polls_cms_integration


The Plugin Class
================

Now create a new file ``cms_plugins.py`` in the same folder your ``models.py`` is in.
The plugin class is responsible for providing django CMS with the necessary
information to render your plugin.

For our poll plugin, we're going to write the following plugin class:

.. code-block:: python

    from cms.plugin_base import CMSPluginBase
    from cms.plugin_pool import plugin_pool
    from polls_cms_integration.models import PollPluginModel
    from django.utils.translation import gettext as _


    @plugin_pool.register_plugin  # register the plugin
    class PollPluginPublisher(CMSPluginBase):
        model = PollPluginModel  # model where plugin data are saved
        module = _("Polls")
        name = _("Poll Plugin")  # name of the plugin in the interface
        render_template = "polls_cms_integration/poll_plugin.html"

        def render(self, context, instance, placeholder):
            context.update({'instance': instance})
            return context

.. note::

    All plugin classes must inherit from :class:`cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase`
    and must register themselves with the :class:`plugin_pool <cms.plugin_pool.PluginPool>`.

A reasonable convention for plugin naming is:

* ``PollPluginModel``: the *model* class
* ``PollPluginPublisher``: the *plugin* class

You don't need to follow this convention, but choose one that makes sense and stick to it.


The template
============

The ``render_template`` attribute in the plugin class is required, and tells the plugin which
:attr:`render_template <cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase.render_template>` to use when rendering.

In this case the template needs to be at ``polls_cms_integration/templates/polls_cms_integration/poll_plugin.html`` and should look something like this:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <h1>{{ instance.poll.question }}</h1>

    <form action="{% url 'polls:vote' instance.poll.id %}" method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <div class="form-group">
            {% for choice in instance.poll.choice_set.all %}
                <div class="radio">
                    <label>
                        <input type="radio" name="choice" value="{{ choice.id }}">
                        {{ choice.choice_text }}
                    </label>
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
        </div>
        <input type="submit" value="Vote" />
    </form>


***************************************************
Test the plugin
***************************************************

Now you can restart the runserver (required because you added the new ``cms_plugins.py`` file, and
visit http://localhost:8000/.

You can now drop the ``Poll Plugin`` into any placeholder on any page, just as
you would any other plugin.

.... image:: /introduction/images/poll-plugin-in-menu.png

.. image:: https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/_images/poll-plugin-in-menu.png
   :alt: the 'Poll plugin' in the plugin selector
   :width: 400
   :align: center

Next we'll integrate the Polls application more fully into our django CMS
project.


===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/introduction/05-apphooks.rst
===================================================

:sequential_nav: both

.. _apphooks_introduction:

########
Apphooks
########

Right now, our Django Polls application is statically hooked into the project's
``urls.py``. This is all right, but we can do more, by attaching applications to
django CMS pages.


*****************
Create an apphook
*****************

We do this with an **apphook**, created using a :class:`CMSApp
<cms.app_base.CMSApp>` sub-class, which tells the CMS how to include that application.


Create the apphook class
========================

Apphooks live in a file called ``cms_apps.py``, so create one in your Polls/CMS Integration
application, i.e. in ``polls_cms_integration``.

This is a very basic example of an apphook for a django CMS application:

.. code-block:: python

    from cms.app_base import CMSApp
    from cms.apphook_pool import apphook_pool


    @apphook_pool.register  # register the application
    class PollsApphook(CMSApp):
        app_name = "polls"
        name = "Polls Application"

        def get_urls(self, page=None, language=None, **kwargs):
            return ["polls.urls"]


In this ``PollsApphook`` class, we have done several key things:

* ``app_name`` attribute gives the system a unique way to refer to the apphook. You can see from
  `Django Polls <https://github.com/divio/django-polls/blob/master/polls/urls.py#L6>`_ that the
  application namespace ``polls`` is hard-coded into the application, so this attribute **must**
  also be ``polls``.
* ``name`` is a human-readable name, and will be displayed to the admin user.
* ``get_urls()`` method is what actually hooks the application in, returning a
  list of URL configurations that will be made active wherever the apphook is used - in this case,
  it will use the ``urls.py`` from ``polls``.


Remove the old ``polls`` entry from the project's ``urls.py``
=============================================================

You must now remove the entry for the Polls application::

    re_path(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls', namespace='polls'))

from your project's ``urls.py``.

Not only is it not required there, because we reach the polls via the apphook
instead, but if you leave it there, it will conflict with the apphook's URL handling. You'll
receive a warning in the logs::

    URL namespace 'polls' isn't unique. You may not be able to reverse all URLs in this namespace.


Restart the runserver
=====================

**Restart the runserver**. This is necessary because we have created a new file containing Python
code that won't be loaded until the server restarts. You only have to do this the first time the
new file has been created.


.. _apply_apphook:

***************************
Apply the apphook to a page
***************************

Now we need to create a new page, and attach the Polls application to it through this apphook.

Create and save a new page, then publish it.

..  note:: Your apphook won't work until the page has been published.

In its *Advanced settings* (from the toolbar, select *Page > Advanced settings...*) choose "Polls
Application" from the *Application* pop-up menu, and save once more.

.... image:: /introduction/images/select-application.png

.. image:: https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/_images/select-application.png
   :alt: select the 'Polls' application
   :width: 400
   :align: center

Refresh the page, and you'll find that the Polls application is now available
directly from the new django CMS page.

..  important::

    Don't add child pages to a page with an apphook.

    The apphook "swallows" all URLs below that of the page, handing them over to the attached
    application. If you have any child pages of the apphooked page, django CMS will not be
    able to serve them reliably.


===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/introduction/06-toolbar.rst
===================================================

:sequential_nav: both

.. _toolbar_introduction:

#####################
Extending the toolbar
#####################

django CMS allows you to control what appears in the toolbar. This allows you
to integrate your application in the frontend editing mode of django CMS and
provide your users with a streamlined editing experience.

In this section of the tutorial, we will add a new *Polls* menu to the toolbar.


*********************************
Add a basic ``PollToolbar`` class
*********************************

We'll add various controls to the toolbar, using a ``cms.toolbar_base.CMSToolbar`` sub-class.


Add a menu to the toolbar
=========================

Start by adding a new file, ``cms_toolbars.py``, to your Polls/CMS Integration application, and
create the ``CMSToolbar`` class:

..  code-block:: python

    from cms.toolbar_base import CMSToolbar
    from cms.toolbar_pool import toolbar_pool
    from polls.models import Poll


    class PollToolbar(CMSToolbar):

        def populate(self):
            self.toolbar.get_or_create_menu(
                'polls_cms_integration-polls',  # a unique key for this menu
                'Polls',                        # the text that should appear in the menu
                )


    # register the toolbar
    toolbar_pool.register(PollToolbar)


..  note::

    Don't forget to restart the runserver to have your new ``cms_toolbars.py`` file recognised.

You will now find, in every page of the site, a new item in the toolbar:

.... image:: /introduction/images/toolbar-polls.png

.. image:: https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/_images/toolbar-polls.png
   :alt: The Polls menu in the toolbars
   :width: 630

The ``populate()`` method is what gets called when the toolbar is built. In it, we're using
:meth:`get_or_create_menu() <cms.toolbar.toolbar.CMSToolbar.get_or_create_menu()>` to add a *Polls*
item to the toolbar.


.. _add-nodes-to-polls-menu:

Add nodes to the *Polls* menu
-----------------------------

So far, the *Polls* menu is empty. We can extend ``populate()`` to add some items.
``get_or_create_menu`` returns a menu that we can manipulate, so let's change the ``populate()``
method to add an item that allows us to see the full list of polls in the sideframe, with
:meth:`add_sideframe_item() <cms.toolbar.items.ToolbarAPIMixin.add_sideframe_item()>`.

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 1, 8, 10-13

    from cms.utils.urlutils import admin_reverse
    [...]


    class PollToolbar(CMSToolbar):

        def populate(self):
            menu = self.toolbar.get_or_create_menu('polls_cms_integration-polls', 'Polls')

            menu.add_sideframe_item(
                name='Poll list',                              # name of the new menu item
                url=admin_reverse('polls_poll_changelist'),    # the URL it should open with
            )

After refreshing the page to load the changes, you can now see the list of polls directly from
the menu.

Also useful would be an option to create new polls. We'll use a modal window for this, invoked with
:meth:`add_modal_item() <cms.toolbar.items.ToolbarAPIMixin.add_modal_item()>`. Add the new code to the
end of the ``populate()`` method:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 6-9

    class PollToolbar(CMSToolbar):

        def populate(self):
            [...]

            menu.add_modal_item(
                name='Add a new poll',                # name of the new menu item
                url=admin_reverse('polls_poll_add'),  # the URL it should open with
            )


Add buttons to the toolbar
==========================

As well as menus, you can add buttons to the toolbar in a very similar way. Rewrite the
``populate()`` method, noting how closely the structure of this code matches that for adding menus.

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3-13

    def populate(self):

        buttonlist = self.toolbar.add_button_list()

        buttonlist.add_sideframe_button(
            name='Poll list',
            url=admin_reverse('polls_poll_changelist'),
        )

        buttonlist.add_modal_button(
            name='Add a new poll',
            url=admin_reverse('polls_poll_add'),
        )


*******************
Further refinements
*******************

The buttons and menu for Polls appear in the toolbar everywhere in the site. It would be useful to
restrict this to pages that are actually relevant.

The first thing to add is a test right at the start of the ``populate()`` method:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3-4

        def populate(self):

            if not self.is_current_app:
                return

            [...]

The ``is_current_app`` flag tells us if the function handling this view (e.g. the list of polls)
belongs to the same application as the one responsible for this toolbar menu.

Often, this can be detected automatically, but in this case, the view belongs to the ``polls``
application, whereas the toolbar menu belongs to ``polls_cms_integration``. So, we need to tell the
``PollToolbar`` class explicitly that it's actually associated with the ``polls`` application:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    class PollToolbar(CMSToolbar):

        supported_apps = ['polls']

Now, the buttons/menu will only appear in relevant pages.


********************************
The complete ``cms_toolbars.py``
********************************

For completeness, here is the full example:

..  code-block:: python

    from cms.utils.urlutils import admin_reverse

    class PollToolbar(CMSToolbar):
        supported_apps = ['polls']

        def populate(self):

            if not self.is_current_app:
                return

            menu = self.toolbar.get_or_create_menu('polls_cms_integration-polls', 'Polls')

            menu.add_sideframe_item(
                name='Poll list',
                url=admin_reverse('polls_poll_changelist'),
            )

            menu.add_modal_item(
                name=('Add a new poll'),
                url=admin_reverse('polls_poll_add'),
            )

            buttonlist = self.toolbar.add_button_list()

            buttonlist.add_sideframe_button(
                name='Poll list',
                url=admin_reverse('polls_poll_changelist'),
            )

            buttonlist.add_modal_button(
                name='Add a new poll',
                url=admin_reverse('polls_poll_add'),
            )

    toolbar_pool.register(PollToolbar)  # register the toolbar

This is just a basic example, and there's a lot more to django CMS toolbar classes than this - see
:ref:`toolbar_how_to` for more.

#############################
Extending the navigation menu
#############################

You may have noticed that while our Polls application has been integrated into
the CMS, with plugins, toolbar menu items and so on, the site's navigation menu
is still only determined by django CMS Pages.

We can hook into the django CMS menu system to add our own nodes to that
navigation menu.


**************************
Create the navigation menu
**************************

We create the menu using a :class:`CMSAttachMenu <cms.menu_bases.CMSAttachMenu>` sub-class, and use the ``get_nodes()``
method to add the nodes.

For this we need a file called ``cms_menus.py`` in our application. Add ``cms_menus.py`` in ``polls_cms_integration/``:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.urls import reverse
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

    from cms.menu_bases import CMSAttachMenu
    from menus.base import NavigationNode
    from menus.menu_pool import menu_pool

    from polls.models import Poll


    class PollsMenu(CMSAttachMenu):
        name = _("Polls Menu")  # give the menu a name this is required.

        def get_nodes(self, request):
            """
            This method is used to build the menu tree.
            """
            nodes = []
            for poll in Poll.objects.all():
                node = NavigationNode(
                    title=poll.question,
                    url=reverse('polls:detail', args=(poll.pk,)),
                    id=poll.pk,  # unique id for this node within the menu
                )
                nodes.append(node)
            return nodes

    menu_pool.register_menu(PollsMenu)


What's happening here:

* we define a ``PollsMenu`` class, and register it
* we give the class a ``name`` attribute (will be displayed in admin)
* in its ``get_nodes()`` method, we build and return a list of nodes, where:
* first we get all the ``Poll`` objects
* ... and then create a ``NavigationNode`` object from each one
* ... and return a list of these ``NavigationNodes``

This menu class won't actually do anything until attached to a page. In the *Advanced settings* of the page to which
you attached the apphook earlier, select "Polls Menu" from the list of *Attached menu* options, and save once more.
(You could add the menu to any page, but it makes most sense to add it to this page.)

.... image:: /introduction/images/attach-menu.png

.. image:: https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/_images/attach-menu.png
   :alt: select the 'Polls Menu'
   :width: 400
   :align: center

You can force the menu to be added automatically to the page by the apphook if you consider this appropriate. See
:ref:`apphook_menus` for information on how to do that.

..  note::

    The point here is to illustrate the basic principles. In this actual case, note that:

    * If you're going to use sub-pages, you'll need to improve the menu styling to make it work a
      bit better.
    * Since the Polls page lists all the Polls in it anyway, this isn't really the most practical
      addition to the menu.

===================================================

:sequential_nav: both

########################
Content creation wizards
########################

Content creation wizards allow you to make use of the toolbar's **Create** button in your own
applications. It opens up a simple dialog box with the basic fields required to create a new item.

django CMS uses it for creating Pages, but you can add your own models to it.

In the ``polls_cms_integration`` application, add a ``forms.py`` file::

    from django import forms

    from polls.models import Poll


    class PollWizardForm(forms.ModelForm):
        class Meta:
            model = Poll
            exclude = []

Then add a ``cms_wizards.py`` file, containing::

    from cms.wizards.wizard_base import Wizard
    from cms.wizards.wizard_pool import wizard_pool

    from polls_cms_integration.forms import PollWizardForm


    class PollWizard(Wizard):
        pass

    poll_wizard = PollWizard(
        title="Poll",
        weight=200,  # determines the ordering of wizards in the Create dialog
        form=PollWizardForm,
        description="Create a new Poll",
    )

    wizard_pool.register(poll_wizard)

Refresh the Polls page, hit the **Create** button in the toolbar - and the wizard dialog will open,
offering you a new wizard for creating Polls.

.. note::

    Once again, this particular example is for illustration only. In the case of a Poll, with
    its multiple Questions associated with it via foreign keys, we really want to be able to
    edit those questions at the same time too.

    That would require a much more sophisticated form and processing than is possible within the
    scope of this tutorial.

#####################################
Integrating a third-party application
#####################################

We've already written our own django CMS plugins and apps, but now we want to
extend our CMS with a third-party application,
`Djangocms-Blog <https://github.com/nephila/djangocms-blog>`_.


******************
Basic installation
******************

First, we need to install the app into our virtual environment from
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org>`_::

    pip install djangocms-blog


***************
Django settings
***************

``INSTALLED_APPS``
==================

Add the application and any of its requirements that are not there already to
``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``. Some *will* be already present; it's up
to you to check them because you need to avoid duplication:

.. code-block:: python

    # you will probably need to add:
    'filer',
    'easy_thumbnails',
    'aldryn_apphooks_config',
    'parler',
    'taggit',
    'taggit_autosuggest',
    'meta',
    'sortedm2m',
    'djangocms_blog',


``THUMBNAIL_PROCESSORS``
========================

One of the dependencies is Django Filer. It provides a special feature that allows more
sophisticated image cropping.

.. code-block:: python

    THUMBNAIL_PROCESSORS = (
        'easy_thumbnails.processors.colorspace',
        'easy_thumbnails.processors.autocrop',
        'filer.thumbnail_processors.scale_and_crop_with_subject_location',
        'easy_thumbnails.processors.filters',
    )
    
    META_SITE_PROTOCOL = 'https'  # set 'http' for non ssl enabled websites
    META_USE_SITES = True


``URL Patterns``
=======================

Add the following url pattern to the main urls.py:

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns += [
        url(r'^taggit_autosuggest/', include('taggit_autosuggest.urls')),
    ]


********************
Migrate the database
********************

We've added a new application so we need to update our database::

    python manage.py migrate

Start the server again.


***************************
Create a new apphooked page
***************************

The News & Blog application comes with a django CMS apphook, so add a new django CMS page (call it
*Blog*), and add the Blog application to it :ref:`just as you did for Polls
<apply_apphook>`.

For this application we also need to create and select an *Application configuration*.

Give this application configuration some settings:

* ``Instance namespace``: *article* (this is used for reversing URLs)
* ``Application title``: *Blog* (the name that will represent the application configuration in the
  admin)
* ``Permalink type``: choose a format you prefer for news article URLs

Save this application configuration, and make sure it's selected in ``Application configurations``.

Publish the new page, and you should find the Blog application at work there. (Until you
actually create any articles, it will simply inform you that there are *No items available*.)


****************************
Add new News & Blog articles
****************************

You can add new articles using the admin or the new *Blog* menu that now appears in the toolbar when you are on a page belonging to Blog.

#################################
How to install django CMS by hand
#################################

The easiest way to install django CMS is by using the automated `django CMS installer
<https://github.com/nephila/djangocms-installer>`_. This is the recommended way to start with new projects, and it's
what we use in the :ref:`tutorial section of this documentation <tutorials>`.

If you prefer to do things manually, this how-to guide will take you through the process.

..  note::

    You can also use this guide to help you install django CMS as part of an existing project. However, the guide
    assumes that you are starting with a blank project, so you will need to adapt the steps below appropriately as
    required.

This document assumes you have some basic familiarity with Python and Django. After you've integrated django CMS into
your project, you should be able to follow the :doc:`/introduction/index` for an introduction to developing with django
CMS.


******************************
Install the django CMS package
******************************

Check the :ref:`Python/Django requirements <requirements>` for this version of django CMS.

django CMS also has other requirements, which it lists as dependencies in its ``setup.py``.

..  important::

    We strongly recommend doing all of the following steps in a virtual environment. You ought to know how to create,
    activate and dispose of virtual environments using `venv <https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/venv.html>`_. If you don't, you
    can use the steps below to get started, but you are advised to take a few minutes to learn the basics of using
    virtualenv before proceeding further.

    ..  code-block:: bash

        python3 -m venv venv # create a virtualenv
        source venv/bin/activate  # activate it

    For the cms to work correctly, you will need django version 3.2.
    Work with newer versions can be unstable.
    You can install recommended version of django with following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install django==3.2

In an activated virtualenv, run::

	pip install --upgrade pip

to make sure ``pip`` is up-to-date, as earlier versions can be less reliable.

Then::

    pip install django-cms

to install the latest stable version of django CMS.


****************************************
Create a new project
****************************************

Create a new project::

    django-admin startproject myproject

If this is new to you, you ought to read the `official Django tutorial
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/>`_, which covers starting a new project.

Your new project will look like this::

    myproject
        myproject
            __init__.py
            asgi.py
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py
        manage.py


********************************************
Minimally-required applications and settings
********************************************

Open the new project's ``settings.py`` file in your text editor.


INSTALLED_APPS
==============

You will need to add the following to its list of ``INSTALLED_APPS``::

    'django.contrib.sites',
    'cms',
    'menus',
    'treebeard',

* django CMS needs to use Django's :mod:`django:django.contrib.sites` framework. You'll need to set a ``SITE_ID``
  in the settings - ``SITE_ID = 1`` will suffice.
* ``cms`` and ``menus`` are the core django CMS modules.
* `django-treebeard <http://django-treebeard.readthedocs.io>`_ is used to manage django CMS's page and plugin tree
  structures.

django CMS installs `django CMS admin style <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-admin-style>`_.
This provides some styling that helps make django CMS administration components easier to work with.
Technically it's an optional component and does not need to be enabled in your project,
but it's strongly recommended.

In the ``INSTALLED_APPS``, **before** ``django.contrib.admin``, add::

    'djangocms_admin_style',


Language settings
=================

django CMS requires you to set the :setting:`django:LANGUAGES` setting. This should list all the languages you want
your project to serve, and must include the language in :setting:`django:LANGUAGE_CODE`.

For example::

    LANGUAGES = [
        ('en', 'English'),
        ('de', 'German'),
    ]

(For simplicity's sake, at this stage it is worth changing the default ``en-us`` in that you'll find in the
``LANGUAGE_CODE`` setting to ``en``.)


********
Database
********

django CMS requires a relational database backend. Each django CMS installation should have its own database.

You can use SQLite, which is included in Python and doesn't need to be installed separately or configured further. You
are unlikely to be using that for a project in production, but it's ideal for development and exploration, especially
as it is configured by default in a new Django project's :setting:`django:DATABASES`::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }

..  note::

    For deployment, you'll need to use a :doc:`production-ready database with Django <django:ref/databases>`. We
    recommend using `PostgreSQL`_ or `MySQL`_.

    Installing and maintaining database systems is far beyond the scope of this documentation, but is very well
    documented on the systems' respective websites.

    .. _PostgreSQL: http://www.postgresql.org/
    .. _MySQL: http://www.mysql.com

    Whichever database you use, it will also require the appropriate Python adaptor to be installed::

        pip install psycopg2     # for Postgres
        pip install mysqlclient  # for MySQL

    Refer to :setting:`Django's DATABASES setting documentation <django:DATABASES>` for the appropriate configuration
    for your chosen database backend.


Database tables
===============

Now run migrations to create database tables for the new applications::

    python manage.py migrate


Admin user
==========

Create an admin superuser::

    python manage.py createsuperuser


*************************************
Using ``cms check`` for configuration
*************************************

Once you have completed the minimum required set-up described above, you can use django CMS's built-in ``cms check``
command to help you identify and install other components. Run::

    python manage.py cms check

This will check your configuration, your applications and your database, and report on any problems.

..  note::

    If key components are be missing, django CMS will be unable to run the ``cms check command`` and will simply raise
    an error instead.

After each of the steps below run ``cms check`` to verify that you have resolved that item in its checklist.


Sekizai
=======

`Django Sekizai <https://github.com/ojii/django-sekizai>`_ is required by the CMS for static files management. You need
to have ``'sekizai'`` listed in ``INSTALLED_APPS``, 

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...,
        'sekizai',
        ...,
    ]


and ``'sekizai.context_processors.sekizai'`` in the ``TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['context_processors']``:

..  code-block:: python

    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            ...
            'OPTIONS': {
                'context_processors': [
                    ...
                    'sekizai.context_processors.sekizai',
                ],
            },
        },
    ]


Middleware
==========

in your :setting:`django:MIDDLEWARE` you'll need :class:`django:django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware` -
it's **not** installed in Django projects by default.

Also add::

    'cms.middleware.user.CurrentUserMiddleware',
    'cms.middleware.page.CurrentPageMiddleware',
    'cms.middleware.toolbar.ToolbarMiddleware',
    'cms.middleware.language.LanguageCookieMiddleware',

to the list.

You can also add ``'cms.middleware.utils.ApphookReloadMiddleware'``. It's not absolutely necessary, but it's
:ref:`useful <reloading_apphooks>`. If included, should be at the start of the list.

add the following configuration to your ``settings.py``::

    X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'SAMEORIGIN'

Context processors
==================

Add ``'cms.context_processors.cms_settings'`` to ``TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['context_processors']``.

Also add ``'django.template.context_processors.i18n'`` if it's not already present.

``cms check`` should now be unable to identify any further issues with your project. Some additional configuration is
required however.


******************************
Further required configuration
******************************

URLs
====

In the project's ``urls.py``, add ``re_path(r'^', include('cms.urls'))`` to the ``urlpatterns`` list. It should come after
other patterns, so that specific URLs for other applications can be detected first.

You'll also need to have an import for ``django.urls.include``. For example:

..  code-block:: python

    from django.urls import re_path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        re_path(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
        re_path(r'^', include('cms.urls')),
    ]

The django CMS project will now run, as you'll see if you launch it with

..  code-block:: bash

    python manage.py runserver


You'll be able to reach it at http://localhost:8000/, and the admin at http://localhost:8000/admin/. You won't yet actually be able to
do anything very useful with it though.


.. _basic_template:

Templates
=========

django CMS requires at least one template for its pages, so you'll need to add :setting:`CMS_TEMPLATES` to your
settings. The first template in the :setting:`CMS_TEMPLATES` list will be the project's default template.

::

    CMS_TEMPLATES = [
        ('home.html', 'Home page template'),
    ]

In the root of the project, create a ``templates`` directory, and in that, ``home.html``, a minimal django CMS
template:


..  code-block:: html+django

    {% load cms_tags sekizai_tags %}
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>{% page_attribute "page_title" %}</title>
            {% render_block "css" %}
        </head>
        <body>
            {% cms_toolbar %}
            {% placeholder "content" %}
            {% render_block "js" %}
        </body>
    </html>

This is worth explaining in a little detail:

* ``{% load cms_tags sekizai_tags %}`` loads the template tag libraries we use in the template.
* ``{% page_attribute "page_title" %}`` extracts the page's ``page_title`` :ttag:`attribute <page_attribute>`.
* ``{% render_block "css" %}`` and ``{% render_block "js" %}`` are Sekizai template tags that load blocks of HTML
  defined by Django applications. django CMS defines blocks for CSS and JavaScript, and requires these two tags. We
  recommended placing ``{% render_block "css" %}`` just before the ``</head>`` tag, and and ``{% render_block "js" %}``
  tag just before the ``</body>``.
* ``{% cms_toolbar %}`` renders the :ttag:`django CMS toolbar <cms_toolbar>`.
* ``{% placeholder "content" %}`` defines a :ttag:`placeholder`, where plugins can be inserted. A template needs at
  least one ``{% placeholder %}`` template tag to be useful for django CMS. The name of the placeholder is simply a
  descriptive one, for your reference.

Django needs to be know where to look for its templates, so add ``templates`` to the ``TEMPLATES['DIRS']`` list:

..  code-block:: python

    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            ...
            'DIRS': ['templates'],
            ...
        },
    ]

..  note::

    The way we have set up the template here is just for illustration. In a real project, we'd recommend creating a
    ``base.html`` template, shared by all the applications in the project, that your django CMS templates can extend.

    See Django's :ref:`template language documentation <django:template-inheritance>` for more on how template
    inheritance works.


Media and static file handling
==============================

A django CMS site will need to handle:

* *static files*, that are a core part of an application or project, such as its necessary images, CSS or
  JavaScript
* *media files*, that are uploaded by the site's users or applications.

:setting:`django:STATIC_URL` is defined (as ``"/static/"``) in a new project's settings by default.
:setting:`django:STATIC_ROOT`, the location that static files will be copied to and served from, is not required for
development - :doc:`only for production <django:howto/deployment/checklist>`.

For now, using the runserver and with ``DEBUG = True`` in your settings, you don't need to worry about either of these.

However, :setting:`django:MEDIA_URL` (where media files will be served) and :setting:`django:MEDIA_ROOT` (where they
will be stored) need to be added to your settings::

    MEDIA_URL = "/media/"
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "media")

For deployment, you need to configure suitable media file serving. **For development purposes only**, the following will
work in your ``urls.py``:

..  code-block:: python

    from django.conf import settings
    from django.conf.urls.static import static

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
    ] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

(See the Django documentation for guidance on :doc:`serving media files in production
<django:howto/static-files/index>`.)


*************************************
Adding content-handling functionality
*************************************

You now have the basics set up for a django CMS site, which is able to manage and serve up pages. However the project
so far has no plugins installed, which means it has no way of handling content in those pages. All content in django
CMS is managed via plugins. So, we now need to install some additional addon applications to provide plugins and other
functionality.

You don't actually **need** to install any of these. django CMS doesn't commit you to any particular applications for
content handling. The ones listed here however provide key functionality and are strongly recommended.

Django Filer
============

`Django Filer`_ provides file and image management. Many other applications also rely on Django Filer - it's very
unusual to have a django CMS site that does *not* run Django Filer. The configuration in this section will get you
started, but you should refer to the `Django Filer documentation <https://django-filer.readthedocs.io>`_ for more
comprehensive configuration information.

.. _Django Filer: https://github.com/divio/django-filer

To install::

    pip install django-filer

A number of applications will be installed as dependencies. `Easy Thumbnails
<https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails>`_ is required to create new versions of images in different sizes;
`Django MPTT <https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/>`_ manages the tree structure of the folders in Django Filer.

Pillow, the Python imaging library, will be installed. `Pillow <https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow>`_ needs some
system-level libraries - the `Pillow documentation <https://pillow.readthedocs.io>`_ describes in detail what is
required to get this running on various operating systems.

Add::

    'filer',
    'easy_thumbnails',
    'mptt',

to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

You also need to add::

    THUMBNAIL_HIGH_RESOLUTION = True

    THUMBNAIL_PROCESSORS = (
        'easy_thumbnails.processors.colorspace',
        'easy_thumbnails.processors.autocrop',
        'filer.thumbnail_processors.scale_and_crop_with_subject_location',
        'easy_thumbnails.processors.filters'
    )

New database tables will need to be created for Django Filer and Easy Thumbnails, so run migrations::

    python manage.py migrate filer
    python manage.py migrate easy_thumbnails

(or simply, ``python manage.py migrate``).


Django CMS CKEditor
===================

`Django CMS CKEditor`_ is the default text editor for django CMS.

.. _Django CMS CKEditor: https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-text-ckeditor

Install: ``pip install djangocms-text-ckeditor``.

Add ``djangocms_text_ckeditor`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

Run migrations::

    python manage.py migrate djangocms_text_ckeditor


Miscellaneous plugins
=====================

There are plugins for django CMS that cover a vast range of functionality. To get started, it's useful to be able to
rely on a set of well-maintained plugins that cover some general content management needs.

* `djangocms-link <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-link>`_
* `djangocms-file <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-file>`_
* `djangocms-picture <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-picture>`_
* `djangocms-video <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-video>`_
* `djangocms-googlemap <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-googlemap>`_
* `djangocms-snippet <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-snippet>`_
* `djangocms-style <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-style>`_

To install::

    pip install djangocms-link djangocms-file djangocms-picture djangocms-video djangocms-googlemap djangocms-snippet djangocms-style

and add::

    'djangocms_link',
    'djangocms_file',
    'djangocms_picture',
    'djangocms_video',
    'djangocms_googlemap',
    'djangocms_snippet',
    'djangocms_style',

to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

Then run migrations::

    python manage.py migrate

These and other plugins are described in more detail in :ref:`commonly-used-plugins`. More are listed
plugins available on the `django CMS Marketplace <https://marketplace.django-cms.org/en/addons/>`_.


******************
Launch the project
******************

Start up the runserver::

    python manage.py runserver

and access the new site, which you should now be able to reach at ``http://localhost:8000``. Login if you haven't
done so already.

/. üöÄ docs/how_to/placeholders.rst
===================================================

.. _placeholders_outside_cms:

#######################################
How to use placeholders outside the CMS
#######################################

Placeholders are special model fields that django CMS uses to render
user-editable content (plugins) in templates. That is, it's the place where a
user can add text, video or any other plugin to a webpage, using the same
frontend editing as the CMS pages.

Placeholders can be viewed as containers for :class:`~cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin` instances, and
can be used outside the CMS in custom applications using the
:class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderField`.

By defining one (or several) :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderField` on a
custom model you can take advantage of the full power of :class:`~cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin`.

***********
Get started
***********

You need to define a :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderField` on the model you would like to
use::

    from django.db import models
    from cms.models.fields import PlaceholderField

    class MyModel(models.Model):
        # your fields
        my_placeholder = PlaceholderField('placeholder_name')
        # your methods


The :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderField` has one required parameter, a string ``slotname``.

The ``slotname`` is used in templates, to determine where the placeholder's plugins should appear
in the page, and in the placeholder configuration :setting:`CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF`, which determines
which plugins may be inserted into this placeholder.

You can also use a callable for the ``slotname``, as in::

    from django.db import models
    from cms.models.fields import PlaceholderField

    def my_placeholder_slotname(instance):
        return 'placeholder_name'

    class MyModel(models.Model):
        # your fields
        my_placeholder = PlaceholderField(my_placeholder_slotname)
        # your methods

.. warning::

    For security reasons the related_name for a
    :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderField` may not be suppressed using
    ``'+'``; this allows the cms to check permissions properly. Attempting to do
    so will raise a :exc:`ValueError`.

.. note::

    If you add a PlaceholderField to an existing model, you'll be able to see
    the placeholder in the frontend editor only after saving the relevant instance.

Admin Integration
=================

.. versionchanged:: 3.0

Your model with ``PlaceholderFields`` can still be edited in the admin. However, any
PlaceholderFields in it will **only be available for editing from the frontend**.
``PlaceholderFields`` **must** not be present in any ``fieldsets``, ``fields``, ``form`` or other
``ModelAdmin`` field's definition attribute.

To provide admin support for a model with a ``PlaceholderField`` in your application's admin, you
need to use the mixin :class:`~cms.admin.placeholderadmin.PlaceholderAdminMixin` along with the
:class:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin`.

.. note::

    Using this mixin is mandatory for permission check to work properly.

Note that the ``PlaceholderAdminMixin`` **must** precede
the ``ModelAdmin`` in the class definition::

    from django.contrib import admin
    from cms.admin.placeholderadmin import PlaceholderAdminMixin
    from myapp.models import MyModel

    class MyModelAdmin(PlaceholderAdminMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
        pass

    admin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)

I18N Placeholders
=================

Out of the box :class:`~cms.admin.placeholderadmin.PlaceholderAdminMixin` supports multiple
languages and will display language tabs. If you extend your model admin class derived from
``PlaceholderAdminMixin`` and overwrite ``change_form_template`` have a look at
``admin/placeholders/placeholder/change_form.html`` to see how to display the language tabs.

If you need other fields translated as well, django CMS has support for `django-hvad`_. If you use
a ``TranslatableModel`` model be sure to **not** include the placeholder fields amongst the
translated fields:


.. code-block::

    class MultilingualExample1(TranslatableModel):
        translations = TranslatedFields(
            title=models.CharField('title', max_length=255),
            description=models.CharField('description', max_length=255),
        )
        placeholder_1 = PlaceholderField('placeholder_1')

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.title

Be sure to combine both hvad's ``TranslatableAdmin`` and :class:`~cms.admin.placeholderadmin.PlaceholderAdminMixin` when
registering your model with the admin site::

    from cms.admin.placeholderadmin import PlaceholderAdminMixin
    from django.contrib import admin
    from hvad.admin import TranslatableAdmin
    from myapp.models import MultilingualExample1

    class MultilingualModelAdmin(TranslatableAdmin, PlaceholderAdminMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
        pass

    admin.site.register(MultilingualExample1, MultilingualModelAdmin)

Templates
=========

To render the placeholder in a template you use the :ttag:`render_placeholder` tag from the
:mod:`~cms.templatetags.cms_tags` template tag library:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load cms_tags %}

    {% render_placeholder mymodel_instance.my_placeholder "640" %}

The :ttag:`render_placeholder` tag takes the following parameters:

* :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderField` instance
* ``width`` parameter for context sensitive plugins (optional)
* ``language`` keyword plus ``language-code`` string to render content in the
  specified language (optional)

The view in which you render your placeholder field must return the
:class:`request <django.http.HttpRequest>` object in the context. This is
typically achieved in Django applications by using :class:`~django.template.RequestContext`::

    from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render

    def my_model_detail(request, id):
        object = get_object_or_404(MyModel, id=id)
        return render(request, 'my_model_detail.html', {
            'object': object,
        })

If you want to render plugins from a specific language, you can use the tag
like this:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load cms_tags %}

    {% render_placeholder mymodel_instance.my_placeholder language 'en' %}

*******************************
Adding content to a placeholder
*******************************

.. versionchanged:: 3.0

Placeholders can be edited from the frontend by visiting the page displaying your model (where you
put the :ttag:`render_placeholder` tag), then appending ``?edit`` to the page's URL.

This will make the frontend editor top banner appear (and if necessary will require you to login).

Once in frontend editing mode, the interface for your application's ``PlaceholderFields`` will work
in much the same way as it does for CMS Pages, with a switch for Structure and Content modes and so
on.

There is no automatic draft/live functionality for general Django models, so content is updated
instantly whenever you add/edit them.

Options
=======

If you need to change ``?edit`` to a custom string (say, ``?admin_on``) you may
set ``CMS_TOOLBAR_URL__EDIT_ON`` variable in your ``settings.py`` to
``"admin_on"``.

You may also change other URLs with similar settings:

* ``?edit_off`` (``CMS_TOOLBAR_URL__EDIT_OFF``)
* ``?build`` (``CMS_TOOLBAR_URL__BUILD``)
* ``?toolbar_off`` (``CMS_TOOLBAR_URL__DISABLE``)

When changing these settings, please be careful because you might inadvertently replace reserved
strings in system (such as ``?page``). We recommended you use safely unique strings for this option
(such as ``secret_admin`` or ``company_name``).

.. _placeholder_object_permissions:

Permissions
===========

To be able to edit a placeholder user must be a ``staff`` member and needs either edit permissions
on the model that contains the :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderField`, or permissions for
that specific instance of that model. Required permissions for edit actions are:

* to ``add``: require ``add`` **or** ``change`` permission on related Model or instance.
* to ``change``: require ``add`` **or** ``change`` permission on related Model or instance.
* to ``delete``: require ``add`` **or** ``change`` **or** ``delete`` permission on related Model
  or instance.

With this logic, an user who can ``change`` a Model's instance but can not ``add`` a new
Model's instance will be able to add some placeholders or plugins to existing Model's instances.

Model permissions are usually added through the default Django ``auth`` application and its admin
interface. Object-level permission can be handled by writing a custom authentication backend as
described in `django docs
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/auth/customizing/#handling-object-permissions>`_

For example, if there is a ``UserProfile`` model that contains a ``PlaceholderField`` then the
custom backend can refer to a ``has_perm`` method (on the model) that grants all rights to current
user only based on the user's ``UserProfile`` object:


.. code-block::

    def has_perm(self, user_obj, perm, obj=None):
        if not user_obj.is_staff:
            return False
        if isinstance(obj, UserProfile):
            if user_obj.get_profile()==obj:
                return True
        return False

===================================================

.. _multilingual_support_how_to:

###############################
How to serve multiple languages
###############################

If you used the `django CMS installer <https://github.com/nephila/djangocms-installer>`_ to start your project, you'll find
that it's already set up for serving multilingual content. Our :ref:`installation` guide also does the same.

This guide specifically describes the steps required to enable multilingual support, in case you need to it manually.


.. _multilingual_urls:

*****************
Multilingual URLs
*****************

If you use more than one language, django CMS urls, *including the admin URLS*, need to be
referenced via :func:`~django.conf.urls.i18n.i18n_patterns`. For more information about this see
the official `Django documentation
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#internationalization-in-url-patterns>`_
on the subject.

Here's a full example of ``urls.py``::

    from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import staticfiles_urlpatterns
    from django.urls import include, re_path
    from django.views.i18n import JavaScriptCatalog


    admin.autodiscover()

    urlpatterns = i18n_patterns(
        re_path(r'^jsi18n/$', JavaScriptCatalog.as_view(), name='javascript-catalog'),
    )
    urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns()

    # note the django CMS URLs included via i18n_patterns
    urlpatterns += i18n_patterns(
        re_path(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        re_path(r'^', include('cms.urls')),
    )


Monolingual URLs
================

Of course, if you want only monolingual URLs, without a language code, simply don't use :func:`~django.conf.urls.i18n.i18n_patterns`::

    urlpatterns += [
        re_path(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
        re_path(r'^', include('cms.urls')),
    ]


************************************
Store the user's language preference
************************************

The user's preferred language is maintained through a browsing session. So that django CMS remembers the user's preference in
subsequent sessions, it must be stored in a cookie. To enable this, ``cms.middleware.language.LanguageCookieMiddleware`` must
be added to the project's ``MIDDLEWARE`` setting.

See :ref:`determining_language_preference` for more information about how this works.


*********************
Working in templates
*********************

Display a language chooser in the page
======================================

The :ttag:`language_chooser` template tag will display a language chooser for the
current page. You can modify the template in ``menu/language_chooser.html`` or
provide your own template if necessary.

Example:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load menu_tags %}
    {% language_chooser "myapp/language_chooser.html" %}


If you are in an apphook and have a detail view of an object you can
set an object to the toolbar in your view. The cms will call ``get_absolute_url`` in
the corresponding language for the language chooser:

Example:

.. code-block:: html+django

    class AnswerView(DetailView):
        def get(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.object = self.get_object()
            if hasattr(self.request, 'toolbar'):
                self.request.toolbar.set_object(self.object)
            response = super().get(*args, **kwargs)
            return response


With this you can more easily control what url will be returned on the language chooser.

.. note::

    If you have a multilingual objects be sure that you return the right url if you don't have
    a translation for this language in ``get_absolute_url``


Get the URL of the current page for a different language
========================================================

The ``page_language_url`` returns the URL of the current page in another language.

Example:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% page_language_url "de" %}

/. üöÄ docs/how_to/multi-site.rst
===================================================

#######################
Multi-Site Installation
#######################

For operating multiple websites using the same virtualenv you can use copies of ``manage.py``,
``wsgi.py`` and different versions of settings and the URL configuration for each site. You can
use the same database for different websites or, if you want a stricter separation, different
databases. You can define settings for all sites in a file that is imported in the site-specific
settings, e. g. ``my_project/base_settings.py``. At the end of these site-specific settings you can
import local settings, which are not under version control, with SECRET_KEY, DATABASES,
ALLOWED_HOSTS etc., which may be site-specific or not.

#.  Copy and edit ``wsgi.py`` and ``manage.py``  e. g. to ``wsgi_second_site.py`` and
    ``manage_second_site.py``: Change the reference to the settings like
    ``os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "my_project.settings_second_site")``, if the
    settings are in ``my_project/settings_second_site.py``. Do this for each site.

#.  In the site-specific settings import common base settings  in the first line like ``from
    .base_settings import *`` and define ``SITE_ID``, ``ROOT_URLCONF``, ``CMS_LANGUAGES`` and other
    settings that should be different on the sites. This way all the items from the imported base
    settings can be overridden by later definitions:

    ``settings.second_site.py``:

    ::

        from .base_settings import *

        SITE_ID: int = 2
        ROOT_URLCONF: str = 'my_project.urls_second_site'
        # other site-specific settings‚Ä¶

        from .settings_local import *

#.  In the web server settings for a site you refer to the site-specific ``wsgi*.py`` like
    ``wsgi_second_site.py``.

===================================================

##########################
How to work with templates
##########################

Application can reuse cms templates by mixing cms template tags and normal django
templating language.


static_placeholder
------------------

Plain :ttag:`placeholder` cannot be used in templates used by external applications,
use :ttag:`static_placeholder` instead.

.. _page_template:

CMS_TEMPLATE
------------

``CMS_TEMPLATE`` is a context variable available in the context; it contains
the template path for CMS pages and application using apphooks, and the default
template (i.e.: the first template in :setting:`CMS_TEMPLATES`) for non-CMS
managed URLs.

This is mostly useful to use it in the ``extends`` template tag in the application
templates to get the current page template.

Example: cms template

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load cms_tags %}
    <html>
        <body>
        {% cms_toolbar %}
        {% block main %}
        {% placeholder "main" %}
        {% endblock main %}
        </body>
    </html>


Example: application template

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends CMS_TEMPLATE %}
    {% load cms_tags %}
    {% block main %}
    {% for item in object_list %}
        {{ item }}
    {% endfor %}
    {% static_placeholder "sidebar" %}
    {% endblock main %}

``CMS_TEMPLATE`` memorises the path of the cms template so the application
template can dynamically import it.


render_model
------------

:ttag:`render_model` allows to edit the django models from the frontend by
reusing the django CMS frontend editor.


===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/how_to/caching.rst
===================================================

#####################
How to manage caching
#####################


******
Set-up
******

To setup caching configure a caching backend in django.

Details for caching can be found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/

In your middleware settings be sure to add ``django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware`` at the first and
``django.middleware.cache.FetchFromCacheMiddleware`` at the last position::

    MIDDLEWARE=[
            'django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware',
            ...
            'cms.middleware.language.LanguageCookieMiddleware',
            'cms.middleware.user.CurrentUserMiddleware',
            'cms.middleware.page.CurrentPageMiddleware',
            'cms.middleware.toolbar.ToolbarMiddleware',
            'django.middleware.cache.FetchFromCacheMiddleware',
        ],


Plugins
=======

Normally all plugins will be cached. If you have a plugin that is dynamic based on the current user or other
dynamic properties of the request set the ``cache=False`` attribute on the plugin class:


.. code-block::

    class MyPlugin(CMSPluginBase):
        name = _("MyPlugin")
        cache = False

.. warning::
    If you disable a plugin cache be sure to restart the server and clear the cache afterwards.

Content Cache Duration
======================

Default: 60

This can be changed in :setting:`CMS_CACHE_DURATIONS`

Settings
========

Caching is set default to true.
Have a look at the following settings to enable/disable various caching behaviours:

- :setting:`CMS_PAGE_CACHE`
- :setting:`CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CACHE`
- :setting:`CMS_PLUGIN_CACHE`
- :setting:`CMS_LIMIT_TTL_CACHE_FUNCTION`

.. _frontend-editable-fields:

#########################################################
How to enable frontend editing for Page and Django models
#########################################################

As well as ``PlaceholderFields``, 'ordinary' Django model fields (both on CMS Pages and your own
Django models) can also be edited through django CMS's frontend editing interface. This is very
convenient for the user because it saves having to switch between frontend and admin views.

Using this interface, model instance values that can be edited show the "Double-click to edit"
hint on hover. Double-clicking opens a pop-up window containing the change form for that model.

.. note::

    This interface is not currently available for touch-screen users, but will be improved in
    future releases.

.. warning::

    This feature is only partially compatible with django-hvad: using
    ``render_model`` with hvad-translated fields (say
    ``{% render_model object 'translated_field' %}`` returns an error if the
    hvad-enabled object does not exists in the current language.
    As a workaround ``render_model_icon`` can be used instead.

.. _render_model_templatetags:

*************
Template tags
*************

This feature relies on five template tags sharing common code. All require that you ``{% load
cms_tags %}`` in your template:

* :ttag:`render_model` (for editing a specific field)
* :ttag:`render_model_block` (for editing any of the fields in a defined block)
* :ttag:`render_model_icon` (for editing a field represented by another value, such as an image)
* :ttag:`render_model_add` (for adding an instance of the specified model)
* :ttag:`render_model_add_block` (for adding an instance of the specified model)

Look at the tag-specific page for more detailed reference and discussion of limitations and caveats.

****************
Page titles edit
****************

For CMS pages you can edit the titles from the frontend; according to the
attribute specified a default field, which can also be overridden, will be editable.

Main title::

    {% render_model request.current_page "title" %}


Page title::

    {% render_model request.current_page "page_title" %}

Menu title::

    {% render_model request.current_page "menu_title" %}

All three titles::

    {% render_model request.current_page "titles" %}


You can always customise the editable fields by providing the
`edit_field` parameter::

    {% render_model request.current_page "title" "page_title,menu_title" %}


**************
Page menu edit
**************

By using the special keyword ``changelist`` as edit field the frontend
editing will show the page tree; a common pattern for this is to enable
changes in the menu by wrapping the menu template tags:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% render_model_block request.current_page "changelist" %}
        <h3>Menu</h3>
        <ul>
            {% show_menu 1 100 0 1 "sidebar_submenu_root.html" %}
        </ul>
    {% endrender_model_block %}

Will render to:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <template class="cms-plugin cms-plugin-start cms-plugin-cms-page-changelist-1"></template>
        <h3>Menu</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/another">another</a></li>
            [...]
    <template class="cms-plugin cms-plugin-end cms-plugin-cms-page-changelist-1"></template>

.. warning:

    Be aware that depending on the layout of your menu templates, clickable
    area of the menu may completely overlap with the active area of the
    frontend editor thus preventing editing. In this case you may use
    ``{% render_model_icon %}``.
    The same conflict exists when menu template is managed by a plugin.

********************************
Editing 'ordinary' Django models
********************************

As noted above, your own Django models can also present their fields for editing in the frontend.
This is achieved by using the ``FrontendEditableAdminMixin`` base class.

Note that this is only required for fields **other than** ``PlaceholderFields``.
``PlaceholderFields`` are automatically made available for frontend editing.

Configure the model's admin class
=================================

Configure your admin class by adding the ``FrontendEditableAdminMixin`` mixin to it (see
:mod:`Django admin documentation <django.contrib.admin>` for general Django admin information)::

    from cms.admin.placeholderadmin import FrontendEditableAdminMixin
    from django.contrib import admin


    class MyModelAdmin(FrontendEditableAdminMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
        ...

The ordering is important: as usual, **mixins must come first**.

Then set up the templates where you want to expose the model for editing, adding a ``render_model``
template tag::

    {% load cms_tags %}

    {% block content %}
    <h1>{% render_model instance "some_attribute" %}</h1>
    {% endblock content %}

See :ttag:`template tag reference <render_model>` for arguments documentation.


Selected fields edit
====================

Frontend editing is also possible for a set of fields.

Set up the admin
----------------

You need to add to your model admin a tuple of fields editable from the frontend
admin::

    from cms.admin.placeholderadmin import FrontendEditableAdminMixin
    from django.contrib import admin


    class MyModelAdmin(FrontendEditableAdminMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
        frontend_editable_fields = ("foo", "bar")
        ...

Set up the template
-------------------

Then add comma separated list of fields (or just the name of one field) to
the template tag::

    {% load cms_tags %}

    {% block content %}
    <h1>{% render_model instance "some_attribute" "some_field,other_field" %}</h1>
    {% endblock content %}



Special attributes
==================

The ``attribute`` argument of the template tag is not required to be a model field,
property or method can also be used as target; in case of a method, it will be
called with request as argument.


.. _custom-views:

Custom views
============

You can link any field to a custom view (not necessarily an admin view) to handle
model-specific editing workflow.

The custom view can be passed either as a named url (``view_url`` parameter)
or as name of a method (or property) on the instance being edited
(``view_method`` parameter).
In case you provide ``view_method`` it will be called whenever the template tag is
evaluated with ``request`` as parameter.

The custom view does not need to obey any specific interface; it will get
``edit_fields`` value as a ``GET`` parameter.

See :ttag:`template tag reference <render_model>` for arguments documentation.

Example ``view_url``::

    {% load cms_tags %}

    {% block content %}
    <h1>{% render_model instance "some_attribute" "some_field,other_field" "" "admin:exampleapp_example1_some_view" %}</h1>
    {% endblock content %}


Example ``view_method``:


.. code-block::

    class MyModel(models.Model):
        char = models.CharField(max_length=10)

        def some_method(self, request):
            return "/some/url"


    {% load cms_tags %}

    {% block content %}
    <h1>{% render_model instance "some_attribute" "some_field,other_field" "" "" "some_method" %}</h1>
    {% endblock content %}


Model changelist
================

By using the special keyword ``changelist`` as edit field the frontend
editing will show the model changelist:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% render_model instance "name" "changelist" %}

Will render to:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <div class="cms-plugin cms-plugin-myapp-mymodel-changelist-1">
        My Model Instance Name
    </div>


.. filters:

*******
Filters
*******

If you need to apply filters to the output value of the template tag, add quoted
sequence of filters as in Django :ttag:`django:filter` template tag:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load cms_tags %}

    {% block content %}
    <h1>{% render_model instance "attribute" "" "" "truncatechars:9" %}</h1>
    {% endblock content %}



****************
Context variable
****************

The template tag output can be saved in a context variable for later use, using
the standard `as` syntax:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load cms_tags %}

    {% block content %}
    {% render_model instance "attribute" as variable %}

    <h1>{{ variable }}</h1>

    {% endblock content %}

Sitemaps are XML files used by Google to index your website by using their
**Webmaster Tools** and telling them the location of your sitemap.

The :class:`cms.sitemaps.CMSSitemap` will create a sitemap with all the published pages of
your CMS.


*************
Configuration
*************

 * add :mod:`django.contrib.sitemaps` to your project's :setting:`django:INSTALLED_APPS`
   setting
 * add ``from cms.sitemaps import CMSSitemap`` to the top of your main ``urls.py``
 * add ``from django.contrib.sitemaps.views import sitemap`` to ``urls.py```
 * add ``url(r'^sitemap\.xml$', sitemap, {'sitemaps': {'cmspages': CMSSitemap}}),``
   to your ``urlpatterns``

How to manage Page Types
########################

**Page Types** make it easier for content editors to create pages from predefined **types**.

The examples contain content such as plugins that will be copied over to the newly-created page,
leaving the type untouched.


*******************
Creating Page Types
*******************

First you need to create a new page in the usual way; this will become the template for your new
page type.

Use this page as your template to add example content and plugins until you
reach a satisfied result.

Once ready, choose *Save as Page Type...* from the *Page* menu and give it an appropriate name.
Don't worry about making it perfect, you can continue to change its content and settings.

This will create a new page type, and makes it available from *Add Page* command and the **Create**
wizard dialog.

.. image:: /contributing/images/add-page-type.png
   :alt: Creating a page type

If you don't want or need the original page from which you create the new page type, you can simply
delete it.


*******************
Managing Page Types
*******************

When you save a page as a page type, it is placed in the page list under *Page Types* node.

This node behaves differently from regular pages:

- They are not publicly accessible.
- All pages listed in *Page Types* will be rendered in the *Page Types*
  drop-down menu.

There's also a quick way to create a new page type: simply drag an existing page to the *Page
Types* node, whereupon it will become a new page type.


*********************
Selecting a Page Type
*********************

You can now select a page type when creating a new page. You'll find a drop-down menu named *Page
Type* from which you can select the type for your new page.

/. üöÄ docs/how_to/custom_plugins.rst
===================================================

.. _custom-plugins:

#####################
How to create Plugins
#####################

*******************
The simplest plugin
*******************

We'll start with an example of a very simple plugin.

You may use ``python manage.py startapp`` to set up the basic layout for your
plugin app (remember to add your plugin to ``INSTALLED_APPS``). Alternatively, just add a file called ``cms_plugins.py`` to an
existing Django application.

Place your plugins in ``cms_plugins.py``. For our example, include the following code::

    from cms.plugin_base import CMSPluginBase
    from cms.plugin_pool import plugin_pool
    from cms.models.pluginmodel import CMSPlugin
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

    @plugin_pool.register_plugin
    class HelloPlugin(CMSPluginBase):
        model = CMSPlugin
        render_template = "hello_plugin.html"
        cache = False

Now we're almost done. All that's left is to add the template. Add the
following into the root template directory in a file called
``hello_plugin.html``:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <h1>Hello {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}{{ request.user.first_name }} {{ request.user.last_name}}{% else %}Guest{% endif %}</h1>

This plugin will now greet the users on your website either by their name if
they're logged in, or as Guest if they're not.

Now let's take a closer look at what we did there. The ``cms_plugins.py`` files
are where you should define your sub-classes of
:class:`cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase`, these classes define the different
plugins.

There are two required attributes on those classes:

* ``model``: The model you wish to use for storing information about this plugin.
  If you do not require any special information, for example configuration, to
  be stored for your plugins, you can simply use
  :class:`cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin` (we'll look at that model more
  closely in a bit). In a normal admin class, you don't need to supply this
  information because ``admin.site.register(Model, Admin)`` takes care of it,
  but a plugin is not registered in that way.
* ``name``: The name of your plugin as displayed in the admin. It is generally
  good practice to mark this string as translatable using
  :func:`django.utils.translation.gettext_lazy`, however this is optional. By
  default the name is a nicer version of the class name.

And one of the following **must** be defined if ``render_plugin`` attribute
is ``True`` (the default):

* ``render_template``: The template to render this plugin with.

**or**

* ``get_render_template``: A method that returns a template path to render the
  plugin with.

In addition to those attributes, you can also override the :meth:`~cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase.render()` method
which determines the template context variables that are used to render your
plugin. By default, this method only adds ``instance`` and ``placeholder``
objects to your context, but plugins can override this to include any context
that is required.

A number of other methods are available for overriding on your CMSPluginBase
sub-classes. See: :class:`~cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase` for further details.


***************
Troubleshooting
***************

Since plugin modules are found and loaded by django's importlib, you might
experience errors because the path environment is different at runtime. If
your `cms_plugins` isn't loaded or accessible, try the following::

    $ python manage.py shell
    >>> from importlib import import_module
    >>> m = import_module("myapp.cms_plugins")
    >>> m.some_test_function()

.. _storing configuration:

*********************
Storing configuration
*********************

In many cases, you want to store configuration for your plugin instances. For
example, if you have a plugin that shows the latest blog posts, you might want
to be able to choose the amount of entries shown. Another example would be a
gallery plugin where you want to choose the pictures to show for the plugin.

To do so, you create a Django model by sub-classing
:class:`cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin` in the ``models.py`` of an installed
application.

Let's improve our ``HelloPlugin`` from above by making its fallback name for
non-authenticated users configurable.

In our ``models.py`` we add the following::

    from cms.models.pluginmodel import CMSPlugin

    from django.db import models

    class Hello(CMSPlugin):
        guest_name = models.CharField(max_length=50, default='Guest')


If you followed the Django tutorial, this shouldn't look too new to you. The
only difference to normal models is that you sub-class
:class:`cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin` rather than
:class:`django.db.models.Model`.

Now we need to change our plugin definition to use this model, so our new
``cms_plugins.py`` looks like this::

    from cms.plugin_base import CMSPluginBase
    from cms.plugin_pool import plugin_pool
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

    from .models import Hello

    @plugin_pool.register_plugin
    class HelloPlugin(CMSPluginBase):
        model = Hello
        name = _("Hello Plugin")
        render_template = "hello_plugin.html"
        cache = False

        def render(self, context, instance, placeholder):
            context = super().render(context, instance, placeholder)
            return context

We changed the ``model`` attribute to point to our newly created ``Hello``
model and pass the model instance to the context.

As a last step, we have to update our template to make use of this
new configuration:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <h1>Hello {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}
      {{ request.user.first_name }} {{ request.user.last_name}}
    {% else %}
      {{ instance.guest_name }}
    {% endif %}</h1>

The only thing we changed there is that we use the template variable ``{{
instance.guest_name }}`` instead of the hard-coded ``Guest`` string in the else
clause.

.. warning::

    You cannot name your model fields the same as any installed plugins lower-
    cased model name, due to the implicit one-to-one relation Django uses for
    sub-classed models. If you use all core plugins, this includes: ``file``,
    ``googlemap``, ``link``, ``picture``, ``snippetptr``, ``teaser``,
    ``twittersearch``, ``twitterrecententries`` and ``video``.

    Additionally, it is *recommended* that you avoid using ``page`` as a model
    field, as it is declared as a property of :class:`cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin`,
    and your plugin will not work as intended in the administration without
    further work.

.. warning::

    If you are using Python 2.x and overriding the ``__unicode__`` method of the
    model file, make sure to return its results as UTF8-string. Otherwise
    saving an instance of your plugin might fail with the frontend editor showing
    an <Empty> plugin instance. To return in Unicode use a return statement like
    ``return u'{0}'.format(self.guest_name)``.

.. _handling-relations:

Handling Relations
==================

Every time the page with your custom plugin is published the plugin is copied.
So if your custom plugin has foreign key (to it, or from it) or many-to-many
relations you are responsible for copying those related objects, if required,
whenever the CMS copies the plugin - **it won't do it for you automatically**.

Every plugin model inherits the empty
:meth:`cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin.copy_relations` method from the base
class, and it's called when your plugin is copied. So, it's there for you to
adapt to your purposes as required.

Typically, you will want it to copy related objects. To do this you should
create a method called ``copy_relations`` on your plugin model, that receives
the **old** instance of the plugin as an argument.

You may however decide that the related objects shouldn't be copied - you may
want to leave them alone, for example. Or, you might even want to choose some
altogether different relations for it, or to create new ones when it's
copied... it depends on your plugin and the way you want it to work.

If you do want to copy related objects, you'll need to do this in two slightly
different ways, depending on whether your plugin has relations *to* or *from*
other objects that need to be copied too:

For foreign key relations *from* other objects
----------------------------------------------

Your plugin may have items with foreign keys to it, which will typically be
the case if you set it up so that they are inlines in its admin. So you might
have two models, one for the plugin and one for those items:


.. code-block::

    class ArticlePluginModel(CMSPlugin):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=50)

    class AssociatedItem(models.Model):
        plugin = models.ForeignKey(
            ArticlePluginModel,
            related_name="associated_item"
        )

You'll then need the ``copy_relations()`` method on your plugin model to loop
over the associated items and copy them, giving the copies foreign keys to the
new plugin:


.. code-block::

    class ArticlePluginModel(CMSPlugin):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=50)

        def copy_relations(self, oldinstance):
            # Before copying related objects from the old instance, the ones
            # on the current one need to be deleted. Otherwise, duplicates may
            # appear on the public version of the page
            self.associated_item.all().delete()

            for associated_item in oldinstance.associated_item.all():
                # instance.pk = None; instance.pk.save() is the slightly odd but
                # standard Django way of copying a saved model instance
                associated_item.pk = None
                associated_item.plugin = self
                associated_item.save()

For many-to-many or foreign key relations *to* other objects
------------------------------------------------------------

Let's assume these are the relevant bits of your plugin:


.. code-block::

    class ArticlePluginModel(CMSPlugin):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        sections = models.ManyToManyField(Section)

Now when the plugin gets copied, you want to make sure the sections stay, so
it becomes:


.. code-block::

    class ArticlePluginModel(CMSPlugin):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        sections = models.ManyToManyField(Section)

        def copy_relations(self, oldinstance):
            self.sections.set(oldinstance.sections.all())

If your plugins have relational fields of both kinds, you may of course need
to use *both* the copying techniques described above.

Relations *between* plugins
---------------------------

It is much harder to manage the copying of relations when they are from one plugin to another.

See the GitHub issue `copy_relations() does not work for relations between cmsplugins #4143
<https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/issues/4143>`_ for more details.

Advanced
********

Inline Admin
============

If you want to have the foreign key relation as a inline admin, you can create an
``admin.StackedInline`` class and put it in the Plugin to "inlines". Then you can use the inline
admin form for your foreign key references:


.. code-block::

    class ItemInlineAdmin(admin.StackedInline):
        model = AssociatedItem


    class ArticlePlugin(CMSPluginBase):
        model = ArticlePluginModel
        name = _("Article Plugin")
        render_template = "article/index.html"
        inlines = (ItemInlineAdmin,)

        def render(self, context, instance, placeholder):
            context = super().render(context, instance, placeholder)
            items = instance.associated_item.all()
            context.update({
                'items': items,
            })
            return context

Plugin form
===========

Since :class:`cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase` extends
:class:`django:django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin`, you can customise the form
for your plugins just as you would customise your admin interfaces.

The template that the plugin editing mechanism uses is
``cms/templates/admin/cms/page/plugin/change_form.html``. You might need to
change this.

If you want to customise this the best way to do it is:

* create a template of your own that extends ``cms/templates/admin/cms/page/plugin/change_form.html``
  to provide the functionality you require;
* provide your :class:`cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase` sub-class with a
  ``change_form_template`` attribute pointing at your new template.

Extending ``admin/cms/page/plugin/change_form.html`` ensures that you'll keep
a unified look and functionality across your plugins.

There are various reasons *why* you might want to do this. For example, you
might have a snippet of JavaScript that needs to refer to a template
variable), which you'd likely place in ``{% block extrahead %}``, after a ``{{
block.super }}`` to inherit the existing items that were in the parent
template.


.. _custom-plugins-handling-media:

Handling media
==============

If your plugin depends on certain media files, JavaScript or stylesheets, you
can include them from your plugin template using `django-sekizai`_. Your CMS
templates are always enforced to have the ``css`` and ``js`` sekizai namespaces,
therefore those should be used to include the respective files. For more
information about django-sekizai, please refer to the
`django-sekizai documentation`_.

Note that sekizai *can't* help you with the *admin-side* plugin templates -
what follows is for your plugins' *output* templates.

Sekizai style
-------------

To fully harness the power of django-sekizai, it is helpful to have a consistent
style on how to use it. Here is a set of conventions that should be followed
(but don't necessarily need to be):

* One bit per ``addtoblock``. Always include one external CSS or JS file per
  ``addtoblock`` or one snippet per ``addtoblock``. This is needed so
  django-sekizai properly detects duplicate files.
* External files should be on one line, with no spaces or newlines between the
  ``addtoblock`` tag and the HTML tags.
* When using embedded javascript or CSS, the HTML tags should be on a newline.

A **good** example:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load sekizai_tags %}

    {% addtoblock "js" %}<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}myplugin/js/myjsfile.js"></script>{% endaddtoblock %}
    {% addtoblock "js" %}<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}myplugin/js/myotherfile.js"></script>{% endaddtoblock %}
    {% addtoblock "css" %}<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ MEDIA_URL }}myplugin/css/astylesheet.css">{% endaddtoblock %}
    {% addtoblock "js" %}
    <script type="text/javascript">
        $(document).ready(function(){
            doSomething();
        });
    </script>
    {% endaddtoblock %}

A **bad** example:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load sekizai_tags %}

    {% addtoblock "js" %}<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}myplugin/js/myjsfile.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}myplugin/js/myotherfile.js"></script>{% endaddtoblock %}
    {% addtoblock "css" %}
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ MEDIA_URL }}myplugin/css/astylesheet.css"></script>
    {% endaddtoblock %}
    {% addtoblock "js" %}<script type="text/javascript">
        $(document).ready(function(){
            doSomething();
        });
    </script>{% endaddtoblock %}


.. note::
        If the Plugin requires javascript code to be rendered properly,
        the class ``'cms-execute-js-to-render'`` can be added to the script tag.
        This will download and execute all scripts with this class, which weren't present before,
        when the plugin is first added to the page.
        If the javascript code is protected from prematurely executing by
        the EventListener for the event ``'load'`` and/or ``'DOMContentLoaded'``,
        the following classes can be added to the script tag:

        ===========================================  ========================================================
        Classname                                    Corresponding javascript code
        ===========================================  ========================================================
        cms-trigger-event-document-DOMContentLoaded  ``document.dispatchEvent(new Event('DOMContentLoaded')``
        cms-trigger-event-window-DOMContentLoaded    ``window.dispatchEvent(new Event('DOMContentLoaded')``
        cms-trigger-event-window-load                ``window.dispatchEvent(new Event('load')``
        ===========================================  ========================================================


        The events will be triggered once after all scripts are successfully injected into the DOM.


.. _plugin-context-processors:


Plugin Context
==============

The plugin has access to the django template context. You can override
variables using the ``with`` tag.

Example::

    {% with 320 as width %}{% placeholder "content" %}{% endwith %}


Plugin Context Processors
=========================

Plugin context processors are callables that modify all plugins' context before
rendering. They are enabled using the :setting:`CMS_PLUGIN_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`
setting.

A plugin context processor takes 3 arguments:

* ``instance``: The instance of the plugin model
* ``placeholder``: The instance of the placeholder this plugin appears in.
* ``context``: The context that is in use, including the request.

The return value should be a dictionary containing any variables to be added to
the context.

Example:


.. code-block::

    def add_verbose_name(instance, placeholder, context):
        '''
        This plugin context processor adds the plugin model's verbose_name to context.
        '''
        return {'verbose_name': instance._meta.verbose_name}



Plugin Processors
=================

Plugin processors are callables that modify all plugins' output after rendering.
They are enabled using the :setting:`CMS_PLUGIN_PROCESSORS` setting.

A plugin processor takes 4 arguments:

* ``instance``: The instance of the plugin model
* ``placeholder``: The instance of the placeholder this plugin appears in.
* ``rendered_content``: A string containing the rendered content of the plugin.
* ``original_context``: The original context for the template used to render
  the plugin.

.. note:: Plugin processors are also applied to plugins embedded in Text
          plugins (and any custom plugin allowing nested plugins). Depending on
          what your processor does, this might break the output. For example,
          if your processor wraps the output in a ``div`` tag, you might end up
          having ``div`` tags inside of ``p`` tags, which is invalid. You can
          prevent such cases by returning ``rendered_content`` unchanged if
          ``instance._render_meta.text_enabled`` is ``True``, which is the case
          when rendering an embedded plugin.

Example
-------

Suppose you want to wrap each plugin in the main placeholder in a colored box
but it would be too complicated to edit each individual plugin's template:

In your ``settings.py``::

    CMS_PLUGIN_PROCESSORS = (
        'yourapp.cms_plugin_processors.wrap_in_colored_box',
    )

In your ``yourapp.cms_plugin_processors.py``:


.. code-block::

    def wrap_in_colored_box(instance, placeholder, rendered_content, original_context):
        '''
        This plugin processor wraps each plugin's output in a colored box if it is in the "main" placeholder.
        '''
        # Plugins not in the main placeholder should remain unchanged
        # Plugins embedded in Text should remain unchanged in order not to break output
        if placeholder.slot != 'main' or (instance._render_meta.text_enabled and instance.parent):
            return rendered_content
        else:
            from django.template import Context, Template
            # For simplicity's sake, construct the template from a string:
            t = Template('<div style="border: 10px {{ border_color }} solid; background: {{ background_color }};">{{ content|safe }}</div>')
            # Prepare that template's context:
            c = Context({
                'content': rendered_content,
                # Some plugin models might allow you to customise the colors,
                # for others, use default colors:
                'background_color': instance.background_color if hasattr(instance, 'background_color') else 'lightyellow',
                'border_color': instance.border_color if hasattr(instance, 'border_color') else 'lightblue',
            })
            # Finally, render the content through that template, and return the output
            return t.render(c)

Nested Plugins
==============

You can nest CMS Plugins in themselves. There's a few things required to
achieve this functionality:

``models.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    class ParentPlugin(CMSPlugin):
        # add your fields here

    class ChildPlugin(CMSPlugin):
        # add your fields here


``cms_plugins.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from .models import ParentPlugin, ChildPlugin

    @plugin_pool.register_plugin
    class ParentCMSPlugin(CMSPluginBase):
        render_template = 'parent.html'
        name = 'Parent'
        model = ParentPlugin
        allow_children = True  # This enables the parent plugin to accept child plugins
        # You can also specify a list of plugins that are accepted as children,
        # or leave it away completely to accept all
        # child_classes = ['ChildCMSPlugin']

        def render(self, context, instance, placeholder):
            context = super().render(context, instance, placeholder)
            return context


    @plugin_pool.register_plugin
    class ChildCMSPlugin(CMSPluginBase):
        render_template = 'child.html'
        name = 'Child'
        model = ChildPlugin
        require_parent = True  # Is it required that this plugin is a child of another plugin?
        # You can also specify a list of plugins that are accepted as parents,
        # or leave it away completely to accept all
        # parent_classes = ['ParentCMSPlugin']

        def render(self, context, instance, placeholder):
            context = super(ChildCMSPlugin, self).render(context, instance, placeholder)
            return context


``parent.html``:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load cms_tags %}

    <div class="plugin parent">
        {% for plugin in instance.child_plugin_instances %}
            {% render_plugin plugin %}
        {% endfor %}
    </div>


`child.html`:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <div class="plugin child">
        {{ instance }}
    </div>


If you have attributes of the parent plugin which you need to access in the
child you can access the parent instance using ``get_bound_plugin``:

.. code-block:: django

    class ChildPluginForm(forms.ModelForm):

        class Meta:
            model = ChildPlugin
            exclude = ()

        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            if self.instance:
                parent, parent_cls = self.instance.parent.get_bound_plugin()


.. _extending_context_menus:

Extending context menus of placeholders or plugins
==================================================

There are three possibilities to extend the context menus
of placeholders or plugins.

* You can either extend a placeholder context menu.
* You can extend all plugin context menus.
* You can extend the current plugin context menu.

For this purpose you can overwrite 3 methods on CMSPluginBase.

* :meth:`~cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase.get_extra_placeholder_menu_items`
* :meth:`~cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase.get_extra_global_plugin_menu_items`
* :meth:`~cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase.get_extra_local_plugin_menu_items`

Example:


.. code-block::

    class AliasPlugin(CMSPluginBase):
        name = _("Alias")
        allow_children = False
        model = AliasPluginModel
        render_template = "cms/plugins/alias.html"

        def render(self, context, instance, placeholder):
            context = super().render(context, instance, placeholder)

                    include_self=True
                ).order_by('placeholder', 'tree_id', 'level', 'position')
                plugins = downcast_plugins(plugins)
                plugins[0].parent_id = None
                plugins = build_plugin_tree(plugins)
                context['plugins'] = plugins
            if instance.alias_placeholder_id:
                content = render_placeholder(instance.alias_placeholder, context)
                print content
                context['content'] = mark_safe(content)
            return context

.. _plugin-datamigrations-3.1:

Plugin data migrations
======================

Due to the migration from Django MPTT to django-treebeard in version 3.1, the plugin model is
different between the two versions. Schema migrations are not affected as the migration systems
(both South and Django) detects the different bases.

Data migrations are a different story, though.

If your data migration does something like:

.. code-block:: django

    MyPlugin = apps.get_model('my_app', 'MyPlugin')

    for plugin in MyPlugin.objects.all():
        ... do something ...

You may end up with an error like
``django.db.utils.OperationalError: (1054, "Unknown column 'cms_cmsplugin.level' in 'field list'")``
because depending on the order the migrations are executed, the historical models may be out of
sync with the applied database schema.

To keep compatibility with 3.0 and 3.x you can force the data migration to run before the django CMS
migration that creates treebeard fields, by doing this the data migration will always be executed
on the "old" database schema and no conflict will exist.

For South migrations add this:

.. code-block:: django

    from distutils.version import LooseVersion
    import cms
    USES_TREEBEARD = LooseVersion(cms.__version__) >= LooseVersion('3.1')

    class Migration(DataMigration):

        if USES_TREEBEARD:
            needed_by = [
                ('cms', '0070_auto__add_field_cmsplugin_path__add_field_cmsplugin_depth__add_field_c')
            ]


For Django migrations add this:

.. code-block:: django

    from distutils.version import LooseVersion
    import cms
    USES_TREEBEARD = LooseVersion(cms.__version__) >= LooseVersion('3.1')

    class Migration(migrations.Migration):

        if USES_TREEBEARD:
            run_before = [
                ('cms', '0004_auto_20140924_1038')
            ]

===================================================

.. _apphooks_how_to:

######################
How to create apphooks
######################

An **apphook** allows you to attach a Django application to a page. For example,
you might have a news application that you'd like integrated with django CMS. In
this case, you can create a normal django CMS page without any content of its
own, and attach the news application to the page; the news application's content
will be delivered at the page's URL.

All URLs in that URL path will be passed to the attached application's URL configs.

The :ref:`Tutorials <tutorials>` section contains a basic guide to :ref:`getting started with
apphooks <apphooks_introduction>`. This document assumes more familiarity with the CMS generally.


******************************
The basics of apphook creation
******************************

To create an apphook, create a ``cms_apps.py`` file in your application.

The file needs to contain a :class:`CMSApp <cms.app_base.CMSApp>` sub-class. For example::

    from cms.app_base import CMSApp
    from cms.apphook_pool import apphook_pool

    @apphook_pool.register
    class MyApphook(CMSApp):
        app_name = "myapp"  # must match the application namespace
        name = "My Apphook"

        def get_urls(self, page=None, language=None, **kwargs):
            return ["myapp.urls"] # replace this with the path to your application's URLs module

.. versionchanged:: 3.3
    ``CMSApp.get_urls()`` replaces ``CMSApp.urls``. ``urls`` was removed
    in version 3.5.


Apphooks for namespaced applications
====================================

Your application should use :ref:`namespaced URLs <django:topics-http-defining-url-namespaces>`.

In the example above, the application uses the ``myapp`` namespace. Your ``CMSApp``
sub-class **must reflect the application's namespace** in the ``app_name`` attribute.

The application may specify a namespace by supplying an ``app_name`` in its ``urls.py``, or its
documentation might advise that you when include its URLs, you do it thus:

..  code-block:: python

    re_path(r'^myapp/', include('myapp.urls', app_name='myapp'))

If you fail to do this, then any templates in the application that invoke URLs using the form ``{% url
'myapp:index' %}`` or views that call (for example) ``reverse('myapp:index')`` will throw a
``NoReverseMatch`` error.


Apphooks for non-namespaced applications
----------------------------------------

If you are writing apphooks for third-party applications, you may find one that in fact does
not have an application namespace for its URLs. Such an application is liable to tun into namespace
conflicts, and doesn't represent good practice.

However if you *do* encounter such an application, your own apphook for it will need in turn to forgo the
``app_name`` attribute.

Note that unlike apphooks without ``app_name`` attributes can be attached only to one page at a
time; attempting to apply them a second time will cause an error. Only one instance of these
apphooks can exist.

See :ref:`multi_apphook` for more on having multiple apphook instances.


Returning apphook URLs manually
===============================

Instead of defining the URL patterns in another file ``myapp/urls.py``, it also is possible
to return them manually, for example if you need to override the set provided. An example:

..  code-block:: python

    from django.urls import re_path
    from myapp.views import SomeListView, SomeDetailView

    class MyApphook(CMSApp):
        # ...
        def get_urls(self, page=None, language=None, **kwargs):
            return [
                re_path(r'^$', SomeListView.as_view()),
                re_path(r'^(?P<slug>[\w-]+)/?$', SomeDetailView.as_view()),
            ]

However, it's much neater to keep them in the application's ``urls.py``, where they can easily be
reused.


.. _reloading_apphooks:

Loading new and re-configured apphooks
======================================

Certain apphook-related changes require server restarts in order to be loaded.

Whenever you:

* add or remove an apphook
* change the slug of a page containing an apphook or the slug of a page which has a descendant with
  an apphook

the URL caches must be reloaded.

If you have the :ref:`ApphookReloadMiddleware` installed, which is recommended, the server will do
it for you by re-initialising the URL patterns automatically.

Otherwise, you will need to restart the server manually.


****************
Using an apphook
****************

Once your apphook has been set up and loaded, you'll now be able to select the *Application* that's
hooked into that page from its *Advanced settings*.

.. note::

    An apphook won't actually do anything until the page it belongs to is published. Take note that
    this also means all parent pages must also be published.

The apphook attaches all of the apphooked application's URLs to the page; its root URL will be the
page's own URL, and any lower-level URLs will be on the same URL path.

So, given an application with the ``urls.py`` for the views ``index_view`` and ``archive_view``::

    urlpatterns = [
        re_path(r'^$', index_view),
        re_path(r'^archive/$', archive_view),
    ]

attached to a page whose URL path is ``/hello/world/``, the views will be exposed as follows:

* ``index_view`` at ``/hello/world/``
* ``archive_view`` at ``/hello/world/archive/``


Sub-pages of an apphooked page
==============================

..  important::

    Don't add child pages to a page with an apphook.

    The apphook "swallows" all URLs below that of the page, handing them over to the attached
    application. If you have any child pages of the apphooked page, django CMS will not be
    able to serve them reliably.


*****************
Managing apphooks
*****************

Uninstalling an apphook with applied instances
==============================================

If you remove an apphook class from your system (in effect uninstalling it) that still has
instances applied to pages, django CMS tries to handle this as gracefully as possible:

* Affected pages still maintain a record of the applied apphook; if the apphook class is
  subsequently reinstated, it will work as before.
* The page list will show apphook indicators where appropriate.
* The page will otherwise behave like a normal django CMS page, and display its placeholders in the
  usual way.
* If you save the page's *Advanced settings*, the apphook will be removed.


Management commands
===================

You can clear uninstalled apphook instances using the CMS management command ``uninstall apphooks``. For example::

    manage.py cms uninstall apphooks MyApphook MyOtherApphook

You can get a list of installed apphooks using the :ref:`cms-list-command`; in this case::

    manage.py cms list apphooks

See the :ref:`Management commands reference <management_commands>` for more information.


.. _apphook_menus:

************************
Adding menus to apphooks
************************

Generally, it is recommended to allow the user to control whether a menu is attached to a page (See
:ref:`integration_attach_menus` for more on these menus). However, an apphook can be made to do
this automatically if required. It will behave just as if the menu had been attached to the page
using its *Advanced settings*).

Menus can be added to an apphook using the ``get_menus()`` method. On the basis of the example above::

    # [...]
    from myapp.cms_menus import MyAppMenu

    class MyApphook(CMSApp):
        # [...]
        def get_menus(self, page=None, language=None, **kwargs):
            return [MyAppMenu]

.. versionchanged:: 3.3
    ``CMSApp.get_menus()`` replaces ``CMSApp.menus``. The ``menus`` attribute is now deprecated and
    has been removed in version 3.5.


The menus returned in the ``get_menus()`` method need to return a list of nodes, in their
``get_nodes()`` methods. :ref:`integration_attach_menus` has more information on creating menu
classes that generate nodes.

You can return multiple menu classes; all will be attached to the same page:


.. code-block::

    def get_menus(self, page=None, language=None, **kwargs):
        return [MyAppMenu, CategoryMenu]


.. _apphook_permissions:

********************************
Managing permissions on apphooks
********************************

By default the content represented by an apphook has the same permissions set as the page it is
assigned to. So if for example a page requires the user to be logged in, then the attached apphook
and all its URLs will have the same requirements.

To disable this behaviour set ``permissions = False`` on your apphook:


.. code-block::

    class MyApphook(CMSApp):
        [...]
        permissions = False

If you still want some of your views to use the CMS's permission checks you can enable them via a decorator, ``cms.utils.decorators.cms_perms``

Here is a simple example::

    from cms.utils.decorators import cms_perms

    @cms_perms
    def my_view(request, **kw):
        ...

If you make your own permission checks in your application, then use the ``exclude_permissions`` property of the apphook:


.. code-block::

    class MyApphook(CMSApp):
        [...]
        permissions = True
        exclude_permissions = ["some_nested_app"]

where you provide the name of the application in question


***********************************************
Automatically restart server on apphook changes
***********************************************

As mentioned above, whenever you:

* add or remove an apphook
* change the slug of a page containing an apphook
* change the slug of a page with a descendant with an apphook

The CMS the server will reload its URL caches. It does this by listening for
the signal ``cms.signals.urls_need_reloading``.

.. warning::

    This signal does not actually do anything itself. For automated server
    restarting you need to implement logic in your project that gets executed
    whenever this signal is fired. Because there are many ways of deploying
    Django applications, there is no way we can provide a generic solution for
    this problem that will always work.

    The signal is fired **after** a request - for example, upon saving a page's settings. If you
    change and apphook's setting via an API the signal won't fire until a subsequent request.


**************************************
Apphooks and placeholder template tags
**************************************

It's important to understand that while an apphooked application takes over the CMS page at that
location completely, depending on how the application's templates extend other templates, a
django CMS ``{% placeholder %}`` template tag may be invoked - **but will not work**.

``{% static_placeholder %}`` tags on the other hand are *not* page-specific and *will* function
normally.

.. _complex_apphooks_how_to:

###########################################
How to manage complex apphook configuration
###########################################

In :ref:`apphooks_how_to` we discuss some basic points of using apphooks. In this document we will cover some more
complex implementation possibilities.


.. _multi_apphook:

***************************************
Attaching an application multiple times
***************************************

Define a namespace at class-level
=================================

If you want to attach an application multiple times to different pages, then the class defining the apphook *must*
have an ``app_name`` attribute:


.. code-block::

    class MyApphook(CMSApp):
        name = _("My Apphook")
        app_name = "myapp"

        def get_urls(self, page=None, language=None, **kwargs):
            return ["myapp.urls"]

The ``app_name`` does three key things:

* It provides the *fallback namespace* for views and templates that reverse URLs.
* It exposes the *Application instance name* field in the page admin when applying an apphook.
* It sets the *default apphook instance name* (which you'll see in the *Application instance name* field).

We'll explain these with an example. Let's suppose that your application's views or templates use
``reverse('myapp:index')`` or ``{% url 'myapp:index' %}``.

In this case the namespace of any apphooks you apply must match ``myapp``. If they don't, your pages using them will
throw up a ``NoReverseMatch`` error.

You can set the namespace for the instance of the apphook in the *Application instance name* field. However, you'll
need to set that to something *different* if an instance with that value already exists. In this case, as long as
``app_name = "myapp"`` it doesn't matter; even if the system doesn't find a match with the name of the instance it will
fall back to the one hard-wired into the class.

In other words setting ``app_name`` correctly guarantees that URL-reversing will work, because it sets the fallback
namespace appropriately.


Set a namespace at instance-level
=================================

On the other hand, the *Application instance name* will override the ``app_name`` *if* a match is found.

This arrangement allows you to use multiple application instances and namespaces if that flexibility is required, while
guaranteeing a simple way to make it work when it's not.

Django's :ref:`django:topics-http-reversing-url-namespaces` documentation provides more information on how this works,
but the simplified version is:

1. First, it'll try to find a match for the *Application instance name*.
2. If it fails, it will try to find a match for the ``app_name``.


.. _apphook_configurations:

**********************
Apphook configurations
**********************

Namespacing your apphooks also makes it possible to manage additional database-stored apphook configuration, on an
instance-by-instance basis.


Basic concepts
==============

To capture the configuration that different instances of an apphook can take, a Django model needs to be created - each
apphook instance will be an instance of that model, and administered through the Django admin in the usual way.

Once set up, an apphook configuration can be applied to to an apphook instance, in the *Advanced settings* of the page
the apphook instance belongs to:

.. image:: /how_to/images/select_apphook_configuration.png
   :alt: selecting an apphook configuration application
   :width: 400
   :align: center

The configuration is then loaded in the application's views for that namespace, and will be used to determined how it
behaves.

Creating an application configuration in fact creates an apphook instance namespace. Once created, the namespace of a
configuration cannot be changed - if a different namespace is required, a new configuration will also need to be
created.


********************************
An example apphook configuration
********************************

In order to illustrate how this all works, we'll create a new FAQ application, that provides a simple list
of questions and answers, together with an apphook class and an apphook configuration model that allows it to
exist in multiple places on the site in multiple configurations.

We'll assume that you have a working django CMS project running already.

Using helper applications
=========================

We'll use a couple of simple helper applications for this example, just to make our work easier.


Aldryn Apphooks Config
----------------------

`Aldryn Apphooks Config <https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-apphooks-config>`_ is a helper application that makes it
easier to develop configurable apphooks. For example, it provides an ``AppHookConfig`` for you to subclass, and other
useful components to save you time.

In this example, we'll use Aldryn Apphooks Config, as we recommend it. However, you don't have to use it in your own
projects; if you prefer to can build the code you require by hand.

Use ``pip install aldryn-apphooks-config`` to install it.

Aldryn Apphooks Config in turn installs `Django AppData <https://github.com/ella/django-appdata>`_, which provides an
elegant way for an application to extend another; we'll make use of this too.


Create the new FAQ application
==============================

.. code-block:: shell

    python manage.py startapp faq


Create the FAQ ``Entry`` model
------------------------------

``models.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from aldryn_apphooks_config.fields import AppHookConfigField
    from aldryn_apphooks_config.managers import AppHookConfigManager
    from django.db import models
    from faq.cms_appconfig import FaqConfig


    class Entry(models.Model):
        app_config = AppHookConfigField(FaqConfig)
        question = models.TextField(blank=True, default='')
        answer = models.TextField()

        objects = AppHookConfigManager()

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.question

        class Meta:
            verbose_name_plural = 'entries'

The ``app_config`` field is a ``ForeignKey`` to an apphook configuration model; we'll create it in a moment. This model
will hold the specific namespace configuration, and makes it possible to assign each FAQ Entry to a namespace.

The custom ``AppHookConfigManager`` is there to make it easy to filter the queryset of ``Entries`` using a convenient
shortcut: ``Entry.objects.namespace('foobar')``.


Define the AppHookConfig subclass
---------------------------------

In a new file ``cms_appconfig.py`` in the FAQ application:

.. code-block:: python

    from aldryn_apphooks_config.models import AppHookConfig
    from aldryn_apphooks_config.utils import setup_config
    from app_data import AppDataForm
    from django.db import models
    from django import forms
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _


    class FaqConfig(AppHookConfig):
        paginate_by = models.PositiveIntegerField(
            _('Paginate size'),
            blank=False,
            default=5,
        )


    class FaqConfigForm(AppDataForm):
        title = forms.CharField()
    setup_config(FaqConfigForm, FaqConfig)

The implementation *can* be left completely empty, as the minimal schema is already defined in
the abstract parent model provided by Aldryn Apphooks Config.

Here though we're defining an extra field on model, ``paginate_by``. We'll use it later
to control how many entries should be displayed per page.

We also set up a ``FaqConfigForm``, which uses ``AppDataForm`` to add a field to ``FaqConfig`` without actually
touching its model.

The title field could also just be a model field, like ``paginate_by``. But we're using the AppDataForm to demonstrate
this capability.


Define its admin properties
---------------------------

In ``admin.py`` we need to define all fields we'd like to display:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib import admin
    from .cms_appconfig import FaqConfig
    from .models import Entry
    from aldryn_apphooks_config.admin import ModelAppHookConfig, BaseAppHookConfig


    class EntryAdmin(ModelAppHookConfig, admin.ModelAdmin):
        list_display = (
            'question',
            'answer',
            'app_config',
        )
        list_filter = (
            'app_config',
        )
    admin.site.register(Entry, EntryAdmin)


    class FaqConfigAdmin(BaseAppHookConfig, admin.ModelAdmin):
        def get_config_fields(self):
            return (
                'paginate_by',
                'config.title',
            )
    admin.site.register(FaqConfig, FaqConfigAdmin)

``get_config_fields`` defines the fields that should be displayed. Any fields
using the AppData forms need to be prefixed by ``config.``.


Define the apphook itself
-------------------------

Now let's create the apphook, and set it up with support for multiple instances. In ``cms_apps.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from aldryn_apphooks_config.app_base import CMSConfigApp
    from cms.apphook_pool import apphook_pool
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
    from .cms_appconfig import FaqConfig


    @apphook_pool.register
    class FaqApp(CMSConfigApp):
        name = _("Faq App")
        app_name = "faq"
        app_config = FaqConfig

        def get_urls(self, page=None, language=None, **kwargs):
            return ["faq.urls"]


Define a list view for FAQ entries
----------------------------------

We have all the basics in place. Now we'll add a list view for the FAQ entries
that only displays entries for the currently used namespace. In ``views.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from aldryn_apphooks_config.mixins import AppConfigMixin
    from django.views import generic
    from .models import Entry


    class IndexView(AppConfigMixin, generic.ListView):
        model = Entry
        template_name = 'faq/index.html'

        def get_queryset(self):
            qs = super().get_queryset()
            return qs.namespace(self.namespace)

        def get_paginate_by(self, queryset):
            try:
                return self.config.paginate_by
            except AttributeError:
                return 10


``AppConfigMixin`` saves you the work of setting any attributes in your view - it automatically sets, for the view
class instance:

* current namespace in ``self.namespace``
* namespace configuration (the instance of FaqConfig) in ``self.config``
* current application in the ``current_app parameter`` passed to the
  ``Response`` class

In this case we're filtering to only show entries assigned to the current
namespace in ``get_queryset``. ``qs.namespace``, thanks to the model manager we defined earlier, is the equivalent of
``qs.filter(app_config__namespace=self.namespace)``.

In ``get_paginate_by`` we use the value from our appconfig model.


Define a template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In ``faq/templates/faq/index.html``:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends 'base.html' %}

    {% block content %}
        <h1>{{ view.config.title }}</h1>
        <p>Namespace: {{ view.namespace }}</p>
        <dl>
            {% for entry in object_list %}
                <dt>{{ entry.question }}</dt>
                <dd>{{ entry.answer }}</dd>
            {% endfor %}
        </dl>

        {% if is_paginated %}
            <div class="pagination">
                <span class="step-links">
                    {% if page_obj.has_previous %}
                        <a href="?page={{ page_obj.previous_page_number }}">previous</a>
                    {% else %}
                        previous
                    {% endif %}

                    <span class="current">
                        Page {{ page_obj.number }} of {{ page_obj.paginator.num_pages }}.
                    </span>

                    {% if page_obj.has_next %}
                        <a href="?page={{ page_obj.next_page_number }}">next</a>
                    {% else %}
                        next
                    {% endif %}
                </span>
            </div>
        {% endif %}
    {% endblock %}


URLconf
^^^^^^^

``urls.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.urls import re_path
    from . import views


    urlpatterns = [
        re_path(r'^$', views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),
    ]


Put it all together
===================

Finally, we add ``faq`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``, then create and run migrations:

.. code-block:: shell

    python manage.py makemigrations faq
    python manage.py migrate faq

Now we should be all set.

Create two pages with the ``faq`` apphook (don't forget to publish them), with different namespaces and different
configurations. Also create some entries assigned to the two namespaces.

You can experiment with the different configured behaviours (in this case, only pagination is available), and the way
that different ``Entry`` instances can be associated with a specific apphook.

.. _toolbar_how_to:

#########################
How to extend the Toolbar
#########################

The django CMS toolbar provides an API that allows you to add, remove and manipulate toolbar items
in your own code. It helps you to integrate django CMS's frontend editing mode into your
application, and provide your users with a streamlined editing experience.

..  seealso::

    * :ref:`Extending the Toolbar <toolbar_introduction>` in the tutorial
    * :ref:`Toolbar API reference <toolbar-api-reference>`


*********************************
Create a ``cms_toolbars.py`` file
*********************************

In order to interact with the toolbar API, you need to create a
:class:`~cms.toolbar_base.CMSToolbar` sub-class in your own code, and register it.

This class should be created in your application's ``cms_toolbars.py`` file, where it will be
discovered automatically when the Django runserver starts.

You can also use the :setting:`CMS_TOOLBARS` to control which toolbar classes are loaded.

..  admonition:: Use the high-level toolbar APIs

    You will find a ``toolbar`` object in the request in your views, and you may be tempted to
    do things with it, like:

    ..  code-block:: python

        toolbar = request.toolbar
        toolbar.add_modal_button('Do not touch', dangerous_button_url)

    \- but you should not, in the same way that it is not recommended to poke tweezers into
    electrical sockets just because you can.

    Instead, you should **only** interact with the toolbar using a ``CMSToolbar`` class, and the
    :ref:`documented APIs for managing it <toolbar-api-reference>`.

    Similarly, although a generic :meth:`~cms.toolbar.items.ToolbarAPIMixin.add_item` method is
    available, we provide higher-level methods for handling specific item types, and it is always
    recommended that you use these instead.


**********************************************
Define and register a ``CMSToolbar`` sub-class
**********************************************

..  code-block:: python

    from cms.toolbar_base import CMSToolbar
    from cms.toolbar_pool import toolbar_pool

    class MyToolbarClass(CMSToolbar):
        [...]

    toolbar_pool.register(MyToolbarClass)

The ``cms.toolbar_pool.ToolbarPool.register`` method can also be used as a decorator:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 1

    @toolbar_pool.register
    class MyToolbarClass(CMSToolbar):
        [...]


********************
Populate the toolbar
********************

Two methods are available to control what will appear in the django CMS toolbar:

* ``populate()``, which is called *before* the rest of the page is rendered
* ``post_template_populate()``, which is called *after* the page's template is rendered

The latter method allows you to manage the toolbar based on the contents of the page, such as the
state of plugins or placeholders, but unless you need to do this, you should opt for the more
simple ``populate()`` method.

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3-5

    class MyToolbar(CMSToolbar):

        def populate(self):

            # add items to the toolbar

Now you have to decide exactly what items will appear in your toolbar. These can include:

* :ref:`menus <create-toolbar-menu>`
* :ref:`buttons <create-toolbar-button>` and button lists
* various other toolbar items


Add links and buttons to the toolbar
====================================

You can add links and buttons as entries to a menu instance, using the various
``add_`` methods.

====================== ============================================================= ===========================================================
Action                 Text link variant                                             Button variant
====================== ============================================================= ===========================================================
Open link              :meth:`~cms.toolbar.items.ToolbarAPIMixin.add_link_item`      :meth:`~cms.toolbar.toolbar.CMSToolbar.add_button`
Open link in sideframe :meth:`~cms.toolbar.items.ToolbarAPIMixin.add_sideframe_item` :meth:`~cms.toolbar.toolbar.CMSToolbar.add_sideframe_button`
Open link in modal     :meth:`~cms.toolbar.items.ToolbarAPIMixin.add_modal_item`     :meth:`~cms.toolbar.toolbar.CMSToolbar.add_modal_button`
POST action            :meth:`~cms.toolbar.items.ToolbarAPIMixin.add_ajax_item`
====================== ============================================================= ===========================================================

The basic form for using any of these is:

..  code-block:: python

    def populate(self):

        self.toolbar.add_link_item( # or add_button(), add_modal_item(), etc
            name='A link',
            url=url
            )

Note that although these toolbar items may take various positional arguments in their methods, **we
strongly recommend using named arguments**, as above. This will help ensure that your own toolbar
classes and methods survive upgrades. See the reference documentation linked to in the table above
for details of the signature of each method.


Opening a URL in an iframe
--------------------------

A common case is to provide a URL that opens in a sideframe or modal dialog on the same page.
*Administration...* in the site menu, that opens the Django admin in a sideframe, is a good
example of this. Both the sideframe and modal are HTML iframes.

A typical use for a sideframe is to display an admin list (similar to that used in the
:ref:`tutorial example <add-nodes-to-polls-menu>`):

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 1, 8-11

    from cms.utils.urlutils import admin_reverse
    [...]

    class PollToolbar(CMSToolbar):

        def populate(self):

            self.toolbar.add_sideframe_item(
                name='Poll list',
                url=admin_reverse('polls_poll_changelist')
                )

A typical use for a modal item is to display the admin for a model instance:

..  code-block:: python

        self.toolbar.add_modal_item(name='Add new poll', url=admin_reverse('polls_poll_add'))

However, you are not restricted to these examples, and you may open any suitable resource inside
the modal or sideframe. Note that protocols may need to match and the requested resource must allow
it.


..  _create-toolbar-button:

Adding buttons to the toolbar
-----------------------------

A button is a sub-class of :class:`cms.toolbar.items.Button`

Buttons can also be added in a list - a :class:`~cms.toolbar.items.ButtonList` is a group of
visually-linked buttons.

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3-5

    def populate(self):

        button_list = self.toolbar.add_button_list()
        button_list.add_button(name='Button 1', url=url_1)
        button_list.add_button(name='Button 2', url=url_2)


..  _create-toolbar-menu:

Create a toolbar menu
=====================

The text link items described above can also be added as nodes to menus in the toolbar.

A menu is an instance of :class:`cms.toolbar.items.Menu`. In your ``CMSToolbar`` sub-class, you can
either create a menu, or identify one that already exists (in order to add new items to it, for
example), in the ``populate()`` or ``post_template_populate()`` methods, using
:meth:`~cms.toolbar.toolbar.CMSToolbar.get_or_create_menu`.

..  code-block:: python

    def populate(self):
        menu = self.toolbar.get_or_create_menu(
            key='polls_cms_integration',
            verbose_name='Polls'
            )

The ``key`` is unique menu identifier; ``verbose_name`` is what will be displayed in the menu. If
you know a menu already exists, you can obtain it with
:meth:`~cms.toolbar.toolbar.CMSToolbar.get_menu`.

..  note::

    It's recommended to namespace your ``key`` with the application name. Otherwise, another
    application could unexpectedly interfere with your menu.

Once you have your menu, you can add items to it in much the same way that you add them to the
toolbar. For example:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 4-7

    def populate(self):
        menu = [...]

        menu.add_sideframe_item(
            name='Poll list',
            url=admin_reverse('polls_poll_changelist')
        )


To add a menu divider
---------------------

:meth:`~cms.toolbar.items.SubMenu.add_break` will place a
:class:`~cms.toolbar.items.Break`, a visual divider, in a menu list, to allow grouping of items.
For example:

..  code-block:: python

    menu.add_break(identifier='settings_section')


To add a sub-menu
-----------------

A sub-menu is a menu that belongs to another ``Menu``:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 4-7

    def populate(self):
        menu = [...]

        submenu = menu.get_or_create_menu(
            key='sub_menu_key',
            verbose_name='My sub-menu'
            )

You can then add items to the sub-menu in the same way as in the examples above. Note that a
sub-menu is an instance of :class:`~cms.toolbar.items.SubMenu`, and may not itself have further
sub-menus.


.. _finding_toolbar_items:

******************************
Finding existing toolbar items
******************************

``get_or_create_menu()`` and ``get_menu()``
===========================================

A number of methods and useful constants exist to get hold of and manipulate existing toolbar
items. For example, to find (using ``get_menu()``) and rename the *Site* menu:

..  code-block:: python

    from cms.cms_toolbars import ADMIN_MENU_IDENTIFIER

    class ManipulativeToolbar(CMSToolbar):

        def populate(self):

            admin_menu = self.toolbar.get_menu(ADMIN_MENU_IDENTIFIER)

            admin_menu.name = "Site"

``get_or_create_menu()`` will equally well find the same menu, and also has the advantages that:

* it can update the item's attributes itself
  (``self.toolbar.get_or_create_menu(ADMIN_MENU_IDENTIFIER, 'Site')``)
* if the item doesn't exist, it will create it rather than raising an error.


``find_items()`` and ``find_first()``
=====================================

Search for items by their type:

..  code-block:: python

    def populate(self):

        self.toolbar.find_items(item_type=LinkItem)

will find all ``LinkItem``\s in the toolbar (but not for example in the menus in the toolbar - it
doesn't search *other* items in the toolbar for items of their own).

:meth:`~cms.toolbar.items.ToolbarAPIMixin.find_items` returns a list of
:class:`~cms.toolbar.items.ItemSearchResult` objects;
:meth:`~cms.toolbar.items.ToolbarAPIMixin.find_first` returns the first object in that list. They
share similar behaviour so the examples here will use ``find_items()`` only.

The ``item_type`` argument is always required, but you can refine the search by using their other
attributes, for example::

    self.toolbar.find_items(Menu, disabled=True))

Note that you can use these two methods to search ``Menu`` and ``SubMenu`` classes for items too.


.. _toolbar_control_item_position:

********************************************
Control the position of items in the toolbar
********************************************

Methods to add menu items to the toolbar take an optional :option:`position` argument, that can be
used to control where the item will be inserted.

By default (``position=None``) the item will be inserted after existing items in the same level of
the hierarchy (a new sub-menu will become the last sub-menu of the menu, a new menu will be become
the last menu in the toolbar, and so on).

A position of ``0`` will insert the item before all the others.

If you already have an object, you can use that as a reference too. For example:

..  code-block:: python

    def populate(self):

        link = self.toolbar.add_link_item('Link', url=link_url)
        self.toolbar.add_button('Button', url=button_url, position=link)

will add the new button before the link item.

Finally, you can use a :class:`~cms.toolbar.items.ItemSearchResult` as a position:

..  code-block:: python

    def populate(self):

        self.toolbar.add_link_item('Link', url=link_url)

        link = self.toolbar.find_first(LinkItem)

        self.toolbar.add_button('Button', url=button_url, position=link)

and since the ``ItemSearchResult`` can be cast to an integer, you could even do:

    self.toolbar.add_button('Button', url=button_url, position=link+1)


****************************************
Control how and when the toolbar appears
****************************************

By default, your :class:`~cms.toolbar_base.CMSToolbar` sub-class will be active (i.e. its
``populate`` methods will be called) in the toolbar on every page, when the user ``is_staff``.
Sometimes however a ``CMSToolbar`` sub-class should only populate the toolbar when visiting pages
associated with a particular application.

A ``CMSToolbar`` sub-class has a useful attribute that can help determine whether a toolbar should
be activated. ``is_current_app`` is ``True`` when the application containing the toolbar class
matches the application handling the request.

This allows you to activate it selectively, for example:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3-4

    def populate(self):

        if not self.is_current_app:
            return

        [...]

If your toolbar class is in another application than the one you want it to be active for,
you can list any applications it should support when you create the class:

..  code-block:: python

    supported_apps = ['some_app']

``supported_apps`` is a tuple of application dotted paths (e.g: ``supported_apps =
('whatever.path.app', 'another.path.app')``.

The attribute ``app_path`` will contain the name of the application handling the current request
- if ``app_path`` is in ``supported_apps``, then ``is_current_app`` will be ``True``.


*****************************
Modifying an existing toolbar
*****************************

If you need to modify an existing toolbar (say to change an attribute or the behaviour of a method)
you can do this by creating a sub-class of it that implements the required changes, and registering
that instead of the original.

The original can be unregistered using ``toolbar_pool.unregister()``, as in the example below.
Alternatively if you originally invoked the toolbar class using :setting:`CMS_TOOLBARS`, you will
need to modify that to refer to the new one instead.

An example, in which we unregister the original and register our own::


    from cms.toolbar_pool import toolbar_pool
    from third_party_app.cms_toolbar import ThirdPartyToolbar

    @toolbar_pool.register
    class MyBarToolbar(ThirdPartyToolbar):
        [...]

    toolbar_pool.unregister(ThirdPartyToolbar)


.. _url_changes:

**********************************
Detecting URL changes to an object
**********************************

If you want to watch for object creation or editing of models and redirect after they have been
added or changed add a ``watch_models`` attribute to your toolbar.

Example:


.. code-block::

    class PollToolbar(CMSToolbar):

        watch_models = [Poll]

        def populate(self):
            ...

After you add this every change to an instance of ``Poll`` via sideframe or modal window will
trigger a redirect to the URL of the poll instance that was edited, according to the toolbar
status:

* in *draft* mode the ``get_draft_url()`` is returned (or ``get_absolute_url()`` if the former
  does not exist)
* in *live* mode, and the method exists, ``get_public_url()`` is returned.


********
Frontend
********

If you need to interact with the toolbar, or otherwise account for it in your site's frontend code,
it provides CSS and JavaScript hooks for you to use.

It will add various classes to the page's ``<html>`` element:

* ``cms-ready``, when the toolbar is ready
* ``cms-toolbar-expanded``, when the toolbar is fully expanded
* ``cms-toolbar-expanding`` and ``cms-toolbar-collapsing`` during toolbar animation.

The toolbar also fires a JavaScript event called ``cms-ready`` on the document.
You can listen to this event using jQuery::

    CMS.$(document).on('cms-ready', function () { ... });

How to customise navigation menus
#################################

In this document we discuss three different way of customising the navigation
menus of django CMS sites.

1. :ref:`integration_menus`: Statically extend the menu entries

2. :ref:`integration_attach_menus`: Attach your menu to a page.

3. :ref:`integration_modifiers`: Modify the whole menu tree

.. _integration_menus:

*****
Menus
*****

Create a ``cms_menus.py`` in your application, with the following::

    from menus.base import Menu, NavigationNode
    from menus.menu_pool import menu_pool
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

    class TestMenu(Menu):

        def get_nodes(self, request):
            nodes = []
            n = NavigationNode(_('sample root page'), "/", 1)
            n2 = NavigationNode(_('sample settings page'), "/bye/", 2)
            n3 = NavigationNode(_('sample account page'), "/hello/", 3)
            n4 = NavigationNode(_('sample my profile page'), "/hello/world/", 4, 3)
            nodes.append(n)
            nodes.append(n2)
            nodes.append(n3)
            nodes.append(n4)
            return nodes

    menu_pool.register_menu(TestMenu)

.. note:: Up to version 3.1 this module was named ``menu.py``. Please
          update your existing modules to the new naming convention.
          Support for the old name will be removed in version 3.5.

If you refresh a page you should now see the menu entries above.
The ``get_nodes`` function should return a list of
:class:`NavigationNode <menus.base.NavigationNode>` instances. A
:class:`menus.base.NavigationNode` takes the following arguments:

``title``
  Text for the menu node

``url``
  URL for the menu node link

``id``
  A unique id for this menu

``parent_id=None``
  If this is a child of another node, supply the id of the parent here.

``parent_namespace=None``
  If the parent node is not from this menu you can give it the parent
  namespace. The namespace is the name of the class. In the above example that
  would be: ``TestMenu``

``attr=None``
  A dictionary of additional attributes you may want to use in a modifier or
  in the template

``visible=True``
  Whether or not this menu item should be visible

Additionally, each :class:`menus.base.NavigationNode` provides a number of methods which are
detailed in the :class:`NavigationNode <menus.base.NavigationNode>` API references.


Customise menus at runtime
==========================

To adapt your menus according to request dependent conditions (say: anonymous/logged in user), you
can use `Navigation Modifiers`_ or you can make use of existing ones.

For example it's possible to add ``{'visible_for_anonymous':
False}``/``{'visible_for_authenticated': False}`` attributes recognised by the django CMS core
``AuthVisibility`` modifier.

Complete example:


.. code-block::

    class UserMenu(Menu):
        def get_nodes(self, request):
                return [
                    NavigationNode(_("Profile"), reverse(profile), 1, attr={'visible_for_anonymous': False}),
                    NavigationNode(_("Log in"), reverse(login), 3, attr={'visible_for_authenticated': False}),
                    NavigationNode(_("Sign up"), reverse(logout), 4, attr={'visible_for_authenticated': False}),
                    NavigationNode(_("Log out"), reverse(logout), 2, attr={'visible_for_anonymous': False}),
                ]


.. _integration_attach_menus:

************
Attach Menus
************

Classes that extend from :class:`menus.base.Menu` always get attached to the
root. But if you want the menu to be attached to a CMS Page you can do that as
well.

Instead of extending from :class:`~menus.base.Menu` you need to extend from
:class:`cms.menu_bases.CMSAttachMenu` and you need to define a name.

We will do that with the example from above::

    from menus.base import NavigationNode
    from menus.menu_pool import menu_pool
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
    from cms.menu_bases import CMSAttachMenu

    class TestMenu(CMSAttachMenu):

        name = _("test menu")

        def get_nodes(self, request):
            nodes = []
            n = NavigationNode(_('sample root page'), "/", 1)
            n2 = NavigationNode(_('sample settings page'), "/bye/", 2)
            n3 = NavigationNode(_('sample account page'), "/hello/", 3)
            n4 = NavigationNode(_('sample my profile page'), "/hello/world/", 4, 3)
            nodes.append(n)
            nodes.append(n2)
            nodes.append(n3)
            nodes.append(n4)
            return nodes

    menu_pool.register_menu(TestMenu)

Now you can link this Menu to a page in the *Advanced* tab of the page
settings under attached menu.


.. _integration_modifiers:

********************
Navigation Modifiers
********************

Navigation Modifiers give your application access to navigation menus.

A modifier can change the properties of existing nodes or rearrange entire
menus.


Example use-cases
=================

A simple example: you have a news application that publishes pages
independently of django CMS. However, you would like to integrate the
application into the menu structure of your site, so that at appropriate
places a *News* node appears in the navigation menu.

In another example, you might want a particular attribute of your ``Pages`` to be available in
menu templates. In order to keep menu nodes lightweight (which can be important in a site with
thousands of pages) they only contain the minimum attributes required to generate a usable menu.

In both cases, a Navigation Modifier is the solution - in the first case, to add a new node at the
appropriate place, and in the second, to add a new attribute - on the ``attr`` attribute, rather
than directly on the ``NavigationNode``, to help avoid conflicts - to all nodes in the menu.

How it works
============

Place your modifiers in your application's ``cms_menus.py``.

To make your modifier available, it then needs to be registered with
``menus.menu_pool.menu_pool``.

Now, when a page is loaded and the menu generated, your modifier will
be able to inspect and modify its nodes.

Here is an example of a simple modifier that places each Page's ``changed_by`` attribute in the corresponding
``NavigationNode``::

    from menus.base import Modifier
    from menus.menu_pool import menu_pool

    from cms.models import Page

    class MyExampleModifier(Modifier):
        """
        This modifier makes the changed_by attribute of a page
        accessible for the menu system.
        """
        def modify(self, request, nodes, namespace, root_id, post_cut, breadcrumb):
            # only do something when the menu has already been cut
            if post_cut:
                # only consider nodes that refer to cms pages
                # and put them in a dict for efficient access
                page_nodes = {n.id: n for n in nodes if n.attr["is_page"]}
                # retrieve the attributes of interest from the relevant pages
                pages = Page.objects.filter(id__in=page_nodes.keys()).values('id', 'changed_by')
                # loop over all relevant pages
                for page in pages:
                    # take the node referring to the page
                    node = page_nodes[page['id']]
                    # put the changed_by attribute on the node
                    node.attr["changed_by"] = page['changed_by']
            return nodes

    menu_pool.register_modifier(MyExampleModifier)


It has a method :meth:`~menus.base.Modifier.modify` that should return a list
of :class:`~menus.base.NavigationNode` instances.
:meth:`~menus.base.Modifier.modify` should take the following arguments:

``request``
  A Django request instance. You want to modify based on sessions, or
  user or permissions?

``nodes``
  All the nodes. Normally you want to return them again.

``namespace``
  A Menu Namespace. Only given if somebody requested a menu with only nodes
  from this namespace.

``root_id``
  Was a menu request based on an ID?

``post_cut``
  Every modifier is called two times. First on the whole tree. After that the
  tree gets cut to only show the nodes that are shown in the current menu.
  After the cut the modifiers are called again with the final tree. If this is
  the case ``post_cut`` is ``True``.

``breadcrumb``
  Is this a breadcrumb call rather than a menu call?

Here is an example of a built-in modifier that marks all node levels:

.. code-block::

    class Level(Modifier):
        """
        marks all node levels
        """
        post_cut = True

        def modify(self, request, nodes, namespace, root_id, post_cut, breadcrumb):
            if breadcrumb:
                return nodes
            for node in nodes:
                if not node.parent:
                    if post_cut:
                        node.menu_level = 0
                    else:
                        node.level = 0
                    self.mark_levels(node, post_cut)
            return nodes

        def mark_levels(self, node, post_cut):
            for child in node.children:
                if post_cut:
                    child.menu_level = node.menu_level + 1
                else:
                    child.level = node.level + 1
                self.mark_levels(child, post_cut)

    menu_pool.register_modifier(Level)

Performance issues in menu modifiers
====================================

Navigation modifiers can quickly become a performance bottleneck. Each modifier is called
multiple times: For the breadcrumb (``breadcrumb=True``),
for the whole menu tree (``post_cut=False``),
for the menu tree cut to the visible part (``post_cut=True``) and perhaps for each level
of the navigation. Performing inefficient operations inside a navigation modifier
can hence lead to big performance issues.
Some tips for keeping a modifier implementation fast:

* Specify when exactly the modifier is necessary (in breadcrumb, before or after cut).
* Only consider nodes and pages relevant for the modification.
* Perform as less database queries as possible (i.e. not in a loop).
* In database queries, fetch exactly the attributes you are interested in.
* If you have multiple modifications to do, try to apply them in the same method.

#########################################
How to implement content creation wizards
#########################################

django CMS offers a framework for creating 'wizards' - helpers - for content editors.

They provide a simplified workflow for common tasks.

A django CMS Page wizard already exists, but you can create your own for other content types very easily.


********************************
Create a content-creation wizard
********************************

Creating a CMS content creation wizard for your own module is fairly easy.

To begin, create a file in the root level of your module called ``forms.py``
to create your form(s)::

    # my_apps/forms.py

    from django import forms

    class MyAppWizardForm(forms.ModelForm):
        class Meta:
            model = MyApp
            exclude = []

Now create another file in the root level called ``cms_wizards.py``.
In this file, import ``Wizard`` as follows::

    from cms.wizards.wizard_base import Wizard
    from cms.wizards.wizard_pool import wizard_pool

Then, simply subclass ``Wizard``, instantiate it, then register it. If you were to
do this for ``MyApp``, it might look like this::


    # my_apps/cms_wizards.py

    from cms.wizards.wizard_base import Wizard
    from cms.wizards.wizard_pool import wizard_pool

    from .forms import MyAppWizardForm

    class MyAppWizard(Wizard):
        pass

    my_app_wizard = MyAppWizard(
        title="New MyApp",
        weight=200,
        form=MyAppWizardForm,
        description="Create a new MyApp instance",
    )

    wizard_pool.register(my_app_wizard)

.. note::

    If your model doesn't define a ``get_absolute_url`` function then your wizard
    will require a :ref:`get_success_url` method.

    ..  code-block:: python

        class MyAppWizard(Wizard):

            def get_success_url(self, obj, **kwargs):
                """
                This should return the URL of the created object, ¬´obj¬ª.
                """
                if 'language' in kwargs:
                    with force_language(kwargs['language']):
                        url = obj.get_absolute_url()
                else:
                    url = obj.get_absolute_url()

                return url

That's it!

.. note::

    The module name ``cms_wizards`` is special, in that any such-named modules in
    your project's Python path will automatically be loaded, triggering the
    registration of any wizards found in them. Wizards may be declared and
    registered in other modules, but they might not be automatically loaded.

The above example is using a ``ModelForm``, but you can also use ``forms.Form``.
In this case, you **must** provide the model class as another keyword argument
when you instantiate the Wizard object.

For example::

    # my_apps/forms.py

    from django import forms

    class MyAppWizardForm(forms.Form):
        name = forms.CharField()


    # my_apps/cms_wizards.py

    from cms.wizards.wizard_base import Wizard
    from cms.wizards.wizard_pool import wizard_pool

    from .forms import MyAppWizardForm
    from .models import MyApp

    class MyAppWizard(Wizard):
        pass

    my_app_wizard = MyAppWizard(
        title="New MyApp",
        weight=200,
        form=MyAppWizardForm,
        model=MyApp,
        description="Create a new MyApp instance",
    )

    wizard_pool.register(my_app_wizard)

You must subclass ``cms.wizards.wizard_base.Wizard`` to use it. This is because
each wizard's uniqueness is determined by its class and module name.

See the :ref:`Reference section on wizards <wizard_reference>` for technical details of the wizards
API.

===================================================

#################################
How to extend Page & Title models
#################################

You can extend the :class:`cms.models.Page` and :class:`cms.models.Title` models with your own fields (e.g. adding an
icon for every page) by using the extension models: ``cms.extensions.PageExtension`` and
``cms.extensions.TitleExtension``, respectively.


************************
Title vs Page extensions
************************

The difference between a **page extension** and a **title extension** is related to the difference
between the :class:`cms.models.Page` and :class:`cms.models.Title` models.

* ``PageExtension``: use to add fields that should have **the same values** for the different language versions of a
  page - for example, an icon.
* ``TitleExtension``: use to add fields that should have **language-specific values** for different language versions
  of a page - for example, keywords.


***************************
Implement a basic extension
***************************

Three basic steps are required:

* add the extension *model*
* add the extension *admin*
* add a toolbar menu item for the extension


Page model extension example
============================

The model
---------

To add a field to the Page model, create a class that inherits from ``cms.extensions.PageExtension``. Your class should
live in one of your applications' ``models.py`` (or module).

.. note::

    Since ``PageExtension`` (and ``TitleExtension``) inherit from ``django.db.models.Model``, you
    are free to add any field you want but make sure you don't use a unique constraint on any of
    your added fields because uniqueness prevents the copy mechanism of the extension from working
    correctly. This means that you can't use one-to-one relations on the extension model.

Finally, you'll need to register the model using ``extension_pool``.

Here's a simple example which adds an ``icon`` field to the page::

    from django.db import models
    from cms.extensions import PageExtension
    from cms.extensions.extension_pool import extension_pool


    class IconExtension(PageExtension):
        image = models.ImageField(upload_to='icons')


    extension_pool.register(IconExtension)

Of course, you will need to make and run a migration for this new model.


The admin
---------

To make your extension editable, you must first create an admin class that
sub-classes ``cms.extensions.PageExtensionAdmin``. This admin handles page
permissions.

.. note::

    If you want to use your own admin class, make sure to exclude the live versions of the
    extensions by using ``filter(extended_object__publisher_is_draft=True)`` on the queryset.

Continuing with the example model above, here's a simple corresponding
``PageExtensionAdmin`` class::

    from django.contrib import admin
    from cms.extensions import PageExtensionAdmin

    from .models import IconExtension


    class IconExtensionAdmin(PageExtensionAdmin):
        pass

    admin.site.register(IconExtension, IconExtensionAdmin)


Since PageExtensionAdmin inherits from ``ModelAdmin``, you'll be able to use the
normal set of Django ``ModelAdmin`` properties appropriate to your
needs.

.. note::

    Note that the field that holds the relationship between the extension and a
    CMS Page is non-editable, so it does not appear directly in the Page admin views. This may be
    addressed in a future update, but in the meantime the toolbar provides access to it.


The toolbar item
----------------

You'll also want to make your model editable from the cms toolbar in order to
associate each instance of the extension model with a page.

To add toolbar items for your extension create a file named ``cms_toolbars.py``
in one of your apps, and add the relevant menu entries for the extension on each page.

Here's a simple version for our example. This example adds a node to the existing *Page* menu, called *Page icon*. When
selected, it will open a modal dialog in which the *Page icon* field can be edited.

::

    from cms.toolbar_pool import toolbar_pool
    from cms.extensions.toolbar import ExtensionToolbar
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
    from .models import IconExtension


    @toolbar_pool.register
    class IconExtensionToolbar(ExtensionToolbar):
        # defines the model for the current toolbar
        model = IconExtension

        def populate(self):
            # setup the extension toolbar with permissions and sanity checks
            current_page_menu = self._setup_extension_toolbar()

            # if it's all ok
            if current_page_menu:
                # retrieves the instance of the current extension (if any) and the toolbar item URL
                page_extension, url = self.get_page_extension_admin()
                if url:
                    # adds a toolbar item in position 0 (at the top of the menu)
                    current_page_menu.add_modal_item(_('Page Icon'), url=url,
                        disabled=not self.toolbar.edit_mode_active, position=0)


Title model extension example
=============================

In this example, we'll create a ``Rating`` extension field, that can be applied to each ``Title``, in other words, to
each language version of each ``Page``.

..  note::

    Please refer to the more detailed discussion above of the Page model extension example, and in particular to the
    special **notes**.


The model
---------

::

    from django.db import models
    from cms.extensions import TitleExtension
    from cms.extensions.extension_pool import extension_pool


    class RatingExtension(TitleExtension):
        rating = models.IntegerField()


    extension_pool.register(RatingExtension)


The admin
---------

::

    from django.contrib import admin
    from cms.extensions import TitleExtensionAdmin
    from .models import RatingExtension


    class RatingExtensionAdmin(TitleExtensionAdmin):
        pass


    admin.site.register(RatingExtension, RatingExtensionAdmin)


The toolbar item
----------------

In this example, we need to loop over the titles for the page, and populate the menu with those.

::

    from cms.toolbar_pool import toolbar_pool
    from cms.extensions.toolbar import ExtensionToolbar
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
    from .models import RatingExtension
    from cms.utils import get_language_list  # needed to get the page's languages
    @toolbar_pool.register
    class RatingExtensionToolbar(ExtensionToolbar):
        # defines the model for the current toolbar
        model = RatingExtension

        def populate(self):
            # setup the extension toolbar with permissions and sanity checks
            current_page_menu = self._setup_extension_toolbar()

            # if it's all ok
            if current_page_menu and self.toolbar.edit_mode_active:
                # create a sub menu labelled "Ratings" at position 1 in the menu
                sub_menu = self._get_sub_menu(
                    current_page_menu, 'submenu_label', 'Ratings', position=1
                    )

                # retrieves the instances of the current title extension (if any)
                # and the toolbar item URL
                urls = self.get_title_extension_admin()

                # we now also need to get the titleset (i.e. different language titles)
                # for this page
                page = self._get_page()
                titleset = page.title_set.filter(language__in=get_language_list(page.node.site_id))

                # create a 3-tuple of (title_extension, url, title)
                nodes = [(title_extension, url, title.title) for (
                    (title_extension, url), title) in zip(urls, titleset)
                    ]

                # cycle through the list of nodes
                for title_extension, url, title in nodes:

                    # adds toolbar items
                    sub_menu.add_modal_item(
                        'Rate %s' % title, url=url, disabled=not self.toolbar.edit_mode_active
                        )



****************
Using extensions
****************

In templates
============

To access a page extension in page templates you can simply access the
appropriate related_name field that is now available on the Page object.


Page extensions
---------------

As per the normal related_name naming mechanism, the appropriate field to
access is the same as your ``PageExtension`` model name, but lowercased. Assuming
your Page Extension model class is ``IconExtension``, the relationship to the
page extension model will be available on ``page.iconextension``. From there
you can access the extra fields you defined in your extension, so you can use
something like::

    {% load static %}

    {# rest of template omitted ... #}

    {% if request.current_page.iconextension %}
        <img src="{% static request.current_page.iconextension.image.url %}">
    {% endif %}

where ``request.current_page`` is the normal way to access the current page
that is rendering the template.

It is important to remember that unless the operator has already assigned a
page extension to every page, a page may not have the ``iconextension``
relationship available, hence the use of the ``{% if ... %}...{% endif %}``
above.


Title extensions
----------------

In order to retrieve a title extension within a template, get the ``Title`` object using
``request.current_page.get_title_obj``. Using the example above, we could use::

    {{ request.current_page.get_title_obj.ratingextension.rating }}


With menus
==========

Like most other Page attributes, extensions are not represented in the menu ``NavigationNodes``,
and therefore menu templates will not have access to them by default.

In order to make the extension accessible, you'll need to create a :ref:`menu modifier
<integration_modifiers>` (see the example provided) that does this.

Each page extension instance has a one-to-one relationship with its page. Get the extension by
using the reverse relation, along the lines of ``extension = page.yourextensionlowercased``, and
place this attribute of ``page`` on the node - as (for example) ``node.extension``.

In the menu template the icon extension we created above would therefore be available as
``child.extension.icon``.


Handling relations
==================

If your ``PageExtension`` or ``TitleExtension`` includes a ForeignKey *from* another
model or includes a ManyToManyField, you should also override the method
``copy_relations(self, oldinstance, language)`` so that these fields are
copied appropriately when the CMS makes a copy of your extension to support
versioning, etc.


Here's an example that uses a ``ManyToManyField`` ::

    from django.db import models
    from cms.extensions import PageExtension
    from cms.extensions.extension_pool import extension_pool


    class MyPageExtension(PageExtension):

        page_categories = models.ManyToManyField(Category, blank=True)

        def copy_relations(self, oldinstance, language):
            for page_category in oldinstance.page_categories.all():
                page_category.pk = None
                page_category.mypageextension = self
                page_category.save()

    extension_pool.register(MyPageExtension)



********************
Complete toolbar API
********************

The example above uses the :ref:`simplified_extension_toolbar`.

.. _complete_toolbar_api:

If you need complete control over the layout of your extension toolbar items you can still use the
low-level API to edit the toolbar according to your needs::

    from cms.api import get_page_draft
    from cms.toolbar_pool import toolbar_pool
    from cms.toolbar_base import CMSToolbar
    from cms.utils import get_cms_setting
    from cms.utils.page_permissions import user_can_change_page
    from django.urls import reverse, NoReverseMatch
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
    from .models import IconExtension


    @toolbar_pool.register
    class IconExtensionToolbar(CMSToolbar):
        def populate(self):
            # always use draft if we have a page
            self.page = get_page_draft(self.request.current_page)

            if not self.page:
                # Nothing to do
                return

            if user_can_change_page(user=self.request.user, page=self.page):
                try:
                    icon_extension = IconExtension.objects.get(extended_object_id=self.page.id)
                except IconExtension.DoesNotExist:
                    icon_extension = None
                try:
                    if icon_extension:
                        url = reverse('admin:myapp_iconextension_change', args=(icon_extension.pk,))
                    else:
                        url = reverse('admin:myapp_iconextension_add') + '?extended_object=%s' % self.page.pk
                except NoReverseMatch:
                    # not in urls
                    pass
                else:
                    not_edit_mode = not self.toolbar.edit_mode_active
                    current_page_menu = self.toolbar.get_or_create_menu('page')
                    current_page_menu.add_modal_item(_('Page Icon'), url=url, disabled=not_edit_mode)


Now when the operator invokes "Edit this page..." from the toolbar, there will
be an additional menu item ``Page Icon ...`` (in this case), which can be used
to open a modal dialog where the operator can affect the new ``icon`` field.

Note that when the extension is saved, the corresponding page is marked as
having unpublished changes. To see the new extension values publish the page.


.. _simplified_extension_toolbar:

Simplified Toolbar API
======================

The simplified Toolbar API works by deriving your toolbar class from ``ExtensionToolbar``
which provides the following API:

* ``ExtensionToolbar.get_page_extension_admin()``: for page extensions, retrieves the correct admin
  URL for the related toolbar item; returns the extension instance (or ``None`` if none exists) and
  the admin URL for the toolbar item
* ``ExtensionToolbar.get_title_extension_admin()``: for title extensions, retrieves the correct
  admin URL for the related toolbar item; returns a list of the extension instances (or ``None`` if
  none exists) and the admin URLs for each title of the current page

************
Testing Apps
************

Resolving View Names
====================

Your apps need testing, but in your live site they aren't in ``urls.py`` as
they are attached to a CMS page.  So if you want to be able to use
:func:`~django.urls.reverse()` in your tests, or test templates that
use the :ttag:`url` template tag, you need to hook up your app to a special
test version of ``urls.py`` and tell your tests to use that.

So you could create ``myapp/tests/urls.py`` with the following code::

    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import re_path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        re_path(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
        re_path(r'^myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),
        re_path(r'', include('cms.urls')),
    ]

And then in your tests you can plug this in with the
:func:`~django.test.override_settings` decorator::

    from django.test.utils import override_settings
    from cms.test_utils.testcases import CMSTestCase

    class MyappTests(CMSTestCase):

        @override_settings(ROOT_URLCONF='myapp.tests.urls')
        def test_myapp_page(self):
            test_url = reverse('myapp_view_name')
            # rest of test as normal

If you want to the test url conf throughout your test class, then you can use
apply the decorator to the whole class::

    from django.test.utils import override_settings
    from cms.test_utils.testcases import CMSTestCase

    @override_settings(ROOT_URLCONF='myapp.tests.urls')
    class MyappTests(CMSTestCase):

        def test_myapp_page(self):
            test_url = reverse('myapp_view_name')
            # rest of test as normal

CMSTestCase
===========

Django CMS includes ``CMSTestCase`` which has various utility methods that
might be useful for testing your CMS app and manipulating CMS pages.


***************
Testing Plugins
***************

To test plugins, you need to assign them to a placeholder. Depending on at what
level you want to test your plugin, you can either check the HTML generated by
it or the context provided to its template::


    from django.test import TestCase
    from django.test.client import RequestFactory

    from cms.api import add_plugin
    from cms.models import Placeholder
    from cms.plugin_rendering import ContentRenderer

    from myapp.cms_plugins import MyPlugin
    from myapp.models import MyappPlugin

    class MypluginTests(TestCase):
        def test_plugin_context(self):
            placeholder = Placeholder.objects.create(slot='test')
            model_instance = add_plugin(
                placeholder,
                MyPlugin,
                'en',
            )
            plugin_instance = model_instance.get_plugin_class_instance()
            context = plugin_instance.render({}, model_instance, None)
            self.assertIn('key', context)
            self.assertEqual(context['key'], 'value')

        def test_plugin_html(self):
            placeholder = Placeholder.objects.create(slot='test')
            model_instance = add_plugin(
                placeholder,
                MyPlugin,
                'en',
            )
            renderer = ContentRenderer(request=RequestFactory())
            html = renderer.render_plugin(model_instance, {})
            self.assertEqual(html, '<strong>Test</strong>')

How to contribute a patch
#########################

.. note:: For more background on the material covered in this how-to section, see the
   :ref:`contributing-code` and :ref:`testing` sections of the documentation.

django CMS is an open project, and welcomes the participation of anyone who would like to
contribute, whatever their any level of knowledge.

As well as code, we welcome contributions to django CMS's :ref:`documentation
<contributing-documentation>` and :ref:`translations <contributing-translations>`.

.. note::
   Feel free to dive into coding for django CMS in whichever way suits you. However, you need to be
   aware of the :ref:`guidelines <contributing-code>` and :ref:`policies <management>` for
   django CMS project development. Adhering to them will make much easier for the core developers
   to validate and accept your contribution.


.. _start-contributing:

**********
The basics
**********

The basic workflow for a code contribution will typically run as follows:

#. Fork the `django CMS project <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms>`_ GitHub repository to your
   own GitHub account
#. Clone your fork locally::

    git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/django-cms.git

#. Create a virtualenv::

    virtualenv cms-develop
    source cms-develop/bin/activate

#. Install its dependencies::

    cd django-cms
    pip install -r test_requirements/django-X.Y.txt

   Replace ``X.Y`` with whichever version of Django you want to work with.

#. Install pre-commit hooks::

    pre-commit install

#. Create a new branch for your work::

    git checkout -b my_fix

#. Edit the django CMS codebase to implement the fix or feature.
#. Run the test suite::

    python manage.py test

#. Commit and push your code::

    git commit
    git push origin my_fix

#. Open a pull request on GitHub.

*******************
How to write a test
*******************

The django CMS test suite contains a mix of unit tests, functional tests, regression tests and
integration tests.

Depending on your contribution, you will write a mix of them.

Let's start with something simple. We'll assume you have set up your environment correctly as
:ref:`described above <start-contributing>`.

Let's say you want to test the behaviour of the ``CMSPluginBase.render`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    class CMSPluginBase(admin.ModelAdmin, metaclass=CMSPluginBaseMetaclass):

        ...

        def render(self, context, instance, placeholder):
            context['instance'] = instance
            context['placeholder'] = placeholder
            return context

Writing a unit test for it will require us to test whether the returned ``context`` object contains
the declared attributes with the correct values.

We will start with a new class in an existing django CMS test module (``cms.tests.plugins`` in
this case):

.. code-block:: python

    class SimplePluginTestCase(CMSTestCase):
        pass

Let's try to run it:

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py test cms.tests.test_plugins.SimplePluginTestCase

This will call the new test case class only and it's handy when creating new tests and iterating
quickly through the steps. A full test run (``python manage.py test``) is required before opening
a pull request.

This is the output you'll get::

    Creating test database for alias 'default'...

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 0 tests in 0.000s

    OK

Which is correct as we have no test in our test case. Let's add an empty one:

.. code-block:: python

    class SimplePluginTestCase(CMSTestCase):

        def test_render_method(self):
            pass

Running the test command again will return a slightly different output::

    Creating test database for alias 'default'...
    .
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 1 test in 0.001s

    OK

This looks better, but it's not that meaningful as we're not testing anything.

Write a real test:

.. code-block:: python

    class SimplePluginTestCase(CMSTestCase):

        def test_render_method(self):
            """
            Tests the CMSPluginBase.render method by checking that the appropriate variables
            are set in the returned context
            """
            from cms.api import create_page
            my_page = create_page('home', language='en', template='col_two.html')
            placeholder = my_page.placeholders.get(slot='col_left')
            context = self.get_context('/', page=my_page)
            plugin = CMSPluginBase()

            new_context = plugin.render(context, None, placeholder)
            self.assertTrue('placeholder' in new_context)
            self.assertEqual(placeholder, context['placeholder'])
            self.assertTrue('instance' in new_context)
            self.assertIsNone(new_context['instance'])

and run it::

    Creating test database for alias 'default'...
    .
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 1 test in 0.044s

    OK

The output is quite similar to the previous run, but the longer execution time gives us a hint that
this test is actually doing something.

Let's quickly check the test code.

To test ``CMSPluginBase.render`` method we need a RequestContext instance and a placeholder. As
``CMSPluginBase`` does not have any :ref:`configuration model <storing configuration>`,
the instance argument can be ``None``.

#. Create a page instance to get the placeholder
#. Get the placeholder by filtering the placeholders of the page instance on the expected
   placeholder name
#. Create a context instance by using the provided super class method
#. Call the render method on a ``CMSPluginBase`` instance; being stateless, it's easy to call
   ``render`` of a bare instance of the ``CMSPluginBase`` class, which helps in tests
#. Assert a few things the method must provide on the returned context instance

As you see, even a simple test like this assumes and uses many feature of the test utilities
provided by django CMS. Before attempting to write a test, take your time to explore the content of
``cms.test_utils`` package and check the shipped templates, example applications and, most of all,
the base ``testcases`` defined in ``cms.test_utils.testscases`` which provide *a lot* of useful
methods to prepare the environment for our tests or to create useful test data.

********************
Submitting your code
********************

After the code and the tests are ready and packed in commits, you must submit it for review and
merge in the django CMS GitHub project.

As noted above, always create a new branch for your code, be it a fix or a new feature, before
committing changes, then create your pull request from your branch to the :ref:`target
branch <target-branches>` on django CMS.


Acceptance criteria
===================

Matching these criteria from the very beginning will help the core developers to be able
to review your submission more quickly and efficiently and will increase the chances of making a
successful pull request.

Please see our :ref:`development_policies` for guidance on which branches to use, how to prepare pull requests and so
on.

Features
--------

To be accepted, proposed features should have *at least*:

 * natural language documentation in the ``docs`` folder describing the feature, its usage and
   potentially backward incompatibilities.
 * inline documentation (comments and docstrings) in the critical areas of the code explaining
   the behaviour
 * appropriate test coverage
 * Python 2/3 compatibility
 * South and Django migrations (where applicable)

The pull request description must briefly describe the feature and the intended goal and benefits.

Bugs
----

To be accepted, proposed bug fixes should have *at least*:

 * inline documentation (comments and docstrings) in the critical areas of the code explaining
   the behaviour
 * at least 1 regression test that demonstrates the issue and the fix
 * Python 2/3 compatibility
 * South and Django migrations (where applicable)

The pull request description must briefly describe the bug and the steps for its solution; in case
the bug has been opened elsewhere, it must be linked in the pull request description, describing
the fix.

API References

*******
cms.api
*******

Python APIs for creating CMS content. This is done in :mod:`cms.api` and not
on the models and managers, because the direct API via models and managers is
slightly counterintuitive for developers. Also the functions defined in this
module do sanity checks on arguments.

.. warning:: None of the functions in this module does any security or permission
             checks. They verify their input values to be sane wherever
             possible, however permission checks should be implemented manually
             before calling any of these functions.

.. warning:: Due to potential circular dependency issues, it's recommended
             to import the api in the functions that uses its function.

             e.g. use:

             :


             .. code-block::

                 def my_function():
                     from cms.api import api_function

                     api_function(...)

             instead of:

             ::

                 from cms.api import api_function

                 def my_function():
                     api_function(...)

    Publishes a page.

    :param page: The page to publish
    :type page: :class:`cms.models.Page` instance
    :param user: The user that performs this action
    :type user: :class:`django.contrib.auth.models.User` instance
    :param str language: The target language to publish to

.. function:: publish_pages(include_unpublished=False, language=None, site=None)

    Publishes multiple pages defined by parameters.

    :param bool include_unpublished: Set to ``True`` to publish all drafts, including unpublished ones; otherwise, only already published pages will be republished
    :param str language: If given, only pages in this language will be published; otherwise, all languages will be published

    :type site: :class:`django.contrib.sites.models.Site` instance

    .. note::

        This function is a generator, so you'll need to iterate over the result to actually publish
        all pages. This can be done in a single line using ``list()``:

        .. code-block:: python

            list(publish_pages())

.. function:: get_page_draft(page):

    Returns the draft version of a page, regardless if the passed in
    page is a published version or a draft version.

    :param page: The page to get the draft version
    :type page: :class:`cms.models.Page` instance
    :return page: draft version of the page

.. function:: copy_plugins_to_language(page, source_language, target_language, only_empty=True):

    Copy the plugins to another language in the same page for all the page
    placeholders.

    By default plugins are copied only if placeholder has no plugin for the target language; use ``only_empty=False`` to change this.

    .. warning:: This function skips permissions checks

    :param page: the page to copy
    :type page: :class:`cms.models.Page` instance
    :param str source_language: The source language code, must be in :setting:`django:LANGUAGES`
    :param str target_language: The source language code, must be in :setting:`django:LANGUAGES`
    :param bool only_empty: if False, plugin are copied even if plugins exists in the
     target language (on a placeholder basis).
    :return int: number of copied plugins

Example workflows
=================

Create a page called ``'My Page`` using the template ``'my_template.html'`` and
add a text plugin with the content ``'hello world'``. This is done in English::

    from cms.api import create_page, add_plugin

    page = create_page('My Page', 'my_template.html', 'en')
    placeholder = page.placeholders.get(slot='body')
    add_plugin(placeholder, 'TextPlugin', 'en', body='hello world')

######################
Command Line Interface
######################

..  module:: cms.management

.. highlight:: bash

You can invoke the django CMS command line interface using the ``cms`` Django
command::

    python manage.py cms


**********************
Informational commands
**********************

.. _cms-list-command:

``cms list``
============

The ``list`` command is used to display information about your installation.

It has two sub-commands:

* ``cms list plugins`` lists all plugins that are used in your project.
* ``cms list apphooks`` lists all apphooks that are used in your project.

``cms list plugins`` will issue warnings when it finds orphaned plugins (see
``cms delete-orphaned-plugins`` below).


.. _cms-check-command:

``cms check``
=============

Checks your configuration and environment.


**************************************
Plugin and apphook management commands
**************************************

.. _cms-delete-orphaned-plugins-command:

``cms delete-orphaned-plugins``
===============================

.. warning::

    The ``delete-orphaned-plugins`` command **permanently deletes** data from
    your database. You should make a backup of your database before using it!

Identifies and deletes orphaned plugins.

Orphaned plugins are ones that exist in the CMSPlugins table, but:

* have a ``plugin_type`` that is no longer even installed
* have no corresponding saved instance in that particular plugin type's table

Such plugins will cause problems when trying to use operations that need to copy
pages (and therefore plugins), which includes ``cms moderator on`` as well as page
copy operations in the admin.

It is recommended to run ``cms list plugins`` periodically, and ``cms
delete-orphaned-plugins`` when required.


``cms uninstall``
=================

The ``uninstall`` subcommand can be used to make uninstalling a CMS
plugin or an apphook easier.

It has two sub-commands:

* ``cms uninstall plugins <plugin name> [<plugin name 2> [...]]`` uninstalls
  one or several plugins by **removing** them from all pages where they are
  used. Note that the plugin name should be the name of the class that is
  registered in the django CMS. If you are unsure about the plugin name, use
  the :ref:`cms-list-command` to see a list of installed plugins.
* ``cms uninstall apphooks <apphook name> [<apphook name 2> [...]]`` uninstalls
  one or several apphooks by **removing** them from all pages where they are
  used. Note that the apphook name should be the name of the class that is
  registered in the django CMS. If you are unsure about the apphook name, use
  the :ref:`cms-list-command` to see a list of installed apphooks.

.. warning::

    The uninstall commands **permanently delete** data from your database.
    You should make a backup of your database before using them!


.. _cms-copy-command:

``cms copy``
============

The ``copy`` command is used to copy content from one language or site to another.

It has two sub-commands:

* ``cms copy lang`` copy content to a given language.
* ``cms copy site`` copy pages and content to a given site.

.. _cms-copy-lang-command:

``cms copy lang``
=================

The ``copy lang`` subcommand can be used to copy content (titles and plugins)
from one language to another.
By default the subcommand copy content from the current site
(e.g. the value of ``SITE_ID``) and only if the target
placeholder has no content for the specified language; using the defined
options you can change this.

You must provide two arguments:

* ``--from-lang``: the language to copy the content from;
* ``--to-lang``: the language to copy the content to.

It accepts the following options

* ``--force``: set to copy content even if a placeholder already has content;
  if set, copied content will be appended to the original one;
* ``--site``: specify a SITE_ID to operate on sites different from the current one;
* ``--verbosity``: set for more verbose output.
* ``--skip-content``: if set, content is not copied, and the command will only
  create titles in the given language.

Example::

    cms copy lang --from-lang=en --to-lang=de --force --site=2 --verbosity=2

.. _cms-copy-site-command:

``cms copy site``
=================

The ``copy site`` subcommand can be used to copy content (pages and plugins)
from one site to another.
The subcommand copy content from the ``from-site`` to ``to-site``; please note
that static placeholders are copied as they are shared across sites.
The whole source tree is copied, in the root of the target website.
Existing pages on the target website are not modified.

You must provide two arguments:

* ``--from-site``: the site to copy the content from;
* ``--to-site``: the site to copy the content to.

Example::

    cms copy site --from-site=1 --to-site=2

*******************
Moderation commands
*******************

``cms moderator``
=================

If you migrate from an earlier version, you should use the ``cms moderator on``
command to ensure that your published pages are up to date, whether or not you
used moderation in the past.

.. warning::

    This command **alters data** in your database. You should make a backup of
    your database before using it! **Never** run this command without first
    checking for orphaned plugins, using the ``cms list plugins`` command, and
    if necessary ``delete-orphaned-plugins``. Running  ``cms moderator`` with
    orphaned plugins will fail and leave bad data in your database.

``cms publisher-publish``
=========================

If you want to publish many pages at once, this command can help you. By default,
this command publishes drafts for all public pages.

It accepts the following options

* ``--unpublished``: set to publish all drafts, including unpublished ones;
  if not set, only already published pages will be republished.
* ``-l``, ``--language``: specify a language code to publish pages in only one language;
  if not specified, this command publishes all page languages;
* ``--site``: specify a site id to publish pages for specified site only;
  if not specified, this command publishes pages for all sites;


Example::

    #publish drafts for public pages in all languages
    cms publisher-publish

    #publish all drafts in all pages
    cms publisher-publish --unpublished

    #publish drafts for public pages in deutsch
    cms publisher-publish --language=de

    #publish all drafts in deutsch
    cms publisher-publish --unpublished --language=de

    #publish all drafts in deutsch, but only for site with id=2
    cms publisher-publish --unpublished --language=de --site=2

.. warning::

    This command publishes drafts. You should review drafts before using this
    command, because they will become public.

**********************
Maintenance and repair
**********************

.. _fix-tree:

``fix-tree``
============

Occasionally, the pages and plugins tree can become corrupted.
Typical symptoms include problems when trying to copy or delete plugins or pages.

This command will fix small corruptions by rebuilding the tree.

.. _fix-mptt:

``fix-mptt``
============

Occasionally, the MPTT tree can become corrupted (this is one of the reasons for :doc:`our move
away from MPTT to MP in django CMS 3.1 </upgrade/3.1>`). Typical symptoms include problems when
trying to copy or delete plugins or pages.

This command has been removed in :doc:`django CMS 3.1 </upgrade/3.1>` and replaced with `fix-tree`_.


===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/reference/configuration.rst
===================================================

.. _configuration:

#############
Configuration
#############

django CMS has a number of settings to configure its behaviour. These should
be available in your ``settings.py`` file.


.. _installed_apps:

******************************
The ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting
******************************

The ordering of items in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` matters. Entries for applications with plugins
should come *after* ``cms``.


.. _middleware:

**********************************
The ``MIDDLEWARE`` setting
**********************************

.. _ApphookReloadMiddleware:

``cms.middleware.utils.ApphookReloadMiddleware``
================================================

Adding ``ApphookReloadMiddleware`` to the ``MIDDLEWARE`` tuple will enable automatic server
restarts when changes are made to apphook configurations. It should be placed as near to the top of
the classes as possible.

.. note::

   This has been tested and works in many production environments and deployment configurations,
   but we haven't been able to test it with all possible set-ups. Please file an issue if you
   discover one where it fails.


************************
Custom User Requirements
************************

..  setting:: AUTH_USER_MODEL

When using a custom user model (i.e. the ``AUTH_USER_MODEL`` Django setting), there are a few
requirements that must be met.

django CMS expects a user model with at minimum the following fields: ``email``, ``password``,
``is_active``, ``is_staff``, and ``is_superuser``. Additionally, it should inherit from
``AbstractBaseUser`` and ``PermissionsMixin`` (or ``AbstractUser``), and must define one field as
the ``USERNAME_FIELD`` (see Django documentation for more details) and define a ``get_full_name()``
method.

The models must also be editable via Django's admin and have an admin class registered.

Additionally, the application in which the model is defined **must** be loaded before ``cms`` in ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

.. note::

    In most cases, it is better to create a ``UserProfile`` model with a one to one relationship to
    ``auth.User`` rather than creating a custom user model. Custom user models are only necessary if
    you intended to alter the default behaviour of the User model, not simply extend it.

    Additionally, if you do intend to use a custom user model, it is generally advisable to do so
    only at the beginning of a project, before the database is created.


*****************
Required Settings
*****************

..  setting:: CMS_TEMPLATES

CMS_TEMPLATES
=============

default
    ``()`` (Not a valid setting!)

A list of templates you can select for a page.

Example::

    CMS_TEMPLATES = (
        ('base.html', gettext('default')),
        ('2col.html', gettext('2 Column')),
        ('3col.html', gettext('3 Column')),
        ('extra.html', gettext('Some extra fancy template')),
    )

.. note::

    All templates defined in :setting:`CMS_TEMPLATES` **must** contain at least the ``js`` and ``css`` sekizai
    namespaces. For an example, see :ref:`basic_template`.

.. note::

    Alternatively you can use :setting:`CMS_TEMPLATES_DIR` to define a directory
    containing templates for django CMS.

.. warning::

    django CMS requires some special templates to function correctly. These are
    provided within ``cms/templates/cms``. You are strongly advised not to use
    ``cms`` as a directory name for your own project templates.


*******************
Basic Customisation
*******************

..  setting:: CMS_TEMPLATE_INHERITANCE

CMS_TEMPLATE_INHERITANCE
========================

default
    ``True``

Enables the inheritance of templates from parent pages.

When enabled, pages' ``Template`` options will include a new default: *Inherit
from the parent page* (unless the page is a root page).


..  setting:: CMS_TEMPLATES_DIR

CMS_TEMPLATES_DIR
=================

default
    ``None``

Instead of explicitly providing a set of templates via :setting:`CMS_TEMPLATES`
a directory can be provided using this configuration.

`CMS_TEMPLATES_DIR` can be set to the (absolute) path of the templates directory,
or set to a dictionary with `SITE_ID: template path` items::

    CMS_TEMPLATES_DIR: {
        1: '/absolute/path/for/site/1/',
        2: '/absolute/path/for/site/2/',
    }


The provided directory is scanned and all templates in it are loaded as templates for
django CMS.

Template loaded and their names can be customised using the templates dir as a
python module, by creating a ``__init__.py`` file in the templates directory.
The file contains a single ``TEMPLATES`` dictionary with the list of templates
as keys and template names as values::::

    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
    TEMPLATES = {
        'col_two.html': _('Two columns'),
        'col_three.html': _('Three columns'),
    }

Being a normal python file, templates labels can be passed through gettext
for translation.

..  note::

    As templates are still loaded by the Django template loader, the given
    directory **must** be reachable by the template loading system.
    Currently **filesystem** and **app_directory** loader schemas are tested and
    supported.


..  setting:: CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF

CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF
====================

default
    ``{}``

Used to configure placeholders. If not given, all plugins will be available in
all placeholders.

Example::

    CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF = {
        None: {
            "plugins": ['TextPlugin'],
            'excluded_plugins': ['InheritPlugin'],
        },
        'content': {
            'plugins': ['TextPlugin', 'PicturePlugin'],
            'text_only_plugins': ['LinkPlugin'],
            'extra_context': {"width":640},
            'name': gettext("Content"),
            'language_fallback': True,
            'default_plugins': [
                {
                    'plugin_type': 'TextPlugin',
                    'values': {
                        'body':'<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>',
                    },
                },
            ],
            'child_classes': {
                'TextPlugin': ['PicturePlugin', 'LinkPlugin'],
            },
            'parent_classes': {
                'LinkPlugin': ['TextPlugin'],
            },
        },
        'right-column': {
            "plugins": ['TeaserPlugin', 'LinkPlugin'],
            "extra_context": {"width": 280},
            'name': gettext("Right Column"),
            'limits': {
                'global': 2,
                'TeaserPlugin': 1,
                'LinkPlugin': 1,
            },
            'plugin_modules': {
                'LinkPlugin': 'Extra',
            },
            'plugin_labels': {
                'LinkPlugin': 'Add a link',
            },
        },
        'base.html content': {
            "plugins": ['TextPlugin', 'PicturePlugin', 'TeaserPlugin'],
            'inherit': 'content',
        },
    }

.. _placeholder_conf_precedence:

You can combine template names and placeholder names to define
plugins in a granular fashion, as shown above with ``base.html content``.

Configuration is retrieved in the following order:

* CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF['template placeholder']
* CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF['placeholder']
* CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF['template']
* CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF[None]

The first ``CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF`` key that matches for the required configuration attribute
is used.

E.g: given the example above if the ``plugins`` configuration is retrieved for the ``content``
placeholder in a page using the ``base.html`` template, the value
``['TextPlugin', 'PicturePlugin', 'TeaserPlugin']`` will be returned as ``'base.html content'``
matches; if the same configuration is retrieved for the ``content`` placeholder in a page using
``fullwidth.html`` template, the returned value will be ``['TextPlugin', 'PicturePlugin']``. If
``plugins`` configuration is retrieved for ``sidebar_left`` placeholder, ``['TextPlugin']`` from
``CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF`` key ``None`` will be returned.


``plugins``
    A list of plugins that can be added to this placeholder. If not supplied,
    all plugins can be selected.

``text_only_plugins``
    A list of additional plugins available only in the TextPlugin, these
    plugins can't be added directly to this placeholder.

``excluded_plugins``
    A list of plugins that will not be added to the given placeholder; this takes precedence
    over ``plugins`` configuration: if a plugin is present in both lists, it **will not** be
    available in the placeholder. This is basically a way to **blacklist** a plugin: even if
    registered, it will not be available in the placeholder. If set on the ``None`` (default)
    key, the plugins will not be available in any placeholder (except the ``excluded_plugins``
    configuration is overridden in more specific ``CMS_PLACEHOLDER_KEYS``.

``extra_context``
    Extra context that plugins in this placeholder receive.

``name``
    The name displayed in the Django admin. With the gettext stub, the name can
    be internationalised.

``limits``
    Limit the number of plugins that can be placed inside this placeholder.
    Dictionary keys are plugin names and the values are their respective
    limits. Special case: ``global`` - Limit the absolute number of plugins in
    this placeholder regardless of type (takes precedence over the
    type-specific limits).

``language_fallback``
    When ``True``, if the placeholder has no plugin for the current language
    it falls back to the fallback languages as specified in :setting:`CMS_LANGUAGES`.
    Defaults to ``True`` since version 3.1.

.. _placeholder_default_plugins:

``default_plugins``
    You can specify the list of default plugins which will be automatically
    added when the placeholder will be created (or rendered).
    Each element of the list is a dictionary with following keys :

    ``plugin_type``
        The plugin type to add to the placeholder
        Example : ``TextPlugin``

    ``values``
        Dictionary to use for the plugin creation.
        It depends on the ``plugin_type``. See the documentation of each
        plugin type to see which parameters are required and available.
        Example for a text plugin:
        ``{'body':'<p>Lorem ipsum</p>'}``
        Example for a link plugin:
        ``{'name':'Django-CMS','url':'https://www.django-cms.org'}``

    ``children``
        It is a list of dictionaries to configure default plugins
        to add as children for the current plugin (it must accepts children).
        Each dictionary accepts same args than dictionaries of
        ``default_plugins`` : ``plugin_type``, ``values``, ``children``
        (yes, it is recursive).

    Complete example of default_plugins usage::

        CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF = {
            'content': {
                'name' : _('Content'),
                'plugins': ['TextPlugin', 'LinkPlugin'],
                'default_plugins':[
                    {
                        'plugin_type':'TextPlugin',
                        'values':{
                            'body':'<p>Great websites : %(_tag_child_1)s and %(_tag_child_2)s</p>'
                        },
                        'children':[
                            {
                                'plugin_type':'LinkPlugin',
                                'values':{

                                    'url':'https://www.django-cms.org'
                                },
                                # If using LinkPlugin from djangocms-link which
                                # accepts children, you could add some grandchildren :
                                # 'children' : [
                                #     ...
                                # ]
                            },
                        ]
                    },
                ]
            }
        }

``plugin_modules``
    A dictionary of plugins and custom module names to group plugin in the
    toolbar UI.

``plugin_labels``
    A dictionary of plugins and custom labels to show in the toolbar UI.

``child_classes``
    A dictionary of plugin names with lists describing which plugins may be
    placed inside each plugin. If not supplied, all plugins can be selected.

``parent_classes``
    A dictionary of plugin names with lists describing which plugins may contain
    each plugin. If not supplied, all plugins can be selected.

``require_parent``
    A Boolean indication whether that plugin requires another plugin as parent or
    not.

``inherit``
    Placeholder name or template name + placeholder name which inherit. In the
    example, the configuration for ``base.html content`` inherits from ``content``
    and just overwrites the ``plugins`` setting to allow ``TeaserPlugin``, thus you
    have not to duplicate the configuration of ``content``.


..  setting:: CMS_PLUGIN_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS

CMS_PLUGIN_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
=============================

default
    ``[]``

A list of plugin context processors. Plugin context processors are callables
that modify all plugins' context *before* rendering. See
:doc:`/how_to/custom_plugins` for more information.


..  setting:: CMS_PLUGIN_PROCESSORS

CMS_PLUGIN_PROCESSORS
=====================

default
    ``[]``

A list of plugin processors. Plugin processors are callables that modify all
plugins' output *after* rendering. See :doc:`/how_to/custom_plugins`
for more information.


..  setting:: CMS_APPHOOKS

CMS_APPHOOKS
============

default:
    ``()``

A list of import paths for :class:`cms.app_base.CMSApp` sub-classes.

By default, apphooks are auto-discovered in applications listed in all
:setting:`django:INSTALLED_APPS`, by trying to import their ``cms_app`` module.

When ``CMS_APPHOOKS`` is set, auto-discovery is disabled.

Example::

    CMS_APPHOOKS = (
        'myapp.cms_app.MyApp',
        'otherapp.cms_app.MyFancyApp',
        'sampleapp.cms_app.SampleApp',
    )


..  setting:: CMS_ADMIN_NAMESPACE

CMS_ADMIN_NAMESPACE
=====================

default
    ``admin``

Used to configure the namespace of the admin interface.

When using a custom instance of Django's
:class:`~django.contrib.admin.AdminSite`, provide the unique instance name as
``CMS_ADMIN_NAMESPACE``. This instance name is used when :ref:`reversing admin
URLs <django:admin-reverse-urls>`.

CMS_LANGUAGES
=============

..  setting:: CMS_LANGUAGES


default
    Value of :setting:`django:LANGUAGES` converted to this format

Defines the languages available in django CMS.

Example::

    CMS_LANGUAGES = {
        1: [
            {
                'code': 'en',
                'name': gettext('English'),
                'fallbacks': ['de', 'fr'],
                'public': True,
                'hide_untranslated': True,
                'redirect_on_fallback': False,
            },
            {
                'code': 'de',
                'name': gettext('Deutsch'),
                'fallbacks': ['en', 'fr'],
                'public': True,
            },
            {
                'code': 'fr',
                'name': gettext('French'),
                'public': False,
            },
        ],
        2: [
            {
                'code': 'nl',
                'name': gettext('Dutch'),
                'public': True,
                'fallbacks': ['en'],
            },
        ],
        'default': {
            'fallbacks': ['en', 'de', 'fr'],
            'redirect_on_fallback': True,
            'public': True,
            'hide_untranslated': False,
        }
    }

.. note:: Make sure you only define languages which are also in :setting:`django:LANGUAGES`.

.. warning::

    Make sure you use **language codes** (`en-us`) and not **locale names**
    (`en_US`) here and in :setting:`django:LANGUAGES`.
    Use :ref:`check command <cms-check-command>` to check for correct syntax.

``CMS_LANGUAGES`` has different options where you can define how different
languages behave, with granular control.

On the first level you can set values for each ``SITE_ID``. In the example
above we define two sites. The first site has 3 languages (English, German and
French) and the second site has only Dutch.

The ``default`` node defines default behaviour for all languages. You can
overwrite the default settings with language-specific properties. For example
we define ``hide_untranslated`` as ``False`` globally, but the English language
overwrites this behaviour.

Every language node needs at least a ``code`` and a ``name`` property. ``code``
is the ISO 2 code for the language, and ``name`` is the verbose name of the
language.

.. note::

    With a ``gettext()`` lambda function you can make language names translatable.
    To enable this add ``gettext = lambda s: s`` at the beginning of your
    settings file.

What are the properties a language node can have?


..  setting:: code

code
----
String. RFC5646 code of the language.

example
    ``"en"``.


.. note:: Is required for every language.

name
----
String. The verbose name of the language.

.. note:: Is required for every language.


..  setting:: public

public
------
Determines whether this language is accessible in the frontend. You may want for example to keep a language private until your content has been fully translated.

type
    Boolean
default
    ``True``


..  setting:: fallbacks

fallbacks
---------
A list of alternative languages, in order of preference, that are to be used if
a page is not translated yet..

example
    ``['de', 'fr']``
default
    ``[]``


..  setting:: hide_untranslated

hide_untranslated
-----------------

Hides untranslated pages in menus.

When applied to the ``default`` directive, if ``False``, all pages in menus will be listed in all languages, including those
that don't yet have content in a particular language. If ``True``, untranslated pages will be hidden.

When applied to a particular language, hides that language's pages in menus until translations exist for them.

type
    Boolean
default
    ``True``


.. setting:: redirect_on_fallback

redirect_on_fallback
--------------------
Determines behaviour when the preferred language is not available. If ``True``,
will redirect to the URL of the same page in the fallback language. If
``False``, the content will be displayed in the fallback language, but there
will be no redirect.

Note that this applies to the fallback behaviour of *pages*. Starting for 3.1 *placeholders*
**will** default to the same behaviour. If you do not want a placeholder to follow a page's
fallback behaviour, you must set its ``language_fallback`` to ``False``
in :setting:`CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF`, above.

type
    Boolean
default
    ``True``


Unicode support for automated slugs
===================================

If your site has languages which use non-ASCII character sets, :setting:`CMS_UNIHANDECODE_HOST` and
:setting:`CMS_UNIHANDECODE_VERSION` will allow it to automate slug generation for those languages too.

Support for this is provided by the unihandecode.js project.


..  setting:: CMS_UNIHANDECODE_HOST

CMS_UNIHANDECODE_HOST
---------------------

default
    ``None``

Must be set to the URL where you host your unihandecode.js files. For licensing
reasons, django CMS does not include unihandecode.js.

If set to ``None``, the default, unihandecode.js is not used.


.. note::

    Unihandecode.js is a rather large library, especially when loading support
    for Japanese. It is therefore very important that you serve it from a
    server that supports gzip compression. Further, make sure that those files
    can be cached by the browser for a very long period.


..  setting:: CMS_UNIHANDECODE_VERSION

CMS_UNIHANDECODE_VERSION
------------------------

default
    ``None``

Must be set to the version number (eg ``'1.0.0'``) you want to use. Together
with :setting:`CMS_UNIHANDECODE_HOST` this setting is used to build the full
URLs for the javascript files. URLs are built like this:
``<CMS_UNIHANDECODE_HOST>-<CMS_UNIHANDECODE_VERSION>.<DECODER>.min.js``.


..  setting:: CMS_UNIHANDECODE_DECODERS

CMS_UNIHANDECODE_DECODERS
-------------------------

default
    ``['ja', 'zh', 'vn', 'kr', 'diacritic']``

If you add additional decoders to your :setting:`CMS_UNIHANDECODE_HOST`, you can add them to this setting.


..  setting:: CMS_UNIHANDECODE_DEFAULT_DECODER

CMS_UNIHANDECODE_DEFAULT_DECODER
--------------------------------

default
    ``'diacritic'``

The default decoder to use when unihandecode.js support is enabled, but the
current language does not provide a specific decoder in
:setting:`CMS_UNIHANDECODE_DECODERS`. If set to ``None``, failing to find a
specific decoder will disable unihandecode.js for this language.


Example
-------

Add these to your project's settings::

    CMS_UNIHANDECODE_HOST = '/static/unihandecode/'
    CMS_UNIHANDECODE_VERSION = '1.0.0'
    CMS_UNIHANDECODE_DECODERS = ['ja', 'zh', 'vn', 'kr', 'diacritic']

Add the library files from `GitHub ojii/unihandecode.js tree/dist <https://github.com/ojii/unihandecode.js/tree/master/dist>`_ to your static folder::

    project/
        static/
            unihandecode/
                unihandecode-1.0.0.core.min.js
                unihandecode-1.0.0.diacritic.min.js
                unihandecode-1.0.0.ja.min.js
                unihandecode-1.0.0.kr.min.js
                unihandecode-1.0.0.vn.min.js
                unihandecode-1.0.0.zh.min.js

More documentation is available on `unihandecode.js' Read the Docs <https://unihandecodejs.readthedocs.io/>`_.


**************
Media Settings
**************


..  setting:: CMS_MEDIA_PATH

CMS_MEDIA_PATH
==============

default
    ``cms/``

The path from :setting:`django:MEDIA_ROOT` to the media files located in ``cms/media/``


..  setting:: CMS_MEDIA_ROOT

CMS_MEDIA_ROOT
==============

default
    :setting:`django:MEDIA_ROOT` + :setting:`CMS_MEDIA_PATH`

The path to the media root of the cms media files.


..  setting:: CMS_MEDIA_URL

CMS_MEDIA_URL
=============

default
    :setting:`django:MEDIA_URL` + :setting:`CMS_MEDIA_PATH`

The location of the media files that are located in ``cms/media/cms/``


..  setting:: CMS_PAGE_MEDIA_PATH

CMS_PAGE_MEDIA_PATH
===================

default
    ``'cms_page_media/'``

By default, django CMS creates a folder called ``cms_page_media`` in your
static files folder where all uploaded media files are stored. The media files
are stored in sub-folders numbered with the id of the page.

You need to ensure that the directory to which it points is writeable by the
user under which Django will be running.


*****************
Advanced Settings
*****************

..  setting:: CMS_INTERNAL_IPS

CMS_INTERNAL_IPS
================

default
    ``[]``

By default ``CMS_INTERNAL_IPS`` is an empty list (``[]``).

If left as an empty list, this setting does not add any restrictions to the
toolbar. However, if set, the toolbar will only appear for client IP addresses
that are in this list.

This setting may also be set to an `IpRangeList` from the external package
``iptools``. This package allows convenient syntax for defining complex IP
address ranges.

The client IP address is obtained via the :setting:`CMS_REQUEST_IP_RESOLVER`
in the ``cms.middleware.toolbar.ToolbarMiddleware`` middleware.


..  setting:: CMS_REQUEST_IP_RESOLVER

CMS_REQUEST_IP_RESOLVER
=======================

default
    '`cms.utils.request_ip_resolvers.default_request_ip_resolver`'

This setting is used system-wide to provide a consistent and plug-able means
of extracting a client IP address from the HTTP request. The default
implementation should work for most project architectures, but if not, the
administrator can provide their own method to handle the project's
specific circumstances.

The supplied method should accept a single argument `request` and return an
IP address String.


..  setting:: CMS_PERMISSION

CMS_PERMISSION
==============

default
    ``False``

When enabled, 3 new models are provided in Admin:

- Pages global permissions
- User groups - page
- Users - page

In the edit-view of the pages you can now assign users to pages and grant them
permissions. In the global permissions you can set the permissions for users
globally.

If a user has the right to create new users he can now do so in the "Users -
page", but he will only see the users he created. The users he created can also
only inherit the rights he has. So if he only has been granted the right to
edit a certain page all users he creates can, in turn, only edit this page.
Naturally he can limit the rights of the users he creates even further,
allowing them to see only a subset of the pages to which he is allowed access.


..  setting:: CMS_RAW_ID_USERS

CMS_RAW_ID_USERS
================

default
    ``False``

This setting only applies if :setting:`CMS_PERMISSION` is ``True``

The ``view restrictions`` and ``page permissions`` inlines on the
:class:`cms.models.Page` admin change forms can cause performance problems
where there are many thousands of users being put into simple select boxes.

If set to a positive integer, this setting forces the inlines on that page to use
standard Django admin raw ID widgets rather than select boxes if the number of
users in the system is greater than that number, dramatically improving
performance.

If set to ``True`` it forces the inlines on Page admin to use raw ID widgets
without even counting the number of users, giving an additional performance
improvement.

.. note:: Using raw ID fields in combination with ``limit_choices_to`` causes
          errors due to excessively long URLs if you have many thousands of
          users (the PKs are all included in the URL of the popup window). For
          this reason, we only apply this limit if the number of users is
          relatively small (fewer than 500). If the number of users we need to
          limit to is greater than that, we use the usual input field instead
          unless the user is a CMS superuser, in which case we bypass the
          limit.  Unfortunately, this means that non-superusers won't see any
          benefit from this setting.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2.1: CMS_RAW_ID_USERS also applies to
                           ``GlobalPagePermission`` admin.


..  setting:: CMS_PUBLIC_FOR

CMS_PUBLIC_FOR
==============

default
    ``all``

Determines whether pages without any view restrictions are public by default or
staff only. Possible values are ``all`` and ``staff``.


..  setting:: CMS_CACHE_DURATIONS

CMS_CACHE_DURATIONS
===================

This dictionary carries the various cache duration settings.
You can override it partially, e.g. ``{'content': 3600}``.


``'content'``
-------------

default
    ``60``

Cache expiration (in seconds) for :ttag:`show_placeholder`, :ttag:`page_url`, :ttag:`placeholder` and :ttag:`static_placeholder`
template tags.

.. note::

    This settings was previously called ``CMS_CONTENT_CACHE_DURATION``


``'menus'``
-----------

default
    ``3600``

Cache expiration (in seconds) for the menu tree.

.. note::

    This settings was previously called ``MENU_CACHE_DURATION``


``'permissions'``
-----------------

default
    ``3600``

Cache expiration (in seconds) for view and other permissions.


..  setting:: CMS_CACHE_PREFIX

CMS_CACHE_PREFIX
================

default
    ``cms-``


The CMS will prepend the value associated with this key to every cache access
(set and get). This is useful when you have several django CMS installations,
and you don't want them to share cache objects.

Example::

    CMS_CACHE_PREFIX = 'mysite-live'

..  note::

    Django 1.3 introduced a site-wide cache key prefix. See Django's own docs
    on :ref:`cache key prefixing <django:cache_key_prefixing>`


..  setting:: CMS_PAGE_CACHE

CMS_PAGE_CACHE
==============

default
    ``True``

Should the output of pages be cached?
Takes the language, and time zone into account. Pages for logged in users are not cached.
If the toolbar is visible the page is not cached as well.


..  setting:: CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CACHE

CMS_INVALIDATE_PAGE_CACHE_ON_STARTUP
====================================

default
    ``True``

Should the cache version be invalidated on startup?
In a instance where you cannot access the cache in the init phase (for example,
Google App Engine) or where you don't want to invalidate the page cache on the
startup of a new instance (for example, with many instances scaling up and down
rapidly), you may want to keep the page cache version in the cache rather than
reset it on the start of every new instance.


..  setting:: INVALIDATE_PAGE_CACHE_ON_STARTUP

CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CACHE
=====================

default
    ``True``

Should the output of the various placeholder template tags be cached?
Takes the current language and time zone into account. If the toolbar is in edit mode or a plugin with ``cache=False`` is
present the placeholders will not be cached.


..  setting:: CMS_PLUGIN_CACHE

CMS_PLUGIN_CACHE
================

default
    ``True``

Default value of the ``cache`` attribute of plugins. Should plugins be cached by default if not set explicitly?

.. warning::
    If you disable the plugin cache be sure to restart the server and clear the cache afterwards.


..  setting:: CMS_LIMIT_TTL_CACHE_FUNCTION

CMS_LIMIT_TTL_CACHE_FUNCTION
============================

default
    ``None``

If defined, specifies the function to be called that allows to limit the page cache ttl value
using a business logic. The function receives one argument, the `response`, and returns an `int`
the max business value of the page cache ttl.

..  setting:: CMS_MAX_PAGE_PUBLISH_REVERSIONS


..  setting:: CMS_TOOLBARS

CMS_TOOLBARS
============

default
    ``None``

If defined, specifies the list of toolbar modifiers to be used to populate the
toolbar, as import paths. Otherwise, all available toolbars from both the CMS and
the third-party apps will be loaded.

Example::

    CMS_TOOLBARS = [
        # CMS Toolbars
        'cms.cms_toolbars.PlaceholderToolbar',
        'cms.cms_toolbars.BasicToolbar',
        'cms.cms_toolbars.PageToolbar',

        # third-party Toolbar
        'aldryn_blog.cms_toolbars.BlogToolbar',
    ]

.. _unihandecode.js: https://github.com/ojii/unihandecode.js


CMS_ENABLE_HELP
===============

default
    ``True``

This setting controls if the help menu appears in the toolbar.


CMS_EXTRA_HELP_MENU_ITEMS
=========================

Example::

    CMS_EXTRA_HELP_MENU_ITEMS = (
        (_('Community forum'), 'https://discourse.django-cms.org/'),
        (_('Documentation'), 'https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/'),
        (_('Getting started'), 'https://www.django-cms.org/en/get-started-django-cms/'),
        (_('Talk to us'), 'https://www.django-cms.org/en/support/'),
    )

This setting adds to the default links of the support menu allowing project or company support links.


CMS_COLOR_SCHEME
================

default
    ``"light"``

Sets the color scheme for django CMS' editing system. Valid values are ``"light"``,
``"dark"``, and ``"auto"``. ``"auto"`` will take the user's preference from
the browser or operating system setting (or light if no preference is available).

CMS_COLOR_SCHEME_TOGGLE
=======================

default
    ``False``

If set to ``True`` the toolbar will show a moon or sun icon allowing the user
to change the current color scheme from light to dark and vice versa.

CMS_TOOLBAR_ANONYMOUS_ON
========================

default
    ``True``

This setting controls if anonymous users can see the CMS toolbar with
a login form when ``?edit`` is appended to a URL. The default behaviour
is to show the toolbar to anonymous users.


CMS_TOOLBAR_HIDE
================

default
    ``False``

By default, the django CMS toolbar is displayed to logged-in admin users on all pages that use the ``{% cms_toolbar
%}`` template tag. Its appearance can be optionally restricted to django CMS pages only (technically, pages that are
rendered by a django CMS view).

When this is set to ``True``, all other pages will no longer display the toolbar. This includes pages with apphooks
applied to them, as they are handled by the other application's views, and not django CMS's.


.. versionchanged:: 3.2.1: CMS_APP_NAME has been removed as it's no longer required.

CMS_DEFAULT_X_FRAME_OPTIONS
===========================

default
    ``constants.X_FRAME_OPTIONS_INHERIT``

This setting is the default value for a Page's X Frame Options setting.
This should be an integer preferably taken from the ``cms.constants`` e.g.

- X_FRAME_OPTIONS_INHERIT
- X_FRAME_OPTIONS_ALLOW
- X_FRAME_OPTIONS_SAMEORIGIN
- X_FRAME_OPTIONS_DENY


..  setting:: CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE

CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE
================================

default
    ``TEMPLATE_INHERITANCE_MAGIC``

This is the path of the template used to create pages in the wizard. It must be
one of the templates in :setting:`CMS_TEMPLATES`.

..  setting:: CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER

CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER
===================================

default
    None

When set to an editable, non-static placeholder that is available on the page
template, the CMS page wizards will target the specified placeholder when
adding any content supplied in the wizards' "Content" field. If this is left
unset, then the content will target the first suitable placeholder found on
the page's template.


..  setting:: CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN

CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN
==============================

default
    ``TextPlugin``

This is the name of the plugin created in the Page Wizard when the "Content"
field is filled in. There should be no need to change it, unless you
**don't** use ``djangocms-text-ckeditor`` in your project.

..  setting:: CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN_BODY

CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN_BODY
===================================

default
    ``body``

This is the name of the body field in the plugin created in the Page Wizard
when the "Content" field is filled in. There should be no need to change it,
unless you **don't** use ``djangocms-text-ckeditor`` in your project **and**
your custom plugin defined in :setting:`CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN` have a
body field **different** than ``body``.

..  setting:: CMS_REDIRECT_PRESERVE_QUERY_PARAMS

CMS_REDIRECT_PRESERVE_QUERY_PARAMS
===================================

default
    ``False``

This indicates to the CMS that redirects should preserve the query parameters.


..  setting:: CMS_REDIRECT_TO_LOWERCASE_SLUG

CMS_REDIRECT_TO_LOWERCASE_SLUG
==============================

default
    ``False``

This indicates to the CMS that it should redirect requests with an non-lowercase
slug to its lowercase version if no page with that slug is found.

.. py:class:: cms.models.fields.PageField

    This is a foreign key field to the :class:`cms.models.Page` model
    that defaults to the :class:`cms.forms.fields.PageSelectFormField` form
    field when rendered in forms. It has the same API as the
    :class:`django:django.db.models.ForeignKey` but does not require
    the ``othermodel`` argument.


.. py:class:: cms.models.fields.PlaceholderField

    A foreign key field to the :class:`cms.models.placeholdermodel.Placeholder` model.


***********
Form fields
***********


.. py:class:: cms.forms.fields.PageSelectFormField

    Behaves like a :class:`django.forms.ModelChoiceField` field for the
    :class:`cms.models.Page` model, but displays itself as a split
    field with a select drop-down for the site and one for the page. It also
    indents the page names based on what level they're on, so that the page
    select drop-down is easier to use. This takes the same arguments as
    :class:`django.forms.ModelChoiceField`.

.. py:class:: cms.forms.fields.PageSmartLinkField

    A field making use of ``cms.forms.widgets.PageSmartLinkWidget``.
    This field will offer you a list of matching internal pages as you type.
    You can either pick one or enter an arbitrary URL to create a non existing entry.
    Takes a `placeholder_text` argument to define the text displayed inside the
    input before you type.

    The widget uses an ajax request to try to find pages match. It will try to find
    case insensitive matches amongst public and published pages on the `title`, `path`,
    `page_title`, `menu_title` fields.

Menus and navigation
####################

.. highlight:: html+django

There are four template tags for use in the templates that are connected to the
menu:

* :ttag:`show_menu`
* :ttag:`show_menu_below_id`
* :ttag:`show_sub_menu`
* :ttag:`show_breadcrumb`

To use any of these template tags, you need to have ``{% load menu_tags %}`` in
your template before the line on which you call the template tag.

..  note::

    Please note that menus live in the ``menus`` application, which though
    tightly coupled to the ``cms`` application exists independently of it.
    Menus are usable by any application, not just by django CMS.


..  templatetag:: show_menu

*********
show_menu
*********

The ``show_menu`` tag renders the navigation of the current page.
You can overwrite the appearance and the HTML if you add a ``menu/menu.html``
template to your project or edit the one provided with django CMS.
``show_menu`` takes six optional parameters: ``start_level``, ``end_level``,
``extra_inactive``, ``extra_active``, ``namespace`` and ``root_id``.

The first two parameters, ``start_level`` (default=0) and ``end_level``
(default=100) specify from which level the navigation should be rendered and at
which level it should stop. If you have home as a root node (i.e. level 0) and
don't want to display the root node(s), set ``start_level`` to 1.

The third parameter, ``extra_inactive`` (default=0), specifies how many levels
of navigation should be displayed if a node is not a direct ancestor or
descendant of the current active node.

The fourth parameter, ``extra_active`` (default=100), specifies how
many levels of descendants of the currently active node should be displayed.

The fifth parameter, ``namespace``, is currently not implemented.

The sixth parameter ``root_id`` specifies the id of the root node.

You can supply a ``template`` parameter to the tag.

Some Examples
=============

Complete navigation (as a nested list)::

    {% load menu_tags %}
    <ul>
        {% show_menu 0 100 100 100 %}
    </ul>

Navigation with active tree (as a nested list)::

    <ul>
        {% show_menu 0 100 0 100 %}
    </ul>

Navigation with only one active extra level::

    <ul>
        {% show_menu 0 100 0 1 %}
    </ul>

Level 1 navigation (as a nested list)::

    <ul>
        {% show_menu 1 %}
    </ul>

Navigation with a custom template::

    {% show_menu 0 100 100 100 "myapp/menu.html" %}


..  templatetag:: show_menu_below_id

******************
show_menu_below_id
******************

If you have set an id in the advanced settings of a page, you can display the
sub-menu of this page with a template tag. For example, we have a page called
meta that is not displayed in the navigation and that has the id "meta"::

    <ul>
        {% show_menu_below_id "meta" %}
    </ul>

You can give it the same optional parameters as ``show_menu``::

    <ul>
        {% show_menu_below_id "meta" 0 100 100 100 "myapp/menu.html" %}
    </ul>

Unlike :ttag:`show_menu`, however, soft roots will not affect the menu when
using :ttag:`show_menu_below_id`.


..  templatetag:: show_sub_menu

*************
show_sub_menu
*************

Displays the sub menu of the current page (as a nested list).

The first argument, ``levels`` (``default=100``), specifies how many levels deep
the sub menu should be displayed.

The second argument, ``root_level`` (``default=None``), specifies at what level, if
any, the menu should have its root. For example, if root_level is 0 the menu
will start at that level regardless of what level the current page is on.

The third argument, ``nephews`` (``default=100``), specifies how many levels of
nephews (children of siblings) are shown.

Fourth argument, ``template`` (``default=menu/sub_menu.html``), is the template
used by the tag; if you want to use a different template you **must** supply
default values for ``root_level`` and ``nephews``.

Examples::

    <ul>
        {% show_sub_menu 1 %}
    </ul>

Rooted at level 0::

    <ul>
        {% show_sub_menu 1 0 %}
    </ul>

Or with a custom template::

    <ul>
        {% show_sub_menu 1 None 100 "myapp/submenu.html" %}
    </ul>

..  templatetag:: show_breadcrumb

***************
show_breadcrumb
***************

Show the breadcrumb navigation of the current page. The template for the HTML
can be found at ``menu/breadcrumb.html``.::

    {% show_breadcrumb %}

Or with a custom template and only display level 2 or higher::

    {% show_breadcrumb 2 "myapp/breadcrumb.html" %}

Usually, only pages visible in the navigation are shown in the
breadcrumb. To include *all* pages in the breadcrumb, write::

    {% show_breadcrumb 0 "menu/breadcrumb.html" 0 %}

If the current URL is not handled by the CMS or by a navigation extender,
the current menu node can not be determined.
In this case you may need to provide your own breadcrumb via the template.
This is mostly needed for pages like login, logout and third-party apps.
This can easily be accomplished by a block you overwrite in your templates.

For example in your ``base.html``::

    <ul>
        {% block breadcrumb %}
        {% show_breadcrumb %}
        {% endblock %}
    <ul>

And then in your app template::

    {% block breadcrumb %}
    <li><a href="/">home</a></li>
    <li>My current page</li>
    {% endblock %}

*******************************************
Properties of Navigation Nodes in templates
*******************************************
::

    {{ node.is_leaf_node }}

Is it the last in the tree? If true it doesn't have any children.

::

    {{ node.level }}

The level of the node. Starts at 0.
::

    {{ node.menu_level }}

The level of the node from the root node of the menu. Starts at 0.
If your menu starts at level 1 or you have a "soft root" (described
in the next section) the first node would still have 0 as its ``menu_level``.
::

    {{ node.get_absolute_url }}

The absolute URL of the node, without any protocol, domain or port.
::

    {{ node.title }}

The title in the current language of the node.
::

    {{ node.selected }}

If true this node is the current one selected/active at this URL.
::

    {{ node.ancestor }}

If true this node is an ancestor of the current selected node.
::

    {{ node.sibling }}

If true this node is a sibling of the current selected node.
::

    {{ node.descendant }}

If true this node is a descendant of the current selected node.
::

    {{ node.soft_root }}

If true this node is a :ref:`soft root <soft-root>`. A page can be marked as a *soft root*
in its 'Advanced Settings'.

Menu system classes and function
********************************

``menu`` application
====================

..  class:: menus.base.Menu

    The base class for all menu-generating classes.

    ..  method:: get_nodes(self, request)

        Each sub-class of ``Menu`` should return a list of NavigationNode instances.


..  class:: menus.base.Modifier

    The base class for all menu-modifying classes. A modifier add, removes or changes NavigationNodes in the list.

    ..  method:: modify(self, request, nodes, namespace, root_id, post_cut, breadcrumb)

        Each sub-class of ``Modifier`` should implement a ``modify()`` method.

    ..  method:: get_context()


..  class:: menus.base.NavigationNode(title, url, id[, parent_id=None][, parent_namespace=None][, attr=None][, visible=True])

    Each node in a menu tree is represented by a ``NavigationNode`` instance.

    :param str title: The title to display this menu item with.
    :param str url: The URL associated with this menu item.
    :param id: Unique (for the current tree) ID of this item.
    :param parent_id: Optional, ID of the parent item.
    :param parent_namespace: Optional, namespace of the parent.
    :param dict attr: Optional, dictionary of additional information to store on
                      this node.
    :param bool visible: Optional, defaults to ``True``, whether this item is
                         visible or not.


    .. attribute:: attr

        A dictionary, provided in order that arbitrary attributes may be added to the node -
        placing them directly on the node itself could cause a clash with an existing or future attribute.

        An important key in this dictionary is ``is_page``: if ``True``, the node represents a django CMS ``Page``
        object.

        Nodes that represent CMS pages have the following keys in ``attr``:

        * **auth_required** (*bool*) ‚Äì is authentication required to access this page
        * **is_page** (*bool*) ‚Äì Always True
        * **navigation_extenders** (*list*) ‚Äì navigation extenders connected to this node
        * **redirect_url** (*str*) ‚Äì redirect URL of page (if any)
        * **reverse_id** (*str*) ‚Äì unique identifier for the page
        * **soft_root** (*bool*) ‚Äì whether page is a soft root
        * **visible_for_authenticated** (*bool*) ‚Äì visible for authenticated users
        * **visible_for_anonymous** (*bool*) ‚Äì visible for anonymous users

    .. method:: get_descendants

        Returns a list of all children beneath the current menu item.

    .. method:: get_ancestors

        Returns a list of all parent items, excluding the current menu item.

    .. method:: get_absolute_url

        Utility method to return the URL associated with this menu item,
        primarily to follow naming convention asserted by Django.

    .. method:: get_menu_title

        Utility method to return the associated title, using the same naming
        convention used by :class:`cms.models.Page`.


..  class:: menus.modifiers.Marker

    ..  method:: mark_levels()


``cms`` application
===================

..  class:: cms.menu.CMSMenu

    Subclass of :class:`menus.base.Menu`. Its :meth:`~menus.base.Menu.get_nodes()` creates a list of NavigationNodes
    based on ``Page`` objects.


..  class:: cms.menu.NavExtender

..  class:: cms.models.Page

    A ``Page`` is the basic unit of site structure in django CMS. The CMS uses a hierarchical page model: each page
    stands in relation to other pages as parent, child or sibling. This hierarchy is managed by the `django-treebeard
    <http://django-treebeard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ library.

    A ``Page`` also has language-specific properties - for example, it will have a title and a slug for each language it
    exists in. These properties are managed by the :class:`cms.models.Title` model.

**********************************************
CMSPluginBase Attributes and Methods Reference
**********************************************

..  class:: cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase

    Inherits :class:`django:django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin` and in most respects behaves like a
    normal sub-class. Note however that some attributes of ``ModelAdmin`` simply won't make sense in the
    context of a Plugin.


    **Attributes**

    ..  attribute:: admin_preview

        Default: ``False``

        If ``True``, displays a preview in the admin.


    ..  attribute:: allow_children

        Default: ``False``

        Allows this plugin to have child plugins - other plugins placed inside it?

        If ``True`` you need to ensure that your plugin can render its children in the plugin template. For example:

        .. code-block:: html+django

            {% load cms_tags %}
            <div class="myplugin">
                {{ instance.my_content }}
                {% for plugin in instance.child_plugin_instances %}
                    {% render_plugin plugin %}
                {% endfor %}
            </div>

        ``instance.child_plugin_instances`` provides access to all the plugin's children.
        They are pre-filled and ready to use. The child plugins should be rendered using
        the ``{% render_plugin %}`` template tag.

        See also: :attr:`child_classes`, :attr:`parent_classes`, :attr:`require_parent`.


    ..  attribute:: cache

        Default: :setting:`CMS_PLUGIN_CACHE`

        Is this plugin cacheable? If your plugin displays content based on the user or
        request or other dynamic properties set this to ``False``.

        If present and set to ``False``, the plugin will prevent the caching of
        the resulting page.

        .. important:: Setting this to ``False`` will effectively disable the
                       CMS page cache and all upstream caches for pages where
                       the plugin appears. This may be useful in certain cases
                       but for general cache management, consider using the much
                       more capable :meth:`get_cache_expiration`.

        .. warning::

            If you disable a plugin cache be sure to restart the server and clear the cache afterwards.


    ..  attribute:: change_form_template

        Default: ``admin/cms/page/plugin/change_form.html``

        The template used to render the form when you edit the plugin.

        Example:


        .. code-block::

            class MyPlugin(CMSPluginBase):
                model = MyModel
                name = _("My Plugin")
                render_template = "cms/plugins/my_plugin.html"
                change_form_template = "admin/cms/page/plugin/change_form.html"

        See also: :attr:`frontend_edit_template`.


    ..  attribute:: child_classes

        Default: ``None``

        A list of Plugin Class Names. If this is set, only plugins listed here can be
        added to this plugin.

        See also: :attr:`parent_classes`.


    ..  attribute:: disable_child_plugins

        Default: ``False``

        Disables dragging of child plugins in structure mode.


    .. attribute:: form

        Custom form class to be used to edit this plugin.


    ..  attribute:: frontend_edit_template

        *This attribute is deprecated and will be removed in 3.5.*

        Default: ``cms/toolbar/plugin.html``

        The template used for wrapping the plugin in frontend editing.

        See also: :attr:`change_form_template`.


    ..  attribute:: model

        Default: ``CMSPlugin``

        If the plugin requires per-instance settings, then this setting must be set to
        a model that inherits from :class:`~cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin`.

        See also: :ref:`storing configuration`.


    .. attribute:: module

        Will group the plugin in the plugin picker. If the module
        attribute is not provided plugin is listed in the "Generic"
        group.


    .. attribute:: name

        Will be displayed in the plugin picker.


    ..  attribute:: page_only

        Default: ``False``

        Set to ``True`` if this plugin should only be used in a placeholder that is attached to a django CMS page,
        and not other models with ``PlaceholderFields``.

        See also: :attr:`child_classes`, :attr:`parent_classes`, :attr:`require_parent`.


    ..  attribute:: parent_classes

        Default: ``None``

        A list of the names of permissible parent classes for this plugin.

        See also: :attr:`child_classes`, :attr:`require_parent`.


    ..  attribute:: render_plugin

        If set to ``False``, this plugin will not be rendered at all.
        Default: ``True``

        If ``True``, :meth:`render_template` must also be defined.

        See also: :attr:`render_template`, :meth:`get_render_template`.


    ..  attribute:: render_template

        Default: ``None``

        The path to the template used to render the template. If ``render_plugin``
        is ``True`` either this or ``get_render_template`` **must** be defined;

        See also: :attr:`render_plugin` , :meth:`get_render_template`.


    ..  attribute:: require_parent

        Default: ``False``

        Is it required that this plugin is a child of another plugin? Or can it be
        added to any placeholder, even one attached to a page.

        See also: :attr:`child_classes`, :attr:`parent_classes`.


    ..  attribute:: text_enabled

        Default: ``False``

        This attribute controls whether your plugin will be usable (and rendered)
        in a text plugin. When you edit a text plugin on a page, the plugin will show up in
        the *CMS Plugins* dropdown and can be configured and inserted. The output will even
        be previewed in the text editor.

        Of course, not all plugins are usable in text plugins. Therefore the default of this
        attribute is ``False``. If your plugin *is* usable in a text plugin:

        * set this to ``True``
        * make sure your plugin provides its own :meth:`icon_alt`, this will be used as a tooltip in
          the text-editor and comes in handy when you use multiple plugins in your text.

        See also: :meth:`icon_alt`, :meth:`icon_src`.


    **Methods**

    .. method:: get_plugin_urls(instance)

        Returns the URL patterns the plugin wants to register views for.
        They are included under django CMS's page admin URLS in the plugin path
        (e.g.: ``/admin/cms/page/plugin/<plugin-name>/`` in the default case).


        ``get_plugin_urls()`` is useful if your plugin needs to talk asynchronously to the admin.


    ..  method:: get_render_template()

        If you need to determine the plugin render model at render time
        you can implement the :meth:`get_render_template` method on the plugin
        class; this method takes the same arguments as ``render``.

        The method **must** return a valid template file path.

        Example:


        .. code-block::

            def get_render_template(self, context, instance, placeholder):
                if instance.attr = 'one':
                    return 'template1.html'
                else:
                    return 'template2.html'

        See also: :meth:`render_plugin` , :meth:`render_template`


    ..  method:: get_extra_placeholder_menu_items(self, request, placeholder)

        Extends the context menu for all placeholders.

        To add one or more custom context menu items that are displayed in the context menu for all placeholders when
        in structure mode, override this method in a related plugin to return a list of
        :class:`cms.plugin_base.PluginMenuItem` instances.


    ..  method:: get_extra_global_plugin_menu_items(self, request, plugin)

        Extends the context menu for all plugins.

        To add one or more custom context menu items that are displayed in the context menu for all plugins when in
        structure mode, override this method in a related plugin to return a list of
        :class:`cms.plugin_base.PluginMenuItem` instances.


    ..  method:: get_extra_local_plugin_menu_items()

        Extends the context menu for a specific plugin. To add one or more custom
        context menu items that are displayed in the context menu for a given plugin
        when in structure mode, override this method in the plugin to return a list of
        :class:`cms.plugin_base.PluginMenuItem` instances.

    .. _get_cache_expiration:

    ..  method:: get_cache_expiration(self, request, instance, placeholder)

        Provides expiration value to the placeholder, and in turn to the page
        for determining the appropriate Cache-Control headers to add to the
        HTTPResponse object.

        Must return one of:

            :``None``:
                This means the placeholder and the page will not even consider
                this plugin when calculating the page expiration.

            :``datetime``:
                A specific date and time (timezone-aware) in the future when
                this plugin's content expires.

                .. important:: The returned ``datetime`` must be timezone-aware
                               or the plugin will be ignored (with a warning)
                               during expiration calculations.

            :``int``:
                An number of seconds that this plugin's content can be cached.

        There are constants are defined in ``cms.constants`` that may be
        useful: :const:`~cms.constants.EXPIRE_NOW` and :data:`~cms.constants.MAX_EXPIRATION_TTL`.

        An integer value of ``0`` (zero) or :const:`~cms.constants.EXPIRE_NOW` effectively means
        "do not cache". Negative values will be treated as :const:`~cms.constants.EXPIRE_NOW`.
        Values exceeding the value :data:`~cms.constants.MAX_EXPIRATION_TTL` will be set to
        that value.

        Negative ``timedelta`` values or those greater than :data:`~cms.constants.MAX_EXPIRATION_TTL`
        will also be ranged in the same manner.

        Similarly, ``datetime`` values earlier than now will be treated as :const:`~cms.constants.EXPIRE_NOW`. Values
        greater than :const:`~cms.constants.MAX_EXPIRATION_TTL` seconds in the future will be treated as
        :data:`~cms.constants.MAX_EXPIRATION_TTL` seconds in the future.

        :param request: Relevant ``HTTPRequest`` instance.
        :param instance: The ``CMSPlugin`` instance that is being rendered.
        :rtype: ``None`` or ``datetime`` or ``int``


    .. _get_vary_cache_on:

    ..  method:: get_vary_cache_on(self, request, instance, placeholder)

        Returns an HTTP VARY header string or a list of them to be considered by the placeholder
        and in turn by the page to caching behaviour.

        Overriding this method is optional.

        Must return one of:

            :``None``:
                This means that this plugin declares no headers for the cache
                to be varied upon. (default)

            :string:
                The name of a header to vary caching upon.

            :list of strings:
                A list of strings, each corresponding to a header to vary the
                cache upon.


    ..  method:: icon_alt()

        By default :meth:`icon_alt` will return a string of the form: "[plugin type] -
        [instance]", but can be modified to return anything you like.

        This function accepts the ``instance`` as a parameter and returns a string to be
        used as the ``alt`` text for the plugin's preview or icon.

        Authors of text-enabled plugins should consider overriding this function as
        it will be rendered as a tooltip in most browser. This is useful, because if
        the same plugin is used multiple times, this tooltip can provide information about
        its configuration.

        :meth:`icon_alt` takes 1 argument:

        * ``instance``: The instance of the plugin model

        The default implementation is as follows:


        .. code-block::

            def icon_alt(self, instance):
                return "%s - %s" % (force_str(self.name), force_str(instance))

        See also: :attr:`text_enabled`, :meth:`icon_src`.


    .. method:: icon_src(instance)

        By default, this returns an empty string, which, if left unoverridden would
        result in no icon rendered at all, which, in turn, would render the plugin
        uneditable by the operator inside a parent text plugin.

        Therefore, this should be overridden when the plugin has ``text_enabled`` set to
        ``True`` to return the path to an icon to display in the text of the text
        plugin.

        Since djangocms-text-ckeditor introduced inline previews of plugins, the icon
        will not be rendered anymore.

        icon_src takes 1 argument:

        * ``instance``: The instance of the plugin model

        Example:


        .. code-block::

            def icon_src(self, instance):
                return settings.STATIC_URL + "cms/img/icons/plugins/link.png"

        See also: :attr:`text_enabled`, :meth:`icon_alt`


    .. method:: render(context, instance, placeholder)

        This method returns the context to be used to render the template
        specified in :attr:`render_template`.

        The :meth:`render` method takes three arguments:

        * ``context``: The context with which the page is rendered.
        * ``instance``: The instance of your plugin that is rendered.
        * ``placeholder``: The name of the placeholder that is rendered.

        This method must return a dictionary or an instance of
        :class:`django.template.Context`, which will be used as context to render the
        plugin template.

        By default this method will add ``instance`` and ``placeholder`` to the
        context, which means for simple plugins, there is no need to overwrite this
        method.

        If you overwrite this method it's recommended to always populate the context
        with default values by calling the render method of the super class:


        .. code-block::

            def render(self, context, instance, placeholder):
                context = super().render(context, instance, placeholder)
                ...
                return context

        :param context: Current template context.
        :param instance: Plugin instance that is being rendered.
        :param placeholder: Name of the placeholder the plugin is in.
        :rtype: ``dict``


    ..  method:: text_editor_button_icon()

        When :attr:`text_enabled` is ``True``, this plugin can be added in a text editor and
        there might be an icon button for that purpose. This method allows to override
        this icon.

        By default, it returns ``None`` and each text editor plugin may have its own
        fallback icon.

        :meth:`text_editor_button_icon` takes 2 arguments:

        * ``editor_name``: The plugin name of the text editor
        * ``icon_context``: A dictionary containing information about the needed icon
          like `width`, `height`, `theme`, etc

        Usually this method should return the icon URL. But, it may depends on the text
        editor because what is needed may differ. Please consult the documentation of
        your text editor plugin.

        This requires support from the text plugin; support for this is currently planned
        for `djangocms-text-ckeditor <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-text-ckeditor/>`_ 2.5.0.

        See also: :attr:`text_enabled`.


.. class:: cms.plugin_base.PluginMenuItem

    .. method:: __init___(name, url, data, question=None, action='ajax', attributes=None)

        Creates an item in the plugin / placeholder menu

        :param name: Item name (label)
        :param url: URL the item points to. This URL will be called using POST
        :param data: Data to be POSTed to the above URL
        :param question: Confirmation text to be shown to the user prior to call the given URL (optional)
        :param action: Custom action to be called on click; currently supported: 'ajax', 'ajax_add'
        :param attributes: Dictionary whose content will be added as data-attributes to the menu item

Template Tags

..  module:: cms.templatetags.cms_tags

*****************
CMS template tags
*****************

.. highlight:: html+django

To use any of the following template tags you first need to load them at the
top of your template::

    {% load cms_tags %}


Placeholders
============

..  templatetag:: placeholder

placeholder
-----------

The ``placeholder`` template tag defines a placeholder on a page. All
placeholders in a template will be auto-detected and can be filled with
plugins when editing a page that is using said template. When rendering, the
content of these plugins will appear where the ``placeholder`` tag was.

Example::

    {% placeholder "content" %}

.. image:: /reference/images/placeholder.png
   :alt: a placeholder named 'content'
   :align: center

If you want additional content to be displayed in case the placeholder is
empty, use the ``or`` argument and an additional ``{% endplaceholder %}``
closing tag. Everything between ``{% placeholder "..." or %}`` and ``{%
endplaceholder %}`` is rendered in the event that the placeholder has no plugins or
the plugins do not generate any output.

Example::

    {% placeholder "content" or %}There is no content.{% endplaceholder %}

If you want to add extra variables to the context of the placeholder, you
should use Django's :ttag:`with` tag. For instance, if you want to re-size images
from your templates according to a context variable called ``width``, you can
pass it as follows::

    {% with 320 as width %}{% placeholder "content" %}{% endwith %}

If you want the placeholder to inherit the content of a placeholder with the
same name on parent pages, simply pass the ``inherit`` argument::

    {% placeholder "content" inherit %}

This will walk up the page tree up until the root page and will show the first
placeholder it can find with content.

It's also possible to combine this with the ``or`` argument to show an
ultimate fallback if the placeholder and none of the placeholders on parent
pages have plugins that generate content::

    {% placeholder "content" inherit or %}There is no spoon.{% endplaceholder %}

See also the :setting:`CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF` setting where you can also add extra
context variables and change some other placeholder behaviour.

..  important::

    ``{% placeholder %}`` will only work inside the template's ``<body>``.


..  templatetag:: static_placeholder

static_placeholder
------------------

The ``{% static_placeholder %}`` template tag can be used anywhere in a template element after
the ``{% cms_toolbar %}`` tag. A static placeholder instance is not bound to any particular page
or model - in other words, everywhere it appears, a static placeholder will hold exactly the same
content.

The ``{% static_placeholder %}`` tag is normally used to display the same content on multiple
locations or inside of apphooks or other third party apps.

Otherwise, a static placeholder behaves like a "normal" placeholder, to which plugins can be added.

A static placeholder needs to be published to show up on live pages, and requires a name.

Example::

    {% load cms_tags %}

    {% static_placeholder "footer" %}

.. image:: /reference/images/static-placeholder.png
   :alt: a static placeholder
   :align: center

..  note::

    To reduce clutter in the interface, the plugins in static placeholders are hidden by default.
    Click or tap on the name of the static placeholder to reveal/hide them.

If you want additional content to be displayed in case the static placeholder is
empty, use the ``or`` argument and an additional ``{% endstatic_placeholder %}``
closing tag. Everything between ``{% static_placeholder "..." or %}`` and ``{%
endstatic_placeholder %}`` is rendered in the event that the placeholder has no plugins or
the plugins do not generate any output.

Example::

    {% static_placeholder "footer" or %}There is no content.{% endstatic_placeholder %}

By default, a static placeholder applies to *all* sites in a project.

If you want to make your static placeholder site-specific, so that different sites can have their
own content in it, you can add the flag ``site`` to the template tag to achieve this.

Example::

    {% static_placeholder "footer" site or %}There is no content.{% endstatic_placeholder %}

Note that the `Django "sites" framework <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/sites/>`_ *is* required and
``SITE_ID`` *must* be set in ``settings.py`` for this (not to mention other aspects of django CMS) to work correctly.

..  important::

    ``{% static_placeholder %}`` will only work inside the template's ``<body>``.


..  templatetag:: render_placeholder

render_placeholder
==================

``{% render_placeholder %}`` is used if you have a PlaceholderField in your own model and want
to render it in the template.

The :ttag:`render_placeholder` tag takes the following parameters:

* :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderField` instance
* ``width`` parameter for context sensitive plugins (optional)
* ``language`` keyword plus ``language-code`` string to render content in the
  specified language (optional)
* ``as`` keyword followed by ``varname`` (optional): the template tag output can
  be saved as a context variable for later use.


The following example renders the ``my_placeholder`` field from the ``mymodel_instance`` and will
render only the English (``en``) plugins:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load cms_tags %}

    {% render_placeholder mymodel_instance.my_placeholder language 'en' %}


This template tag supports the ``as`` argument. With this you can assign the result
of the template tag to a new variable that you can use elsewhere in the template.

Example::

    {% render_placeholder mymodel_instance.my_placeholder as placeholder_content %}
    <p>{{ placeholder_content }}</p>

When used in this manner, the placeholder will not be displayed for
editing when the CMS is in edit mode.

..  templatetag:: render_uncached_placeholder

render_uncached_placeholder
===========================

The same as :ttag:`render_placeholder`, but the placeholder contents will not be
cached or taken from the cache.

Arguments:

* :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderField` instance
* ``width`` parameter for context sensitive plugins (optional)
* ``language`` keyword plus ``language-code`` string to render content in the
  specified language (optional)
* ``as`` keyword followed by ``varname`` (optional): the template tag output can
  be saved as a context variable for later use.

Example::

    {% render_uncached_placeholder mymodel_instance.my_placeholder language 'en' %}


..  templatetag:: show_placeholder

show_placeholder
================

Displays a specific placeholder from a given page. This is useful if you want
to have some more or less static content that is shared among many pages, such
as a footer.

Arguments:

* ``placeholder_name``
* ``page_lookup`` (see `page_lookup`_ for more information)
* ``language`` (optional)
* ``site`` (optional)

Examples::

    {% show_placeholder "footer" "footer_container_page" %}
    {% show_placeholder "content" request.current_page.parent_id %}
    {% show_placeholder "teaser" request.current_page.get_root %}


..  templatetag:: show_uncached_placeholder

show_uncached_placeholder
=========================

The same as :ttag:`show_placeholder`, but the placeholder contents will not be
cached or taken from the cache.

Arguments:

- ``placeholder_name``
- ``page_lookup`` (see `page_lookup`_ for more information)
- ``language`` (optional)
- ``site`` (optional)

Example::

    {% show_uncached_placeholder "footer" "footer_container_page" %}


..  templatetag:: page_lookup

page_lookup
===========

The ``page_lookup`` argument, passed to several template tags to retrieve a
page, can be of any of the following types:

* :class:`str`: interpreted as the ``reverse_id`` field of the desired page, which
  can be set in the "Advanced" section when editing a page.
* :class:`int`: interpreted as the primary key (``pk`` field) of the desired page
* :class:`dict`: a dictionary containing keyword arguments to find the desired page
  (for instance: ``{'pk': 1}``)
* :class:`~cms.models.Page`: you can also pass a page object directly, in which case there will
  be no database lookup.

If you know the exact page you are referring to, it is a good idea to use a
``reverse_id`` (a string used to uniquely name a page) rather than a
hard-coded numeric ID in your template. For example, you might have a help
page that you want to link to or display parts of on all pages. To do this,
you would first open the help page in the admin interface and enter an ID
(such as ``help``) under the 'Advanced' tab of the form. Then you could use
that ``reverse_id`` with the appropriate template tags::

    {% show_placeholder "right-column" "help" %}
    <a href="{% page_url "help" %}">Help page</a>

If you are referring to a page `relative` to the current page, you'll probably
have to use a numeric page ID or a page object. For instance, if you want the
content of the parent page to display on the current page, you can use::

    {% show_placeholder "content" request.current_page.parent_id %}

Or, suppose you have a placeholder called ``teaser`` on a page that, unless a
content editor has filled it with content specific to the current page, should
inherit the content of its root-level ancestor::

    {% placeholder "teaser" or %}
        {% show_placeholder "teaser" request.current_page.get_root %}
    {% endplaceholder %}


..  templatetag:: page_url


page_url
========

Displays the URL of a page in the current language.

Arguments:

- ``page_lookup`` (see `page_lookup`_ for more information)
- ``language`` (optional)
- ``site`` (optional)
- ``as var_name`` (optional)


Example::

    <a href="{% page_url "help" %}">Help page</a>
    <a href="{% page_url request.current_page.parent %}">Parent page</a>

If a matching page isn't found and :setting:`django:DEBUG` is ``True``, an
exception will be raised. However, if :setting:`django:DEBUG` is ``False``, an
exception will not be raised.


``page_url`` now supports the ``as`` argument. When used this way, the tag
emits nothing, but sets a variable in the context with the specified name
to the resulting value.

When using the ``as`` argument PageNotFound exceptions are always
suppressed, regardless of the setting of :setting:`django:DEBUG` and the
tag will simply emit an empty string in these cases.

Example::

    {# Emit a 'canonical' tag when the page is displayed on an alternate url #}
    {% page_url request.current_page as current_url %}{% if current_url and current_url != request.get_full_path %}<link rel="canonical" href="{% page_url request.current_page %}">{% endif %}


..  templatetag:: page_attribute

page_attribute
==============

This template tag is used to display an attribute of the current page in the
current language.

Arguments:

- ``attribute_name``
- ``page_lookup`` (optional; see `page_lookup`_ for more
  information)

Possible values for ``attribute_name`` are: ``"title"``, ``"menu_title"``,
``"page_title"``, ``"slug"``, ``"meta_description"``, ``"changed_date"``, ``"changed_by"``
(note that you can also supply that argument without quotes, but this is
deprecated because the argument might also be a template variable).

Example::

    {% page_attribute "page_title" %}

If you supply the optional ``page_lookup`` argument, you will get the page
attribute from the page found by that argument.

Example::

    {% page_attribute "page_title" "my_page_reverse_id" %}
    {% page_attribute "page_title" request.current_page.parent_id %}
    {% page_attribute "slug" request.current_page.get_root %}

This template tag supports the ``as`` argument. With this you can assign the result
of the template tag to a new variable that you can use elsewhere in the template.

Example::

    {% page_attribute "page_title" as title %}
    <title>{{ title }}</title>

It even can be used in combination with the ``page_lookup`` argument.

Example::

    {% page_attribute "page_title" "my_page_reverse_id" as title %}
    <a href="/mypage/">{{ title }}</a>

..  templatetag:: render_plugin

render_plugin
=============

This template tag is used to render child plugins of the current plugin and should be used inside plugin templates.

Arguments:

- ``plugin``

Plugin needs to be an instance of a plugin model.

Example::

    {% load cms_tags %}
    <div class="multicolumn">
    {% for plugin in instance.child_plugin_instances %}
        <div style="width: {{ plugin.width }}00px;">
            {% render_plugin plugin %}
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
    </div>

Normally the children of plugins can be accessed via the ``child_plugins`` attribute of plugins.
Plugins need the ``allow_children`` attribute to set to `True` for this to be enabled.

..  templatetag:: render_plugin_block

render_plugin_block
===================

This template tag acts like the template tag ``render_model_block`` but with a
plugin instead of a model as its target. This is used to link from a block of
markup to a plugin's change form in edit/preview mode.

This is useful for user interfaces that have some plugins hidden from display
in edit/preview mode, but the CMS author needs to expose a way to edit them.
It is also useful for just making duplicate or alternate means of triggering
the change form for a plugin.

This would typically be used inside a parent-plugin‚Äôs render template. In this
example code below, there is a parent container plugin which renders a list of
child plugins inside a navigation block, then the actual plugin contents inside a
``DIV.contentgroup-items`` block. In this example, the navigation block is always shown,
but the items are only shown once the corresponding navigation element is
clicked. Adding this ``render_plugin_block`` makes it significantly more intuitive
to edit a child plugin's content, by double-clicking its navigation item in edit mode.

Arguments:

- ``plugin``

Example::

    {% load cms_tags l10n %}

    {% block section_content %}
    <div class="contentgroup-container">
      <nav class="contentgroup">
        <div class="inner">
          <ul class="contentgroup-items">{% for child in children %}
          {% if child.enabled %}
            <li class="item{{ forloop.counter0|unlocalize }}">
              {% render_plugin_block child %}
              <a href="#item{{ child.id|unlocalize }}">{{ child.title|safe }}</a>
              {% endrender_plugin_block %}
            </li>{% endif %}
          {% endfor %}
          </ul>
        </div>
      </nav>

      <div class="contentgroup-items">{% for child in children %}
        <div class="contentgroup-item item{{ child.id|unlocalize }}{% if not forloop.counter0 %} active{% endif %}">
          {% render_plugin child  %}
        </div>{% endfor %}
      </div>
    </div>
    {% endblock %}

..  templatetag:: render_model

render_model
============

``render_model`` is the way to add frontend editing to any Django model.
It both renders the content of the given attribute of the model instance and
makes it clickable to edit the related model.

If the toolbar is not enabled, the value of the attribute is rendered in the
template without further action.

If the toolbar is enabled, click to call frontend editing code is added.

By using this template tag you can show and edit page titles as well as fields in
standard django models, see :ref:`frontend-editable-fields` for examples and
further documentation.

Example:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <h1>{% render_model my_model "title" "title,abstract" %}</h1>

This will render to:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <!-- The content of the H1 is the active area that triggers the frontend editor -->
    <h1><cms-plugin class="cms-plugin cms-plugin-myapp-mymodel-title-1">{{ my_model.title }}</cms-plugin></h1>

**Arguments:**

* ``instance``: instance of your model in the template
* ``attribute``: the name of the attribute you want to show in the template; it
  can be a context variable name; it's possible to target field, property or
  callable for the specified model; when used on a page object this argument
  accepts the special ``titles`` value which will show the page **title**
  field, while allowing editing **title**, **menu title** and **page title**
  fields in the same form;
* ``edit_fields`` (optional): a comma separated list of fields editable in the
  popup editor; when template tag is used on a page object this argument
  accepts the special ``changelist`` value which allows editing the pages
  **changelist** (items list);
* ``language`` (optional): the admin language tab to be linked. Useful only for
  `django-hvad`_ enabled models.
* ``filters`` (optional): a string containing chained filters to apply to the
  output content; works the same way as :ttag:`django:filter` template tag;
* ``view_url`` (optional): the name of a URL that will be reversed using the
  instance ``pk`` and the ``language`` as arguments;
* ``view_method`` (optional): a method name that will return a URL to a view;
  the method must accept ``request`` as first parameter.
* ``varname`` (optional): the template tag output can be saved as a context
  variable for later use.

.. note::

    By default this template tag escapes the content of the rendered
    model attribute. This helps prevent a range of security vulnerabilities
    stemming from HTML, JavaScript, and CSS Code Injection.

    To change this behaviour, the project administrator should carefully review
    each use of this template tag and ensure that all content which is rendered
    to a page using this template tag is cleansed of any potentially harmful
    HTML markup, CSS styles or JavaScript.

    Once the administrator is satisfied that the content is
    clean, he or she can add the "safe" filter parameter to the template tag
    if the content should be rendered without escaping.

.. warning::

    ``render_model`` is only partially compatible with django-hvad: using
    it with hvad-translated fields
    (say {% render_model object 'translated_field' %} return error if the
    hvad-enabled object does not exists in the current language.
    As a workaround ``render_model_icon`` can be used instead.


..  templatetag:: render_model_block

render_model_block
==================

``render_model_block`` is the block-level equivalent of ``render_model``:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% render_model_block my_model %}
        <h1>{{ instance.title }}</h1>
        <div class="body">
            {{ instance.date|date:"d F Y" }}
            {{ instance.text }}
        </div>
    {% endrender_model_block %}

This will render to:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <!-- This whole block is the active area that triggers the frontend editor -->
    <template class="cms-plugin cms-plugin-start cms-plugin-myapp-mymodel-1"></template>
        <h1>{{ my_model.title }}</h1>
        <div class="body">
            {{ my_model.date|date:"d F Y" }}
            {{ my_model.text }}
        </div>
    <template class="cms-plugin cms-plugin-end cms-plugin-myapp-mymodel-1"></template>

In the block the ``my_model`` is aliased as ``instance`` and every attribute and
method is available; also template tags and filters are available in the block.

.. warning::

    If the ``{% render_model_block %}`` contains template tags or template code that rely on or
    manipulate context data that the ``{% render_model_block %}`` also makes use of, you may
    experience some unexpected effects. Unless you are sure that such conflicts will not occur
    it is advised to keep the code within a ``{% render_model_block %}`` as simple and short as
    possible.

**Arguments:**

* ``instance``: instance of your model in the template
* ``edit_fields`` (optional): a comma separated list of fields editable in the
  popup editor; when template tag is used on a page object this argument
  accepts the special ``changelist`` value which allows editing the pages
  **changelist** (items list);
* ``language`` (optional): the admin language tab to be linked. Useful only for
  `django-hvad`_ enabled models.
* ``view_url`` (optional): the name of a URL that will be reversed using the
  instance ``pk`` and the ``language`` as arguments;
* ``view_method`` (optional): a method name that will return a URL to a view;
  the method must accept ``request`` as first parameter.
* ``varname`` (optional): the template tag output can be saved as a context
  variable for later use.

.. note::

    By default this template tag escapes the content of the rendered
    model attribute. This helps prevent a range of security vulnerabilities
    stemming from HTML, JavaScript, and CSS Code Injection.

    To change this behaviour, the project administrator should carefully review
    each use of this template tag and ensure that all content which is rendered
    to a page using this template tag is cleansed of any potentially harmful
    HTML markup, CSS styles or JavaScript.

    Once the administrator is satisfied that the content is
    clean, he or she can add the "safe" filter parameter to the template tag
    if the content should be rendered without escaping.


..  templatetag:: render_model_icon

render_model_icon
=================

``render_model_icon`` is intended for use where the relevant object attribute
is not available for user interaction (for example, already has a link on it,
think of a title in a list of items and the titles are linked to the object
detail view); when in edit mode, it renders an **edit** icon, which will trigger
the editing change form for the provided fields.


.. code-block:: html+django

    <h3><a href="{{ my_model.get_absolute_url }}">{{ my_model.title }}</a> {% render_model_icon my_model %}</h3>

It will render to something like:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <h3>
        <a href="{{ my_model.get_absolute_url }}">{{ my_model.title }}</a>
        <template class="cms-plugin cms-plugin-start cms-plugin-myapp-mymodel-1 cms-render-model-icon"></template>
            <!-- The image below is the active area that triggers the frontend editor -->
            <img src="/static/cms/img/toolbar/render_model_placeholder.png">
        <template class="cms-plugin cms-plugin-end cms-plugin-myapp-mymodel-1 cms-render-model-icon"></template>
    </h3>

.. note::

        Icon and position can be customised via CSS by setting a background
        to the ``.cms-render-model-icon img`` selector.

**Arguments:**

* ``instance``: instance of your model in the template
* ``edit_fields`` (optional): a comma separated list of fields editable in the
  popup editor; when template tag is used on a page object this argument
  accepts the special ``changelist`` value which allows editing the pages
  **changelist** (items list);
* ``language`` (optional): the admin language tab to be linked. Useful only for
  `django-hvad`_ enabled models.
* ``view_url`` (optional): the name of a URL that will be reversed using the
  instance ``pk`` and the ``language`` as arguments;
* ``view_method`` (optional): a method name that will return a URL to a view;
  the method must accept ``request`` as first parameter.
* ``varname`` (optional): the template tag output can be saved as a context
  variable for later use.

.. note::

    By default this template tag escapes the content of the rendered
    model attribute. This helps prevent a range of security vulnerabilities
    stemming from HTML, JavaScript, and CSS Code Injection.

    To change this behaviour, the project administrator should carefully review
    each use of this template tag and ensure that all content which is rendered
    to a page using this template tag is cleansed of any potentially harmful
    HTML markup, CSS styles or JavaScript.

    Once the administrator is satisfied that the content is
    clean, he or she can add the "safe" filter parameter to the template tag
    if the content should be rendered without escaping.


..  templatetag:: render_model_add

render_model_add
================

``render_model_add`` is similar to ``render_model_icon`` but it will enable to
create instances of the given instance class; when in edit mode, it renders an
**add** icon, which will trigger the editing add form for the provided model.


.. code-block:: html+django

    <h3><a href="{{ my_model.get_absolute_url }}">{{ my_model.title }}</a> {% render_model_add my_model %}</h3>

It will render to something like:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <h3>
        <a href="{{ my_model.get_absolute_url }}">{{ my_model.title }}</a>
        <template class="cms-plugin cms-plugin-start cms-plugin-myapp-mymodel-1 cms-render-model-add"></template>
            <!-- The image below is the active area that triggers the frontend editor -->
            <img src="/static/cms/img/toolbar/render_model_placeholder.png">
        <template class="cms-plugin cms-plugin-end cms-plugin-myapp-mymodel-1 cms-render-model-add"></template>
    </h3>

.. note::

        Icon and position can be customised via CSS by setting a background
        to the ``.cms-render-model-add img`` selector.

**Arguments:**

* ``instance``: instance of your model, or model class to be added
* ``edit_fields`` (optional): a comma separated list of fields editable in the
  popup editor;
* ``language`` (optional): the admin language tab to be linked. Useful only for
  `django-hvad`_ enabled models.
* ``view_url`` (optional): the name of a url that will be reversed using the
  instance ``pk`` and the ``language`` as arguments;
* ``view_method`` (optional): a method name that will return a URL to a view;
  the method must accept ``request`` as first parameter.
* ``varname`` (optional): the template tag output can be saved as a context
  variable for later use.

.. note::

    By default this template tag escapes the content of the rendered
    model attribute. This helps prevent a range of security vulnerabilities
    stemming from HTML, JavaScript, and CSS Code Injection.

    To change this behaviour, the project administrator should carefully review
    each use of this template tag and ensure that all content which is rendered
    to a page using this template tag is cleansed of any potentially harmful
    HTML markup, CSS styles or JavaScript.

    Once the administrator is satisfied that the content is
    clean, he or she can add the "safe" filter parameter to the template tag
    if the content should be rendered without escaping.

.. warning::

    If passing a class, instead of an instance, and using ``view_method``,
    please bear in mind that the method will be called over an **empty instance**
    of the class, so attributes are all empty, and the instance does not
    exists on the database.


.. _django-hvad: https://github.com/kristianoellegaard/django-hvad

..  templatetag:: render_model_add_block

render_model_add_block
======================

``render_model_add_block`` is similar to ``render_model_add`` but instead of
emitting an icon that is linked to the add model form in a modal dialog, it
wraps arbitrary markup with the same "link". This allows the developer to create
front-end editing experiences better suited to the project.

All arguments are identical to ``render_model_add``, but the template tag is used
in two parts to wrap the markup that should be wrapped.

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% render_model_add_block my_model_instance %}<div>New Object</div>{% endrender_model_add_block %}


It will render to something like:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <template class="cms-plugin cms-plugin-start cms-plugin-myapp-mymodel-1 cms-render-model-add"></template>
        <div>New Object</div>
    <template class="cms-plugin cms-plugin-end cms-plugin-myapp-mymodel-1 cms-render-model-add"></template>


.. warning::

    You **must** pass an *instance* of your model as instance parameter. The
    instance passed could be an existing models instance, or one newly created
    in your view/plugin. It does not even have to be saved, it is introspected
    by the template tag to determine the desired model class.


**Arguments:**

* ``instance``: instance of your model in the template
* ``edit_fields`` (optional): a comma separated list of fields editable in the
  popup editor;
* ``language`` (optional): the admin language tab to be linked. Useful only for
  `django-hvad`_ enabled models.
* ``view_url`` (optional): the name of a URL that will be reversed using the
  instance ``pk`` and the ``language`` as arguments;
* ``view_method`` (optional): a method name that will return a URL to a view;
  the method must accept ``request`` as first parameter.
* ``varname`` (optional): the template tag output can be saved as a context
  variable for later use.

.. _django-hvad: https://github.com/kristianoellegaard/django-hvad


..  templatetag:: page_language_url


page_language_url
=================

Returns the URL of the current page in an other language::

    {% page_language_url "de" %}
    {% page_language_url "fr" %}
    {% page_language_url "en" %}

If the current URL has no CMS Page and is handled by a navigation extender and
the URL changes based on the language, you will need to set a ``language_changer``
function with the ``set_language_changer`` function in ``menus.utils``.

For more information, see :doc:`/topics/i18n`.


..  templatetag:: language_chooser

language_chooser
================

The ``language_chooser`` template tag will display a language chooser for the
current page. You can modify the template in ``menu/language_chooser.html`` or
provide your own template if necessary.

Example::

    {% language_chooser %}

or with custom template::

    {% language_chooser "myapp/language_chooser.html" %}

The language_chooser has three different modes in which it will display the
languages you can choose from: "raw" (default), "native", "current" and "short".
It can be passed as the last argument to the ``language_chooser tag`` as a string.
In "raw" mode, the language will be displayed like its verbose name in the
settings. In "native" mode the languages are displayed in their actual language
(eg. German will be displayed "Deutsch", Japanese as "Êó•Êú¨Ë™û" etc). In "current"
mode the languages are translated into the current language the user is seeing
the site in (eg. if the site is displayed in German, Japanese will be displayed
as "Japanisch"). "Short" mode takes the language code (eg. "en") to display.

If the current URL has no CMS Page and is handled by a navigation extender and
the URL changes based on the language, you will need to set a ``language_changer``
function with the ``set_language_changer`` function in ``menus.utils``.

For more information, see :doc:`/topics/i18n`.


..  templatetag:: cms_toolbar

*********************
Toolbar template tags
*********************

.. highlight:: html+django

The ``cms_toolbar`` template tag is included in the ``cms_tags`` library and will add the required
CSS and javascript to the sekizai blocks in the base template. The template tag must be placed
before any ``{% placeholder %}`` occurrences within your HTML.

..  important::

    ``{% cms_toolbar %}`` will only work correctly inside the template's ``<body>``.


Example::

    <body>
    {% cms_toolbar %}
    {% placeholder "home" %}
    ...


..  note::

    Be aware that you cannot surround the ``cms_toolbar`` tag with block tags.
    The toolbar tag will render everything below it to collect all plugins and placeholders, before
    it renders itself. Block tags interfere with this.


===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/reference/titles.rst

Titles
######

..  class:: cms.models.Title

    Titles support pages by providing a storage mechanism, amongst other things, for language-specific
    properties of :class:`cms.models.Page`, such as its title, slug, meta description and so on.

    Each ``Title`` has a foreign key to :class:`cms.models.Page`; each :class:`cms.models.Page` may have several
    ``Titles``.

.. _toolbar-api-reference:

###########
The Toolbar
###########

The toolbar can contain various items, some of which in turn can contain other items. These items
are represented by the classes listed in :mod:`cms.toolbar.items`, and created using the various
APIs described below.

..  admonition:: Do not instantiate these classes manually

    **These classes are described here for reference purposes only.** It is strongly recommended
    that you do not create instances yourself, but use the methods listed here.


*******************
Classes and methods
*******************

:ref:`Common parameters <toolbar_parameters>` (``key``, ``verbose_name``, ``position``,
``on_close``, ``disabled``, ``active``) and options are described at the end of this document.

..  module:: cms.toolbar.toolbar

..  class:: CMSToolbar

    The toolbar is an instance of the ``cms.toolbar.toolbar.CMSToolbar`` class. This should not be
    confused with the :class:`~cms.toolbar_base.CMSToolbar`, the base class for *toolbar modifier
    classes* in other applications, that add items to and otherwise manipulates the toolbar.

    It is strongly recommended that you **only** interact with the toolbar in your own code via:

    * the APIs documented here
    * toolbar modifier classes based on ``cms.toolbar_base.CMSToolbar``

    You will notice that some of the methods documented here do not include some arguments present
    in the code. This is the *public* reference documentation, while the code may be subject to
    change without warning.

    ..  method:: add_ajax_item(name, action, active=False, disabled=False, \
                     data=None, question=None, position=None)

        Adds :class:`AjaxItem` that sends a POST request to ``action`` with ``data``, and returns
        it. ``data`` should be ``None`` or a dictionary. The CSRF token will automatically be added
        to the item.

        If a string is provided for ``question``, it will be presented to the user to allow
        confirmation before the request is sent.

    ..  method:: add_item(item, position=None)

        Adds an item (which must be a sub-class of :class:`~cms.toolbar.items.BaseItem`), and
        returns it. This is a low-level API, and you should always use one of the built-in
        object-specific methods to add items in preference if possible, using this method **only**
        for custom item classes.

    ..  method:: find_items(item_type)

        Returns a list of :class:`ItemSearchResult` objects matching all items of ``item_type``
        (e.g. ``LinkItem``).

    ..  method:: find_first(item_type, **attributes)

        Returns the first :class:`ItemSearchResult` that matches the search, or ``None``. The
        search strategy is the same as in :meth:`find_items`. The return value of this method is
        safe to use as the :option:`position` argument of the various APIs to add items.


..  class:: ItemSearchResult

    Returned by the find APIs in :class:`ToolbarAPIMixin`.

    An ``ItemSearchResult`` will have two useful attributes:

    .. attribute:: item

        The item found.

    .. attribute:: index

        The index of the item (its position amongst the other items).

    The ``ItemSearchResult`` itself can be cast to an integer, and supports addition and
    subtraction of numbers. See the :option:`position` parameter for more details, and
    :ref:`toolbar_control_item_position` for examples.


..  module:: cms.toolbar_base.CMSToolbar

..  class:: CMSToolbar

    The base class for toolbar modifiers.

    See :ref:`toolbar_how_to` for more information.


.. _toolbar_parameters:

**********
Parameters
**********

The methods described below for creating/modifying toolbar items share a number of common
parameters:

..  option:: key

    a unique identifier (typically a string)

..  option:: verbose_name

    the displayed text in the item

..  option:: position

    The position index of the new item in the list of items. May be:

    * ``None`` - appends the item to the list
    * an integer - inserts the item at that index in the list
    * an object already in the list - Inserts the item into the list immediately before the object;
      must be a sub-class of :class:`~cms.toolbar.items.BaseItem`, and must exist in the list
    * an :class:`~cms.toolbar.items.ItemSearchResult` - inserts the item into the list immediately
      before the ``ItemSearchResult``. ``ItemSearchResult`` may be treated as an integer.

..  option:: on_close:

    Determines what happens after closing a frame (sideframe or modal) that has been opened by a
    menu item. May be:

    * ``None`` - does nothing when the sideframe closes
    * :const:`~cms.constants.REFRESH_PAGE` - refreshes the page when the frame closes
    * a URL - opens the URLS when the frame is closed.

..  option:: disabled

    Greys out the item and renders it inoperable.

..  option::  active

    Applies to buttons only; renders the button it its 'activated' state.


*************************************
django CMS constants used in toolbars
*************************************

..  module:: cms.constants
    :noindex:

..  data:: REFRESH_PAGE

    Supplied to ``on_close`` arguments to refresh the current page when the frame is closed, for
    example:

    ..  code-block:: python

        from cms.constants import REFRESH_PAGE

        self.toolbar.add_modal_item(
            'Modal item',
            url=modal_url,
            on_close=REFRESH_PAGE
            )


..  module:: cms.cms_toolbars

..  data:: ADMIN_MENU_IDENTIFIER

    The *Site* menu (that usually shows the project's domain name, *example.com* by default).
    ``ADMIN_MENU_IDENTIFIER`` allows you to get hold of this object easily. See
    :ref:`finding_toolbar_items` for an example of usage.

########################
Content creation wizards
########################

See the :ref:`How-to section on wizards <wizard_how_to>` for an introduction to
creating wizards.

Wizard classes are sub-classes of ``cms.wizards.wizard_base.Wizard``.

They need to be registered with the ``cms.wizards.wizard_pool.wizard_pool``::

    wizard_pool.register(my_app_wizard)

Finally, a wizard needs to be instantiated, for example::

    my_app_wizard = MyAppWizard(
        title="New MyApp",
        weight=200,
        form=MyAppWizardForm,
        description="Create a new MyApp instance",
    )

When instantiating a Wizard object, use the keywords:

    :title: The title of the wizard. This will appear in a large font size on
            the wizard "menu"
    :weight: The "weight" of the wizard when determining the sort-order.
    :form: The form to use for this wizard. This is mandatory, but can be
           sub-classed from `django.forms.form` or `django.forms.ModelForm`.
    :model: If a Form is used above, this keyword argument must be supplied and
            should contain the model class. This is used to determine the unique
            wizard "signature" amongst other things.
    :template_name: An optional template can be supplied.
    :description: The description is optional, but if it is not supplied, the
                  CMS will create one from the pattern:
                  "Create a new ¬´model.verbose_name¬ª instance."
    :edit_mode_on_success: If set, the CMS will switch the user to edit-mode by
                           adding an ``edit`` param to the query-string of the
                           URL returned by ``get_success_url``. This is ``True``
                           by default.


***********
Base Wizard
***********

All wizard classes should inherit from ``cms.wizards.wizard_base.Wizard``. This
class implements a number of methods that may be overridden as required.

*******************
Base Wizard methods
*******************

get_description
===============

Simply returns the ``description`` property assigned during instantiation or one
derived from the model if description is not provided during instantiation.
Override this method if this needs to be determined programmatically.


get_title
=========

Simply returns the ``title`` property assigned during instantiation. Override
this method if this needs to be determined programmatically.

.. _get_success_url:

get_success_url
===============

Once the wizard has completed, the user will be redirected to the URL of the new
object that was created. By default, this is done by return the result of
calling the ``get_absolute_url`` method on the object. This may then be modified
to force the user into edit mode if the wizard property ``edit_mode_on_success``
is True.

In some cases, the created content will not implement ``get_absolute_url`` or
that redirecting the user is undesirable. In these cases, simply override this
method. If ``get_success_url`` returns ``None``, the CMS will just redirect to
the current page after the object is created.

This method is called by the CMS with the parameter:

    :obj: The created object
    :kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments


get_weight
==========

Simply returns the ``weight`` property assigned during instantiation. Override
this method if this needs to be determined programmatically.


user_has_add_permission
=======================

This should return a boolean reflecting whether the user has permission to
create the underlying content for the wizard.

This method is called by the CMS with these parameters:

    :user: The current user
    :page: The current CMS page the user is viewing when invoking the wizard



***************
``wizard_pool``
***************

``wizard_pool`` includes a read-only property ``discovered`` which returns the
Boolean ``True`` if wizard-discovery has already occurred and ``False``
otherwise.

*******************
Wizard pool methods
*******************

is_registered
=============

Sometimes, it may be necessary to check to see if a specific wizard has been
registered. To do this, simply call::

    value = wizard_pool.is_registered(¬´wizard¬ª)


register
========

You may notice from the example above that the last line in the sample code is::

    wizard_pool.register(my_app_wizard)

This sort of thing should look very familiar, as a similar approach is used for
cms_apps, template tags and even Django's admin.

Calling the wizard pool's ``register`` method will register the provided wizard
into the pool, unless there is already a wizard of the same module and class
name. In this case, the register method will raise a
``cms.wizards.wizard_pool.AlreadyRegisteredException``.


unregister
==========

It may be useful to unregister wizards that have already been registered with
the pool. To do this, simply call::

    value = wizard_pool.unregister(¬´wizard¬ª)

The value returned will be a Boolean: ``True`` if a wizard was successfully
unregistered or ``False`` otherwise.


get_entry
=========

If you would like to get a reference to a specific wizard in the pool, just call
``get_entry()`` as follows::

    wizard = wizard_pool.get_entry(my_app_wizard)


get_entries
===========

``get_entries()`` is useful if it is required to have a list of all registered
wizards. Typically, this is used to iterate over them all. Note that they will
be returned in the order of their ``weight``: smallest numbers for weight are
returned first.::

    for wizard in wizard_pool.get_entries():
        # do something with a wizard...

Plugins
#####################


..  seealso::

    * :ref:`Plugins how-to guide <custom-plugins>`

CMS Plugins are reusable content publishers that can be inserted into django
CMS pages (or indeed into any content that uses django CMS placeholders). They
enable the publishing of information automatically, without further
intervention.

This means that your published web content, whatever it is, is kept
up-to-date at all times.

It's like magic, but quicker.

Unless you're lucky enough to discover that your needs can be met by the
built-in plugins, or by the many available third-party plugins, you'll have to
write your own custom CMS Plugin.


***************************************
*Why* would you need to write a plugin?
***************************************

A plugin is the most convenient way to integrate content from another Django
application into a django CMS page.

For example, suppose you're developing a site for a record company in django
CMS. You might like to have a "Latest releases" box on your site's home page.

Of course, you could every so often edit that page and update the information.
However, a sensible record company will manage its catalogue in Django too,
which means Django already knows what this week's new releases are.

This is an excellent opportunity to make use of that information to make your
life easier - all you need to do is create a django CMS plugin that you can
insert into your home page, and leave it to do the work of publishing information
about the latest releases for you.

Plugins are **reusable**. Perhaps your record company is producing a series of
reissues of seminal Swiss punk records; on your site's page about the series,
you could insert the same plugin, configured a little differently, that will
publish information about recent new releases in that series.


************************
Components of a plugin
************************

A django CMS plugin is fundamentally composed of three components, that correspond to Django's
familiar Model-View-Template scheme:

===================  ================================  ========================================================
What                 Function                          Subclass of
===================  ================================  ========================================================
model (if required)  plugin instance configuration     :class:`CMSPlugin <cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin>`
view                 display logic                     :class:`CMSPluginBase <cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase>`
template             rendering                         --
===================  ================================  ========================================================


:class:`CMSPlugin <cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin>`
======================================================

The plugin **model**, the sub-class of :class:`cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin`,
is optional.

You could have a plugin that doesn't need to be configured, because it only
ever does one thing.

For example, you could have a plugin that only publishes information
about the top-selling record of the past seven days. Obviously, this wouldn't
be very flexible - you wouldn't be able to use the same plugin for the
best-selling release of the last *month* instead.

Usually, you find that it is useful to be able to configure your plugin, and this
will require a model.


:class:`CMSPluginBase <cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase>`
==================================================================

:class:`cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase` is actually a sub-class of
:class:`django:django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin`.

Because :class:`~cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase` sub-classes ``ModelAdmin`` several important
``ModelAdmin`` options are also available to CMS plugin developers. These
options are often used:

* ``exclude``
* ``fields``
* ``fieldsets``
* ``form``
* ``formfield_overrides``
* ``inlines``
* ``radio_fields``
* ``raw_id_fields``
* ``readonly_fields``

Please note, however, that not all ``ModelAdmin`` options are effective in a CMS
plugin. In particular, any options that are used exclusively by the
``ModelAdmin``'s ``changelist`` will have no effect. These and other notable options
that are ignored by the CMS are:

* ``actions``
* ``actions_on_top``
* ``actions_on_bottom``
* ``actions_selection_counter``
* ``date_hierarchy``
* ``list_display``
* ``list_display_links``
* ``list_editable``
* ``list_filter``
* ``list_max_show_all``
* ``list_per_page``
* ``ordering``
* ``paginator``
* ``prepopulated_fields``
* ``preserve_fields``
* ``save_as``
* ``save_on_top``
* ``search_fields``
* ``show_full_result_count``
* ``view_on_site``



===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/topics/apphooks.rst
===================================================

.. _about_apphooks:

##############################
Application hooks ("apphooks")
##############################

An Application Hook, usually simply referred to as an apphook, is a way of attaching
the functionality of some other application to a django CMS page. It's a convenient way
of integrating other applications into a django CMS site.

For example, suppose you have an application that maintains and publishes information
about Olympic records. You could add this application to your site's ``urls.py`` (before
the django CMS URLs pattern), so that users will find it at ``/records``.

However, although it would thus be integrated into your *project*, it would not be
fully integrated into django CMS, for example:

* django CMS would not be aware of it, and - for example - would allow your users to create a CMS page with the same
  ``/records`` slug, that could never be reached.
* The application's pages won't automatically appear in your site's menus.
* The application's pages won't be able to take advantage of the CMS's publishing
  workflow, permissions or other functionality.

Apphooks offer a more complete way of integrating other applications, by attaching them
to a CMS page. In this case, the attached application takes over the page and its URL
(and all the URLs below it, such as ``/records/1984``).

The application can be served at a URL defined by the content managers, and easily moved
around in the site structure.

The *Advanced settings* of a CMS page provides an *Application* field. :ref:`Adding an apphook class <apphooks_how_to>` to the
application will allow it to be selected in this field.


*********************************
Multiple apphooks per application
*********************************

It's possible for an application to be added multiple times, to different pages. See :ref:`multi_apphook` for more.

Also possible to provide **multiple apphook configurations**:


**********************
Apphook configurations
**********************

You may require the same application to behave differently in different locations on your site. For example, the Olympic
Records application may be required to publish athletics results at one location, but cycling results at another, and so on.

An :ref:`apphook configuration <apphook_configurations>` class allows the site editors to create multiple configuration
instances that specify the behaviour. The kind of configuration available is presented in an admin form, and determined by the
application developer.

..  important::

    It's important to understand that an apphook (and therefore also an apphook configuration)
    serves no function until it is attached to a page - and until the page is **published**, the
    application will be unable to fulfil any publishing function.

    Also note that the apphook "swallows" all URLs below that of the page, handing them over to the
    attached application. If you have any child pages of the apphooked page, django CMS will not be
    able to serve them reliably.





===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/topics/publishing.rst
===================================================

##########
Publishing
##########

Each published page in the CMS exists in as two ``cms.Page`` instances:
**public** and **draft**.

Until it's published, only the **draft** version exists.

The staff users generally use the draft version to edit content and change
settings for the pages. None of these changes are visible on the public site
until the page is published.

When a page is published, the page must also have all parent pages published in
order to become available on the web site. If a parent page is not yet
published, the page goes into a "pending" state. It will be automatically
published once the parent page is published.

This enables you to edit an entire subsection of the website, publishing it
only once all the work is complete.

**************
Code and Pages
**************

When handling ``cms.Page`` in code, you'll generally want to deal with draft
instances.

Draft pages are the ones you interact with in the admin, and in draft mode in
the CMS frontend. When a draft page is published, a public version is created
and all titles, placeholders and plugins are copied to the public version.

The ``cms.Page`` model has a ``publisher_is_draft`` field, that's ``True`` for
draft versions. Use a filter::

    ``publisher_is_draft=True``

to get hold of these draft ``Page`` instances.


===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/topics/multiple_languages.rst
===================================================

#####################################
Serving content in multiple languages
#####################################

**************
Basic concepts
**************

django CMS has a sophisticated multilingual capability. It is able to serve
content in multiple languages, with fallbacks into other languages where
translations have not been provided. It also has the facility for the user to set the
preferred language and so on.

How django CMS determines the user's preferred language
=======================================================

django CMS determines the user's language the same way Django does it.

* the language code prefix in the URL
* the language set in the session
* the language in the language cookie
* the language that the browser says its user prefers

It uses the django built in capabilities for this.

By default no session and cookie are set. If you want to enable this use the
`cms.middleware.language.LanguageCookieMiddleware` to set the cookie on every request.


How django CMS determines what language to serve
================================================

Once it has identified a user's language, it will try to accommodate it using the languages set in :setting:`CMS_LANGUAGES`.

If :setting:`fallbacks` is set, and if the user's preferred
language is not available for that content, it will use the fallbacks
specified for the language in :setting:`CMS_LANGUAGES`.

What django CMS shows in your menus
===================================

If :setting:`hide_untranslated` is ``True`` (the default) then pages that
aren't translated into the desired language will not appear in the menu.


===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/topics/i18n.rst
===================================================

####################
Internationalisation
####################

django CMS excels in its multilingual support, and can be configured to handle a vast range of different requirements. Its
behaviour is flexible and can be controlled at a granular level in :setting:`CMS_LANGUAGES`. Other :ref:`i18n_l10n_reference` settings offer further control.  

See :ref:`multilingual_support_how_to` on how to set up a multilingual django CMS project.

****
URLs
****

Multilingual URLs require the use of :func:`~django.conf.urls.i18n.i18n_patterns`. For more information about this see
the official `Django documentation
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#internationalization-in-url-patterns>`_
on the subject. :ref:`multilingual_urls` describes what you need to do in a django CMS project.


.. _documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#internationalization-in-url-patterns


.. _determining_language_preference:

*************************************************
How django CMS determines which language to serve
*************************************************

django CMS uses a number of standard Django mechanisms to choose the language for the user, in the following order of
preference:

* language code in the URL - for example, ``http://example.com/de`` (when multilingual URLs are enabled)
* language stored in the browsing session
* language stored in a cookie from a previous session
* language requested by the browser in the ``Accept-Language`` header
* the default ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` in the site's settings

More in-depth documentation about this is available at
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#how-django-discovers-language-preference


===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/topics/permissions.rst
===================================================

###########
Permissions
###########

The django CMS permissions system is flexible, granular and multi-layered.


****************
Permission modes
****************

Permissions operate in two different modes, depending on the :setting:`CMS_PERMISSION` setting.

* Simple permissions mode (``CMS_PERMISSION = False``): only the standard Django Users and Groups
  permissions will apply. This is the default.
* Page permissions mode (``CMS_PERMISSION = True``): as well as standard Django permissions, django
  CMS provides row-level permissions on pages, allowing you to control the access of users to
  different sections of a site, and sites within a multi-site project.

.. _key-user-permissions:

********************
Key user permissions
********************

You can find the permissions you can set for a user or groups in the Django admin, in the
*Authentication and Authorization* section. These apply equally in Simple permissions mode and
Page permissions mode.

Filtering by ``cms`` will show the ones that belong to the CMS application. Permissions that a CMS
editor will need are likely to include:

* ``cms | cms plugin``
* ``cms | page``
* ``cms | placeholder``
* ``cms | placeholder reference``
* ``cms | static placeholder``
* ``cms | placeholder reference``
* ``cms | title``

Most of these offer the usual add/change/delete options, though there are some exceptions, such as
``cms | placeholder | Can use Structure mode``.

See :ref:`use-permissions-on-groups` below on applying permissions to groups rather than users.


************************************
Permissions in Page permissions mode
************************************

In Page permissions mode, you also need to give users permission to the right pages and sub-sites.


.. _global-and-per-page-permissions:

Global and per-page permissions
===============================

This can be done in two ways, *globally* or *per-page*.

.. _pages-global-permissions:

**Global page permissions** apply to all pages (or all pages on a sub-site in a multi-site
project). Global page permissions are managed in the admin at *django CMS* > *Pages global
permissions*.

**Per-page permissions** apply to a specific page and/or its children and/or its descendants.
Per-page permissions are managed via the toolbar (*Page* > *Permissions*) when on the page in
question, in edit mode.

Your users (unless they are Django superusers) will need at least one of global page permissions or
per-page permissions granted to them in order to be able to edit any pages at all.

They will **also** need appropriate :ref:`user permissions <key-user-permissions>`, otherwise they
will have no edit rights to pages.

.. _page-permission-options:

Page permission options
=======================

Both global page permissions and per-page permissions can be assigned to users or groups of users.
They include:

* *Can add*
* *Can edit*
* *Can delete*
* *Can publish*
* *Can change advanced settings*
* *Can change permissions*
* *Can move*

.. _important:

    Even though a user may have *Can edit* permissions on a page, that doesn't give them
    permissions to add or change plugins *within* that page. In order to be able to
    add/change/delete plugins on any page, you will need to go through :ref:`the standard Django
    permissions <key-user-permissions>` to provide users with the actions they can perform, for
    example:

    * ``cms | page | Can publish page`` to publish it
    * ``cms | cms plugins | Can edit cms plugin`` to edit plugins on the page


.. _pages-specific-permissions:

Per-page permissions
====================

Per-page permissions are controlled by selecting *Permissions* from the *Page* menu in the toolbar
when on the page (this options is only available when ``CMS_PERMISSION`` mode is on).

*Login required* determines whether anonymous visitors will be able to see the page at all.

*Menu visibility* determines who'll be able to see the page in navigation menus - everyone, or logged in or anonymous users
only.

.. _view-restrictions:

*View restrictions* determine which groups and users will be able to see the page when it is
published. Adding a view restriction will allow you to set this. Note that this doesn't apply any
restrictions to users who are also editors with appropriate permissions.

*Page permissions* determine what editors can do to a page (or hierarchy of pages). They are
described above in :ref:`page-permission-options`.


New admin models
----------------

When ``CMS_PERMISSION`` is enabled, as well as :ref:`Pages global permissions
<pages-global-permissions>` you will find two new models available in the CMS admin:

* *User groups (page)*
* *Users (page)*

You will find that the latter two simply reflect the Django Groups and User permissions that
already exist in the system, and can be ignored.


.. _permission-strategies:

*********************
Permission strategies
*********************

For a simple site with only a few users you may not need to be concerned about this, but with
thousands of pages belonging to different departments and users with greatly differing levels of
authority and expertise, it is important to understand who is able to do what on your site.


.. _use-permissions-on-groups:

Use permissions on Groups, not on Users
=======================================

Avoid applying permissions to individual users unless strictly necessary. It's far better to apply
them to Groups, and add Users to Groups. Otherwise, you risk ending up with large numbers of Users
with unknown or inappropriate permissions.


Use Groups to build up permissions
==================================

Different users may require different subsets of permissions. For example, you could define a
*Basic content editor* group, who can edit and publish pages and content, but who don't have
permission to create new ones; that permission would be granted to a *Lead content editor* Group.
Another Group could have permissions to use the weblog.

Then, when managing a user, place the user into the appropriate groups.


Two dimensions of permissions
-----------------------------

You can divide your users' permissions across two dimensions:

* what sort of things this user or group of user should be allowed to do (e.g. publish pages, add
  new plugins, create new users, etc)
* which sections of the site the user should be allowed to do them on (the home page, a limited set
  of departmental pages, etc)

Groups are very useful for managing this. For example, you can create a *Europe* group for editors
who are allowed to edit the Europe page hierarchy or sub-site. The group can then be added to a
:ref:`global or per-page permission <global-and-per-page-permissions>`.

##########################################
Using touch-screen devices with django CMS
##########################################

.. important::

    These notes about touch interface support apply only to the **django CMS admin and editing
    interfaces**. The visitor-facing published site is **wholly independent** of this, and the
    responsibility of the site developer.


*******
General
*******

django CMS has made extensive use of double-click functionality, which lacks an exact equivalent in
touch-screen interfaces. The touch interface will interpret taps and touches in an intelligent way.

Depending on the context, a tap will be interpreted to mean *open for editing* (that is, the
equivalent of a double-click), or to mean *select* (the equivalent of a single click), according to
what makes sense in that context.

Similarly, in some contexts similar interactions may *drag* objects, or may *scroll* them,
depending on what makes most sense. Sometimes, the two behaviours will be present in the same view,
for example in the page list, where certain areas are draggable (for page re-ordering) while other
parts of the page can be used for scrolling.

In general, the chosen behaviour is reasonable for a particular object, context or portion of the
screen, and in practice is quicker and easier to apprehend simply by using it than it is to explain.

Pop-up help text will refer to clicking or tapping depending on the device being used.

Be aware that some hover-related user hints are simply not available to touch interface users. For
example, the overlay (formerly, the *sideframe*) can be adjusted for width by dragging its edge,
but this is not indicated in a touch-screen interface.


.. _device-support:

**************
Device support
**************

Smaller devices such as most phones are too small to be adequately usable. For example, your Apple
Watch is sadly unlikely to provide a very good django CMS editing experience.

Older devices will often lack the performance to support a usefully responsive frontend
editing/administration interface.

The following devices are known to work well, so newer devices and more powerful models should also
be suitable:

* iOS: Apple iPad Air 1, Mini 4
* Android: Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet, Samsung Galaxy Tab 4
* Windows 10: Microsoft Surface

We welcome feedback about specific devices.


********************
Your site's frontend
********************

django CMS's toolbar and frontend editing architecture rely on good practices in your own frontend
code. To work well with django CMS's responsive management framework, your own site should be
friendly towards multiple devices.

Whether you use your own frontend code or a framework such as Bootstrap 3 or Foundation, be aware
that problems in your CSS or markup can affect django CMS editing modes, and this will become
especially apparent to users of mobile/hand-held devices.


************
Known issues
************

General issues
--------------

* Editing links that lack sufficient padding is currently difficult or impossible using
  touch-screens.

* Similarly, other areas of a page where the visible content is composed entirely of links with
  minimal padding around them can be difficult or impossible to open for editing by tapping. This
  can affect the navigation menu (double-clicking on the navigation menu opens the page list).

* Adding links is known to be problematic on some Android devices, because of the behaviour of the
  keyboard.

* On some devices, managing django CMS in the browser's *private* (also known as *incognito*)
  mode can have significant performance implications.

  This is because local storage is not available in this mode, and user state must be stored in a
  Django session, which is much less efficient.

  This is an unusual use case, and should not affect many users.


CKEditor issues
---------------

* Scrolling on narrow devices, especially when opening the keyboard inside the CKEditor, does not
  always work ideally - sometimes the keyboard can appear in the wrong place on-screen.

* Sometimes the CKEditor moves unexpectedly on-screen in use.

* Sometimes in Safari on iOS devices, a rendering bug will apparently truncate or reposition
  portions of the toolbar when the CKEditor is opened - even though sections may appear to missing
  or moved, they can still be activated by touching the part of the screen where they should have
  been found.


Django Admin issues
-------------------

* In the page tree, the first touch on the page opens the keyboard which may be undesirable. This
  happens because Django automatically focuses the search form input.

/. üöÄ docs/topics/colorscheme.rst
===================================================

.. _colorscheme:

##########################################
Color schemes (light/dark) with django CMS
##########################################

.. important::

    These notes about the color scheme apply only to the **django CMS admin and editing
    interfaces**. The visitor-facing published site is **wholly independent** of this, and the
    responsibility of the site developer.

    The admin interfaces will only reflect the described behavior if the package
    ``djangocms-admin-style`` is installed (version 3.2 or later). If it is not installed the admin
    interface is managed by your underlying Django installation which usually
    uses the browser's color scheme.

************************
Setting the color scheme
************************

Django CMS' default color scheme is ``"light"``. To change the color scheme use the ``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME``
setting in your project's ``setting.py``:

``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME = "light"``
    This is the default appearance and shows the interface with dark text on white background.

``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME = "dark"``
    This so-called dark mode show light text on dark background.

``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME = "auto"``
    The auto mode chooses either light or dark color scheme based on the browser or
    operating system setting of the user.

.. hint::

    If you plan to fix the color scheme to either light or dark, add a corresponding
    ``data-theme`` attribute to the ``html`` tag in your base template, e.g.

    .. code-block::

        <html data-theme="light">

    This will pin the color scheme early when loading pages and avoid potential
    flickering if the browser preference differs from the ``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME``
    setting.

.. versionchanged:: 3.11.4

    Before version 3.11.4 the color scheme was set by ``data-color-scheme``. Since version 3.11.4 django CMS uses ``data-theme`` just as Django since version 4.2.


.. important::

    Not all plugin admin interfaces might support a dark color scheme, especially
    if plugin forms contain custom widgets.

**********************************
Toggle button for the color scheme
**********************************

Adding the setting ``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME_TOGGLE = True`` to the project's ``settings.py`` will add a toggle icon (sun/moon) to the toolbar allowing a user to switch their color scheme for their session.


******************************************
Make your own admin css color scheme aware
******************************************

Plugin forms or any admin forms use Django's admin app which itself supports light and dark color schemes. djangocms-admin-style introduces django CMS' color scheme to the admin app. Just as Django does, djangocms-admin-style defines css variables for frequent colors.

We recommend to write at least your reusable apps in a way which allows  them to respect the color scheme with djangocms-admin-style and with Django's admin style.

Here's some recommendations for making your app work as seamlessly as possible:

* Try avoiding using ``color``, ``background-color``, or other color styles where possible and meaningful.
* If necessary use as few as possible standard django CMS colors (preferably from the list below with plain Django fallback colors)
* Use the following pattern: ``var(--dca-color-var, var(--fallback-color-var, #xxxxxx))`` where ``#xxxxxx`` represents the light version of the color. This tries django CMS color scheme first and falls back to Django color scheme if djangocms-admin-style is not available.
* Avoid media queries like ``@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`` since they would ignore forced settings to light or dark.


The admin frontend pulls the style from django admin styles and - if present - from djangocms-admin-style. Django itself also uses css variables to implement admin mode, these can be used as dark mode-aware fall-back colors.

Here's a table of django CMS' css color variables and their Django fallbacks:

=============================== =========== ======================= ===========
Variable name                   Color       Fallback                Color
=============================== =========== ======================= ===========
``--dca-white``                 ``#ffffff`` ``--body-bg``           ``#ffffff``
``--dca-gray``                  ``#666``    ``--body-quiet-color``  ``#666``
``--dca-gray-lightest``         ``#f2f2f2`` ``--darkened-bg``       ``#f8f8f8``
``--dca-gray-lighter``          ``#ddd``    ``--border-color``      ``#ccc``
``--dca-gray-light``            ``#999``    ``--close-button-bg``   ``#888``
``--dca-gray-darker``           ``#454545``
``--dca-gray-darkest``          ``#333``
``--dca-gray-super-lightest``   ``#f7f7f7``
``--dca-primary``               ``#00bbff`` ``--primary``           ``#79aec8``
``--dca-black``                 ``#000``    ``--body-fg``           ``#303030``
=============================== =========== ======================= ===========

This leaves these recommendation for color scheme dependent colors:

.. code-block::

    white:          var(--dca-white, var(--body-bg, #fff))
    gray:           var(--dca-gray, var(--body-quiet-color, #666))
    gray-lightest:  var(--dca-gray-lightest, var(--darkened-bg, #f2f2f2))
    gray-lighter    var(--dca-gray-lighter, var(--border-color, #ddd))
    gray-light:     var(--dca-gray-lightest, var(--darkened-bg, #f2f2f2))
    gray-primary:   var(--dca-primary, var(--primary, #0bf))
    black:          var(--dca-black, var(--body-fg), #000))

#########################
How the menu system works
#########################

**************
Basic concepts
**************

.. _soft-root:

Soft Roots
==========

A *soft root* is a page that acts as the root for a menu
navigation tree.

Typically, this will be a page that is the root of a significant
new section on your site.

When the *soft root* feature is enabled, the navigation menu
for any page will start at the nearest *soft root*, rather than
at the real root of the site's page hierarchy.

This feature is useful when your site has deep page hierarchies
(and therefore multiple levels in its navigation trees). In such
a case, you usually don't want to present site visitors with deep
menus of nested items.

For example, you're on the page "Introduction to Bleeding", so the menu might look like this::

    School of Medicine
        Medical Education
        Departments
            Department of Lorem Ipsum
            Department of Donec Imperdiet
            Department of Cras Eros
            Department of Mediaeval Surgery
                Theory
                Cures
                    Bleeding
                        * Introduction to Bleeding <current page>
                        Bleeding - the scientific evidence
                        Cleaning up the mess
                    Cupping
                    Leaches
                    Maggots
                Techniques
                Instruments
            Department of Curabitur a Purus
            Department of Sed Accumsan
            Department of Etiam
        Research
        Administration
        Contact us
        Impressum

which is frankly overwhelming.

By making "Department of Mediaeval Surgery" a *soft root*, the
menu becomes much more manageable::

    Department of Mediaeval Surgery
        Theory
        Cures
            Bleeding
                * Introduction to Bleeding <current page>
                Bleeding - the scientific evidence
                Cleaning up the mess
            Cupping
            Leaches
            Maggots
        Techniques
        Instruments

Registration
============

The menu system isn't monolithic. Rather, it is composed of numerous active parts, many of which can operate independently of each other.

What they operate on is a list of menu nodes, that gets passed around the menu system, until it emerges at the other end.

The main active parts of the menu system are menu *generators* and *modifiers*.

Some of these parts are supplied with the menus application. Some come from other applications (from the cms application in django CMS, for example, or some other application entirely).

All these active parts need to be registered within the menu system.

Then, when the time comes to build a menu, the system will ask all the registered menu generators and modifiers to get to work on it.

Generators and Modifiers
========================

Menu generators and modifiers are classes.

Generators
----------

To add nodes to a menu a generator is required.

There is one in cms for example, which examines the Pages in the database and adds them as nodes.

These classes are sub-classes of :py:class:`menus.base.Menu`. The one in cms is :py:class:`cms.menu.CMSMenu`.

In order to use a generator, its :py:meth:`~menus.base.Menu.get_nodes()` method must be called.

Modifiers
---------

A modifier examines the nodes that have been assembled, and modifies them according to its requirements (adding or removing them, or manipulating their attributes, as it sees fit).

An important one in cms (:py:class:`cms.menu.SoftRootCutter`) removes the nodes that are no longer required when a soft root is encountered.

These classes are sub-classes of :py:class:`menus.base.Modifier`. Examples are :py:class:`cms.menu.NavExtender` and :py:class:`cms.menu.SoftRootCutter`.

In order to use a modifier, its :py:meth:`~menus.base.Modifier.modify()` method must be called.

Note that each Modifier's :py:meth:`~menus.base.Modifier.modify()` method can be called *twice*, before and after the menu has been trimmed.

For example when using the ``{% show_menu %}`` template tag, it's called:

* first, by :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool.get_nodes()`, with the argument ``post_cut = False``
* later, by the template tag, with the argument ``post_cut = True``

This corresponds to the state of the nodes list before and after :py:func:`menus.templatetags.menu_tags.cut_levels()`, which removes nodes from the menu according to the arguments provided by the template tag.

This is because some modification might be required on *all* nodes, and some might only be required on the subset of nodes left after cutting.

Nodes
=====

Nodes are assembled in a tree. Each node is an instance of the :class:`menus.base.NavigationNode` class.

A NavigationNode has attributes such as URL, title, parent and children - as one would expect in a navigation tree.

It also has an ``attr`` attribute, a dictionary that's provided for you to add arbitrary attributes
to, rather than placing them directly on the node itself, where they might clash with something.

.. warning::
    You can't assume that a :py:class:`menus.base.NavigationNode` represents a django CMS Page. Firstly, some nodes may
    represent objects from other applications. Secondly, you can't expect to be able to access Page objects via
    NavigationNodes. To check if node represents a CMS Page, check for ``is_page`` in :py:attr:`menus.base.NavigationNode.attr`
    and that it is ``True``.

*****************
Menu system logic
*****************

Let's look at an example using the ``{% show_menu %}`` template tag. It will be different for other
template tags, and your applications might have their own menu classes. But this should help
explain what's going on and what the menu system is doing.

One thing to understand is that the system passes around a list of ``nodes``, doing various things
to it.

Many of the methods below pass this list of nodes to the ones it calls, and return them to the ones
that they were in turn called by.


The ``ShowMenu.get_context()`` method
=====================================

When the Django template engine encounters the ``{% show_menu %}`` template tag, it calls
the :py:meth:`get_context() <menus.templatetags.menu_tags.ShowMenu.get_context()>` of the ``ShowMenu`` class. ``get_context()``:

* calls :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool.get_nodes()` (see :ref:`get_nodes_method` below)
* cuts any nodes other than its descendants (if a ``root_id`` has been provided)
* calls :py:meth:`menus.templatetags.menu_tags.cut_levels()` to remove unwanted levels
* calls :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool.apply_modifiers()` with ``post_cut = True``
* return the nodes to the context in the variable ``children``


.. _get_nodes_method:

The ``MenuPool.get_nodes()`` method
===================================

:py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool.get_nodes()` calls three other methods of ``MenuPool`` in turn:

* :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool.discover_menus()`

  Checks every application's ``cms_menus.py``, and registers:
    * Menu classes, placing them in the ``self.menus`` dict
    * Modifier classes, placing them in the self.modifiers list

* :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool._build_nodes()`

    * checks the cache to see if it should return cached nodes
    * loops over the Menus in self.menus (note: by default the only generator is
      :py:class:`cms.menu.CMSMenu`); for each:

        * calls its :py:meth:`menus.base.Menu.get_nodes()` - the menu generator
        * :py:func:`menus.menu_pool._build_nodes_inner_for_one_menu()`
        * adds all nodes into a big list

* :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool.apply_modifiers()`

    * :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool._mark_selected()`
    * loops over each node, comparing its URL with the request.path_info, and marks the best match
      as ``selected``
    * loops over the Modifiers (see :ref:`menu-modifiers` below) in ``self.modifiers`` calling each
      one's
      :py:meth:`~menus.base.Modifier.modify()` with ``post_cut=False``.


.. _menu-modifiers:

Menu Modifiers
==============

Each ``Modifier`` manipulates menu nodes and their attributes.

The default Modifiers, in the order they are called, are:

* :py:class:`cms.menu.NavExtender`
* :py:class:`cms.menu.SoftRootCutter`

  If ``post_cut`` is ``True``, removes all nodes below the appropriate soft root; otherwise,
  returns immediately.

* :py:class:`menus.modifiers.Marker`

  If ``post_cut`` or ``breadcrumb`` is ``True``, returns immediately; otherwise, loops over all
  nodes; finds selected, marks its ancestors, siblings and children

* :py:class:`menus.modifiers.AuthVisibility`

  Removes nodes that require authorisation to see

* :py:class:`menus.modifiers.Level`

  Loops over all nodes; for each one that is a root node (``level == 0``) passes it to:

    * :py:meth:`~menus.modifiers.Level.mark_levels()` recurses over a node's descendants marking
      their levels

####################
Frontend integration
####################

Generally speaking, django CMS is wholly frontend-agnostic. It doesn't care what your site's
frontend is built on or uses.

The exception to this is when editing your site, as the django CMS toolbar and editing controls
use their own frontend code, and this can sometimes affect or be affected by your site's code.

The content reloading introduced in django CMS 3.5 for plugin operations (when
moving/adding/deleting etc) pull markup changes from the server. This may require a JS widget to be
reinitialised, or additional CSS to be loaded, depending on your own frontend set-up.

For example, if using Less.js, you may notice that content loads without expected CSS after plugin saves.

In such a case, you can use the ``cms-content-refresh`` event to take care of that, by adding something like:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% if request.toolbar and request.toolbar.edit_mode_active %}
        <script>
        CMS.$(window).on('cms-content-refresh', function () {
             less.refresh();
        });
        </script>
    {% endif %}

after the toolbar JavaScript.

******************************************
Are you new to django CMS?
******************************************

If you are new to django CMS, then we recommend you to first familiarize yourself with the CMS
and start with the `install <https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/introduction/01-install.html>`_ section.
After that, you can have a go at issues on Github that are marked `Good first issue <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/labels/good%20first%20issues>`_.
These issues are especially good if you're just starting out but still want to contribute.
Beginners can also contribute to the project, for example by helping to improve the documentation,
or other tasks, such as writing a blog article series about your journey of learning django CMS
(See `community tasks <https://www.django-cms.org/en/community-tasks/>`_).
After you have acquainted yourself with django CMS and maybe already created your first website with it,
you should start looking at contributing to the django CMS codebase.

#################
Contributing code
#################

Like every open-source project, django CMS is always looking for motivated
individuals to contribute to its source code.


*************
In a nutshell
*************

Here's what the contribution process looks like in brief:

#. Fork our `GitHub`_ repository, https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms
#. Work locally and push your changes to your repository.
#. When you feel your code is good enough for inclusion, send us a pull request.
#. After that, please join the `Slack Channel`_ of our Pull Request Review work group (#workgroup-pr-review). This group of friendly community members is dedicated to reviewing pull requests. Report your PR and find a ‚Äúpr review buddy‚Äù who is going to review your pull request.
#. Get acknowledged by the django CMS community for your contribution

See the :ref:`contributing_patch` how-to document for a walk-through of this process.


********************************
Basic requirements and standards
********************************

If you're interested in developing a new feature for the CMS, it is recommended
that you first discuss it on the `Discourse forum <https://discourse.django-cms.org>`_ so as
not to do any work that will not get merged in anyway.

- Code will be reviewed and tested by at least one core developer, preferably
  by several. Other community members are welcome to give feedback.
- Code *must* be tested. Your pull request should include unit-tests (that cover
  the piece of code you're submitting, obviously)
- Documentation should reflect your changes if relevant. There is nothing worse
  than invalid documentation.
- Usually, if unit tests are written, pass, and your change is relevant, then
  it'll be merged.

Since we're hosted on GitHub, django CMS uses `git`_ as a version control system.

The `GitHub help`_ is very well written and will get you started on using git
and GitHub in a jiffy. It is an invaluable resource for newbies and old timers
alike.


Syntax and conventions
======================

Python
------

We try to conform to `PEP8`_ as much as possible. A few highlights:

- Indentation should be exactly 4 spaces. Not 2, not 6, not 8. **4**. Also, tabs
  are evil.
- We try (loosely) to keep the line length at 79 characters. Generally the rule
  is "it should look good in a terminal-base editor" (eg vim), but we try not be
  too inflexible about it.


HTML, CSS and JavaScript
------------------------

As of django CMS 3.2, we are using the same guidelines as described in `Aldryn
Boilerplate`_

Frontend code should be formatted for readability. If in doubt, follow existing
examples, or ask.


.. _js_linting:

JS Linting
----------

JavaScript is linted using `ESLint <http://eslint.org>`_. In order to run the
linter you need to do this:

.. code-block:: sh

    gulp lint

Or you can also run the watcher by just running ``gulp``.


Process
=======

This is how you fix a bug or add a feature:

#. `fork`_ us on GitHub.
#. Checkout your fork.
#. *Hack hack hack*, *test test test*, *commit commit commit*, test again.
#. Push to your fork.
#. Open a pull request.

And at any point in that process, you can add: *discuss discuss discuss*,
because it's always useful for everyone to pass ideas around and look at things
together.

:ref:`testing` is really important: a pull request that lowers our testing
coverage will only be accepted with a very good reason; bug-fixing patches
**must** demonstrate the bug with a test to avoid regressions and to check
that the fix works.

We have a `Slack Channel`_, a `Discourse forum
<https://discourse.django-cms.org>`_, and of course the code reviews mechanism on GitHub - do use them.


.. _contributing_frontend:

********
Frontend
********

..  important::

    When we refer to the *frontend* here, we **only** mean the frontend of django CMS's admin/editor interface.

    The frontend of a django CMS website, as seen by its visitors (i.e. the published site), is *wholly independent of
    this*. django CMS places almost no restrictions at all on the frontend - if a site can be described in
    HTML/CSS/JavaScript, it can be developed in django CMS.

In order to be able to work with the frontend tooling contributing to the
django CMS you need to have the following dependencies installed:

    1. `Node <https://nodejs.org/>`_ version 6.10.1 (will install npm 3.10.10 as well).
       We recommend using `NVM <https://github.com/creationix/nvm>`_ to get
       the correct version of Node.
    2. gulp - see `Gulp's Getting Started notes <https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md>`_
    3. Local dependencies ``npm install``

Styles
======

We use `Sass <http://sass-lang.com/>`_ for our styles. The files
are located within ``cms/static/cms/sass`` and can be compiled using the
`libsass <http://libsass.org/>`_ implementation of Sass compiler through
`gulp <http://gulpjs.com/>`_.

In order to compile the stylesheets you need to run this command from the repo
root::

    gulp sass

While developing it is also possible to run a watcher that compiles Sass files
on change::

    gulp

By default, source maps are not included in the compiled files. In order to turn
them on while developing just add the ``--debug`` option::

    gulp --debug

Icons
=====

We are using `gulp-iconfont <https://github.com/backflip/gulp-iconfont>`_ to
generate icon web fonts into ``cms/static/cms/fonts/``. This also creates
``_iconography.scss`` within ``cms/static/cms/sass/components`` which adds all
the icon classes and ultimately compiles to CSS.

In order to compile the web font you need to run::

    gulp icons

This simply takes all SVGs within ``cms/static/cms/fonts/src`` and embeds them
into the web font. All classes will be automatically added to
``_iconography.scss`` as previously mentioned.

Additionally we created an SVG template within
``cms/static/cms/font/src/_template.svgz`` that you should use when converting
or creating additional icons. It is named *svgz* so it doesn't get compiled
into the font. When using *Adobe Illustrator* please mind the
`following settings <images/svg_settings.png>`_.


JS Bundling
===========

JavaScript files are split up for easier development, but in the end they are
bundled together and minified to decrease amount of requests made and improve
performance. In order to do that we use the ``gulp`` task runner, where ``bundle``
command is available. We use `Webpack <https://github.com/webpack/webpack>`_ for
bundling JavaScript files. Configuration for each bundle are stored inside the
``webpack.config.js`` and their respective entry points. CMS exposes only one
global variable, named ``CMS``. If you want to use JavaScript code provided by
CMS in external applications, you can only use bundles distributed by CMS, not
the source modules.

##########################
Contributing documentation
##########################

Perhaps considered "boring" by hard-core coders, documentation is sometimes even
more important than code! This is what brings fresh blood to a project, and
serves as a reference for old timers. On top of this, documentation is the one
area where less technical people can help most - you just need to write
simple, unfussy English. Elegance of style is a secondary consideration, and
your prose can be improved later if necessary.

Contributions to the documentation earn the greatest respect from the
core developers and the django CMS community.

Documentation should be:

- written using valid `Sphinx`_/`restructuredText`_ syntax (see below for
  specifics); the file extension should be ``.rst``
- wrapped at 100 characters per line
- written in English, using British English spelling and punctuation
- accessible - you should assume the reader to be moderately familiar with
  Python and Django, but not anything else. Link to documentation of libraries
  you use, for example, even if they are "obvious" to you

Merging documentation is pretty fast and painless.

Except for the tiniest of change, we recommend that you test them before
submitting.


**************************
Building the documentation
**************************

Follow the same steps above to fork and clone the project locally. Next, ``cd`` into the
``django-cms/docs`` and install the requirements::

    make install

Now you can test and run the documentation locally using::

    make run

This allows you to review your changes in your local browser using ``http://localhost:8001/``.

.. note:: **What this does**

    ``make install`` is roughly the equivalent of::

        virtualenv env
        source env/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        cd docs
        make html

    ``make run`` runs ``make html``, and serves the built documentation on port 8001 (that is, at
    ``http://localhost:8001/``.

    It then watches the ``docs`` directory; when it spots changes, it will automatically rebuild
    the documentation, and refresh the page in your browser.

**************************
Documentation requirements
**************************

The packages required by the documentation are managed by `pip-tools`_, which
compiles ``requirements.txt`` ensuring compatibility between packages.

The packages that the documentation requires are in ``requirements.in`` which
looks like a regular requirements file. Specific versions of packages can be
specified, or left without a version in which case the latest version which is
compatible with the other packages will be used.

Example ``requirements.in``:

.. code-block::

   furo
   Sphinx>4
   sphinx-copybutton
   sphinxext-opengraph
   sphinxcontrib-spelling
   pyenchant>3

By running ``pip-compile`` the requirements are compiled into ``requirements.txt``.

Periodically requirements should be updated to ensure that new versions, most
importantly security patches, are used. This is done using the ``-U`` flag:

.. code-block::

   cd docs
   pip-compile -U

The generated ``requirements.txt`` pins specific versions and explains where
each required package comes from, for example:

.. code-block::

   datetime==4.3
       # via -r requirements.in
   django==3.2.5
       # via
       #   django-classy-tags
       #   django-cms
       #   django-formtools
       #   django-sekizai
       #   django-treebeard
   django-classy-tags==2.0.0
       # via
       #   django-cms
       #   django-sekizai
   django-cms==3.9.0
       # via -r requirements.in
   django-formtools==2.3
       # via django-cms

.. _spelling:

********
Spelling
********

We use `sphinxcontrib-spelling <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-spelling/>`_, which in
turn uses `pyenchant <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyenchant/>`_ and `enchant
<http://www.abisource.com/projects/enchant/>`_ to check the spelling of the documentation.

You need to check your spelling before submitting documentation.

.. important::

    We use British English rather than US English spellings. This means that we use *colour*
    rather than *color*, *emphasise* rather than *emphasize* and so on.


Install the spelling software
=============================

``sphinxcontrib-spelling`` and ``pyenchant`` are Python packages that will be installed in the
virtualenv ``docs/env`` when you run ``make install`` (see above).

You will need to have ``enchant`` installed too, if it is not already. The easy way to check is to
run ``make spelling`` from the ``docs`` directory. If it runs successfully, you don't need to do
anything, but if not you will have to install ``enchant`` for your system. For example, on OS X::

    brew install enchant

or Debian Linux::

    apt-get install enchant


Check spelling
==============

Run::

    make spelling

in the ``docs`` directory to conduct the checks.

.. note::

    This script expects to find a virtualenv at ``docs/env``, as installed by ``make install`` (see
    above).

If no spelling errors have been detected, ``make spelling`` will report::

    build succeeded.

Otherwise::

    build finished with problems.
    make: *** [spelling] Error 1

It will list any errors in your shell. Misspelt words will be also be listed in
``build/spelling/output.txt``

Words that are not in the built-in dictionary can be added to ``docs/spelling_wordlist``. **If**
you are certain that a word is incorrectly flagged as misspelt, add it to the ``spelling_wordlist``
document, in alphabetical order. **Please do not add new words unless you are sure they should be
in there.**

If you find technical terms are being flagged, please check that you have capitalised them
correctly - ``javascript`` and ``css`` are **incorrect** spellings for example. Commands and
special names (of classes, modules, etc) in double backticks - `````` - will mean that they are not
caught by the spelling checker.

.. important::

    You may well find that some words that pass the spelling test on one system but not on another.
    Dictionaries on different systems contain different words and even behave differently. The
    important thing is that the spelling tests pass on `Travis
    <https://travis-ci.com/django-cms/django-cms>`_ when you submit a pull request.


*********************
Making a pull request
*********************

Before you commit any changes, you need to check spellings with ``make spelling`` and rebuild the
docs using ``make html``. If everything looks good, then it's time to push your changes to GitHub
and open a pull request in the usual way.


***********************
Documentation structure
***********************

Our documentation is divided into the following main sections:

* :doc:`/introduction/index` (``introduction``): step-by-step, beginning-to-end tutorials to get
  you up and running
* :doc:`/how_to/index` (``how_to``): step-by-step guides covering more advanced development
* :doc:`/topics/index` (``topics``): explanations of key parts of the system
* :doc:`/reference/index` (``reference``): technical reference for APIs, key
  models
  and so on
* :doc:`/contributing/index` (``contributing``)
* :doc:`/upgrade/index` (``upgrade``)
* :doc:`/whoisbehind/index` (``who``): who is behind the django CMS project



********************
Documentation markup
********************

Sections
========

We mostly follow the Python documentation conventions for section marking::

    ##########
    Page title
    ##########

    *******
    heading
    *******

    sub-heading
    ===========

    sub-sub-heading
    ---------------

    sub-sub-sub-heading
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    sub-sub-sub-sub-heading
    """""""""""""""""""""""


Inline markup
=============

* use backticks - `````` - for:
    * literals::

        The ``cms.models.pagemodel`` contains several important methods.

    * filenames::

        Before you start, edit ``settings.py``.

    * names of fields and other specific items in the Admin interface::

        Edit the ``Redirect`` field.

* use emphasis - ``*Home*`` - around:
    * the names of available options in or parts of the Admin::

        To hide and show the *Toolbar*, use the...

    * the names of important modes or states::

        ... in order to switch to *Edit mode*.

    * values in or of fields::

        Enter *Home* in the field.

* use strong emphasis - ``**`` - around:
    * buttons that perform an action::

        Hit **View published** or **Save as draft**.



Rules for using technical words
===============================

There should be one consistent way of rendering any technical word, depending on its context.
Please follow these rules:

* in general use, simply use the word as if it were any ordinary word, with no capitalisation or
  highlighting: "Your placeholder can now be used."
* at the start of sentences or titles, capitalise in the usual way: "Placeholder management guide"
* when introducing the term for the the first time, or for the first time in a document, you may
  highlight it to draw attention to it: "**Placeholders** are special model fields".
* when the word refers specifically to an object in the code, highlight it as a literal:
  "``Placeholder`` methods can be overwritten as required" - when appropriate, link the term to
  further reference documentation as well as simply highlighting it.


References
==========

Create::

    .. _testing:

and use::

     :ref:`testing`

internal cross-references liberally.


Use absolute links to other documentation pages - ``:doc:`/how_to/toolbar``` -
rather than relative links - ``:doc:`/../toolbar```. This makes it easier to
run search-and-replaces when items are moved in the structure.

******
Review
******

All patches should be made as pull requests **against develop** to
`the GitHub repository <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms>`_. Patches should
never be pushed directly.

**Nothing** may enter the code-base, *including the documentation*, without
proper review and formal approval from the core team.

Reviews are welcomed by all members of the community. You don't need to be a core developer, or even an experienced
programmer, to contribute usefully to code review. Even noting that you don't understand something in a pull request
is valuable feedback and will be taken seriously.


Formal approval
===============

Formal approval means "OK to merge" comments, following review, from at least
one member of the core team who has expertise in the relevant areas, and excluding
the author of the pull request.


**********************************************
Proposal and discussion of significant changes
**********************************************

New features and backward-incompatible changes should follow the best practice of `DEPS <https://github.com/django/deps>`_ and
should be discussed in the community first. After your proposal has been reviewed by the community,
it needs to be finally approved by the `Tech Committee <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-mgmt/blob/master/tech-committee/about.md>`_.
This is in the interests of openness and transparency,
and to give the community a chance to participate in and understand the decisions taken by the project.

So before submitting pull requests with significant changes, please make sure that the community agrees and the
Technical Committee approves.


To create a proposal...

1. please use this `DEP template <https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/template.rst>`_
2. create a discussion in the main `Github repository <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/discussions>`_
3. discuss, discuss, discuss
4. join the Tech Committee `Slack Channel <https://www.django-cms.org/slack>`_ (#technical-committee) and make the team aware of your proposal after the proposal has been reviewed by the Technical Committee, it is put to a vote at one of the weekly meetings of the technical committee


****************
Release schedule
****************

The `roadmap <https://www.django-cms.org/en/roadmap/>`_ can be found on our website. The release schedule is
managed by the release management workgroup. The plan is to release quarterly and according to a retrospectice approach.

Example of retrospective approach.

* Q1 2021 -> 3.9 Release
* End of Q1 2021 -> freeze
* Check what‚Äôs available
* Merge in anything that‚Äôs been approved
* Q2 2021 Release -> 3.10
* ...
* Unscheduled Releases -> e.g. bug fix -> 3.x.x

The release management workgroup can be found on `Slack <https://www.django-cms.org/slack>`_ in #release-management channel.
For questions regarding the release process please join the channel and reach out. We're happy to help.

Long-Term Support Release
===========================

..  versionchanged:: 3.7

    django CMS 3.7 is the current active long term release.

django CMS 3.4, surpassed by 3.7, was the first "LTS" ("Long-Term Support")
release of the application. *Long-term support* means that this version will
continue to receive security and other critical updates for 24 months after its
first release.

Any updates it does receive will be backward-compatible and will not alter functional behaviour. This means that users
can deploy this version confident that keeping it up-to-date requires only easily-applied security and other critical
updates, until the next LTS release.


.. _branch_policy:

********
Branches
********

..  versionchanged:: 3.3

    Previously, we maintained a ``master`` branch (now deleted), and a set of ``support`` branches (now pruned, and
    renamed ``release``).

..  versionchanged:: 3.7

    Simplified the description of the release branches and added additional
    information for ``releases`` and ``release/4.0.x``. In general open PRs
    against ``develop``.

We maintain a number of branches on
`our GitHub repository <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms>`_:

``develop``
    The default target branch for on-going development and new pull requests.

``release/x.y.z`` are the latest released versions of django CMS. Commits
    are cherry-picked from ``develop`` and merged into ``release/x.y.z``
    when suitable. We **officially support** the latest, highest released version
    and the latest LTS (currently 3.7).

``release/4.0.x`` is an experimental branch and should not be considered
    as the highest released version.

``releases`` hosts the `releases.json` file to indicate the availability of new
    django CMS versions when using `djangocms-admin-style <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-admin-style#configuration>`_.

Please always open PR's against develop and indicate that they should be
backported to the latest LTS release when necessary. Older branches are not
supported any longer.


.. _commit_policy:

*******
Commits
*******

Commit messages
===============

Commit messages and their subject lines should be written in the past tense, not present tense, for example:

    Updated contribution policies.

    * Updated branch policy to clarify purpose of develop/release branches
    * Added commit policy.
    * Added changelog policy.

Keep lines short, and within 72 characters as far as possible.


Squashing commits
=================

In order to make our Git history more useful, and to make life easier for the core developers, please rebase and
squash your commit history into a single commit representing a single coherent piece of work.

For example, we don't really need or want a commit history, for what ought to be a single commit, that looks like
(newest last)::

    2dceb83 Updated contribution policies.
    ffe5f2c Fixed spelling mistake in contribution policies.
    29168da Fixed typo.
    85d925c Updated commit policy based on feedback.

The bottom three commits are just noise. They don't represent development of the code base. The four commits
should be squashed into a single, meaningful, commit::

    85d925c Updated contribution policies.


How to squash commits
---------------------

In this example above, you'd use ``git rebase -i HEAD~4`` (the ``4`` refers to the number of commits being squashed -
adjust it as required).

This will open a ``git-rebase-todo`` file (showing commits with the newest last)::

    pick 2dceb83 Updated contribution policies.
    pick ffe5f2c Fixed spelling mistake in contribution policies.
    pick 29168da Fixed typo.
    pick 85d925c Updated commit policy based on feedback.

"Fixup" the last three commits, using ``f`` so that they are squashed into the first, and their commit messages
discarded::

    pick 2dceb83 Updated contribution policies.
    f ffe5f2c Fixed spelling mistake in contribution policies.
    f 29168da Fixed typo.
    f 85d925c Updated commit policy based on feedback.

Save - and this will leave you with a single commit containing all of the changes::

    85d925c Updated contribution policies.

Ask for help if you run into trouble!

*********
Changelog
*********

**Every new feature, bugfix or other change of substance** must be represented in the `CHANGELOG
<https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.rst>`_. This includes documentation, but **doesn't** extend
to things like reformatting code, tidying-up, correcting typos and so on.

Each line in the changelog should begin with a verb in the past tense, for example::

    * Added CMS_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER setting
    * Renamed the CMS_WIZARD_* settings to CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_*
    * Deprecated the old-style wizard-related settings
    * Improved handling of uninstalled apphooks
    * Fixed an issue which could lead to an apphook without a slug
    * Updated contribution policies documentation

New lines should be added to the top of the list.

#####################################
Guidelines for django CMS projects
#####################################

.. note:: These guidelines are based on the best practice established by the Jazzband project, a community of contributors that shares the responsibility of maintaining Python-based projects.

The django CMS ecosystem consists of many custom projects. Often these projects are maintained by the author themselves.
However, sometimes it can make sense to put a project in the care of the django CMS project.
Either because it is of interest to the entire community, or because the author can no longer devote time to maintain the project themselves.

Whether an existing project is transferred to the django CMS Github organization,
or a new project is set up within the django CMS Github organization, it is important that certain standards are followed.

**********************************************************
Acceptance criteria for new projects or existing ones
**********************************************************

Projects must meet the criteria of viability, documentation, testing, code of conducts and contributing guidelines.
But before that, they must be approved by the Tech Committee.

Approval by Tech Committee of the django CMS Association
************************************************************

New projects or project transfers under the django CMS patronage must first be approved
by the `Tech Committee <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-mgmt/blob/master/tech-committee/about.md>`_.
For that you should join the #tech-committee channel on `Slack <https://www.django-cms.org/slack>`_ and simply submit your proposal. Then, the TC decides
whether or not your project is in line with the product roadmap and overall vision for django CMS.

Viability
***********

Projects to be maintained by the django CMS project must have a certain maturity (No proof of concepts,
one-off toys or code snippet hosts) and provide useful functionality.
They should also be transferred to django CMS with the agreement of the previous maintainer and in
consultation with the Tech Committee (see `Tech Committee <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-mgmt/blob/master/tech-committee/about.md>`_).

Documentation
*****************

Project documentation is one of the most important aspects of a project. For this reason, it is of utmost importance
that the project includes prose documentation for end users and contributors.
It is also strongly recommended to prepare inline code documentation, as this is considered an indicator of
high quality code. Please document as much as possible, but also as clearly and concisely as possible.
To quote `Jazzband <https://jazzband.co/about/guidelines>`_ ‚ÄúWrite like you‚Äôre addressing yourself in a few years.‚Äù
More information about how to contribute software documentation can be found `here <https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/contributing/documentation.html>`_.

Tests
********
Your contributions and fixes are more than welcome as are your tests. We do not want to compromise our codebase.
Therefore, you are going to have to include tests if you want to contribute. For more information about running and writing tests please `see here <https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/contributing/testing.html>`_.

Conduct
********

Projects are required to adopt and follow the django CMS `code of conduct <https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/contributing/code_of_conduct.html>`_.
Please see the Contributor Code of Conduct for more information about what that entails and how to report conduct violations.

Contributing Guidelines
***************************

Projects have to add a CONTRIBUTING.md ( `Markdown <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>`_ ) or CONTRIBUTING.rst ( `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_ ) file to their repository so it‚Äôs automatically displayed
when new issues and pull requests are created.

The respective file needs to contain this text:

First of all, thank you for wanting to contribute to the django CMS.
We always welcome contributions, like many other open-source projects. We are very thankful to the many
`present, past and future contributors <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/graphs/contributors>`_,
to our `community heroes <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-mgmt/blob/master/community%20heros/list%20of%20community%20heros.md>`_ and to the [members of the `django CMS Association <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-mgmt/blob/master/association/members.md>`_.
This is a `django CMS <https://www.django-cms.org>`_ project.
By contributing you agree to abide by the `Contributor Code of Conduct <https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/contributing/code_of_conduct.html>`_ and follow the `guidelines <https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/contributing/index.html>`_. Of course extending the contributing document with your project‚Äôs contributing guide is highly encouraged, too. See GitHub‚Äôs documentation on contributing guidelines for more information.

*****************************************************************
Move an existing project to the django CMS Github organization
*****************************************************************

To initiate the transfer to django CMS, you should use Github‚Äôs `Transfer Feature <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository>`_ to transfer the repository to the django CMS organization.


===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/contributing/management.rst
===================================================

.. _management:

###########################
Code and project management
###########################

We use our `GitHub project <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms>`_ for managing both django CMS code
and development activity.

This document describes how we manage tickets on GitHub. By "tickets", we mean GitHub issues and
pull requests (in fact as far as GitHub is concerned, pull requests are simply a species of issue).

******
Issues
******

Raising an issue
================

.. ATTENTION::

    If you think you have discovered a security issue in our code, please report
    it **privately**, by emailing us at `security@django-cms.org <security@django-cms.org>`_.

    Please **do not** raise it in any public forum until we have had a
    chance to deal with it.


Except in the case of security matters, of course, you're welcome to raise
issues in any way that suits you - :ref:`using Discourse, or the Slack group
<development-community>` or in person if you happen to meet another django CMS
developer.

It's very helpful though if you don't just raise an issue by mentioning it to people, but actually
file it too, and that means creating a `new issue on GitHub
<https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/issues/new>`_.

There's an art to creating a good issue report.

The *Title* needs to be both succinct and informative. "show_sub_menu displays incorrect nodes when
used with soft_root" is helpful, whereas "Menus are broken" is not.

In the *Description* of your report, we'd like to see:

* how to reproduce the problem
* what you expected to happen
* what did happen (a traceback is often helpful, if you get one)

Getting your issue accepted
===========================

Other django CMS developers will see your issue, and will be able to comment. A core developer may
add further comments, or a :ref:`label <label-reference>`.

The important thing at this stage is to have your issue *accepted*. This means that we've agreed
it's a genuine issue, and represents something we can or are willing to do in the CMS.

You may be asked for more information before it's accepted, and there may be some discussion before
it is. It could also be rejected as a :term:`non-issue` (it's not actually a problem) or
:term:`won't fix` (addressing your issue is beyond the scope of the project, or is incompatible
with our other aims).

Feel free to explain why you think a decision to reject your issue is incorrect - very few
decisions are final, and we're always happy to correct our mistakes.

**********************
How we process tickets
**********************

Tickets should be:

* given a :ref:`status <label-status>`
* marked with :ref:`needs <label-need>`
* marked with a kind
* marked with the components they apply to
* marked with :ref:`miscellaneous other labels <label-others>`
* commented

A ticket's *status* and *needs* are the most important of these. They tell us two key things:

* *status*: what stage the ticket is at
* *needs*: what next actions are required to move it forward

Needless to say, these labels need to be applied carefully, according to the rules of this system.

GitHub's interface means that we have no alternative but to use colours to help identify our
tickets. We're sorry about this. We've tried to use colours that will cause the fewest issues for
colour-blind people, so we don't use green (since we use red) or yellow (since we use blue) labels,
but we are aware it's not ideal.

django CMS ticket processing system rules
=========================================

* one and only one status **must** be applied to each ticket
* a healthy ticket (blue) **cannot** have any :ref:`critical needs <label-need-critical>` (red)
* when closed, tickets **must** have either a healthy (blue) or dead (black) status
* a ticket with :ref:`critical needs <label-need-critical>` **must not** have :ref:`non-critical
  needs <label-need-non-critical>` or :ref:`miscellaneous other <label-others>` labels
* :term:`has patch` and :term:`on hold` labels imply a related pull request, which **must** be
  linked-to when these labels are applied
* *component*, :ref:`non-critical need <label-need-non-critical>` and :ref:`miscellaneous other
  <label-others>` labels should be applied as seems appropriate

Status
======

The first thing we do is decide whether we accept the ticket, whether it's a pull request or an
issue. An accepted status means the ticket is healthy, and will have a blue label.

Basically, it's good for open tickets to be healthy (blue), because that means they are going
somewhere.

.. IMPORTANT::
   Accepting a ticket means marking it as healthy, with one of the blue labels.

    issues
        The bar for :term:`status: accepted <accepted>` is high. The status can be revoked at any
        time, and should be when appropriate. If the issue needs a :term:`design decision`,
        :term:`expert opinion` or :term:`more info`, it can't be *accepted*.

    pull requests
        When a pull request is accepted, it should become :term:`work in progress` or (more rarely)
        :term:`ready for review` or even :term:`ready to be merged`, in those rare cases where a
        perfectly-formed and unimprovable pull request lands in our laps. As for issues, if it
        needs a :term:`design decision`, :term:`expert opinion` or :term:`more info`, it can't be
        accepted.

        **No issue or pull request can have both a blue (accepted) and a red, grey or black label
        at the same time.**

Preferably, the ticket should either be accepted (blue), rejected (black) or marked as having
critical needs (red) *as soon as possible*. It's important that open tickets should have a clear
status, not least for the sake of the person who submitted it so that they know it's being assessed.

Tickets should not be allowed to linger indefinitely with critical (red) needs. If the opinions or
information required to accept the ticket are not forthcoming, the ticket should be declared
unhealthy (grey) with :term:`marked for rejection` and rejected (black) at the next release.

Needs
=====

Critical needs (red) affect status.

:ref:`label-need-non-critical` labels (pink) can be added as appropriate (and of course, removed
as work progresses) to pull requests.

It's important that open tickets should have a clear needs labels, so that it's apparent what needs
to be done to make progress with it.

Kinds and components
====================

Of necessity, these are somewhat porous categories. For example, it's not always absolutely clear
whether a pull request represents an enhancement or a bug-fix, and tickets can apply to multiple
parts of the CMS - so do the best you can with them.

Other labels
============

:term:`backport`, :term:`blocker`, :term:`has patch` or :term:`easy pickings` labels should be applied as appropriate, to healthy (blue) tickets only.

Comments
========

At any time, people can comment on the ticket, of course. Although only core maintainers can change
labels, anyone can suggest changing a label.

..  _label-reference:

***************
Label reference
***************

*Components* and *kinds* should be self-explanatory, but :ref:`statuses <label-status>`,
:ref:`needs <label-need>` and :ref:`miscellaneous other labels <label-others>` are clarified below.

..  _label-status:

Statuses
========

A ticket's *status* is its position in the pipeline - its point in our workflow.

Every issue should have a status, and be given one as soon as possible. **An issue should have only
one status applied to it**.

Many of these statuses apply equally well to both issues and pull requests, but some make sense
only for one or the other:

.. glossary::

    accepted
        (issues only) The issue has been accepted as a genuine issue that needs to be addressed.
        Note that it doesn't necessarily mean we will do what the issue suggests, if it makes a
        suggestion - simply that we agree that there is an issue to be resolved.

    non-issue
        The issue or pull request are in some way mistaken - the 'problem' is in fact correct and
        expected behaviour, or the problems were caused by (for example) misconfiguration.

        When this label is applied, an explanation must be provided in a comment.

    won't fix
        The issue or pull request imply changes to django CMS's design or behaviour that the core
        team consider incompatible with our chosen approach.

        When this label is applied, an explanation must be provided in a comment.

    marked for rejection
        We've been unable to reproduce the issue, and it has lain dormant for a long time. Or, it's
        a pull request of low significance that requires more work, and looks like it might have
        been abandoned. These tickets will be closed when we make the next release.

        When this label is applied, an explanation must be provided in a comment.

    work in progress
        (pull requests only) Work is on-going.

        The author of the pull request should include "(work in progress)" in its title, and remove
        this when they feel it's ready for final review.

    ready for review
        (pull requests only) The pull request needs to be reviewed. (Anyone can review and make
        comments recommending that it be merged (or indeed, any further action) but only a core
        maintainer can change the label.)

    ready to be merged
        (pull requests only) The pull request has successfully passed review. Core maintainers
        should not mark their own code, except in the simplest of cases, as *ready to be merged*,
        nor should they mark any code as *ready to be merged* and then merge it themselves - there
        should be another person involved in the process.

        When the pull request is merged, the label should be removed.

..  _label-need:

Needs
=====

If an issue or pull request lacks something that needs to be provided for it to progress further,
this should be marked with a "needs" label. A "needs" label indicates an *action* that should
be taken in order to advance the item's status.

..  _label-need-critical:

Critical needs
--------------

*Critical needs* (red) mean that a ticket is 'unhealthy' and won't be :term:`accepted`
(issues) or :term:`work in progress`, :term:`ready for review` or :term:`ready to be merged` until
those needs are addressed. In other words, no ticket can have both a blue and a red label.)

.. glossary::

    more info
        Not enough information has been provided to allow us to proceed, for example to reproduce a
        bug or to explain the purpose of a pull request.

    expert opinion
        The issue or pull request presents a technical problem that needs to be looked at by a
        member of the core maintenance team who has a special insight into that particular aspect
        of the system.

    design decision
        The issue or pull request has deeper implications for the CMS, that need to be considered
        carefully before we can proceed further.

..  _label-need-non-critical:

Non-critical needs
------------------

A healthy (blue) ticket can have non-critical needs:

.. glossary::

    patch
        (issues only) The issue has been given a *status: accepted*, but now someone needs to write
        the patch to address it.

    tests
    docs
        (pull requests only) Code without docs or tests?! In django CMS? No way!

..  _label-others:

Other
=====

.. glossary::

    has patch
        (issues only) A patch intended to address the issue exists. This doesn't imply that the
        patch will be accepted, or even that it contains a viable solution.

        When this label is applied, a comment should cross-reference the pull request(s) containing
        the patch.

    easy pickings
        An easy-to-fix issue, or an easy-to-review pull request - newcomers to django CMS
        development are encouraged to tackle *easy pickings* tickets.

    blocker
        We can't make the next release without resolving this issue.

    backport
        Any patch will should be backported to a previous release, either because it has security
        implications or it improves documentation.

    on hold
        (pull requests only) The pull request has to wait for a higher-priority pull request to land
        first, to avoid complex merges or extra work later. Any *on hold* pull request is by
        definition :term:`work in progress`.

        When this label is applied, a comment should cross-reference the other pull request(s).

===================================================

..  _testing:

#########################
Running and writing tests
#########################

Good code needs tests.

A project like django CMS simply can't afford to incorporate new code that
doesn't come with its own tests.

Tests provide some necessary minimum confidence: they can show the code will
behave as it expected, and help identify what's going wrong if something breaks
it.

Not insisting on good tests when code is committed is like letting a gang of
teenagers without a driving license borrow your car on a Friday night, even if
you think they are very nice teenagers and they really promise to be careful.

We certainly do want your contributions and fixes, but we need your tests with
them too. Otherwise, we'd be compromising our codebase.

So, you are going to have to include tests if you want to contribute. However,
writing tests is not particularly difficult, and there are plenty of examples to
crib from in the code to help you.


*************
Running tests
*************

There's more than one way to do this, but here's one to help you get started::

    # create a virtual environment
    virtualenv test-django-cms

    # activate it
    cd test-django-cms/
    source bin/activate

    # get django CMS from GitHub
    git clone https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms.git

    # install the dependencies for testing
    # note that requirements files for other Django versions are also provided
    pip install -r django-cms/test_requirements/django-X.Y.txt

    # run the test suite
    # note that you must be in the django-cms directory when you do this,
    # otherwise you'll get "Template not found" errors
    cd django-cms
    python manage.py test


It can take a few minutes to run.

When you run tests against your own new code, don't forget that it's useful to
repeat them for different versions of Python and Django.


Problems running the tests
==========================

We are working to improve the performance and reliability of our test suite. We're aware of certain
problems, but need feedback from people using a wide range of systems and configurations in order
to benefit from their experience.

Please report any issues on our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/issues>`_.

If you can help *improve* the test suite, your input will be especially valuable.


OS X users
----------

In some versions of OS X, ``gettext`` needs to be installed so that it is
available to Django. If you run the tests and find that various tests in
``cms.tests.frontend`` raise errors, it's likely that you have this problem.

A solution is::

    brew install gettext && brew link --force gettext

(This requires the installation of `Homebrew <http://brew.sh>`_)

``ERROR: test_copy_to_from_clipboard (cms.tests.frontend.PlaceholderBasicTests)``
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may find that a single frontend test raises an error. This sometimes happens, for some users,
when the entire suite is run. To work around this you can invoke the test class on its own::

    manage.py test cms.PlaceholderBasicTests

and it should then run without errors.


``ERROR: zlib is required unless explicitly disabled using --disable-zlib, aborting``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you run into that issue, make sure to install zlib using Homebrew::

    brew install libjpeg zlib && brew link --force zlib


Advanced testing options
========================

Run ``manage.py test --help`` for the full list of advanced options.

Use ``--parallel`` to distribute the test cases across your CPU cores.

Use ``--failed`` to only run the tests that failed during the last run.

Use ``--retest`` to run the tests using the same configuration as the last run.

Use ``--vanilla`` to bypass the advanced testing system and use the built-in
Django test command.

To use a different database, set the ``DATABASE_URL`` environment variable to a
dj-database-url compatible value.


**********************
Running Frontend Tests
**********************

We have two types of frontend tests: unit tests and integration tests.
For unit tests we are using `Karma <http://karma-runner.github.io/>`_ as a
test runner and `Jasmine <http://jasmine.github.io/>`_ as a test framework.

Integration tests run on `PhantomJS <http://phantomjs.org/>`_ and are
built using `CasperJS <http://casperjs.org/>`_.

In order to be able to run them you need to install necessary dependencies as
outlined in :ref:`frontend tooling installation instructions <contributing_frontend>`.

Linting runs against the test files as well with ``gulp tests:lint``. In order
to run linting continuously, do::

    gulp watch


Unit tests
==========

Unit tests can be run like this::

    gulp tests:unit

If your code is failing and you want to run only specific files, you can provide
the ``--tests`` parameter with comma separated file names, like this::

    gulp tests:unit --tests=cms.base,cms.modal

If you want to run tests continuously you can use the watch command::

    gulp tests:unit:watch

This will rerun the suite whenever source or test file is changed.
By default the tests are running on `PhantomJS <http://phantomjs.org/>`_, but
when running Karma in watch mode you can also visit the server it spawns with an
actual browser.

    INFO [karma]: Karma v0.13.15 server started at http://localhost:9876/

On Travis CI we are using SauceLabs integration to run tests in a set of
different real browsers, but you can opt out of running them on saucelabs using
``[skip saucelabs]`` marker in the commit message, similar to how you would skip
the build entirely using ``[skip ci]``.

We're using Jasmine as a test framework and Istanbul as a code coverage tool.


Integration tests
=================

In order to run integration tests you'll have to install at least the version
of django CMS from the current directory and django-app-helper into into your virtualenv.
All commands should be run from the root of the repository. If you do not have
virtualenv yet, create and activate it first::

    virtualenv env
    . env/bin/activate

Then install minimum required dependencies::

    pip install -r test_requirements/django-1.8.txt
    pip install -e .

Now you'll be able to run a tests with this command::

    gulp tests:integration

The command will start a server, wait for a minute for the migrations to run
and will run integration tests against it.  It will use ``testdb.sqlite`` as the
database. If you want to start with a clean state you could use ``--clean``
argument.

Some tests require different server configuration, so it is possible that the
server will stop, and another variation will start with different arguments.
Take a look inside `testserver.py` if you need to customise the test server
settings.

While debugging you can use the ``--tests`` parameter as well in order to run test
suites separately.::

    gulp tests:integration --tests=pagetree
    gulp tests:integration --tests=loginAdmin,toolbar

If specified tests require different servers they will be grouped to speed
things up, so the order might not be the same as you specify in the argument.

When running locally, it sometimes helps to visualise the tests output. For that
you can install `casperjs visual debugging utility <https://github.com/vxsx/casperjs-visual-debugging>`_,
and run the tests with additional ``--visual`` argument. It will try to
communicate with the server and display the progress of the test, which you then
can also rewind.

It might sometimes be useful not to restart the server when creating the tests,
for that you can run ``python testserver.py`` with necessary arguments in one
shell and ``gulp tests:integration --no-server`` in another. However you would
need to clean the state yourself if the test you've been writing fails.

*************
Writing tests
*************

Contributing tests is widely regarded as a very prestigious contribution (you're
making everybody's future work much easier by doing so). We'll always accept contributions of
a test without code, but not code without a test - which should give you an idea of how important
tests are.


What we need
============

We have a wide and comprehensive library of unit-tests and integration tests
with good coverage.

Generally tests should be:

* Unitary (as much as possible). i.e. should test as much as possible only one
  function/method/class. That's the very definition of unit tests. Integration
  tests are interesting too obviously, but require more time to maintain since
  they have a higher probability of breaking.
* Short running. No hard numbers here, but if your one test doubles the time it
  takes for everybody to run them, it's probably an indication that you're doing
  it wrong.
* Easy to understand. If your test code isn't obvious, please add comments on
  what it's doing.

Code of Conduct
###############

Participation in the django CMS project is governed by a code of conduct.

The django CMS community is a pleasant one to be involved in for everyone, and
we wish to keep it that way. Participants are expected to behave and
communicate with others courteously and respectfully, whether online or in
person, and to be welcoming, friendly and polite.

We will not tolerate abusive behaviour or language or any form of harassment.

Individuals whose behaviour is a cause for concern will be given a warning, and
if necessary will be excluded from participation in official django CMS

How to upgrade to 3.9.0
***********************

We assume you are upgrading from django CMS 3.8.

Please make sure that your current database is consistent and in a healthy
state, and **make a copy of the database before proceeding further.**

Check your settings of `CMS_LANGUAGES` (if used), as it was ignored by default in preceding versions.
For more information, please see: https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/pull/6795

Then run::

    python manage.py migrate  # to ensure that your database is up-to-date with migrations
    python manage.py cms fix-tree

Check custom code and third-party applications for use of deprecated or removed functionality or
APIs (see above). Some third-party components may need to be updated.

Install the new version of django CMS from GitHub or via pip.

Run::

    python manage.py migrate

to apply the new migrations.

3.5.0 release notes
###################

This release of django CMS concentrates on usability and user-experience, by improving
its responsiveness while performing editing operations, particularly those that
involve updates to plugin trees.

It also continues our move to decouple logical layers in the system. Most significant in this
release is the new separation of the structure board from page rendering, which allows the
structure board to be updated without requiring the page to be re-rendered. This vastly
speeds up page editing, especially when dealing with complex plugin structures.

Another significant example is that the Page model has been decoupled from the site navigation
hierarchy. The navigation tree now exists independently, offering further speed advantages, as well
as future benefits for development and extensibility.

Our work to improve separation of concerns can also be seen in the renaming of publishing controls,
so that they no longer refer to specifically to pages. Ultimately, publishing actions could apply
to any kind of content, and this is a step in that direction.


*******************
What's new in 3.5.0
*******************

Improvements and new features
=============================

* structure board now decoupled from page rendering
* ``Page`` model decoupled from the site navigation
* Page copy between sites
* better behaviour of the language chooser for published/unpublished languages
* improved handling, refactored code for language fallbacks
* improved repr for ``Page``, ``Title``, ``Placeholder`` and ``CMSPlugin`` models
* generic publishing controls no longer refer to "page"
* improved documentation


Bug Fixes
=========

This release fixes:

* a Page template settings permission issue (failed to check for "Change advanced settings
  permission")
* a bug allowing Pages to be pasted without the correct translations for the target site
* a bug that prevented users from seeing the welcome screen when debug is off
* a bug allowing aliased plugins to render even if their host page was unpublished
* a bug where focusing inputs in modal would require two clicks in some browsers
* minor issues with initialisation of interface widgets.
* minor clipboard bugs


Removal of deprecated functionality
===================================

Previously deprecated functionality has been removed:

* Menu modules can no longer be named ``menus.py`` (use ``cms_menus.py``).
* The ``cms.utils.django_load.py`` module has been removed (in favour of standard Django helpers)
* Support for Django Reversion has been removed.
* The ``urls`` and ``menus`` attributes are no longer supported on ``CMSApp`` (apphook) classes.
  All apphook subclasses now need a ``get_urls()`` method. In addition, if your apphook has a
  ``menus`` attribute, that will need to be replaced by a ``get_menus()`` method.
* ``Page.revision_id`` has been removed
* Deprecated content creation wizard settings have been removed.


Backward-incompatible changes
=============================

* The home page is no longer automatically the root page in the tree (since there is no longer a
  page tree). Instead, the home page is set manually in the page list admin.
* Previously, ordered pages could be obtained via ``Page.object.order_by('path')``; the equivalent
  is now ``Page.object.order_by('node__path')``.
* Pages are no longer ordered by path. For ordering, use ``order_by('node__path')``.
* Pages no longer have a ``site`` field. Whereas previously you could use ``filter(site=id)``,
  now use ``filter(node__site==id)``.
* Pages no longer have a ``parent`` field. Instead a ``parent`` property now returns the new
  ``parent_page`` attribute, which relies on the node tree.
* Never-published pages can no longer have a 'pending' publishing state. A data migration,
  ``cms/migrations/0018_pagenode.py``, removes this.
* Using ``self.request.path`` or ``self.request.path_info`` in a ``CMSToolbar`` subclass method is
  no longer reliable and is discouraged. Instead, use ``self.toolbar.request_path``.


*********************
How to upgrade to 3.5

Page methods
============

The following methods have been removed from the ``Page`` model:

  This internal method was removed and replaced with ``revert_to_live``.


Placeholder utilities
=====================

Because of a performance issue with placeholder inheritance,
we've altered the return value for the following internal placeholder utility functions:

* ``cms.utils.placeholder._scan_placeholders``
  This will now return a list of ``Placeholder`` tag instances instead of a list of placeholder slot names.
  You can get the slot name by calling the ``get_name()`` method on the ``Placeholder`` tag instance.

* ``cms.utils.placeholder.get_placeholders``
  This will now return a list of ``DeclaredPlaceholder`` instances instead of a list of placeholder slot names.
  You can get the slot name by accessing the ``slot`` attribute on the ``DeclaredPlaceholder`` instance.

3.4.2 release notes
###################

django CMS 3.4.2 introduces two key new features: *Revert to live* for pages, and support for Django 1.10

*Revert to live* is in fact being reintroduced in a new form following a complete rewrite of our revision handling
system, that was removed in :ref:`django CMS 3.4 <upgrade-to-3.4>` to make possible a greatly-improved new
implementation from scratch.

*Revert to live* is the first step in fully re-implementing revision management on a new basis.

The full set of changes is listed below.

*******************
What's new in 3.4.2
*******************

Bug Fixes
=========

* Escaped strings in ``close_frame`` JS template.
* Fixed a bug with `text-transform` styles on inputs affecting CMS login
* Fixed a typo in the confirmation message for copying plugins from a different
  language
* Fixed a bug which prevented certain migrations from running in a multi-db setup.
* Fixed a regression which prevented the ``Page`` model from rendering correctly
  when used in a ``raw_id_field``.
* Fixed a regression which caused the CMS to cache the toolbar when ``CMS_PAGE_CACHE``
  was set to ``True`` and an anonymous user had ``cms_edit`` set to ``True`` on their session.
* Fixed a regression which prevented users from overriding content in an inherited
  placeholder.
* Fixed a bug affecting Firefox for Macintosh users, in which use of the Command key later followed by Return would
  trigger a plugin save.
* Fixed a bug where template inheritance setting creates spurious migration (see #3479)
* Fixed a bug which prevented the page from being marked as dirty (pending changes)
  when changing the value of the overwrite url field.
* Fixed a bug where the page tree would not update correctly when a sibling page was moved
  from left to right or right to left.

Improvements and new features
=============================

* Added official support for Django 1.10.
* Rewrote manual installation how-to documentation
* Re-introduced the "Revert to live" menu option.
* Added support for django-reversion >= 2 (see #5830)
* Improved the ``fix-tree`` command so that it also fixes non-root nodes (pages).
* Introduced placeholder operation signals.

Deprecations
============

* Removed the deprecated ``add_url()``, ``edit_url()``, ``move_url()``, ``delete_url()``, ``copy_url()`` properties of
  CMSPlugin model.
* Added a deprecation warning to method ``render_plugin()`` in class ``CMSPlugin``.
* Deprecated ``frontend_edit_template`` attribute of ``CMSPluginBase``.
* The ``post_`` methods in ```PlaceholderAdminMixin`` have been deprecated in favour of
  placeholder operation signals.

Other changes
=============

* Adjusted Ajax calls triggered when performing a placeholder operation (add plugin, etc..) to include
  a GET query called cms_path. This query points to the path where the operation originates from.
* Changed CMSPlugin.get_parent_classes() from method to classmethod.

3.4 release notes
#################

The most significant change in this release is the removal of revision support
(i.e. undo/redo/recover functionality on pages) from the core django CMS. This
functionality will be reinstated as an optional addon in due course, but in the
meantime, that functionality is not available.

.. _whats_new_3.4:

*****************
What's new in 3.4
*****************

* Changed the way CMS plugins are rendered. The HTML ``div`` with
  ``cms-plugin`` class is no longer rendered around every CMS plugin. Instead a
  combination of ``template`` tags and JavaScript is used to add event handlers
  and plugin data directly to the plugin markup. This fixes most of the
  rendering issues caused by the extra markup.
* Changed asset cache-busting implementation, which is now handled by a path change,
  rather than the ``GET`` parameter.
* Added the option to copy pages in the page tree using the drag and drop
  interface.
* Made it possible to use multi-table inheritance for Page/Title extensions.
* Refactored plugin rendering functionality to speed up loading time in both
  structure and content modes.
* Added a new ``Shift`` + ``Space`` shortcut to switch between structure and
  content mode while highlighting the current plugin, revealing its position.
* Improved keyboard navigation
* Added help modal about available short-cuts
* Added fuzzy matching to the plugin picker.
* Changed the ``downcast_plugins`` utility to return a generator instead of a
  list.
* Fixed a bug that caused an aliased placeholder to show in structure mode.
* Fixed a bug that prevented aliased content from showing correctly without
  publishing the page first.
* Added help text to an ``Alias`` plugin change form when attached to a page
  to show the content editor where the content is aliased from.
* Removed revision support from django CMS core.
  As a result both ``CMS_MAX_PAGE_HISTORY_REVERSIONS`` and ``CMS_MAX_PAGE_PUBLISH_REVERSIONS``
  settings are no longer supported, as well as the ``with_revision`` parameter
  in ``cms.api.create_page`` and ``cms.api.create_title``.
* In ``cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase`` methods ``get_child_classes`` and ``get_parent_classes`` now
  are implemented as a ``@classmethod``.

.. _backward_incompatible_3.4:

****************
Upgrading to 3.4
****************

A database migration is required because the default value of CMSPlugin.position was set to 0 instead of null.

Please make sure that your current database is consistent and in a healthy
state, and **make a copy of the database before proceeding further.**

Then run::

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py cms fix-tree


*****************************
Backward incompatible changes
*****************************

Apphooks & Toolbars
===================

As per our deprecation policy we've now removed the backwards compatible shim
for ``cms_app.py`` and ``cms_toolbar.py``.
If you have not done so already, please rename these to ``cms_apps.py`` and ``cms_toolbars.py``.


Permissions
===========

The permissions system was heavily refactored. As a result, several internal
functions and methods have been removed or changed.

Functions removed:

 * ``user_has_page_add_perm``
 * ``has_page_add_permission``
 * ``has_page_add_permission_from_request``
 * ``has_any_page_change_permissions``
 * ``has_auth_page_permission``
 * ``has_page_change_permission``
 * ``has_global_page_permission``
 * ``has_global_change_permissions_permission``
 * ``has_generic_permission``
 * ``load_view_restrictions``
 * ``get_any_page_view_permissions``


The following methods were changed to require a user parameter instead of a request:

 * ``Page.has_view_permission``
 * ``Page.has_add_permission``
 * ``Page.has_change_permission``
 * ``Page.has_delete_permission``
 * ``Page.has_delete_translation_permission``
 * ``Page.has_publish_permission``
 * ``Page.has_advanced_settings_permission``
 * ``Page.has_change_permissions_permission``
 * ``Page.has_move_page_permission``

These are also deprecated in favour of their counterparts in ``cms.utils.page_permissions``.

To keep consistency with both django CMS permissions and Django permissions,
we've modified the vanilla permissions system (``CMS_PERMISSIONS = False``)
to require users to have certain Django permissions to perform an action.

Here's an overview:

============ ==================================
Action       Permission required
============ ==================================
Add Page     Can Add Page & Can Change Page
Change Page  Can Change Page
Delete Page  Can Change Page & Can Delete Page
Move Page    Can Change Page
Publish Page Can Change Page & Can Publish Page
============ ==================================

This change will only affect non-superuser staff members.

.. warning::

    If you have a custom ``Page`` extension with a configured toolbar,
    please see the updated :ref:`example <complete_toolbar_api>`.
    It uses the new permission internals.


Manual plugin rendering
=======================

We've rewritten the way plugins and placeholders are rendered.
As a result, if you're manually rendering plugins and placeholders
you'll have to adapt your code to match the new rendering mechanism.

To render a plugin programmatically, you will need a context and request object.

.. warning:: Manual plugin rendering is not a public API, and as such it's subject to change without notice.

         ::

             from django.template import RequestContext
             from cms.plugin_rendering import ContentRenderer

             def render_plugin(request, plugin):
                 renderer = ContentRenderer(request)
                 context = RequestContext(request)
                 # Avoid errors if plugin require a request object
                 # when rendering.
                 context['request'] = request
                 return renderer.render_plugin(plugin, context)

Like a plugin, to render a placeholder programmatically, you will need a context and request object.


.. warning:: Manual placeholder rendering is not a public API, and as such it's subject to change without notice.

             ::

                 from django.template import RequestContext
                 from cms.plugin_rendering import ContentRenderer

                 def render_placeholder(request, placeholder):
                     renderer = ContentRenderer(request)
                     context = RequestContext(request)
                     # Avoid errors if plugin require a request object
                     # when rendering.
                     context['request'] = request
                     content = renderer.render_placeholder(
                        placeholder,
                        context=context,
                     )
                     return content

3.3 release notes
#################

django CMS 3.3 has been planned largely as a consolidation release, to build on the progress made
in 3.2 and pave the way for the future ones.

The largest major change is dropped support for Django 1.6 and 1.7, and Python 2.6 followed
by major code cleanup to remove compatibility shims.

.. _whats_new_3.3:

*****************
What's new in 3.3
*****************

* Removed support for Django 1.6, 1.7 and python 2.6
* Changed the default value of CMSPlugin.position to 0 instead of null
* Refactored the language menu to allow for better integration with many languages
* Refactored management commands completely for better consistency
* Fixed "failed to load resource" for favicon on welcome screen
* Changed behaviour of toolbar CSS classes: ``cms-toolbar-expanded`` class is only added now when toolbar is fully
  expanded and not at the beginning of the animation. ``cms-toolbar-expanding`` and ``cms-toolbar-collapsing`` classes
  are added at the beginning of their respective animations.
* Added unit tests for CMS JavaScript files
* Added frontend integration tests (written with Casper JS)
* Removed frontend integration tests (written with Selenium)
* Added the ability to declare cache expiration periods on a per-plugin basis
* Improved UI of page tree
* Improved UI in various minor ways
* Added a new setting CMS_INTERNAL_IPS for defining a set of IP addresses for which
  the toolbar will appear for authorized users. If left unset, retains the
  existing behaviour of allowing toolbar for authorized users at any IP address.
* Changed behaviour of sideframe; is no longer resizable, opens to 90% of the screen or 100% on
  small screens.
* Removed some unnecessary reloads after closing sideframe.
* Added the ability to make pagetree actions work on currently picked language
* Removed deprecated CMS_TOOLBAR_SIMPLE_STRUCTURE_MODE setting
* Introduced the method ``get_cache_expiration`` on CMSPluginBase to be used
  by plugins for declaring their rendered content's period of validity.
* Introduced the method ``get_vary_cache_on`` on CMSPluginBase to be used
  by plugins for declaring ``VARY`` headers.
* Improved performance of plugin moving; no longer saves all plugins inside the placeholder.
* Fixed breadcrumbs of recently moved plugin reflecting previous position in
  the tree
* Refactored plugin adding logic to no longer create the plugin before the user submits the form.
* Improved the behaviour of the placeholder cache
* Improved fix-tree command to sort by position and path when rebuilding positions.
* Fixed several regressions and tree corruptions on page move.
* Added new class method on CMSPlugin ``requires_parent_plugin``
* Fixed behaviour of ``get_child_classes``; now correctly calculates child classes when not
  configured in the placeholder.
* Removed internal ``ExtraMenuItems`` tag.
* Removed internal ``PluginChildClasses`` tag.
* Modified RenderPlugin tag; no longer renders the ``content.html`` template
  and instead just returns the results.
* Added a ``get_cached_template`` method to the ``Toolbar()`` main class to reuse loaded templates per request. It
  works like Django's cached template loader, but on a request basis.
* Added a new method ``get_urls()`` on the appbase class to get CMSApp.urls, to allow passing a page object to it.
* Changed JavaScript linting from JSHint and JSCS to ESLint
* Fixed a bug when it was possible to drag plugin into clipboard
* Fixed a bug where clearing clipboard was closing any open modal
* Added CMS_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER setting
* Renamed the CMS_WIZARD_* settings to CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_*
* Deprecated the old-style wizard-related settings
* Improved documentation further
* Improved handling of uninstalled apphooks
* Fixed toolbar placement when foundation is installed
* Fixed an issue which could lead to an apphook without a slug
* Fixed numerous frontend issues
* Added contribution policies documentation
* Corrected an issue where someone could see and use the internal placeholder plugin in the structure board
* Fixed a regression where the first page created was not automatically published
* Corrected the instructions for using the ``delete-orphaned-plugins`` command
* Re-pinned django-treebeard to >=4.0.1

.. _backward_incompatible_3.3:

****************
Upgrading to 3.3
****************

A database migration is required because the default value of CMSPlugin.position was set to 0 instead of null.

Please make sure that your current database is consistent and in a healthy state,
and **make a copy of the database before proceeding further.**

Then run::

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py cms fix-tree


Deprecation of Old-Style Page Wizard Settings
=============================================

In this release, we introduce a new naming scheme for the Page Wizard settings
that better reflects that they effect the CMS's Page Wizards, rather than all
wizards. This will also allow future settings for different wizards with a
smaller chance of confusion or naming-collision.

This release simultaneously deprecates the old naming scheme for these settings.
Support for the old naming scheme will be dropped in version 3.5.0.

Action Required
---------------

Developers using any of the following settings in their projects should rename
them as follows at their earliest convenience. ::

    CMS_WIZARD_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE => CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE
    CMS_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN => CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN
    CMS_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN_BODY => CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN_BODY
    CMS_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER => CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER

The CMS will accept both-schemes until 3.5.0 when support for the old scheme
will be dropped. During this transition period, the CMS prefers the new-style
naming if both schemes are used in a project's settings.


*****************************
Backward incompatible changes
*****************************

Management commands
===================

Management commands uses now argparse instead of optparse, following the Django deprecation
of the latter API.

The commands behaviour has remained untouched.

Detailed changes:

 * commands now use argparse subcommand API which leads to slightly different help output
   and other internal differences. If you use the commands by using Django's ``call_command``
   function you will have to adapt the command invocation to reflect this.
 * some commands have been rename replacing underscores with hyphens for consistency
 * all arguments are now non-positional. If you use the commands by using Django's
   ``call_command`` function you will have to adapt the command invocation to reflect this.


Signature changes
=================

The signatures of the toolbar methods ``get_or_create_menu`` have a new kwarg
``disabled`` *inserted* (not appended). This was done to maintain consistency with
other, existing toolbar methods. The signatures are now:

 * ``cms.toolbar.items.Menu.get_or_create_menu(key, verbose_name, disabled=False, side=LEFT, position=None)``
 * ``cms.toolbar.toolbar.CMSToolbar.get_or_create_menu(key, verbose_name=None, disabled=False, side=LEFT, position=None)``

It should only affect developers who use kwargs as positional args.

What's new in 3.2.5
*******************

.. note::

    This release is identical to 3.2.4, but had to be released also as 3.2.4 due
    to a Python wheel packaging issue.

Bug Fixes
=========

* Fix cache settings
* Fix user lookup for view restrictions/page permissions when using raw id field
* Fixed regression when page couldn't be copied if CMS_PERMISSION was False
* Fixes an issue relating to uninstalling a namespaced application
* Adds "Can change page" permission
* Fixes a number of page-tree issues the could lead data corruption under
  certain conditions
* Addresses security vulnerabilities in the `render_model` template tag that
  could lead to escalation of privileges or other security issues.
* Addresses a security vulnerability in the cms' usage of the messages framework
* Fixes security vulnerabilities in custom FormFields that could lead to
  escalation of privileges or other security issues.

.. important::

    This version of django CMS introduces a new setting:
    ``CMS_UNESCAPED_RENDER_MODEL_TAGS`` with a default value of `True`. This default
    value allows upgrades to occur without forcing django CMS users to do
    anything, but, please be aware that this setting continues to allow known
    security vulnerabilities to be present. Due to this, the new setting is
    immediately deprecated and will be removed in a near-future release.

    To immediately improve the security of your project and to prepare for
    future releases of django CMS and related addons, the project
    administrator should carefully review each use of the ``render_model``
    template tags provided by django CMS. He or she is encouraged to ensure
    that all content which is rendered to a page using this template tag is
    cleansed of any potentially harmful HTML markup, CSS styles or JavaScript.
    Once the administrator or developer is satisfied that the content is
    clean, he or she can add the "safe" filter parameter to the render_model
    template tag if the content should be rendered without escaping. If there
    is no need to render the content un-escaped, no further action
    is required.

    Once all template tags have been reviewed and adjusted where necessary,
    the administrator should set ``CMS_UNESCAPED_RENDER_MODEL_TAGS = False``
    in the project settings. At that point, the project is more secure and
    will be ready for any future upgrades.

*******************
What's new in 3.2.2
*******************

Improvements
============

- Substantial "under-the-hood" improvements to the page tree resulting in
  significant reduction of page-tree reloads and generally cleaner code
- Update jsTree version to 3.2.1 with slight adaptations to the page tree
- Improve the display and usability of the language menu, especially in cases
  where there are many languages
- Documentation improvements


Bug Fixes
=========

- Fix an issue relating to search fields in plugins
- Fix an issue where the app-resolver would trigger locales into migrations
- Fix cache settings
- Fix ToolbarMiddleware.is_cms_request logic
- Fix numerous Django 1.9 deprecations
- Numerous other improvements to overall stability and code quality


Model Relationship Back-References and Django 1.9
=================================================

Django 1.9 is lot stricter about collisions in the ``related_names`` of
relationship fields than previous versions of Django. This has brought to light
issues in django CMS relating to the private field ``CMSPlugin.cmsplugin_ptr``.
The issue becomes apparent when multiple packages are installed that provide
plugins with the same model class name. A good example would be if you have the
package ``djangocms-file`` installed, which has a poorly named CMSPlugin model
subclass called ``File``, then any other package that has a plugin with a
field named "file" would most likely cause an issue. Considering that
``djangocms-file`` is a very common plugin to use and a field name of "file" is
not uncommon in other plugins, this is less than ideal.

Fortunately, developers can correct these issues in their own projects while
they await improvements in django CMS. There is an internal field that is
created when instantiating plugins: ``CMSPlugin.cmsplugin_ptr``. This private
field is declared in the CMSPlugin base class and is populated on instantiation
using the lower-cased model name of the CMSPlugin subclass that is
being registered.

A subclass to ``CMSPlugin`` can declare their own ``cmsplugin_ptr`` field to
immediately fix this issue. The easiest solution is to declare this field with a
``related_name`` of "+". In typical Django fashion, this will suppress the
back-reference and prevent any collisions. However, if the back-reference is
required for some reason (very rare), then we recommend using the pattern
``%(app_label)s_%(class_name)s``. In fact, in version 3.3 of django CMS, this is
precisely the string-template that the reference setup will use to create the
name. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyPlugin(CMSPlugin):
        class Meta:
            app_label = 'my_package'

        cmsplugin_ptr = models.OneToOneField(
            CMSPlugin,
            related_name='my_package_my_plugin',
            parent_link=True
        )

        # other fields, etc.
        # ...

Please note that CMSPlugin.cmsplugin_ptr will remain a private field.


Notice of Upcoming Change in 3.3
================================

As outlined in the section immediately above, the pattern currently used to
derive a ``related_name`` for the private field ``CMSPlugin.cmsplugin_ptr`` may
result in frequent collisions. In django CMS 3.3, this string-template will be
changed to utilise both the ``app_label`` and the model class name. In the
majority of cases, this will not affect developers or users, but if your
project uses these back-references for some reason, please be aware of this
change and plan accordingly.


Treebeard corruption
====================

Prior to 3.2.1 moving or pasting nested plugins could lead to some non-fatal
tree corruptions, raising an error when adding plugins under the newly
pasted plugins.

To fix these problems, upgrade to 3.2.1 or later and then run
``manage.py cms fix-tree`` command to repair the tree.

django CMS 3.2 introduces touch-screen support, significant improvements to the structure-board,
and numerous other updates and fixes for the frontend. Behind the scenes, auto-reloading following
apphook configuration changes will make life simpler for all users.

.. warning:: Upgrading from previous versions

    3.2 introduces some changes that **require** action if you are upgrading
    from a previous version. Please read :ref:`upgrade-guide-3.2` for a step-by-step guide to the
    process of upgrading from 3.1 to 3.2.


*****************
What's new in 3.2
*****************

* New welcome page to help new users
* touch-screen support for most editing interfaces, for sizes from small tablets to table-top
  devices
* enhanced and polished user interface
* much-needed improvements to the structure-board
* enhancements to components such as the pop-up plugin editor, sideframe (now called the *overlay*)
  and the toolbar
* significant speed improvements on loading, HTTP requests and file sizes
* restarts are no longer required when changing apphook configurations
* a new content wizard system, adaptable to arbitrary content types


******************************
Changes that require attention
******************************

Touch interface support
=======================

For general information about touch interface support, see the :ref:`touch screen device notes
<touch>` in the documentation.

.. important::

    These notes about touch interface support apply only to the **django CMS admin and editing
    interfaces**. The visitor-facing published site is **wholly independent** of this, and the
    responsibility of the site developer. A good site should already work well for its visitors,
    whatever interface they use!

Numerous aspects of the CMS and its interface have been updated to work well with touch-screen
devices. There are some restrictions and warnings that need to be borne in mind.


Device support
--------------

Smaller devices such as most phones are too small to be adequately usable. For example, your Apple
Watch is sadly unlikely to provide a very good django CMS editing experience.

Older devices will often lack the performance to support a usefully responsive frontend
editing/administration interface.

There are some device-specific issues still to be resolved. Some of these relate to the CKEditor
(the default django CMS text editor). We will continue to work on these and they will be addressed
in a future release.

See :ref:`device-support` for information about devices that have been tested and confirmed to
work well, and about known issues affecting touch-screen device support.


Feedback required
-----------------

We've tested the CMS interface extensively, but will be very keen to have feedback from other users
- device reports, bug reports and general suggestions and opinions are very welcome.


Bug-fixes
=========

* An issue in which ``{% placeholder %}`` template tags ignored the ``lang`` parameter has been
  fixed.

  However this may affect the behaviour of your templates, as now a previously-ignored
  parameter will be recognised. If you used the ``lang`` parameter in these template tags you may
  be affected: check the behaviour of your templates after upgrading.


Content wizards
===============

:doc:`/reference/wizards` can help simplify production of content, and can be created to handle
non-CMS content too.

For a quick introduction to using a wizard as a content editor, see the user tutorial. 



Renaming cms_app, cms_toolbar, menu modules
===========================================

``cms_app.py``, ``cms_toolbar.py`` and ``menu.py`` have been renamed to
``cms_apps.py``, ``cms_toolbars.py`` and ``cms_menus.py`` for consistency.

Old names are still supported but deprecated; support will be removed in 3.4.


Action required
---------------

In your own applications that use these modules, rename ``cms_app.py`` to ``cms_apps.py``,
``cms_toolbar.py`` to ``cms_toolbars.py`` and ``menu.py`` to ``cms_menus.py``.


New ``ApphookReloadMiddleware``
===============================

Until now, changes to apphooks have required a restart of the server in order to take effect. A new
optional middleware class, :ref:`ApphookReloadMiddleware`, makes this automatic.


For developers
==============

Various improvements have been implemented to make developing with and for django CMS easier. These
include:

* improvements to frontend code, to comply better with `aldryn-boilerplate-bootstrap3
  <https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-boilerplate-bootstrap3>`_

* changes to directory structure for frontend related components such as JavaScript and SASS.

* We no longer use ``develop.py``; we now use ``manage.py`` for all development tasks. See
  :ref:`contributing_patch` for examples.

* We've moved our ``widgets.py`` JavaScript to ``static/cms/js/widgets``.


Code formatting
---------------

We've switched from tabs (in some places) to four spaces *everywhere*. See :ref:`contributing-code`
for more on formatting.


gulp.js
-------

We now use :ref:`gulp.js <js_linting>` for linting, compressing and bundling of frontend files.


Sass-related changes
--------------------

We now use `LibSass <https://github.com/sass/libsass>`_ rather than Compass for building static
files (this only affects frontend developers *of* django CMS - contributors to it, not other users
or developers). We've also adopted `CSSComb <http://csscomb.com>`_.


``.editorconfig`` file
----------------------

We've added a ``.editorconfig`` (at the root of the project) to provide cues to text editors.


Automated spelling checks for documentation
-------------------------------------------

Documentation is now checked for spelling. A ``make spelling`` command is available now when
working on documentation, and our `Travis Continuous Integration server
<https://travis-ci.com/django-cms/django-cms>`_ also runs these checks.

See the :ref:`spelling` section in the documentation.


New structure board
===================

The structure board is cleaner and easier to understand. It now displays its elements in a tree,
rather than in a series of nested boxes.

You can optionally enable the old appearance and behaviour with the
``CMS_TOOLBAR_SIMPLE_STRUCTURE_MODE`` setting (this option will be removed in 3.3).


Replaced the sideframe with an overlay
======================================

The sideframe that could be expanded and collapsed to reveal a view of the admin and other controls
has been replaced by a simpler and more elegant *overlay* mechanism.

The API documentation still refers to the ``sideframe``, because it is invoked in the same way, and
what has changed is merely the behaviour in the user's browser.

In other words, *sideframe* and the *overlay* refer to different versions of the same thing.


New startup page
================

A new startup mode makes it easier for users (especially new users) to dive straight into editing
when launching a new site.


************
Known issues
************

The `sub-pages of a page with an apphook will be unreachable
<https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/issues/4758>`_ (``404 page not found``), due to internal URL
resolution mechanisms in the CMS. Though it's unlikely that most users will need sub-pages of this
kind (typically, an apphooked page will create its own sub-pages) this issue will be addressed in a
forthcoming release.


*****************************
Backward-incompatible changes
*****************************

See the :ref:`Frontend code <contributing_frontend>` documentation.

There are no other known backward-incompatible changes.


.. _upgrade-guide-3.2:

*******************************
Upgrading django CMS 3.1 to 3.2
*******************************

Please note any changes that require action above, and take action accordingly.

A database migration is required (a new model, ``UrlconfRevision`` has been added as part of the
apphook reload mechanism):

Note also that any third-party applications you update may have their own migrations, so as always,
before upgrading, please make sure that your current database is consistent and in a healthy state,
and **make a copy of the database before proceeding further.**

Then run::

    python manage.py migrate

to migrate.

Otherwise django CMS 3.2 represents a fairly easy upgrade path.

********************
Pending deprecations
********************

In django CMS 3.3:

    Django 1.6, 1.7 and Python 2.6 will no longer be supported. If you still using these versions,
    you are strongly encouraged to begin exploring the upgrade process to a newer version.

    The ``CMS_TOOLBAR_SIMPLE_STRUCTURE_MODE`` setting will be removed.

.. _upgrade-to-3.1:

#################
3.1 release notes
#################

django CMS 3.1 has been planned largely as a consolidation release, to build on the progress made
in 3.0 and establish a safe, solid base for more ambitious work in the future.

In this release we have tried to maintain maximum backwards-compatibility, particularly for
third-party applications, and endeavoured to identify and tidy loose ends in the system wherever
possible.

.. warning:: Upgrading from previous versions

    3.1 introduces some changes that **require** action if you are upgrading
    from a previous version. Please read :ref:`upgrade-guide-3.1` for a step-by-step guide to the
    process of upgrading from 3.0 to 3.1.

*****************
What's new in 3.1
*****************

Switch from MPTT to MP
======================

Since django CMS 2.0 we have relied on MPTT (Modified Pre-order Tree Traversal) for efficiently
handling tree structures in the database.

In 3.1, `Django MPTT <https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt>`_ has been replaced by
`django-treebeard <https://github.com/django-treebeard/django-treebeard>`_, to improve performance and
reliability.

Over the years MPTT has proved not to be fast enough for big tree operations (>1000 pages); tree
corruption, because of transactional errors, has also been a problem.

django-treebeard uses MP (Materialised Path). MP is more efficient and has more error resistance
then MPTT. It should make working with and using django CMS better - faster and reliable.

Other than this, end users should not notice any changes.

.. note:: User feedback required

    We require as much feedback as possible about the performance of django-treebeard in this
    release. Please let us know your experiences with it, especially if you encounter any problems.

.. note:: Backward incompatible change

    While most of the low-level interface is very similar between ``django-mptt`` and
    ``django-treebeard`` they are not exactly the same. If any custom code needs to make use of the
    low-level interfaces of the page or plugins tree, please see the `django-treebeard
    documentation <http://django-treebeard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for information
    on how to use equivalent calls in ``django-treebeard``.

.. note:: Handling plugin data migrations

    Please check :ref:`plugin-datamigrations-3.1` for information on how to create
    migrations compatible with django CMS 3.0 and 3.1


Action required
---------------

Run :ref:`manage.py cms fix-mptt <fix-mptt>` before you upgrade.

Developers who use django CMS will need to run the schema and data migrations that are part of this
release. Developers of third-party applications that relied on the Django MPTT that shipped with
django CMS are advised to update their own applications so that they install it independently.

Dropped support for Django 1.4 and 1.5
======================================

Starting from version 3.1, django CMS runs on Django 1.6 (specifically, 1.6.9 and later) and 1.7.

.. warning:: Django security support

    Django 1.6 support is provided as an interim measure only. In accordance with the `Django
    Project's security policies <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/>`_, 1.6
    no longer receives security updates from the Django Project team. Projects running on Django
    1.6 have known vulnerabilities, so you are advised to upgrade your installation to 1.7 or 1.8
    as soon as possible.

Action required
---------------

If you're still on an earlier version, you will need to install a newer one, and make sure that
your third-party applications are also up-to-date with it before attempting to upgrade django CMS.

South is now an optional dependency
===================================

As Django South is now required for Django 1.6 only, it's marked as an optional dependency.

Action required
---------------

To install South along with django CMS use ``pip install django-cms[south]``.

Changes to PlaceholderAdmin.add_plugin
======================================

Historically, when a plugin was added to django CMS, a POST request was made to
the ``PlaceholderAdmin.add_plugin`` endpoint (and going back into very ancient
history before ``PlaceholderAdmin`` existed, it was ``PageAdmin.add_plugin``).
This would create an instance of ``CMSPlugin``, but not an instance of the
actual plugin model itself. It would then let the user agent edit the created
plugin, which when saved would put the database back in to a consistent state,
with a plugin instance connected to the otherwise empty and meaningless
``CMSPlugin``.

In some cases, "ghost plugins" would be created, if the process of creating the
plugin instance failed or were interrupted, for example by the browser window's
being closed.

This would leave orphaned ``CMSPlugin`` instances in the database without any
data. This could result pages not working at all, due to the resulting database
inconsistencies.

This issue has now been solved. Calling ``CMSPluginBase.add_plugin`` with a
GET request now serves the form for creating a new instance of a plugin. Then on
submitting that form via POST, the plugin is created in its entirety, ensuring
a consistent database and an end to ghost plugins.

However, to solve it some backwards incompatible changes to **non-documented
APIs** that developers might have used have had to be made.

CMSPluginBase permission hooks
------------------------------

Until now, ``CMSPluginBase.has_delete_permission``,
``CMSPluginBase.has_change_permission`` and
``CMSPluginBase.has_add_permission`` were handled by a single method, which
used an undocumented and unreliable property on ``CMSPluginBase`` instances
(or subclasses thereof) to handle permission management.

In 3.1, ``CMSPluginBase.has_add_permission`` is its own method that implements
proper permission checking for adding plugins.

If you want to work with those APIs, see the `Django documentation`_ for more
on the permission methods.


CMSPluginBase.get_form
----------------------

Prior to 3.1, this method would only ever be called with an actual instance
available.

As of 3.1, this method will be called without an instance (the ``obj`` argument
to the method will be ``None``) if the form is used to add a plugin, rather
than editing it. Again, this is in line with how Django's ``ModelAdmin`` works.

If you need access to the ``Placeholder`` object to which the plugin will be
added, the ``request`` object is *guaranteed* to have a ``placeholder_id`` key
in ``request.GET``, which is the primary key of the ``Placeholder`` object to
which the plugin will be added. Similarly, ``plugin_language`` in
``request.GET`` holds the language code of the plugin to be added.

CMSPlugin.add_view
------------------

This method used to never be called, but as of 3.1 it will be. Should you need
to hook into this method, you may want to use the
``CMSPluginBase.add_view_check_request`` method to verify that a request made to
this view is valid. This method will perform integrity and permission checks
for the GET parameters of the request.


Migrations moved
================

Migrations directories have been renamed to conform to the new standard layout:

 * Django 1.7 migrations: in the default ``cms/migrations`` and ``menus/migrations`` directories
 * South migrations: in the ``cms/south_migrations`` and ``menus/south_migrations`` directories

Action required
---------------

South 1.0.2 or newer is required to handle the new layout correctly, so make sure you have that
installed.

If you are upgrading from django CMS 3.0.x running on Django 1.7 you need to remove the old
migration path from `MIGRATION_MODULES
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/settings/#migration-modules>`_ settings.

Plugins migrations moving process
=================================

Core plugins are being changed to follow the new convention for the migration modules, starting
with **djangocms_text_ckeditor** 2.5 released together with django CMS 3.1.

Action required
---------------

Check the readme file of each plugin when upgrading to know the actions required.

Structure mode permission
=========================

A new :doc:`Can use Structure mode* permission </topics/permissions>` has been added.

Without this permission, a non-superuser will no longer have access to structure mode. This makes
possible a more strict workflow, in which certain users are able to edit content but not structure.

This change includes a data migration that adds the new permission to any staff user or group with
``cms.change_page`` permission.

Action required
---------------

You may need to adjust these permissions once you have completed migrating your database.

Note that if you have existing users in your database, but are installing django CMS and running
its migrations for the first time, you will need to grant them these permissions - they will not
acquire them automatically.

Simplified loading of view restrictions in the menu
===================================================

The system that loads page view restrictions into the menu has been improved, simplifying the
queries that are generated, in order to make it faster.

.. note:: User feedback required

    We require as much feedback as possible about the performance of this feature in this
    release. Please let us know your experiences with it, especially if you encounter any problems.

Toolbar API extension
=====================

The toolbar API has been extended to permit more powerful use of it in future development,
including the use of "clipboard-like" items.


Per-namespace apphook configuration
===================================

django CMS provides a new API to define namespaced :doc:`Apphook </how_to/apphooks>` configurations.

`Aldryn Apphooks Config <https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-apphooks-config>`_ has
been created and released as a standard implementation to take advantage
of this, but other implementations can be developed.

Improvements to the toolbar user interface
==========================================

Some minor changes have been implemented to improve the toolbar user interface.
The old **Draft/Live** switch has been replaced to achieve a more clear
distinction between page states, and **Edit** and **Save as draft** buttons are now
available in the toolbar to control the page editing workflow.

Placeholder language fallback default to True
=============================================

``language_fallback`` in :setting:`CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF` is ``True`` by default.


New template tags
=================

``render_model_add_block``
--------------------------

The family of :ref:`render_model <render_model_templatetags>` template tags that allow Django
developers to make any Django model editable in the frontend has been extended with
:ttag:`render_model_add_block`, which can offer arbitrary markup as the *Edit* icon (rather than
just an image as previously).

``render_plugin_block``
-----------------------

Some user interfaces have some plugins hidden from display in edit/preview mode.
:ttag:`render_plugin_block` provides a way to expose them for editing, and also more generally
provides an alternative means of triggering a plugin's change form.

Plugin table naming
===================

Old-style plugin table names (for example, ``cmsplugin_<plugin name>`` are no longer
supported. Relevant code has been removed.

Action required
---------------

Any plugin table name must be migrated to the standard (``<application name>_<table name>`` layout.

``cms.context_processors.media`` replaced by ``cms.context_processors.cms_settings``
====================================================================================

Action required
---------------

Replace the ``cms.context_processors.media`` with ``cms.context_processors.cms_settings`` in
``settings.py``.


.. _upgrade-guide-3.1:

*******************************
Upgrading django CMS 3.0 to 3.1
*******************************

Preliminary steps
=================

Before upgrading, please make sure that your current database is consistent and in a healthy state.

To ensure this, run two commands:

* ``python manage.py cms delete_orphaned_plugins``
* ``python manage.py cms fix-mptt``

**Make a copy of the database before proceeding further.**

Settings update
===============

* Change ``cms.context_processors.media`` to ``cms.context_processors.cms_settings`` in
  ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``.
* Add ``treebeard`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``, and remove ``mptt`` if not required by other
  applications.
* If using Django 1.7 remove ``cms`` and ``menus`` from ``MIGRATION_MODULES`` to support
  the new migration layout.
* If migrating from Django 1.6 and below to Django 1.7, remove ``south`` from ``installed_apps``.
* Eventually set ``language_fallback`` to ``False`` in :setting:`CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF` if you do
  not want language fallback behaviour for placeholders.

Update the database
===================

* Rename plugin table names, to conform to the new naming scheme (see above). **Be warned** that not
  all third-party plugin applications may provide these migrations - in this case you will need to
  rename the table manually. Following the upgrade, django CMS will look for the tables for these
  plugins under their new name, and will report that they don't exist if it can't find them.
* The migration for MPTT to ``django-treebeard`` is handled by the django CMS migrations,
  thus apply migrations to update your database::

    python manage.py migrate

             incorrect behaviour. Check your code for calls to these methods. Correctly

3.0.6 release notes
###################

*******************
What's new in 3.0.6
*******************

Django 1.7 support
==================

As of version 3.0.6 django CMS supports Django 1.7.

Currently our migrations for Django 1.7 are in ``cms/migrations_django`` to
allow better backward compatibility; in future releases the Django migrations
will be moved to the standard ``migrations`` directory, with the South
migrations in ``south_migrations``.

To support the current arrangement you need to add the following to your
``settings``::

    MIGRATION_MODULES = {
        'cms': 'cms.migrations_django',
        'menus': 'menus.migrations_django',
    }

.. warning:: **Applications migrations**

    **Any** application that defines a django CMS plugin or a model that uses a
    PlaceholderField or depends in any way on django CMS models **must** also
    provide Django 1.7 migrations.

Extended Custom User Support
============================

If you are using custom user models and use ``CMS_PERMISSION = True`` then be
sure to check that ``PageUserAdmin`` and ``PageUserGroup`` is still in working
order.

The ``PageUserAdmin`` class now extends dynamically from the admin class that
handles the user model. This allows us to use the same ``search_fields`` and
filters in ``PageUserAdmin`` as in the custom user model admin.

``CMSPlugin.get_render_template``
=================================

A new method on plugins, that returns the template during the render phase,
allowing you to change the template based on any plugin attribute or context
status. See :doc:`/how_to/custom_plugins` for more.

Simplified toolbar API for page extensions
==========================================

A simpler, more compact way to extend the toolbar for page extensions: :ref:`simplified_extension_toolbar`.

.. _upgrade-to-3.0.3:

###################
3.0.3 release notes
###################

*******************
What's new in 3.0.3
*******************

New Alias Plugin
================

A new Alias plugin has been added. You will find in your plugins and placeholders context menu in
structure mode a new entry called "Create alias". This will create a new Alias plugin in the clipboard
with a reference to the original. It will render this original plugin/placeholder instead. This
is useful for content that is present in more then one place.

New Context Menu API
====================

Plugins can now change the context menus of placeholders and plugins.
For more details have a look at the docs:

:ref:`extending_context_menus`


Apphook Permissions
===================

Apphooks have now by default the same permissions as the page they are attached to.
This means if a page has for example a login required enabled all views in the apphook
will have the same behaviour.

Docs on how to disable or customise this behaviour have a look here:

:ref:`apphook_permissions`

3.0 release notes
#################

*****************
What's new in 3.0
*****************

.. warning:: Upgrading from previous versions

    3.0 introduces some changes that **require** action if you are upgrading
    from a previous version.

.. note:: :ref:`See the quick upgrade guide <upgrading-from-2.4>`

New Frontend Editing
====================

django CMS 3.0 introduces a new frontend editing system as well as a
customisable Django admin skin (`djangocms_admin_style`_).

In the new system, ``Placeholders`` and their plugins are no longer managed in
the admin site, but only from the frontend.

In addition, the system now offer two editing views:

* **content** view, for editing the configuration and content of plugins.
* **structure** view, in which plugins can be added and rearranged.

Page titles can also be modified directly from the frontend.

.. _djangocms_admin_style: https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-admin-style

New Toolbar
===========

The toolbar's code has been simplified and its appearance refreshed. The
toolbar is now a more consistent management tool for adding and changing
objects. See :doc:`/how_to/toolbar`.

.. warning:: Upgrading from previous versions

    3.0 now requires the ``django.contrib.messages`` application for the
    toolbar to work.

New Page Types
==============

You can now save pages as page types. If you then create a new page you may
select a page type and all plugins and contents will be pre-filled.


Experimental Python 3.3 support
===============================

We've added experimental support for Python 3.3. Support for Python 2.5 has
been dropped.

Better multilingual editing
===========================

Improvements in the django CMS environment for managing a multi-lingual site
include:

* a built-in language chooser for languages that are not yet public.
* configurable behaviour of the admin site's language when switching between
  languages of edited content.

CMS_SEO_FIELDS
==============

The setting has been **removed**, along with the SEO fieldset in admin.

* ``meta_description`` field's max_length is now 155 for optimal Google
  integration.
* ``page_title`` is default on top.
* ``meta_keywords`` field has been removed, as it no longer serves any purpose.

CMS_MENU_TITLE_OVERWRITE
========================

New default for this setting is ``True``.

Plugin fallback languages
=========================

It's now possible to specify fallback languages for a placeholder if the placeholder
is empty for the current language. This must be activated in
:setting:`CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF` per placeholder. It defaults to ``False`` to
maintain pre-3.0 behaviour.

language_chooser
================

The ``language_chooser`` template tag now only displays languages that are
public. Use the toolbar language chooser to change the language to non-public
languages.

Undo and Redo
=============

If you have ``django-reversion`` installed you now have **undo** and **redo**
options available directly in the toolbar. These can now revert *plugin*
content as well as *page* content.

.. _ex-core-plugins:

Plugins removed
===============

We have removed plugins from the core. This is not because you are not
expected to use them, but because django CMS should not impose unnecessary
choices about what to install upon its adopters.

The most significant of these removals is ``cms.plugins.text``.

We provide ``djangocms-text-ckeditor``, a CKEditor-based Text Plugin. It's
available from https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-text-ckeditor. You may of
course use your preferred editor; others are available.

Furthermore, we removed the following plugins from the core and moved them into
separate repositories.

.. note::
    In order to update from the old ``cms.plugins.X`` to the new
    ``djangocms_X`` plugins, simply install the new plugin, remove the old
    ``cms.plugins.X`` from ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS`` and add the new one
    to it. Then run the migrations (``python manage.py migrate djangocms_X``).


File Plugin
-----------

We removed the file plugin (``cms.plugins.file``). Its new location is at:

* https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-file

As an alternative, you could also use the following (yet you will not be able
to keep your existing files from the old ``cms.plugins.file``!)

* https://github.com/divio/django-filer


Flash Plugin
------------

We removed the flash plugin (``cms.plugins.flash``). Its new location is at:

* https://github.com/divio/djangocms-flash


Googlemap Plugin
----------------

We removed the Googlemap plugin (``cms.plugins.googlemap``).
Its new location is at:

* https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-googlemap


Inherit Plugin
--------------

We removed the inherit plugin (``cms.plugins.inherit``).
Its new location is at:

* https://github.com/divio/djangocms-inherit


Picture Plugin
--------------

We removed the picture plugin (``cms.plugins.picture``).
Its new location is at:

* https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-picture


Teaser Plugin
-------------

We removed the teaser plugin (``cms.plugins.teaser``).
Its new location is at:

* https://github.com/divio/djangocms-teaser


Video Plugin
------------

We removed the video plugin (``cms.plugins.video``). Its new location is at:

* https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-video


Link Plugin
-----------

We removed the link plugin (``cms.plugins.link``). Its new location is at:

* https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-link


Snippet Plugin
--------------

We removed the snippet plugin (``cms.plugins.snippet``).
Its new location is at:

* https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-snippet

As an alternative, you could also use the following (yet you will not be able
to keep your existing files from the old ``cms.plugins.snippet``!)

* https://github.com/pbs/django-cms-smartsnippets

.. _cmsplugin-twitter-removed:

Twitter Plugin
--------------

Twitter disabled V1 of their API, thus we've removed the twitter plugin
(``cms.plugins.twitter``) completely.

For alternatives have a look at these plugins:

* https://github.com/nephila/djangocms_twitter
* https://github.com/changer/cmsplugin-twitter


Plugin Context Processors take a new argument
=============================================

:ref:`plugin-context-processors` have had an argument added so that the rest
of the context is available to them. If you have existing plugin context
processors you will need to change their function signature to add the extra
argument.

Apphooks
=========

Apphooks have moved from the title to the page model. This means you can no
longer have separate apphooks for each language. A new ``application instance name``
field has been added.

.. note::
    The reverse id is not used for the namespace any more. If you used
    namespaced apphooks before, be sure to update your pages and fill out the
    namespace fields.

If you use apphook apps with ``app_name`` for app namespaces, be sure to fill
out the instance namespace field ``application instance name`` as it's now
required to have a namespace defined if you use app namespaces.

For further reading about application namespaces, please refer to the Django
documentation on the subject at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/#url-namespaces

``request.current_app`` has been removed. If you relied on this, use the
following code instead in your views:


.. code-block::

    def my_view(request):
      current_app = resolve(request.path_info).namespace
      context = RequestContext(request, current_app=current_app)
      return render_to_response("my_templace.html", context_instance=context)

Details can be found in :ref:`multi_apphook`.

``PlaceholderAdmin``
====================

``PlaceholderAdmin`` now is deprecated. Instead of deriving from
``admin.ModelAdmin``, a new mixin class ``PlaceholderAdminMixin`` has been
introduced which shall be used together with ``admin.ModelAdmin``. Therefore
when defining a model admin class containing a placeholder, now add
``PlaceholderAdminMixin`` to the list of parent classes, together with
``admin.ModelAdmin``.

``PlaceholderAdmin`` doesn't have language tabs any more and the plugin editor
is gone. The plugin API has changed and is now more consistent. ``PageAdmin``
uses the same API as ``PlaceholderAdminMixin`` now. If your app talked with
the Plugin API directly be sure to read the code and the changed parameters.
If you use ``PlaceholderFields`` you should add the mixin
``PlaceholderAdminMixin`` as it delivers the API for editing the plugins and
the placeholders.

The workflow in the future should look like this:

1. Create new model instances via a toolbar entry or via the admin.
2. Go to the view that represents the model instance and add content via
   frontend editing.


Placeholder object permissions
==============================

In addition to model level permissions, ``Placeholder`` now checks if a user
has permissions on a specific object of that model. Details can be found here
in :ref:`placeholder_object_permissions`.

Placeholders are pre-fillable with default plugins
==================================================

In CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF, for each placeholder configuration, you can specify
via 'default_plugins' a list of plugins to automatically add to the
placeholder if empty. See :ref:`default_plugins in CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF <placeholder_default_plugins>`.

Custom modules and plugin labels in the toolbar UI
==================================================

It's now possible to configure module and plugins labels to show in the toolbar
UI. See :setting:`CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF` for details.

New ``copy-lang`` subcommand
============================

Added a management command to copy content (titles and plugins) from one
language to another.

The command can be run with::

    manage.py cms copy_lang from_lang to_lang

Please read :ref:`cms-copy-lang-command` before using.

Frontend editor for Django models
=================================

Frontend editor is available for any Django model; see
:ref:`documentation<frontend-editable-fields>` for details.

New ``Page related_name`` to ``Site``
=====================================

The ``Page`` object used to have the default ``related_name`` (``page``) to the
``Site`` model which may cause clashing with other Django apps; the
``related_name`` is now ``djangocms_pages``.

.. warning:: Potential backward incompatibility

    This change may cause you code to break, if you relied on ``Site.page_set``
    to access cms pages from a ``Site`` model instance: update it to use
    ``Site.djangocms_pages``

Moved all template tags to ``cms_tags``
=======================================

All template tags are now in the ``cms_tags`` namespace so to use any cms
template tags you can just do:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load cms_tags %}

``getter`` and ``setter`` for translatable plugin content
=========================================================

A plugin's translatable content can now be read and set through :meth:`~cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin.get_translatable_content()`
and :meth:`~cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin.set_translatable_content()`. See :ref:`Custom Plugins <custom-plugins>` for more info.

No more DB table-name magic for plugins
=======================================

Since django CMS 2.0 plugins had their table names start with `cmsplugin_`. We removed this behaviour
in 3.0 and will display a deprecation warning with the old and new table name. If your plugin uses
south for migrations create a new empty schema migration and rename the table by hand.

.. warning:: When working in the django shell or coding at low level, you **must**
             trigger the backward compatible behaviour (a.k.a. magical rename
             checking), otherwise non migrated plugins will fail.
             To do this execute the following code::

             >>> from cms.plugin_pool import plugin_pool
             >>> plugin_pool.set_plugin_meta()

             This code can be executed both in the shell or in your python
             modules.

Added support for custom user models
====================================

Since Django 1.5 it has been possible to swap out the default User model for a custom user model.
This is now fully supported by DjangoCMS, and in addition a new option has been added to the test
runner to allow specifying the user model to use for tests (e.g. ``--user=customuserapp.User``)

Page caching
============

Pages are now cached by default.
You can disable this behaviour with :setting:`CMS_PAGE_CACHE`

Placeholder caching
===================

Plugins have a new default property: `cache=True`. If all plugins in a placeholder have set this to
``True`` the whole placeholder will be cached if the toolbar is not in edit mode.

.. warning:: If your plugin is dynamic and processes current user or request data be sure to set ``cache=False``

Plugin caching
==============

Plugins have a new attribute: ``cache=True``. Its default value can be configured with :setting:`CMS_PLUGIN_CACHE`.

Per-page Clickjacking protection
================================

An advanced option has been added which controls, on a per-page basis, the
``X-Frame-Options`` header. The default setting is to inherit from the parent
page. If no ancestor specifies a value, no header will be set, allowing Django's
own middleware to handle it (if enabled).

CMS_TEMPLATE context variable
=============================

A new ``CMS_TEMPLATE`` variable is now available in the context: it contains the path to the
current page template.
See :ref:`CMS_TEMPLATE reference <page_template>` for details.


.. _upgrading-from-2.4:

******************
Upgrading from 2.4
******************

.. note::
    There are reports that upgrading the CMS from 2.4 to 3.0 may fail if
    Django Debug Toolbar is installed. Please remove/disable Django Debug
    Toolbar and other non-essential apps before attempting to upgrade, then
    once complete, re-enable them following the `"Explicit setup"
    <https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/installation.html#explicit-setup>`_
    instructions.

If you want to upgrade from version 2.4 to 3.0, there's a few things you need to do.
Start of by updating the cms' package::

    pip install django-cms==3.0


Next, you need to make the following changes in your ``settings.py``

* ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS``

    * Remove ``cms.plugin.twitter``. This package has been deprecated, see :ref:`cmsplugin-twitter-removed`.
    * Rename all the other ``cms.plugins.X`` to ``djangocms_X``, see :ref:`ex-core-plugins`.

* settings.CONTEXT_PROCESSORS

    * Replace ``cms.context_processors.media`` with ``cms.context_processors.cms_settings``

Afterwards, install all your previously renamed ex-core plugins (``djangocms-whatever``). Here's a
full list, but you probably don't need all of them::

    pip install djangocms-file
    pip install djangocms-flash
    pip install djangocms-googlemap
    pip install djangocms-inherit
    pip install djangocms-picture
    pip install djangocms-teaser
    pip install djangocms-video
    pip install djangocms-link
    pip install djangocms-snippet


Also, please check your templates to make sure that you haven't put the ``{% cms_toolbar %}`` tag into a ``{% block %}``
tag. This is not allowed in 3.0 any more.

To finish up, please update your database::

    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py migrate  (answer yes if your prompted to delete stale content types)

Finally, your existing pages will be unpublished, so publish them with the ``publisher`` command::

    python manage.py publisher_publish

That's it!

********************
Pending deprecations
********************

placeholder_tags
================

``placeholder_tags`` is now deprecated, the ``render_placeholder`` template
tag can now be loaded from the ``cms_tags`` template tag library.

Using ``placeholder_tags`` will cause a ``DeprecationWarning`` to occur.

``placeholder_tags`` will be removed in version 3.1.


cms.context_processors.media
============================

``cms.context_processors.media`` is now deprecated, please use
``cms.context_processors.cms_settings`` by updating ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``
in the settings

Using ``cms.context_processors.media`` will cause a ``DeprecationWarning`` to occur.

``cms.context_processors.media`` will be removed in version 3.1.

*****************
What's new in 2.4
*****************


.. _upgrade-to-2.4:

.. warning:: Upgrading from previous versions

    2.4 introduces some changes that **require** action if you are upgrading
    from a previous version.

    You will need to read the sections :ref:`migrations-upgrade` and
    :ref:`cms-moderator-upgrade` below.


Introducing Django 1.5 support, dropped support for Django 1.3 and Python 2.5
=============================================================================

Django CMS 2.4 introduces Django 1.5 support.

In django CMS 2.4 we dropped support for Django 1.3 and Python 2.5.
Django 1.4 and Python 2.6 are now the minimum required versions.


.. _migrations-upgrade:

Migrations overhaul
===================

In version 2.4, migrations have been completely rewritten to address issues
with newer South releases.

To ease the upgrading process, all the migrations for the `cms` application
have been consolidated into a single migration file, `0001_initial.py`.

*   migration 0001 is a *real* migration, that gets you to the same point migrations 0001-0036 used to
*   the migrations 0002 to 0036 inclusive still exist, but are now all *dummy*
    migrations
*   migrations 0037 and later are *new* migrations

How this affects you
--------------------

If you're starting with *a new installation*, you don't need to worry about
this. Don't even bother reading this section; it's for upgraders.

If you're using version *2.3.2 or newer*, you don't need to worry about this
either.

If you're using version *2.3.1 or older*, you will need to run a two-step
process.

First, you'll need to upgrade to 2.3.3, to bring your migration history
up-to-date with the new scheme. Then you'll need to perform the migrations for
2.4.

For the two-step upgrade process do the following in your project main directory::

    pip install django-cms==2.3.3
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py migrate
    pip install django-cms==2.4
    python manage.py migrate

Added delete orphaned plugins command
=====================================

Added a management command for deleting orphaned plugins from the database.

The command can be run with::

    manage.py cms delete_orphaned_plugins

Please read :ref:`cms-delete-orphaned-plugins-command` before using.

.. _cms-moderator-upgrade:

Added a check command
=====================

Added a management command to check your configuration and environment.

To use this command, simply run:

    manage.py cms check

This replaces the old at-runtime checks.

CMS_MODERATOR
=============
Has been removed since it is no longer in use. From 2.4 onward, all pages
exist in a public and draft version. Users with the ``publish_page`` permission
can publish changes to the public site.

.. admonition:: Management command required

    To bring a previous version of your site's database up-to-date, you'll
    need to run ``manage.py cms moderator on``. **Never run this command
    without first checking for orphaned plugins**, using the ``cms list
    plugins`` command. If it reports problems, run ``manage.py cms
    delete_orphaned_plugins``. Running ``cms moderator`` with orphaned plugins
    will fail and leave bad data in your database. See :ref:`cms-list-command`
    and :ref:`cms-delete-orphaned-plugins-command`.

    Also, check that all your plugins define a
    :meth:`~cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin.copy_relations()` method if required. You can do
    this by running ``manage.py cms check`` and read the *Presence of
    "copy_relations"* section. See :ref:`handling-relations` for guidance on
    this topic.


Added Fix MPTT Management command
=================================

Added a management command for fixing MPTT tree data.

The command can be run with::

    manage.py cms fix-mptt


Removed the MultilingualMiddleware
==================================

We removed the MultilingualMiddleware. This removed rather some unattractive
monkey-patching of the ``reverse()`` function as well. As a benefit we now
support localisation of URLs and apphook URLs with standard Django helpers.


For django 1.4 more information can be found here:

    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#internationalization-in-url-patterns

If you are still running django 1.3 you are able to achieve the same functionality with django-i18nurl. It is a backport
of the new functionality in django 1.4 and can be found here:

   https://github.com/brocaar/django-i18nurls


What you need to do:

- Remove ``cms.middleware.multilingual.MultilingualURLMiddleware`` from your
  settings.
- Be sure ``django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware`` is in your settings,
  and that it comes after the SessionMiddleware.
- Be sure that the ``cms.urls`` is included in a ``i18n_patterns``::

        from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns
        from django.contrib import admin
        from django.conf import settings
        from django.urls import *

        admin.autodiscover()

        urlpatterns = i18n_patterns('',
            re_path(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
            re_path(r'^', include('cms.urls')),
        )

        if settings.DEBUG:
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
            re_path(r'^media/(?P<path>.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve',
                    {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT, 'show_indexes': True}),
            re_path(r'', include('django.contrib.staticfiles.urls')),
        ) + urlpatterns

- Change your url and reverse calls to language namespaces. We now support the django way of
  calling other language urls either via ``{% language %}`` template tag or via ``activate("de")`` function call in views.

  Before::

        {% url "de:myview" %}

  After::

        {% load i18n %}{% language "de" %}
        {% url "myview_name" %}
        {% endlanguage %}

- reverse urls now return the language prefix as well. So maybe there is some code that adds language prefixes. Remove
  this code.

Added LanguageCookieMiddleware
==============================

To fix the behaviour of django to determine the language every time from new, when you visit `/` on a page, this
middleware saves the current language in a cookie with every response.

To enable this middleware add the following to your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` setting:

    `cms.middleware.language.LanguageCookieMiddleware`


CMS_LANGUAGES
=============

:setting:`CMS_LANGUAGES` has be overhauled. It is no longer a list of tuples like the ``LANGUAGES`` settings.

An example explains more than thousand words::

    CMS_LANGUAGES = {
            1: [
                {
                    'code': 'en',
                    'name': gettext('English'),
                    'fallbacks': ['de', 'fr'],
                    'public': True,
                    'hide_untranslated': True,
                    'redirect_on_fallback':False,
                },
                {
                    'code': 'de',
                    'name': gettext('Deutsch'),
                    'fallbacks': ['en', 'fr'],
                    'public': True,
                },
                {
                    'code': 'fr',
                    'name': gettext('French'),
                    'public': False,
                },
            ],
            2: [
                {
                    'code': 'nl',
                    'name': gettext('Dutch'),
                    'public': True,
                    'fallbacks': ['en'],
                },
            ],
            'default': {
                'fallbacks': ['en', 'de', 'fr'],
                'redirect_on_fallback':True,
                'public': False,
                'hide_untranslated': False,
            }
        }


For more details on what all the parameters mean please refer to the :setting:`CMS_LANGUAGES` docs.

The following settings are not needed any more and have been removed:

- `CMS_HIDE_UNTRANSLATED`
- `CMS_LANGUAGE_FALLBACK`
- `CMS_LANGUAGE_CONF`
- `CMS_SITE_LANGUAGES`
- `CMS_FRONTEND_LANGUAGES`

Please remove them from your ``settings.py``.

CMS_FLAT_URLS
=============

Was marked deprecated in 2.3 and has now been removed.



Plugins in Plugins
==================

We added the ability to have plugins in plugins. Until now only the TextPlugin supported this.
For demonstration purposes we created a MultiColumn Plugin. The possibilities for this are endless.
Imagine: StylePlugin, TablePlugin, GalleryPlugin etc.

The column plugin can be found here:

   https://github.com/divio/djangocms-column

At the moment the limitation is that plugins in plugins is only editable in the frontend.

Here is the MultiColumn Plugin as an example:


.. code-block::

    class MultiColumnPlugin(CMSPluginBase):
        model = MultiColumns
        name = _("Multi Columns")
        render_template = "cms/plugins/multi_column.html"
        allow_children = True
        child_classes = ["ColumnPlugin"]

There are 2 new properties for plugins:

**allow_children**

Boolean
If set to True it allows adding Plugins.

**child_classes**

List
A List of Plugin Classes that can be added to this plugin.
If not provided you can add all plugins that are available in this placeholder.

How to render your child plugins in the template
------------------------------------------------

We introduce a new template tag in the cms_tags called ``{% render_plugin %}``
Here is an example of how the MultiColumn plugin uses it::

    {% load cms_tags %}
    <div class="multicolumn">
    {% for plugin in instance.child_plugins %}
        {% render_plugin plugin %}
    {% endfor %}
    </div>

As you can see the children are accessible via the plugins children attribute.


New way to handle django CMS settings
=====================================

If you have code that needs to access django CMS settings (settings prefixed
with ``CMS_`` or ``PLACEHOLDER_``) you would have used for example
``from django.conf import settings; settings.CMS_TEMPLATES``. This will no
longer guarantee to return sane values, instead you should use
``cms.utils.conf.get_cms_setting`` which takes the name of the setting
**without** the ``CMS_`` prefix as argument and returns the setting.

Example of old, now deprecated style::

    from django.conf import settings

    settings.CMS_TEMPLATES
    settings.PLACEHOLDER_FRONTEND_EDITING

Should be replaced with the new API::

    from cms.utils.conf import get_cms_setting

    get_cms_setting('TEMPLATES')
    get_cms_setting('PLACEHOLDER_FRONTEND_EDITING')


Added ``cms.constants`` module
==============================

This release adds the ``cms.constants`` module which will hold generic django
CMS constant values. Currently it only contains ``TEMPLATE_INHERITANCE_MAGIC``
which used to live in ``cms.conf.global_settings`` but was moved to the new
``cms.constants`` module in the settings overhaul mentioned above.


django-reversion integration changes
====================================

`django-reversion`_ integration has changed. Because of huge databases after some time we introduce some changes
to the way revisions are handled for pages.

     1. Only publish revisions are saved. All other revisions are deleted when you publish a page.
     2. By default only the latest 25 publish revisions are kept. You can change this behaviour with the new
        :setting:`CMS_MAX_PAGE_PUBLISH_REVERSIONS` setting.


Changes to the show_sub_menu template tag
=========================================

The :ttag:`show_sub_menu` has received two new parameters.
The first stays the same and is still: how many levels of menu should be displayed.

The second: ``root_level`` (default=None), specifies at what level, if any, the menu should root at.
For example, if root_level is 0 the menu will start at that level regardless of what level the current page is on.

The third argument: ``nephews`` (default=100), specifies how many levels of nephews (children of siblings) are shown.


PlaceholderAdmin support i18n
=============================

If you use placeholders in other apps or models we now support more than one language out of the box.
If you just use ``PlaceholderAdmin`` it will display language tabs like the cms. If you
use `django-hvad`_ it uses the hvad language tabs.

If you want to disable this behaviour you can set ``render_placeholder_language_tabs = False`` on your Admin
class that extends PlaceholderAdmin. If you use a custom ``change_form_template`` be sure to have a look at
``cms/templates/admin/placeholders/placeholder/change_form.html`` for how to incorporate language tabs.


Added CMS_RAW_ID_USERS
======================

If you have a lot of users (500+) you can set this setting to a number after which admin User fields are displayed in
a raw Id field. This improves performance a lot in the admin as it has not to load all the users into the html.


******************************
Backwards incompatible changes
******************************

New minimum requirements for dependencies
=========================================

* Django 1.3 and Python 2.5 are no longer supported.


********************
Pending deprecations
********************

* ``simple_language_changer`` will be removed in version 3.0. A bug-fix makes
  this redundant as every non-managed URL will behave like this.

2.3.4 release notes

*******************
What's new in 2.3.4
*******************

WymEditor fixed
===============

2.3.4 fixes a critical issue with WymEditor that prevented it from load it's
JavaScript assets correctly.

Moved Norwegian translations
============================

The Norwegian translations are now available as ``nb``, which is the new
(since 2003) official language code for Norwegian, replacing the older and
deprecated ``no`` code.

If your site runs in Norwegian, you need to change your ``LANGUAGES`` settings!

Added support for time zones
============================

On Django 1.4, and with ``USE_TZ=True`` the django CMS now uses time zone aware
date and time objects.

Fixed slug clashing
===================

In earlier versions, publishing a page that has the same slug (URL) as another
(published) page could lead to errors. Now, when a page which would have the
same URL as another (published) page is published, the user is shown an error
and they're prompted to change the slug for the page.

Prevent unnamed related names for PlaceholderField
==================================================

:class:`cms.models.fields.PlaceholderField` no longer allows the related name
to be suppressed. Trying to do so will lead to a :exc:`ValueError`. This change
was done to allow the django CMS to properly check permissions on Placeholder
Fields.

Two fixes to page change form
=============================

The change form for pages would throw errors if the user editing the page does
not have the permission to publish this page. This issue was resolved.

Further the page change form would not correctly pre-populate the slug field if
``DEBUG`` was set to ``False``. Again, this issue is now resolved.

can be modified in the page admin or frontend editor.

Zoom level is now set via a select field which ensure only legal values are used.

.. warning:: Due to the above change, `level` field is now marked as `NOT NULL`,
    and a data migration has been introduced to modify existing Googlemap plugin
    instance to set the default value if `level` if is `NULL`.

Introducing Django 1.4 support, dropped support for Django 1.2
==============================================================

In django CMS 2.3 we dropped support for Django 1.2. Django 1.3.1 is now the
minimum required Django version. Django CMS 2.3 also introduces Django 1.4
support.


Lazy page tree loading in admin
===============================

Thanks to the work by Andrew Schoen the page tree in the admin now loads lazily,
significantly improving the performance of that view for large sites.


Toolbar isolation
=================

The toolbar JavaScript dependencies should now be properly isolated and no
longer pollute the global JavaScript namespace.


Plugin cancel button fixed
==========================

The cancel button in plugin change forms no longer saves the changes, but
actually cancels.


Tests refactor
==============

Tests can now be run using ``setup.py test`` or ``runtests.py`` (the latter
should be done in a virtualenv with the proper dependencies installed).

Check ``runtests.py -h`` for options.


Moving text plugins to different placeholders no longer loses inline plugins
============================================================================

A serious bug where a text plugin with inline plugins would lose all
the inline plugins when moved to a different placeholder has been fixed.


Minor improvements
==================

* The ``or`` clause in the ``placeholder`` tag now works correctly on non-cms
  pages.
* The icon source URL for inline plugins for text plugins no longer gets double
  escaped.
* ``PageSelectWidget`` correctly orders pages again.
* Fixed the file plugin which was sometimes causing invalid HTML (unclosed ``span`` tag).
* Migration ordering for plugins improved.
* Internationalised strings in JavaScript now get escaped.


******************************
Backwards incompatible changes
******************************

New minimum requirements for dependencies
=========================================

* ``django-reversion`` must now be at version 1.6
* ``django-sekizai`` must be at least at version 0.6.1
* ``django-mptt`` version 0.5.1 or 0.5.2 is required

Registering a list of plugins in the plugin pool
================================================
This feature was deprecated in version 2.2 and removed in 2.3. Code like this
will not work any more::

    plugin_pool.register_plugin([FooPlugin, BarPlugin])

Instead, use multiple calls to ``register_plugin``::

    plugin_pool.register_plugin(FooPlugin)
    plugin_pool.register_plugin(BarPlugin)


********************
Pending deprecations
********************

The ``CMS_FLAT_URLS`` setting is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.4.
The moderation feature (``CMS_MODERATOR = True``) will be deprecated in 2.4 and
replaced with a simpler way of handling unpublished changes.

#################
2.2 release notes
#################

*****************
What's new in 2.2
*****************

``django-mptt`` now a proper dependency
=======================================

`django-mptt`_ is now used as a
proper dependency and is no longer shipped with the django CMS. This solves the
version conflict issues many people were experiencing when trying to use the django CMS
together with other Django apps that require django-mptt. django CMS 2.2
requires django-mptt 0.5.1.

.. warning::

    Please remove the old ``mptt`` package from your Python site-packages
    directory before upgrading. The ``setup.py`` file will install the
    `django-mptt`_ package as an external dependency!

.. _django-mptt: https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/


Django 1.3 support
==================

The django CMS 2.2 supports both Django 1.2.5 and Django 1.3.


View permissions
================

You can now give view permissions for django CMS pages to groups and users.

.. _backwards-incompatible-changes:

******************************
Backwards incompatible changes
******************************

``django-sekizai`` instead of PluginMedia
=========================================

Due to the sorry state of the old plugin media framework, it has been dropped in
favour of the more stable and more flexible django-sekizai, which is a new
dependency for the django CMS 2.2.

The following methods and properties of :class:`cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase`
are affected:

* ``cms.plugins_base.CMSPluginBase.PluginMedia``
* ``cms.plugins_base.CMSPluginBase.pluginmedia``
* ``cms.plugins_base.CMSPluginBase.get_plugin_media``

Accessing those attributes or methods will raise a
``cms.exceptions.Deprecated`` error.

The ``cms.middleware.media.PlaceholderMediaMiddleware`` middleware was also
removed in this process and is therefore no longer required. However you are now
required to have the ``sekizai.context_processors.sekizai`` context processor
in your ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`` setting.

All templates in :setting:`CMS_TEMPLATES` must at least contain the ``js`` and
``css`` sekizai namespaces.

Please refer to the documentation on :ref:`custom-plugins-handling-media` in
custom CMS plugins and the
`django-sekizai documentation <https://django-sekizai.readthedocs.io/>`_ for
more information.


Toolbar must be enabled explicitly in templates
===============================================

The toolbar no longer hacks itself into responses in the middleware, but rather
has to be enabled explicitly using the ``{% cms_toolbar %}`` template tag from
the ``cms_tags`` template tag library in your templates. The template tag
should be placed somewhere within the body of the HTML (within ``<body>...</body>``).

This solves issues people were having with the toolbar showing up in places it
shouldn't have.


Static files moved to /static/
==============================

The static files (CSS/JavaScript/images) were moved from ``/media/`` to
``/static/`` to work with the new ``django.contrib.staticfiles`` app in Django
1.3. This means you will have to make sure you serve static files as well as
media files on your server.

.. warning::

    If you use Django 1.2.x you will not have a ``django.contrib.staticfiles``
    app. Instead you need the `django-staticfiles`_ backport.


**************************
Features deprecated in 2.2
**************************

``django-dbgettext`` support
============================

The django-dbgettext support has been fully dropped in 2.2 in favour of the
built-in multi-lingual support mechanisms.

####################################
Who is behind django CMS
####################################

django CMS was released under a BSD licence in 2009. It was created at `Divio AG <https://www.divio.com/>`_
of Z√ºrich, Switzerland, by `Patrick Lauber <https://github.com/digi604/>`_, who led its development for several
years.

*****************************
the django CMS Association
*****************************

In July 2020 Divio handed over the banner to the newly founded
`django CMS Association <https://www.django-cms.org/en/about-us/>`_ (dCA). Its
goal is to drive the success of django CMS, by increasing customer happiness,
market share and open-source-contributions. Divio remains thoroughly committed
to django CMS as the host of the `django CMS project website <https://www.django-cms.org/>`_
and as one of the founding members of the dCA, next to `What <https://what.digital/>`_. and
`Eliga Services <https://eliga.services/>`_.

The dCA‚Äôs role in steering the project‚Äôs development is formalised in the
`django CMS technical committee <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-mgmt/blob/master/tech-committee/about.md>`_,
whose members are drawn from the django CMS community and the dCA.

The dCA maintains overall control of the `django CMS repository <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms>`_.
As the chief backer of django CMS, and in order to ensure a consistent and
long-term approach to the project, the dCA reserves the right of final say in
any decisions concerning its development.

As a non-profit organization the django CMS Association is dependent on
donations to fulfill its mission, which is based on the following three statements:

* Innovate and lead
* Foster contribution
* Drive adoption

The best way to donate is to become a member of the association and pay
membership fees. The funding is funneled back into core development and
community projects.

* `Sign up for more information about becoming a member of the dCA <https://www.django-cms.org/en/sign-up/>`_
