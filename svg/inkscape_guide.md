**Abstract**

_Inkscape, Guide to a Vector Drawing Program_ is **_the guide_** to the Inkscape program. The web-based version is linked directly under the program's Help menu. This book is both an introduction and reference for the Inkscape drawing program. With Inkscape, one can produce a wide variety of art, from photo-realistic drawings to organizational charts. Inkscape uses _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_, a powerful vector-based drawing language and W3C web standard, as its native format. _SVG_ drawings can be directly viewed by all the major web browsers including Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome and Edge. With the advent of _[HTML5](#html5 "HyperText Markup Language, Version 5")_, _SVG_ is easily embedded in web pages. Inkscape is available free for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems.

The first third of the book is devoted to eight tutorials that progress in difficulty from very basic to very complex (three additional tutorials were written explicitly for the PDF and print versions). The remainder of the book covers each facet of Inkscape in detail. Updated for Inkscape v0.92 and v0.93, the book includes complete coverage of new features including: new Mesh tool, updated Text tool with font features, and many new extensions. Advance topics covered include the use of Inkscape's powerful tiling tool, built-in bitmap tracing, and _SVG_ use on the Web including in _HTML5_. The book includes plenty of tips (and warnings) about the use of Inkscape and _SVG_.

*   [Help]

This book serves as both a textbook and a reference for using Inkscape to produce high-quality drawings. It includes a series of tutorials followed by chapters that cover completely each facet of the Inkscape program. The book is full of tips and notes to enable the user to make the best use of the program.

Inkscape is an open source, _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_\-based\[[1](#ftn.idm140091256532208)\] vector drawing program. It is useful for drawing:

*   Illustrations for the Web
    
*   Graphics for mobile phones
    
*   Simple line drawings
    
*   Cartoons
    
*   Complex works of art
    
*   Figures for articles and books
    
*   Organization charts
    

The file format that Inkscape uses is compact and quickly transmittable over the Internet. Yet it is powerful and can describe complex drawings that are scalable to any size. As part of HTML5, all major browsers support direct rendering of SVG.

Inkscape supports the drawing of regular shapes (rectangles, circles, etc.), arbitrary paths, and text. These _objects_ can be given a wide variety of attributes such as color, gradient or patterned fills, alpha blending, and markers. Objects can be transformed, cloned, and grouped. Hyperlinks can be added for use in web browsers. The Inkscape program aims to be fully _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_, _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_, and _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ compliant.

Inkscape is available prepackaged for the Windows, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems. The program and its source code are freely available. They can be obtained from the Inkscape [website](http://www.inkscape.org/).

Inkscape is undergoing very rapid development with new features being added and compliance to the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard being constantly improved. This manual documents versions 0.92 and 0.93.

========================================================

How to Use This Book
--------------------

Following this introduction, there is a set of tutorials. The tutorials are designed to cover the basics of all the important features found in Inkscape and to lead the reader from the beginning to end of the drawing process.

The bulk of the book is devoted to a detailed discussion of all of Inkscape's features, including examples of solving common drawing problems. Both the strengths and weaknesses of Inkscape are pointed out.

Depending on one's background, one may use the book as a reference or read the book from front to back. In general, the more fundamental topics are covered first. Novices are encouraged to work through each of the tutorials sitting in front of their computer. At the end of the book are a few drawing challenges.

Conventions:

*   _Click_: Click on icon, object, and so forth with the **Left Mouse** button (unless another mouse button is indicated) with immediate release.
    
*   _Click-drag_: Click on icon, object, and so forth with the **Left Mouse** button (unless another mouse button is indicated) and hold the button down while moving the mouse.
    
*   Select the option in the pull-down menu. Example: File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-properties.png)Document Properties... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**D****): Select “Document Properties...” under the “File” pull-down menu. **Shift**+**Ctrl**+**D** is the keyboard shortcut corresponding to this option.
    

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

One-button Mice

Users of one-button mice might want to upgrade to a multi-button mouse. Inkscape makes good use of a three-button mouse with a scroll wheel. (Inkscape also makes good use of graphics tablets.) In the meantime, the button on a one-button mouse corresponds to the **Left Mouse** button.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Icons

The icons used in this book are in general those provided by Inkscape's default icon theme. Some icons, however, are provided by the operating system. It is possible that the icons you see in your version of Inkscape are different depending upon the source of your version. Regardless of what icons are used, the functionality remains the same.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Book Website

The book has a [website](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/) with some _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ examples and tests as well as graphics for use with the tutorials.


http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/Introduction-VectorGraphics.html
========================================================

Vector Graphics
---------------

There are two basic types of graphic images: _bitmap_ (or _raster_) images and _vector_ images. In the first case, the image is defined in terms of rows and columns of individual pixels, each with its own color. In the second case, the image is defined in terms of lines, both straight and curved. A single straight line is described in terms of its two end points. The difference in these types of graphic images becomes readily apparent when a drawing is enlarged.

![Lines](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/INTRO/Lines.png)

The same line is shown on the left and right. On the left it is displayed as a bitmap image, while on the right it is displayed as a vector. In both cases, the line has been scaled up by a factor of four from its nominal size.

When the bitmap resolution of a drawing matches the display resolution, the objects in the drawing look smooth.

![Three person line drawing.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/INTRO/ThreePeoplex2.png)

The same drawing, but defined as a bitmap image on the left and a vector image on the right. If the output device has the same resolution as the bitmap image, there is little difference between the appearance of the two images.

If the bitmap resolution is significantly less than the display resolution, the display will show jagged lines.

![Three person line drawing, one head only.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/INTRO/ThreePeople_Headx2.png)

The head of the gentleman in the above drawings has been scaled up by a factor of five. Now one can see a difference in the quality of the bitmap drawing (left) and the vector drawing (right). Note that the bitmap image uses _anti-aliasing_, a method of using grayscale to attempt to smooth the drawing.

All output devices, with few exceptions, use a raster or bitmap image to display graphics.\[[2](#ftn.idm140091255198640)\] The real difference between drawing with bitmap graphics and vector graphics is the point at which the image is converted into a bitmap. In the case of vector graphics, this conversion is done at the very last step before display, ensuring that the final image matches exactly the resolution of the output device.

  

* * *

\[[2](#idm140091255198640)\] The few vector output devices include large plotters for engineering and architectural drawings and archaic Tektronix terminals.


http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/Introduction-SVG.html
========================================================
* * *

SVG
---

_[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ stands for _Scalable Vector Graphics_. _Scalable_ refers to the notion that a drawing can be scaled to an arbitrary size without losing detail.

_Scalable_ also refers to the idea that a drawing can be composed of an unlimited number of smaller parts, parts that can be reused many times.

The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard is directed toward a complete description of two-dimensional graphics, including animation in an _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ (eXtensible Markup Language) format. _XML_ is an open standard for describing a document in a way that can be easily extended and is resistant to future changes in the document specification. A drawing saved in one version of _SVG_ by one version of a drawing program should be viewable, to the full extent possible, by any previous or future version of any drawing program that adheres to the _SVG_ standard. If a program doesn't support something in the _SVG_ standard, it should just skip over any part of a drawing that uses it, rendering the rest correctly.

_[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files are small, and drawings described by the standard adapt well to different presentation methods. This has led to great interest in the standard. Support is included in all major web browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Edge.


http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/Introduction-TheProgram.html
========================================================

The Inkscape Program
--------------------

Inkscape has its roots in the program Gill (GNOME Illustrator application) created by [Raph Levian](http://www.levien.com/) of Ghostscript fame. This project was expanded on by the [Sodipodi](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sodipodi) program. A different set of goals led to the split-off of the current Inkscape development effort.

The goal of the writers of Inkscape is to produce a program that can take full advantage of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard. This is not a small task. A link to the road map for future development can be found on the Inkscape [website](http://www.inkscape.org/). Of course, you are welcome to contribute!

Instructions on installing Inkscape can be found on the Inkscape website. Full functionality of Inkscape requires additional _helper_ programs to be installed, especially for _[importing]( "Importing Files")_ and _[exporting]( "Exporting Files")_ files in different graphic formats. Check the log file `extensions-errors.log` located on Linux at `~/.config/inkscape/` and on Windows at `%userprofile%\Application Data\Inkscape\` for missing programs.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Inkscape on the Mac

Inkscape version 0.92 uses GTK 2 which requires the XQuartz, the _X11_\-window layer. This is normally included in OS X 10.7 and earlier versions (if not already installed it is available on the installation disks). Since 10.8, Apple no longer includes XQuartz by default with OS X and one will need to download it. (The system will notify you where to download XQuartz the first time you try to use Inkscape.) The non-native interface lacks the look and feel of “normal” Mac programs. Fear not, it will still work, although starting Inkscape may take a bit longer than other programs, especially the first time.

As of version 0.93, Inkscape uses GTK 3 which includes a native OS X backend.

A number of the keyboard shortcuts may also not work out of the box. You can consult the [Mac OS X section of the Inkscape FAQ](https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#mac-os-x-specific-issues) for how to get the **Alt** keys to work properly and for other Mac related issues.

========================================================

The Anatomy of the Inkscape Window
----------------------------------

_Updated for v0.92._

Start by opening Inkscape. You will see a single window. This window contains several major areas, many containing clickable icons or pull-down menus. The following figure shows this window and labels key parts.

Some of the bars change position depending on which option is selected at the bottom of the View menu. When _Default_ is selected, the _Command Bar_ is on the top while the _Snap Bar_ is on the right. When _Custom_ is selected, the _Command Bar_ and the _Snap Bar_ are both on the top. When _Wide_ is selected, the _Command Bar_ and the _Snap Bar_ are both on the right (as shown in figure). By default, _Default_ is used if you are not using a “Wide Screen” display while _Wide_ is used if you are. A width to height aspect ratio of greater than 1.65 is defined to be wide. These bars, as well as the _[Palette](#palette)_ and _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_, can be hidden using the View → Show/Hide submenu.

As Inkscape has grown more complex, the area required to include icons and entry boxes for all the various items has also grown leading to problems when Inkscape is used on small screens. The _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_, _[Snap Bar](#snapbar)_, _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_, and _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_ have variable widths or heights. If there are too many items to be shown in the width (height) of the Inkscape window, a small triangle will appear on the right side or bottom of the bars. Clicking on this triangle will open a drop-down menu with access to the missing items.

One can also choose to use smaller or larger icons. These options can be found in the _Interface_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. Note that the _Secondary toolbar icon size_ refers to the _[Snap Bar](#snapbar)_. Using the smallest icons, the smallest possible Inkscape window becomes 510 pixels wide by 429 pixels high in v0.92. The smallest size may depend on which operating system you are using and the availability of a small icon set. By hiding all the various window components (_[Command Bar](#commandbar)_, _[Palette](#palette)_, etc. via View → Show/Hide), you can get an Inkscape window just 510 pixels wide by 284 pixels high.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Icons in Menus

Icons in drop-down menus and buttons have been deprecated for some time in the Gnome windowing system used by Inkscape. If you wish to restore them, you can try two options:

Use the program `gconf-editor` or “Configuration Editor” (which you may need to install). Navigate to `desktop` → `gnome` → `interface` and check the “menus\_have\_icons” box. You can also check the “buttons\_have\_icons” box if you wish.) (Note, with recent versions of Gnome, this no longer seems to work.)

Use the command line option: `gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings overrides "{'Gtk/ButtonImages': <1>, 'Gtk/MenuImages': <1>}"` .

![Default Inkscape window.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/ANATOMY/anatomy01.png)

The default Inkscape window with the key parts labeled.

Canvas

The drawing area. It may extend outside the viewable area. It can be [panned]( "Panning the Canvas") (scrolled left/right and up/down) and [zoomed]( "Zooming the Canvas"). In v0.93, the _Canvas_ can also be [rotated]( "Rotating the Canvas") and [flipped]( "Flipping the Canvas").

Page

The part of the _Canvas_ area corresponding to a printed page or other predefined area. Useful for setting an output region in printing or exporting a bitmap image. It may extend outside the viewable area.\[[3](#ftn.idm140091262199936)\]

Menu Bar

Contains the main pull-down menus.

Command Bar

Contains shortcuts to many of the items located in the menus. Click on the _Triangle_ on the right end to access entries missing due to space.

Snap Bar

Contains clickable icons that control snapping. See [the section called “Snapping”] in [Chapter 5, _Positioning and Transforming_]( "Chapter 5. Positioning and Transforming").

Tool Controls

Contains entry boxes and clickable icons that are specific to the selected tool. For example, when the _[Rectangle Tool]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ is in use, an entry box to specify a selected rectangle's width appears. Click on the _Triangle_ on the right end to access entries that may be missing due to space. If there is no arrow, then all options are being shown.

Tool Box

Contains “Tools” for selecting, drawing, or modifying objects. Clicking on an icon selects a tool. Double-clicking brings up that tool's preference dialog. The cursor (pointer) changes shape when placed over the _Canvas_ depending on which tool is selected.

Available tools:

Color Palette

Contains a color palette. Colors can be dragged from the palette onto objects to change their _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_. Using the **Shift** key while dragging will change the _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color instead. The color used by some tools can be set by clicking on a color swatch. The palette can be changed by clicking on the arrow icon at the right end of the palette. Many predefined palettes are included. If the number of color swatches in a palette exceeds the space allocated, the scroll bar beneath the palette can be used to access the hidden swatches. Use **Shift**+**Shift**+**P** to toggle visibility on/off.

Status Bar

Contains several areas, including the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_, current drawing layer, pointer position, current drawing layer (and if it is visible or locked), current zoom level, window resize handle, and a _[Notification Region](#notification)_ that describes context dependent options.

Style Indicator

Shows the style (_[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_) of a selected object, text fragment, or gradient stop. A **Left Mouse Click** on the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ part of the indicator opens the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog. A **Right Mouse Click** opens up a pop-up menu. See [the section called “Style Indicator”](#Attributes-Color-StyleIndicator "Style Indicator") in [Chapter 10, _Attributes_]( "Chapter 10. Attributes") for details and more uses.

Notification Region

Contains context dependent information. If the region is too small to view all the text, placing the cursor over the region will display a _[tool tip](#tooltip "tool tip")_ with the full text.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Notification Region

The _[Notification Region](#notification)_ contains very useful information. Pay close attention to it when using an unfamiliar tool.

Rulers

Show the _x_\- and _y_\-axis coordinates of the drawing. Use **Ctrl**+**R** to toggle visibility on/off. A **Left Mouse Drag** from a _[Ruler](#rulers)_ onto the _Canvas_ creates a _[Guide Line](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_.

Scroll Bars

Allows scrolling to adjust which part of the _Canvas_ is viewable. Use **Ctrl**+**B** to toggle visibility on/off.

Color Calibration

Button toggles on/off use of a [_Color Profile_](#ColorProfile) (if set up).

### Dockable Dialogs

Inkscape implements _Dockable Dialogs_. With this feature, opened dialogs are placed inside the main Inkscape window on the right side as seen in the next figure.

![Main window with two docked dialogs.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/ANATOMY/anatomy02_docked.png)

The Inkscape main window with two docked dialogs.

The docked dialogs can be rearranged, resized (if space permits), stacked, and iconified. To move a dialog, **Left Mouse Drag** in the dialog's title bar (and not the window manager's bar). Dialogs can also be dragged off of the main window into their own window. Each dialog can have its own window or they can be grouped in floating docks. Dialogs can be stacked, placed side-by-side, or _tabbed_ depending on where they are dropped onto a dock. Drop a dialog on the left side and it will be placed on the left. Drop a dialog in the center and it will replace the current dialog, with both dialogs listed as tabs at the bottom. There is a visual indicator of where the dropped dialog will appear (under Windows it may be hard to see). Clicking the small triangle icon will _iconize_ the dialog along the right edge of the main window.

![Floating dock with two dialogs.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/ANATOMY/anatomy03_floating.png)

A floating _Dock_ with three dialogs, two of which are visible. The _Layers_ and _Undo History_ dialogs are tabbed together.

Selecting _Floating_ under _Dialog behavior_ in the _Interface_ → _Windows_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)) disables the use of docks. Instead, all dialogs will be opened in their own window.

When multiple drawings are opened, docked dialogs apply to the _Canvas_ that is in the same window while floating dialogs apply to whichever window is active. (Note, it is possible to dock a dialog into the wrong window!)

  

* * *

\[[3](#idm140091262199936)\] Inkscape uses the terms _Canvas_ and _Page_ inconsistently. In this manual, _Canvas_ will refer to the entire drawing area while _Page_ will refer to a specified region of the _Canvas_ corresponding to a defined output area.

The Swedish Flag—A Short Example
--------------------------------

We will use Inkscape to draw a simple flag, that of Sweden. This example will cover: setting a custom drawing size, setting up a _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ to help precisely place objects, the use of the _[Rectangle Tool]( "Rectangles and Squares")_, changing the color of objects, and finally saving a drawing and exporting the drawing into a form suitable for use on a web page.

![Flag of Sweden](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/SwedishFlag.png)

Flag of Sweden.

The steps we'll take are:

*   Start Inkscape.
    
*   Set the drawing size.
    
*   Set up a _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ to guide drawing objects.
    
*   Draw the flag background.
    
*   Draw the cross.
    
*   Set the colors of the background and cross.
    
*   Save and export the drawing.
    

It is assumed that you know how to start Inkscape and to use a mouse, touch pad, or tablet to select menu items and move scroll bars.

**Procedure 1.1. Drawing the Swedish Flag**

1.  **Start Inkscape.**
    
    The program will open a single window with a default page size.
    
2.  **Set the page size to the desired flag size.**
    
    The correct width to height proportion of the Swedish flag is 16 to 10. We will set the page size to a 320 by 200 pixel area. What is important here is the ratio. The size of drawing when printed or exported to a bitmap can be changed later (by default, a pixel corresponds to a screen pixel when exported).
    
    1.  **Open the _Document Properties_ dialog.**
        
        Open the _[Document Properties]( "Document Properties")_ dialog by selecting File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-properties.png)Document Properties... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**D****).
        
    2.  **Set page size.**
        
        In the newly opened window, set _Custom size_: _Units_ to "px" using the drop-down menus. Set _Display units_ to "px" to match (this will make the Inkscape show lengths in terms of screen pixels). Then set the flag size by changing _Custom size_: _Width_ to 320, and _Height_ to 200. This can be done by typing the numbers into the entry boxes next to the labels (one could use the small up and down arrows to change the entered value, but this does not work well when an entered number could be non-integer). Note that when you type in new values, changes don't take effect until you hit **Return**, click on a different entry box, or move the cursor from the _[Document Properties]( "Document Properties")_ dialog to another Inkscape window. _Page orientation_ will automatically change to _Landscape_.
        
        Set _Scale x_ to 1.0. This ensures that the internal "px" (aka "_SVG_ _[user unit](#user_unit "user unit")_) is equal to an external "px" (some Inkscape templates set one internal "px" to equal a different external value such as one millimeter or one inch).
        
        ![Document Properties dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/page.png)
        
        _Document Properties_ dialog.
        
    3.  **Fit the page into the drawing area.**
        
        The page is now a small rectangle at the bottom of the drawing area. To fit the page to the drawing area, click on the _Zoom-Page_ icon ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/zoom-fit-page.png) in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_, or use the keyboard shortcut: **5**. The Inkscape window should then look like this:
        
        ![Flag of Sweden, first step.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/SwedishFlag_1.png)
        
        The Inkscape window after you have adjusted the page size and zoom level.
        
        ![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)
        
        Window Size
        
        The figures here show the Inkscape window at its smallest size. Using a larger size will make it easier to use the Inkscape interface (such as being able to read the _[Notification Region](#notification)_).
        
3.  **Set a _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_.**
    
    While the _[Document Properties]( "Document Properties")_ dialog is open, we will make one more change that will make drawing the background and cross easier. A _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ is a set of (usually) horizontal and vertical lines that provide a guide for drawing objects. Optionally, objects will “snap” to a _Grid_ when being drawn or moved, enabling accurate drawing. A _Grid_ will not show when the drawing is printed or exported as a bitmap.
    
    1.  **Create a _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_.**
        
        Select the _Grids_ tab in the _[Document Properties]( "Document Properties")_ dialog. Under the _Creation_ section, select _Rectangular grid_ from the drop-down menu (if not already selected) and then click on the _New_ button. You should see a grid of blue lines on the canvas. If you don't, make sure both the _Enabled_ and the _Visible_ boxes are checked in the _Defined grids_ section. If they are checked, toggle on the global visibility of _Grids_ using the command View → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/show-grid.png)Grid (****#****).
        
    2.  **Adjust the _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ spacing.**
        
        You can now adjust the _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ to match the cross. The dimension and position of the cross is given by Swedish law. The vertical bar is to be placed between 5/16ths and 7/16ths of the flag width, while the horizontal bar is to be placed between 4/10ths and 6/10ths of the flag height.
        
        The default _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ has minor divisions every pixel and major divisions every 5 pixels. Depending on the zoom level, not all divisions may be displayed. A more useful _Grid_ for drawing the flag would be one with divisions every 20 pixels so that the _Grid_ lines divide the flag width into 16 parts and the flag height into 10 parts.
        
        To change the scale of the _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ go back to the _Grids_ tab of the _[Document Properties]( "Document Properties")_ window.
        
        ![Document Properties dialog, Grids tab.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/grid.png)
        
        _Document Properties_ dialog, _Grids_ tab.
        
        Set both _Spacing X_ and _Spacing Y_ to 20.
        
        To help draw the flag accurately, we will turn on the snapping of nodes to the grid lines. First select the _Snap_ tab. Check the _Always snap_ option under the _Snap to grids_ section. This will force snapping regardless of the distance the cursor is from a _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ line. Enable overall snapping by highlighting the Snap (top or left-most ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap.png) , _[tool tip](#tooltip "tool tip")_: _Enable snapping (%)_) icon in the _[Snap Bar](#snapbar)_. Enable snapping of nodes by highlighting the _Snap nodes, paths, and handles_ (third ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap.png) ) icon as well as the _Snap cusp nodes_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-nodes-cusp.png)) icon in the same section of the _Snap Bar_. Next make sure the _Snap to Grid_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/grid-rectangular.png)) icon is highlighted in the _Snap Bar_. If any of these icons are not visble, you may have to widen/heighten the Inkscape window, or use the drop-down menu opened with the the _Triangle_ at the right end or bottom of the bar and check the appropriate boxes). Finally, make sure the _Snap bounding boxes_ (second ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap.png) ) icon is not highlighted.\[[4](#ftn.idm140091252975552)\]
        
        ![Document Properties dialog, Snap tab.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/snap.png)
        
        _[Document Properties]( "Document Properties")_ dialog, _Snap_ tab.
        
        After making the changes, you may close the _Document Properties_ window. The Inkscape window should look like this:
        
        ![Swedish flag, second step.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/SwedishFlag_2.png)
        
        Drawing area with _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ turned on and adjusted. Note the _[Snap Bar](#snapbar)_ settings.
        
4.  **Draw the flag background.**
    
    The flag has a light-blue background. There are several ways to accomplish this; we'll use a filled rectangle.
    
    1.  **Select the _Rectangle Tool_.**
        
        Click on the _[Rectangle Tool]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ icon ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-rectangle.png) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_ on the left of the Inkscape window (or use the keyboard shortcut **F4**) to select the _Rectangle Tool_.
        
        ![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)
        
        Tool Tips
        
        One nice feature of Inkscape is that there are very good built-in hints. While the mouse pointer is over the _Rectangle Tool_ icon, you'll see a _[tool tip](#tooltip "tool tip")_ describing the use of the _Rectangle Tool_. This feature is present for almost all icons and objects in Inkscape. The _tool tip_ usually includes the keyboard shortcut for an icon, in this case (F4), indicating that pressing **F4** would be another way of selecting the _Rectangle Tool_.
        
        Once you have selected the _[Rectangle Tool]( "Rectangles and Squares")_, move the pointer over the drawing area. The pointer will become a rectangle. This signifies you are ready to draw a rectangle or square. The small cross at the upper-left corner of the pointer indicates the active point.
        
        ![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)
        
        Notification Region
        
        At the bottom of the window, there is a _[Notification Region](#notification)_ (in the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_). This tells you what actions you can perform with the selected tool. Note that the region isn't always large enough to show all the options. Moving the mouse over the region will pop up a _[tool tip](#tooltip "tool tip")_ showing the full content. One could also widen the Inkscape window to see more of the region. When the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ is in use, the _[Notification Region](#notification)_ will also tell you the number and type of objects that are currently selected.
        
    2.  **Draw the background rectangle.**
        
        To draw the background rectangle, follow the hint in the _[Notification Region](#notification)_. Click-drag the pointer from one corner to the opposite corner of the page area.
        
        Note how the corners of the rectangle snap to the _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_. If your rectangle doesn't match the page size, you can use one of the drag handles (little squares) in the upper left or lower right of the rectangle to adjust the size of the rectangle. (The circle at the upper-right corner has a different function. It is used to round the four corners of a rectangle.) As you drag the squares around, they will snap to the _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_.
        
        If you make a mistake, you can click on the _Undo_ icon ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-undo-ltr.png) in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_, use Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-undo-ltr.png)Undo (****Ctrl**+**Z****) from the _[Menu Bar](#menubar)_, or use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl**+**Z** to undo the change.
        
        ![Swedish flag, third step.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/SwedishFlag_3.png)
        
        Background rectangle.
        
    
    The background color will need to be changed. One could do that now, but it is easier to wait and change it at the same time the cross color is set.
    
5.  **Draw the cross.**
    
    The cross consists of a horizontal bar and a vertical bar.
    
    1.  **Draw the horizontal bar.**
        
        With the _[Rectangle Tool]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ still selected, create a bar by starting six grid lines from the bottom of the background rectangle on the left side of the flag and click-dragging the pointer until four grid lines from the bottom on the right side of the flag. The rectangle corners should snap to the grid. Notice that the rectangle _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color is the same as the background color but you should still be able to see the new bar. Make any corrections to the size and position of the rectangle that are necessary.
        
        **If you can't see the horizontal bar ... ** don't panic! Inkscape often uses the _[Current style](#CurrentStyle "Current Style:")_ (attributes: color, line style, etc.) to draw new objects. The _Current style_ is set to that of the last object where the style was modified (including that of a previous Inkscape session). If the border color matches the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color of the rectangle or if drawing the border has been turned off, AND if the _[transparency](#transparency "transparency")_ or _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ is set to 100% you will have the same situation as a polar bear in a snow storm. There are many fixes but the easiest one is to change the horizontal bar color to be different from the background color. This can be done by clicking on any of the color samples in the _[Palette](#palette)_ while the newly drawn bar is still selected (indicated by the dashed line around the perimeter). If a color sample in the _[Palette](#palette)_ is clicked on when no object is selected, the _Current style_ will be changed to use that color for the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of the next _Rectangle_ drawn.
        
    2.  **Draw the vertical bar.**
        
        The vertical bar should extend between 5 and 7 grid lines from the left of the background rectangle.
        
        ![Swedish flag, fourth step.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/SwedishFlag_4.png)
        
        The display after both the horizontal bar and vertical bar are drawn. The border lines show how one rectangle of the cross overlaps the other.
        
    3.  **Merge the bars into a cross.**
        
        One could stop here. After removing the border for the bars, one would have the desired cross. But it might be better (and at least more pedagogical) to merge the bars into a cross, so that the cross is one _object_ rather than two.
        
        1.  **Select both the rectangles.**
            
            Both bars need to be selected at once. This can be done with the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ and the **Shift** key. Enable the _Select Tool_ by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-pointer.png) icon in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_ or by using one of the keyboard shortcuts **F1** or **s**.
            
            After changing to the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ (indicated by the pointer changing to an arrow when over the canvas or crossed arrows when over an object), click on one of the rectangles in the cross. Then, while holding the **Shift** key down, click on the other rectangle in the cross. Both rectangles should be selected as indicated by their dotted borders. Note that the background rectangle is not surrounded by a dotted border and that the _[Notification Region](#notification)_ reports that two objects are selected.
            
            ![Swedish flag, fifth step.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/SwedishFlag_5.png)
            
            The two rectangles that form the cross are selected.
            
        2.  **Merge paths.**
            
            The two rectangles can be combined by merging their _[Paths]( "Chapter 7. Paths")_. (Here, the _[Path]( "Chapter 7. Paths")_ is the border of the rectangle.) To merge the two rectangles, select Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-union.png)Union (****Ctrl**+**+****) from the _[Menu Bar](#menubar)_. The rectangles are now merged into one object.
            
            ![Swedish flag, sixth step.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/SwedishFlag_6.png)
            
            The cross after the rectangles have been merged.
            
            The cross is no longer made of _[Rectangle]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ objects but is instead defined as a _[Path]( "Chapter 7. Paths")_.
            
6.  **Set the colors of the background and cross.**
    
    The next step is to adjust the colors of the background and cross to the colors of the Swedish flag. We'll use the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog so that we can precisely set the correct colors.
    
    1.  **Bring up the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog.**
        
        Open up the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog by clicking on the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ icon ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-fill-and-stroke.png) in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_, clicking on the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ part of the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ in the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_, or using the keyboard shortcut **Shift**+**Ctrl**+**F**.
        
        The dialog will by default be docked on the right, inside the Inkscape window. If you have room, undock the dialog by dragging on the top bar of the dialog (the gray bar with _Fill and Stroke_ written in it). Drop the dialog outside of the Inkscape window. Hit **5** to recenter the drawing inside the main window (or use the **Middle Mouse** button to drag the drawing back to the center).
        
        ![Fill and Stroke dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/fillandstroke.png)
        
        _Fill and Stroke_ dialog.
        
        Make sure that the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ tab is highlighted at the top of the dialog; if not, click on the tab. The parameters in the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog apply to the currently selected drawing object(s).
        
    2.  **Set the _Fill_ background color.**
        
        Select the background rectangle by clicking on it with the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_. The _[Notification Region](#notification)_ should report that one rectangle is selected and the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ will show the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color and the _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color of the rectangle. The _Flat Color_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-solid.png) icon should be highlighted. If not, click on it.
        
        There are several ways to specify the desired _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color. We'll use the _[Red-Green-Blue (RGB)](#rgb "red-green-blue")_ mode (select the _RGB_ tab if not already highlighted). In this mode, a color is specified by setting the amount of each of the three primary colors. The scale extends from 0 to 255. One can change the amount of each primary color via sliding the little triangles left or right on the bars labeled R, G, B, or by changing the numbers in the boxes to the right of the bars (via typing or using the up/down arrows). For the Swedish flag, the background color is specified by the NIS standard color 4055-R95B, which is equivalent to the values: Red: 0, Green: 90, Blue: 173. The fourth entry is _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ (A) or transparency, which indicates how opaque the object should be. We want our flag to have a solid, non–see-through background, so _Alpha_ should be set to 255 (range is 0 to 255). Likewise, the _Master opacity_ slide should be set to 100%.
        
        One additional step is to turn off any _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ (border) color. In the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog, select the _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ tab and click on the _No paint_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-none.png) icon to turn off the stroke.
        
    3.  **Set the cross _Fill_ color.**
        
        Select the cross and change the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color following the previous instructions. When the cross is selected, the _[Notification Region](#notification)_ will report that a _[Path]( "Chapter 7. Paths")_ with 12 nodes is selected. You'll need to reselect the _Fill_ tab. This time, set the colors to R: 255, G: 194, and B: 0. Also turn off the border as done previously.
        
7.  **Save and export your work.**
    
    Now is the time to save your work. Select File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-save-as.png)Save As... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**S****). The dialog that appears will depend on your operating system. Select the folder or directory where the drawing should be saved and give the drawing an appropriate name. Finally, click on the _Save_ button.
    
    One last step is to export your file as a _[PNG (Portable Network Graphic)](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ bitmap that can be used by other graphics programs or on a web page.\[[5](#ftn.idm140091203665760)\] Bring up the _[Export Bitmap](#File-Export-PNG "Exporting PNG (Portable Network Graphic) Files")_ dialog: (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/document-export.png)Export Bitmap... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**E****)).
    
    ![Export Bitmap dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/export.png)
    
    _Export Bitmap_ dialog.
    
    There are four options for choosing the area to export: _Page_, _Drawing_, _Selection_, and _Custom_. In our case, the _Page_ and _Drawing_ areas are the same. Select either one, then enter or select a filename at the bottom and click on the _Export_ button to save the drawing as a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_. You should now have a _PNG_ file with a flag as shown at the beginning of this section. Note, the dialog will remain on the screen even after a successful export.
    

  

* * *

\[[4](#idm140091252975552)\] The _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ includes (normally) the width of any visible border line. The finished flag will not have any visible border lines, but the rectangles used for the drawing of the flag will have visible borders until they are removed in one of the last steps. If the placement of the rectangles is done using _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_, the final placements of the rectangles will be off slightly.

\[[5](#idm140091203665760)\] All major browsers have native support for _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ graphics so depending on use, it may not be necessary to save the drawing as a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_.

The European Flag—A More Elaborate Example
------------------------------------------

We will use Inkscape to draw a more complicated flag, that of the [European Union](http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/flag_guide.asp) (EU). This tutorial will cover using the _[Star Tool]( "Regular Polygons and Stars")_ to draw a regular star, using _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_ for positioning, making copies or clones of an object, and precisely moving those copies to their proper places.

![Flag of the European Union](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/EUFlag.png)

Flag of the European Union.

The steps are:

*   Set basic drawing parameters (flag size, grid, background color).
    
*   Add _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_.
    
*   Draw a single star.
    
*   Duplicate the star and position the duplicates.
    

**Procedure 1.2. Drawing the European Union Flag**

1.  **Set up the drawing.**
    
    To begin, start Inkscape. The page size needs to be set to the correct proportions for the EU flag, which has a 3 to 2 width to height ratio. We will use a 270 by 180 pixel area. This will facilitate drawing and placing of the stars to the EU specifications.
    
    Follow the instructions for setting the page size and creating a grid given in the Swedish flag example but set the flag width to 270 and the flag height to 180 pixels. Also set the grid spacing to 10 pixels rather than 20 (so we can snap to the flag width which is not divisible by 20). Enable snapping of nodes in the _[Snap Bar](#snapbar)_.
    
    Draw a rectangle for the flag background that covers the entire page. Next use the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-fill-and-stroke.png)Fill and Stroke... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**F****)) to set the color of the background to the officially prescribed _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ color: 0, 51, 153. Check that the _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ (A) value is 255 and the _Master opacity_ is 100%.
    
2.  **Add _Guide Lines_.**
    
    For placing the stars, it is easiest to draw the first star at the center of the flag (at 135, 90). You can then use simple translations to move the stars to their final positions. You can make it easier to keep track of the center point by adding _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_. The _Guide Lines_ are lines that, like the _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_, are not part of the actual drawing.
    
    To add a _[Guide Line](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_, click-drag starting on a _[Ruler](#rulers)_ near the middle and finishing at the desired point on the canvas. (If you start near the edge, an angled _Guide Line_ will be created.) The _Guide Line_ can be moved by selecting (with the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_) and dragging. Be careful not to move the background! If you do, just undo the move (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-undo-ltr.png)or **Ctrl**+**Z**). To precisely place the _Guide Line_, double-click on the _Guide Line_ using the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_. A dialog will open where you can type in the exact position required. You can check the _Locked_ box to prevent accident moving of the _Guide Line_.
    
    ![Guide line dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/guide.png)
    
    _Guide Line_ dialog.
    
    The _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_ can be turned on and off by using the _Guide Line_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/guides.png)) icon in the _[Snap Bar](#snapbar)_ (recall that you may need to enlarge the Inkscape window to see the icon) or via the command View → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/show-guides.png)Guides (****|****).
    
    Add both a horizontal _Guide Line_ at _y_ = 90 px and a vertical _Guide Line_ at _x_ = 135 px.
    
3.  **Draw a star.**
    
    We need to draw a five-pointed star that will be duplicated to create the 12 stars of the flag. To avoid drawing a blue star on a blue background, click to the side of the drawing to deselect the background rectangle, then click on one of the colors in the _[Palette](#palette)_. When no object is selected, clicking on a color in the _Palette_ will set the default _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ to that color.
    
    1.  **Select _Star Tool_ and set up the star parameters.**
        
        To draw a star, select the _[Star Tool]( "Regular Polygons and Stars")_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-polygon-star.png) (keyboard shortcut **\***) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_. You may need to click on the small right-arrow at the bottom of the _Tool Box_ if the icon is not shown to access the pop-up menu. According to the EU flag specification, the stars on the flag are five-pointed with one point straight up. The easiest way to get the star the exact shape is to use the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.
        
        ![Star and Polygon Tool Controls](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/EUFlag_ToolControls.png)
        
        The _[Star Tool]( "Regular Polygons and Stars")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.
        
        In the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_, set the number of _Corners_ to 5. Select the _Star_ icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-star.png)) to enable drawing of a star.
        
        The _Spoke Ratio_ is the ratio of the radius of the innermost point to the radius of the outermost point of a star (R2/R1). For a “regular” five-pointed star this should be 0.382. You can either set this directly or select the _0.382: pentagram_ entry from the pop-up menu after clicking with the **Right Mouse** button on the entry box. If you don't see the _Spoke Ratio_ entry box, you can either widen the Inkscape window or access the parameter by clicking on the down-arrow at the right edge of the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_; select _Spoke Ratio_ from the menu and then _0.382: pentagram_ from the drop-down menu.)
        
        The other entries in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_, _Rounded_ and _Randomized_, should both be zero.
        
        ![Star dimensions](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/EUFlag_Star.png)
        
        The Star dimensions.
        
    2.  **Draw the star.**
        
        The specified radius (R1) of the star on the EU flag is 1/18 of the flag height, or 10 pixels with our flag size. Starting with the mouse at the intersection of the _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_, click drag upward for 10 pixels. You must move the cursor half the distance to the next grid line before you'll see a star. The upper point will snap to the _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_.
        
        Adjust the color of the star to a RGB value of (255, 204, 0). Make sure _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ (A) is 255 and the _Master opacity_ is 100%.
        
        ![EU Flag, first step.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/EUFlag_1.png)
        
        After the first star has been drawn and the color adjusted.
        
4.  **Duplicate and place the 12 stars.**
    
    1.  **Clone a star.**
        
        Either click on the icon ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-clone.png) in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_ or use Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-clone.png)Create Clone (****Alt**+**D****) to make a _[Clone]_ of the star. A _Clone_ is a copy that is linked to the original so that if you modify the original, the _Clone_ will also change. This is handy if you need to make a common adjustment to all the stars (change color, enlarge, etc.).
        
    2.  **Place a cloned star.**
        
        The EU flag specifies that the stars be evenly distributed on a circle that is one third of the flag height and at positions corresponding to the hours of a clock. The easiest way to place the stars properly is to use the move feature on the _Move_ tab of the _[Transform](#Transforms-Transform "Transforms with the Transform Dialog")_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-transform.png)Transform... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**M****)). Open the dialog, and if you have room, drag it out of the Inkscape window. To move the cloned star to the 12 o'clock position, set the _Vertical_ (_y_) direction to 60 pixels. Make sure the _Relative move_ box is checked and the units are set to pixels (px), then click the _Apply_ button.
        
        ![Transform dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/FLAG/EUFlag_Transform.png)
        
        The _[Transform](#Transforms-Transform "Transforms with the Transform Dialog")_ dialog, set to move the first cloned star into place.
        
        Next, select the original star and make a new _[Clone]_. This time move the _Clone_ 60 pixels down (−60). Repeat for the _Horizontal_ (_x_) direction. For the rest of the stars, use the eight permutations of _x_(_y_) =  30 and _y_(_x_) =  52 pixels (60 times the sine and cosine of 30 , respectively).
        
        After all 12 stars are placed, you can delete the original star. The links between the clones and the original star are automatically broken.
        
        If desired, save your work and export a bitmap as for the Swedish flag.

A Hiking Club Logo—An Exercise in Paths
---------------------------------------

We will use Inkscape to draw a logo for the Fuji Hiking and Mountaineering Club, as shown below. This tutorial will cover the use of text, importing a bitmap for use as a guide in drawing, and manipulation of paths.

![FHMC Logo](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_15.png)

Logo for the Fuji Hiking and Mountaineering Club.

The steps are:

*   Start Inkscape and set the drawing size.
    
*   Create the text for the logo.
    
*   Import a bitmap with the shape of Fuji mountain.
    
*   Convert the text to a path and manipulate that path.
    
*   Trace the Fuji mountain picture to obtain a path.
    
*   Trim the text to the mountain shape using Fuji mountain path.
    
*   Add snow to the mountain top.
    
*   Add finishing touches.
    

**Procedure 1.3. Creating the Fuji Hiking and Mountaineering Club Logo**

1.  **Set up the drawing.**
    
    To begin, start Inkscape.
    
    Follow the instructions for setting the page size and grid spacing given in the Swedish flag example, but set drawing size to a width of 500 and a height of 300 pixels. Do _not_ create a _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_.
    
2.  **Create the text.**
    
    1.  **Enter the text.**
        
        Select the _[Text Tool]( "Chapter 9. Text")_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-text.png) from the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_ (keyboard shortcut **F8**). Click on the left side of the page to establish a starting point for the text. You should see a blinking bar. Type the initials for the club “FHMC”; the text should appear in a small size on the page.
        
    2.  **Adjust the text.**
        
        The text is too small and may not use the most suitable font. To change the attributes of the text, use the items in the _[Text Tool]( "Chapter 9. Text")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.
        
        ![Text Tool-Tool Controls](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_ToolControls.png)
        
        The _[Text Tool]( "Chapter 9. Text")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.
        
        With the text selected, choose a suitable font from the pull-down menu on the left. Nimbus Roman No9 L is a good freely available font with the wide serifs needed for the logo. If you do not have this font installed on your system, you can choose a similar font such as Times or Times New Roman. Select the **Bold** style from the drop-down _Style_ menu, bar, and set the _Font size_ to 108 pt (144 px). The changes to the text are shown immediately.
        
        ![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)
        
        Default Font-Size Unit
        
        The default font-size units in Inkscape was changed to _points (pts)_ to match what is commonly used in the print industry. One _point_ is equivalent to 4/3 _pixels_. The preferred font-size unit can be set in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. The currently used unit can be seen by hovering the cursor over the Font-size entry box.
        
        Finally, center the text near the bottom of the drawing by using the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ and dragging the text down.
        
        ![The text for the logo](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_01.png)
        
        The text for the logo, sized and positioned.
        
3.  **Import the guide for the mountain shape.**
    
    We'll use as a basis for the shape of Fuji San a bitmap tracing of the mountain. You could use any suitable drawing or picture of the mountain (in _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_, _[GIF](#gif "Graphics Interchange Format")_, or _[JPEG](#jpeg "Joint Photographic Experts Group")_ format). You can download the same image used here from the book's website ([http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/)).
    
    1.  **Import the bitmap.**
        
        Import the bitmap using the _[Import]( "Importing Files")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/document-import.png)Import... (****Ctrl**+**I****)). _New in v0.48:_ A dialog will pop up asking if you wish to _embed_ or _link_ to the image. Since we will not need to keep the image around, it is better to simply link to the file.
        
    2.  **Adjust the bitmap.**
        
        The bitmap's image size doesn't match well with the text. The easiest way to adjust the size is to select the image with the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-pointer.png) (keyboard shortcut **F1**). When the image is selected, a set of double-headed arrows appears around the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ (dotted line) of the image. Dragging on the handles will scale the image. Dragging while holding down the **Ctrl** key will keep the width to height ratio constant. Dragging on a non-transparent part of the image will move the whole image. Note that if you click on the image twice with the _Select Tool_, the corner arrows change to rotation arrows. Just click on the image one more time to restore the scale arrows. One can also use the **Arrow** keys to move the image. Note: You may want to decrease the zoom a bit (**3** when image selected) or widen the Inkscape window before enlarging the image.
        
        ![Scaling the image.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_02.png)
        
        Image selected and with arrows, ready for scaling.
        
        Drag on the corner arrows while holding down the **Ctrl** key and drag the image until you are happy with the scale and placement. I have chosen to center the top of Fuji over the right side serif of the H.
        
        ![The placement of the mountain image.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_03.png)
        
        The outline of Fuji San, sized and positioned.
        
4.  **Manipulate the text.**
    
    In this section, we will convert the text to a _[Path]( "Chapter 7. Paths")_ so we can alter the shape of the letters. The text needs to be extended upward, above the outline of the mountain so that we can _[Clip]_ it to match the shape of the mountain. We will also make a few additional cosmetic changes to the letters.
    
    1.  **Convert the text to a path.**
        
        The text, stored as a text object, needs to be converted to a path object for editing. This process is not reversible and the text will lose its memory of being text. To convert the text to a path, select the text with the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ and use the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****) command. Each letter is converted into a separate path and all the paths are placed in a _[Group]_ (when objects are in a _Group_ they can be manipulated as if they were one object). This is normally a good thing, but for our purposes it would be better if all the letters were not grouped and were composed of one path. So, with the text selected, use the Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-ungroup.png)Ungroup (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**G****) command to remove the group and then Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-combine.png)Combine (****Ctrl**+**K****) to combine the paths.
        
    2.  **Extend the text upward.**
        
        1.  **Extend the F and H up.**
            
            We'll start with extending the F and H. Select the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png) (**F2**). And click on the letters to select the text path.
            
            The text is now surrounded by a series of small diamonds. These are the _nodes_ of the path. They define places where the path changes direction or curvature. The path is edited by manipulating these nodes.
            
            At this point, it is easier if you zoom in on the drawing. There are multiple ways to _[zoom]( "Zooming the Canvas")_. Using the **Ctrl** key with the scroll wheel of a scrolling mouse is one way. The drawing will zoom around the cursor position. Another way is to use the **+** or **\=** keys. In this case, the zoom is around the center of the viewable canvas. The scroll bars can be used to pan the drawing (i.e., change the viewable region).
            
            ![Ready to extend the F and H.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_04.png)
            
            Ready to extend the F and H. You can see the diamond-shaped nodes.
            
            To select a node, click on it with the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_. Holding the **Shift** key down allows nodes to be added (or removed) from the selection. One can also use a _[rubber-band](#rubberband "rubber band")_ selection technique to select multiple nodes at one time. To do this, click-drag from one point to another. All nodes within the box defined by the starting and stopping points will be selected. The click-drag must not begin on a node. The selected nodes will change from gray to blue and yellow when selected.
            
            Select the top nodes of the F and of both sides of the H. A total of seven nodes are selected in this example (there are two on top of each other at the upper-right corner of the F). If you have chosen a different font you may have to select a different number.
            
            Now click-drag on any of the selected nodes upward, holding the **Ctrl** key down to constrain the direction of the drag to vertical. Drag until all the selected nodes are above the outline of the mountain.
            
            ![Extension of F and H.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_05.png)
            
            After the F and H have been extended.
            
            One problem that is immediately apparent is that the extended parts hide part of the bitmap image. This problem can be alleviated by temporarily removing the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of the text objects. To do this, click on the red _x_ at the left end of the _[Palette](#palette)_. If the text is no longer visible, you will need to make the _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ visible. Click on one of the colors in the _Palette_ with the **Shift** held down.
            
        2.  **Extend the M.**
            
            Extending the M may be more difficult than extending the first two letters, it depends on the font selected. For Nimbus Roman No9 L, we need to add two extra nodes in order to preserve the shape of the stems of the M.
            
            Use the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ to select the four nodes at the top of the M. Click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-add.png) icon (_Insert New Node_) in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. This will add two nodes, each halfway between the pairs of adjacent selected nodes. Click on the background to deselect all the nodes, then click-drag the new node on the left side to be above the rightmost node of the left serif, as shown next.
            
            ![Extension of M.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_06.png)
            
            In the middle of the process to extend the M.
            
            Do the equivalent for the new node on the right side.
            
            Now select the four top nodes of the serifs (the two new nodes replacing two of the previous top nodes) and drag them up, holding the **Ctrl** key down to constrain their movement in the vertical direction. Move the nodes above the mountain.
            
        3.  **Extend the C.**
            
            Extending the C also requires a bit of node manipulation. Select the leftmost node and the top-center node of the C. Convert these to _Corner_ nodes by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/node-type-cusp.png) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. This will allow the path to have an abrupt change in direction at the nodes. Click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/node-segment-line.png) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ to convert the selected segment to a line. Click on the background to deselect both nodes, then click-drag the topmost node of the line to move it above the lower node of the line, as shown next.
            
            ![Extension of C.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_07.png)
            
            In the middle of the process to extend the C. The arrow shows the movement of the node and the dotted line, the new position of the line segment.
            
            Select all the nodes along the top of the C and drag them above the mountain, again using the **Ctrl** key to constrain the movement in the vertical direction.
            
        
        The text path should now look like this:
        
        ![Extension of "FHMC".](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_08.png)
        
        After all the characters in the text have been extended above the mountain image.
        
    3.  **Adjust kerning.**
        
        The _[kerning](#kerning "kerning")_ of the text isn't quite right. The C is too far from the M. This could have been corrected while the text was still a _Text_ object, but it would have been hard to get correct spacing without seeing the newly extended parts.
        
        To move the C, use the _Node Tool_ to select all the nodes in the C, then use the left and right **Arrow** keys to move the C until the gap between the C and M matches the gaps between the F and H, and the H and M. If the movement step is too large, use **Alt**+**Arrow** to make smaller movements.
        
        Adjust the spacing between the other letters if needed.
        
    4.  **Fill in the gap in the M.**
        
        The gap between the two extensions of the M is a bit wide. To reduce the visual effect of the gap we will add a block in between.
        
        1.  **Add the rectangle.**
            
            Select the _[Rectangle Tool]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-rectangle.png) (**F4**) and click drag a rectangle between the extensions of the M as shown below. Use the rectangle handles to adjust the position.
            
            ![With rectangle.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_09.png)
            
            The text after adding a rectangle between the extensions of the M.
            
        2.  **Merge the rectangle with text.**
            
            For later steps, the rectangle object must be merged with the text path. Select with the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ both the rectangle and the text path. Then use the command: Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-combine.png)Combine (****Ctrl**+**K****) to create one path out of the two. The rectangle object is automatically converted to a path object before the merge.
            
5.  **Trace the bitmap mountain to form a new path.**
    
    The top of the extended text will be trimmed with the shape of Fuji San. To do this, the bitmap image of the mountain must be converted to a path. But first, make any last-minute adjustments to the position of the mountain using the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_.
    
    Inkscape includes a tool to trace the bitmap automatically ([Chapter 20, _Tracing Bitmaps_]( "Chapter 20. Tracing Bitmaps")) but the path produced is too complicated for our use.
    
    Instead, we will use the _[Pencil Tool](#Paths-Pencil "The Pencil Tool")_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-freehand.png) (**F6**). In the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ make sure that _Mode_ is set to _Bezier_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/path-mode-bezier.png)) and that _Shape_ is set to _None_. A _Smoothing_ value of about 30 will give you a reasonable number of nodes. Starting at one end of the mountain, click-drag the pointer along the top edge of the mountain to create a new path. When you reach the far end, loop the path back to the starting point, as shown next.
    
    ![The mountain as a path.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_10.png)
    
    After tracing the mountain to form a path, the stroke color has been changed to red to make it easier to see.
    
    It is not important that the ends of the path meet exactly. It is important that the loop encloses all of the tops of the letters. The path can be tweaked by using the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ to reposition any wayward nodes. It helps to make the path a different color using the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog.
    
6.  **Trim the tops of the letters.**
    
    We'll use the _[Path Difference](#Paths-Difference)_ command to subtract the overlap between the mountain path and the text path from the text path. It is important that the mountain path be on top of the text path because this command subtracts the top path from the bottom path. As the mountain path was created after the text path, it should already be on top.
    
    To do the path subtraction, select both the mountain path and the text path using the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ (hold the **Shift** key down while selecting the second object) and then use the _Path Difference_ command: Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-difference.png)Difference (****Ctrl**+**\-****). The mountain path will disappear and the text path should look like below.
    
    ![The trimmed text](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_11.png)
    
    The text after trimming to the outline of the mountain.
    
7.  **Adding the snow to the mountain top.**
    
    You could now delete the bitmap of Fuji San, change the fill of the text object to solid black, and call it a day, as shown next.
    
    ![Logo sans snow.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_12.png)
    
    The logo without snow on Fuji San's top.
    
    But it might look better if the logo included a snow cap.
    
    To create a snow cap, zoom in on the bitmap image of the snow and the use the _[Pencil Tool](#Paths-Pencil "The Pencil Tool")_ to trace the snow, creating a loop as with the mountain top below.
    
    ![The snow as a path.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_13.png)
    
    After tracing the snow to form a path.
    
    The next step is to create a copy of the text object, with which to cut the snow path. To create a copy, select the text and then click on the _Duplicate_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-duplicate.png) icon in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_ or use the menu entry Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-duplicate.png)Duplicate (****Ctrl**+**D****).
    
    With the **Shift** key down, select the snow path. Both the duplicate text path and snow path should be selected. Use the _Path Intersection_ command: Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-intersection.png)Intersection (****Ctrl**+**\*****) to combine the two paths. The logo should look like:
    
    ![Logo with snow.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/LOGO/fhmc_14.png)
    
    The logo after adding a path for snow.
    
8.  **Finishing touches.**
    
    1.  **Delete the Fuji San bitmap.**
        
        The bitmap is no longer needed. Delete it by selecting it and then using Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-delete.png)Delete (****Delete** or **Backspace****) or Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-cut.png)Cut (****Ctrl**+**X****).
        
    2.  **Correct _Fill_ and _Stroke_.**
        
        Change the fill of the text object to black. Change the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of the snow object to white and the _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ to black.
        
    3.  **Widen the snow outline.**
        
        The snow outline looks a bit thin. To give it more definition, use the _Stroke style_ tab of the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog. Change the width to 3 pixels. The width of the text path must also be changed to 3 pixels to match.
        

The logo is now finished. Save your work as in the previous tutorials.

The Northern Pacific Railway Logo—A Tracing Example
---------------------------------------------------

Inkscape's _[auto-tracing]( "Chapter 20. Tracing Bitmaps")_ capability is very useful for turning existing artwork into _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ drawings. In this example, we will create the artwork for a logo from a photograph. The logo is for the Northern Pacific (or NP) railroad, which features the _Yin and Yang_ symbol. This tutorial will cover use of the _[Trace Bitmap]( "Chapter 20. Tracing Bitmaps")_ dialog as well as manipulation of paths. The use of _[Layers]_ is also introduced.

![NP Logo](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/NP/NP.png)

Logo for the Northern Pacific Railroad featuring the Yin and Yang (Monad) symbol.

The steps are:

*   Start Inkscape and set the drawing size.
    
*   Import the source photo.
    
*   Auto trace the logo.
    
*   Clean up the logo paths.
    

**Procedure 1.4. Creating the Northern Pacific Logo**

1.  **Set up the drawing.**
    
    To begin, start Inkscape.
    
    Follow the instructions for setting the page size and grid spacing given in the Swedish flag example but set drawing size to a width of 500 and a height of 500 pixels. Do _not_ turn on the _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_.
    
2.  **Import the photograph.**
    
    You can use any photograph (in _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_, _[GIF](#gif "Graphics Interchange Format")_, or _[JPEG](#jpeg "Joint Photographic Experts Group")_ form) with a logo for this exercise. However, sharp, high resolution photographs work best. I will use part of a photograph from the railroad photographer James M. Fredrickson. The photograph has been cropped to show only the logo. If you wish to use the same photograph as used in the exercise, you can download it from the book's website: [http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/).
    
    ![End of car.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/NP/NP_CarEnd.png)
    
    The end of a passenger car showing the Northern Pacific logo.
    
    ![NP Logo.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/NP/NP_CarEnd_HighRes_Cropped2.png)
    
    The NP logo, cropped and zoomed from the previous photograph.
    
    1.  **Import the photograph.**
        
        Import the photograph using the File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/document-import.png)Import... (****Ctrl**+**I****) dialog. _New in v0.48:_ A dialog will pop up asking if you wish to _embed_ or _link_ to the image. Since we will not need to keep the image around, it is better to simply link to the file.
        
    2.  **Adjust the size and position of the photograph.**
        
        Adjust the photograph's size and position to match the Inkscape page with the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-pointer.png) (keyboard shortcut **F1**). Drag the corners while holding down the **Ctrl** key to preserve the aspect ratio. Drag the body to translate the photo.
        
3.  **Trace the logo.**
    
    Inkscape utilizes the _Potrace_ tracing library to create _SVG_ paths from bitmap images. To trace the picture, call up the _[Trace Bitmap]( "Chapter 20. Tracing Bitmaps")_ dialog (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/bitmap-trace.png)Trace Bitmap... (****Shift**+**Alt**+**B****)).
    
    ![Trace Bitmap dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/NP/Dialog_TraceBitmap_NP.png)
    
    _[Trace Bitmap]( "Chapter 20. Tracing Bitmaps")_ dialog.
    
    The _[Trace Bitmap]( "Chapter 20. Tracing Bitmaps")_ dialog presents a number of choices for how the tracing is done. Looking at the image, we see that there are three different grayscale levels. This suggests that we use one of the _Multiple scans_ methods. As this is a monochrome photograph, we'll try the _[Grays](#Trace-Multi-Grays "Grays")_ option with _Scans_ set to three. This will give us three regions, each corresponding to one of the grayscale levels. There is the possibility to smooth the bitmap prior to tracing by checking the _Smooth_ box. This is not necessary as our starting photograph doesn't have any speckle. Finally, there is an option to generate paths for mutually exclusive areas or that include all darker regions. The latter is more useful for us, so we check the _Stack scans_ option box. One can get a relatively quick idea of what the final scans will look like by checking the _Live Preview_ box. The resulting traces are shown below.
    
    ![First scan attempt.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/NP/NP_02.png)
    
    Results of scanning using the _Multiple scans, Grays_ option. On the far left is the output of the scan. The three paths that make up the scan are shown separately to the right. As each path includes all darker regions, the path for the lightest region is just a square covering the entire page.
    
    The paths generated with the _Grays_ option are usable as a starting point for the NP logo. However, we might be able to do better if we use the _Single scan, Brightness cutoff_ method, optimizing the threshold for each scan.
    
    Select the _Brightness cutoff_ option in the _[Trace Bitmap]( "Chapter 20. Tracing Bitmaps")_ dialog. Adjust the _Threshold_ to create a well-defined Yin and Yang path. Pressing the _Update_ button will create a preview. A threshold of 0.15 seems to work well. After finding a good value, click on the _OK_ button to generate the path.
    
    ![Second scan attempt.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/NP/NP_03a.png)
    
    Scanning the photo with a _Threshold_ of 0.15. The scan has been shifted for better visibility. Notice the “blobs” in between the two circles.
    
    The scan has many “blobs” that clutter the picture. We could remove these by hand, but there is an easier way. Select the _Options_ tab in the _[Trace Bitmap]( "Chapter 20. Tracing Bitmaps")_ dialog. The _Suppress speckles_ option allows the automatic suppression of paths smaller than the specified size. Make sure the _Suppress speckles_ box is checked and set the _Size_ to 50. While you're at it, make sure the _Smooth corners_ and _Optimize paths_ boxes are checked. This will result in a smooth scan with fewer nodes. Rescan and the “blobs” should be gone.
    
    It will be easier to edit the traces separately. To do so, we'll temporarily move the path. This requires a precise move which can be done with the _[Transform](#Transforms-Transform "Transforms with the Transform Dialog")_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-transform.png)Transform... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**M****)). Bring up the dialog and select the _Move_ tab. Move the path a page width to the right by setting the _Horizontal_ entry to 500 pixels, setting the _Vertical_ entry to 0 pixels, selecting the _Relative move_ option, and then clicking on the _Apply_ button. (One could also move the path using the **Shift**+**Arrow** keys to move the path 20 pixels at a time. This may be faster than calling up the _[Transform](#Transforms-Transform "Transforms with the Transform Dialog")_ dialog but there is a small risk of making a mistake in the shifts.)
    
    Next, repeat the trace with a new threshold. This time optimize the threshold for the lettering. A threshold of 0.65 looks good. Execute the trace. The following figure shows what you should see.
    
    ![Second scan attempt.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/NP/NP_03.png)
    
    Results of scanning using the _Image Brightness_ twice. A threshold of 0.15 was used for the path in the right while a threshold of 0.65 was used for the path on the left. The original photo is still under the tracing on the left.
    
4.  **Clean up the traces.**
    
    1.  **Move the photograph to a different layer.**
        
        Objects in Inkscape can be selected by clicking on them. This leads to a small problem when using a _[rubber-band](#rubberband "rubber band")_ selection technique where one click-drags to select multiple objects as we will want to do a few times. If the click-drag begins over the photograph, the photograph will be moved. One can avoid this by holding the **Shift** key down while starting the click-drag, but this is a bit of a pain to do every time. One could _lock_ the picture in place by checking the _Lock_ box in the _Object Properties_ dialog but this isn't recommended. It is nontrivial to select and unlock a locked object.
        
        The preferred solution is to put the picture on a separate _[Layer]_. _Layers_ can be thought of as separate drawings on transparent sheets that are stacked on top of each other. The final drawing is what one sees through the stack. In Inkscape, the _Layers_ can be easily locked and unlocked against modification. They can also be made invisible. We'll put the photograph on a locked _Layer_ by itself. Then there is no chance of it moving while we work on cleaning up the tracings.
        
        First, create a new _[Layer]_ for the photograph. This is done through the _[Add Layer]_ dialog (Layer → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/layer-new.png)Add Layer... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**N****)). Enter the name “Photograph”, select _Below current_ in the _Position_ drop-down menu, and then click on the _Add_ button. The new layer is created below the old layer. It is selected automatically. The layer name is shown in the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_.
        
        Select the photograph by clicking on an opening in the tracing (check the _[Notification Region](#notification)_ to see what is selected). Note that the layer is automatically changed back to the original layer (Layer 1) when the photograph is selected. Move the photograph to the new layer by using the command Layer → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-move-to-layer-below.png)Move Selection to Layer Below (****Shift**+**Page Down****). The current layer changes automatically to “Photograph”. Lock this layer by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-unlocked.png) icon next to the layer name. The icon should change to the locked state ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-locked.png) . The photograph now cannot be moved.
        
    2.  **Clean up the Yin and Yang.**
        
        Select the path for the circles and the Yin and Yang. The current layer will switch to “Layer 1”. Zoom in the paths by hitting the **3** key. Each trace creates one path. Each path is made up of many sub-paths. It is generally easier to clean up a tracing by converting the sub-paths into independent paths. Do this by using the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-break-apart.png)Break Apart (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**K****) command.
        
        The first thing you will notice is that the Yin and Yang symbol becomes all black. Don't panic! This is because the Yin and Yang has been broken into two pieces, one for the outer circle and one for the Yin shape. Each path takes on the attributes of the prior combined path and thus both have black _Fill_. Select the Yang (left side) path by first clicking on the background to deselect the paths and then clicking inside the area of the Yang path (look at the original photo). You can tell you've selected the correct path by the shape of the bounding box that is shown when the path is selected. If you got the wrong path, try again moving the cursor a bit. It may be necessary to hold down the **Alt** key while clicking. This will cycle through selecting each object under the cursor in turn. (If the cycling doesn't work, your window manager may be stealing the **Alt** key. See [the section called “Alternative Alt Key”](#Customize-Files-Preferences-AltKey "Alternative Alt Key") in [Chapter 24, _Customization_]( "Chapter 24. Customization"), for ways to work around this problem.)
        
        ![Selecting Yang path.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/NP/NP_04.png)
        
        The Yang path is selected.
        
        While the photograph is in black and white, the Yang part of the monad in the NP logo should be red. Set the _Fill_ color of the path by clicking on the red square in the _[Palette](#palette)_ (or using the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog).
        
        ![Yin and Yang cleaned up.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/NP/NP_05.png)
        
        After the Yin and Yang has been cleaned up.
        
    3.  **Clean up circles.**
        
        Next we will replace the complicated path for the outer circle with ... you guessed it, a circle. Select the _[Ellipse Tool]( "Ellipses, Circles, and Arcs")_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-ellipse.png) from the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. To create a circle, hold down the **Ctrl** key while click-dragging the mouse from one corner of an imaginary box (the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_) that encloses the outer circle, to the opposite corner of the imaginary box. Don't worry about getting the size and position correct at this point.
        
        Turn off the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ by clicking on the red _x_ at the right end of the _[Palette](#palette)_. It is easier to adjust the circle if the circle _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ is a different color than the original and is semi-transparent. Set the _Stroke_ color by holding the **Shift** while clicking on the red square in the _Palette_. Set the opacity to 50% using the entry box marked _O:_ in the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ at the lower left of the Inkscape window.
        
        Now we are ready to adjust the circle. Set the stroke width to match the width of the original circle by either selecting the width from the pop-up menu accessed by a **Right Mouse Click** on the number next to the _Stroke_ color in the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ (a _[tool tip](#tooltip "tool tip")_ will display _Stroke width: x px_ when the cursor is over the number) or, if finer control is required, by setting using the _Width_ entry box under the _Stroke style_ tab of the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-fill-and-stroke.png)Fill and Stroke... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**F****)).
        
        Next, adjust the size of the circle by dragging either of the two square handles (on left and top of circle). The handles are visible (by default) when any of the _[shape tools]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ or the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ is selected. Hold down the **Ctrl** down while dragging to preserve the circle shape. Tapping the **Space** bar will change to the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ for repositioning the circle. Fine adjustments to the position can be made by holding the **Alt** key down while using the arrow keys. Tapping the **Space** bar a second time will reselect the _[Ellipse Tool]( "Ellipses, Circles, and Arcs")_.
        
        ![Outer circle sized and placed.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/NP/NP_06.png)
        
        The new outer circle (semi-transparent red), sized and positioned.
        
        By this time, you will have realized that the original outer circle is not a true circle. This is because the logo in the photograph is at an angle with respect to the plane of the photograph so the original circle is distorted. We will keep the true circle for the logo but keep in mind that we may need to make other corrections.
        
        The final steps for the outer circle are to delete the original circle and change the stroke of the new circle to a solid black.
        
        The inner solid black circle can also be replaced following the same steps as for replacing the outer circle with two minor changes: 1. Use a filled circle without a stroke. 2. Place the new circle behind the Yang object with the Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-lower.png)Lower (****Page Down****) command (also available from the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_).
        
        ![Inner circle sized and placed.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/NP/NP_07.png)
        
        The new inner circle (semi-transparent red), sized and positioned but before moving behind the Yang object.
        
    4.  **Clean up the lettering.**
        
        It is now time to clean up the letters. Again we must break up the path into pieces (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-break-apart.png)Break Apart (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**K****)). After doing so, you'll see one big black square. I don't have to remind you not to panic, do I? Select the square and delete it; you should now see a big black circle. Delete that too (select it by clicking its edge). You should now see letters. While we are at it, delete the center black circle leaving only the letters.
        
        Notice that the A, O, P, and two R's are missing their holes. (You are not panicking, right?) This is because they are each composed of two paths that need to be put back together. We can do this for each of the letters, but in this case it is more convenient to select all the letter paths and merge them into one path using the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-combine.png)Combine (****Ctrl**+**K****) command. (A _[rubber-band](#rubberband "rubber band")_ selection would work well here.)
        
        ![Only letters left.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/NP/NP_08.png)
        
        After extracting only the lettering on the left.
        
    5.  **Final steps.**
        
        It is time to rejoin the Yin and Yang as well as the circles with the text. Select the Yin and Yang, and the circles and use the _[Transform](#Transforms-Transform "Transforms with the Transform Dialog")_ dialog to move them −500 pixels in the horizontal direction.
        
        One can now see that the lettering isn't quite spaced correctly. This is again due to the orientation of the logo in the original picture. The lettering needs to be widened a little bit. Select the lettering path and scale it by 3% in the horizontal direction using the _Scale_ tab of the _[Transform](#Transforms-Transform "Transforms with the Transform Dialog")_ dialog.
        

The logo is now finished. You can either delete or hide the original photograph. (Select the “Photograph” _[Layer]_ in the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_ and then either click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-locked.png) icon to unlock the layer and then select and delete the photograph, or click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-visible.png) icon to hide the _Layer_.) You can also make fine adjustments to the Yin path with the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ if desired. Save your work as in the previous tutorials.

A Box for Cards—An Isometric Projection
---------------------------------------

Inkscape is a two-dimensional drawing program. It can, however, be used to create simple three-dimensional drawings. We will create in this tutorial a simple [_Isometric Projection_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection).

![A box of playing cards.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/ISO/iso_04.png)

A box of playing cards.

An isometric projection is a view of an object such that there is an equal opening angle between the three projected orthogonal axes, as shown below.

![Isometric projection definition.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/ISO/iso_def.png)

The isometric projection of a cube. The angle between each pair of projected axes is 120 .

Inkscape includes axonometric _[Grids](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ that can be used to rapidly draw isometrically projected boxes. However, the method described here works best when drawings are included on the sides of the boxes as distorting the sides requires two precise transformations (scaling and skewing).

The steps are:

*   Start Inkscape and set the drawing size.
    
*   Create the three sides of the box, unfolded.
    
*   Add designs to box sides.
    
*   Transform each box side into place.
    

**Procedure 1.5. Creating an Isometric Projection**

1.  **Set up the drawing.**
    
    To begin, start Inkscape.
    
    Follow the instructions for setting the page size and defining a _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ given in the Swedish flag example but set drawing size to a width of 500 pixels and a height of 500 pixels. Set the _Grid_ spacing to 10 pixels. In the _[Snap Bar](#snapbar)_, enable overall snapping (first ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap.png) ), enable snapping to the _Grid_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/grid-rectangular.png)), enable snapping of the _[Rotation center](#RotationCenter "Rotation Center")_ (fourth ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap.png) , tool tip: _Snap other points_; and ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-nodes-rotation-center.png) ), and turn off snapping of _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ (second ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap.png) , tool tip: _Snap bounding boxes_).
    
2.  **Create the three sides of the box.**
    
    We need the front, side, and top of the box in the ratio 6:4:1, similar to the dimensions for a deck of cards. Create one rectangle with a width of 200 pixels and height of 300 pixels with the lower edge 100 pixels from the bottom of the page. Create a rectangle to the right of the first with width of 50 pixels and height of 300. Create another rectangle above the first rectangle with width of 200 pixels and a height of 50 pixels. The paths of the rectangles should overlap.
    
    Turn on the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of the rectangles with the _[Palette](#palette)_ or _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-fill-and-stroke.png)Fill and Stroke... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**F****)) and set the _Fill_ to white. Turn on the _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and set the _Stroke_ color to black and the width to one pixel. Set the _Stroke_ _Join_ to _Bevel_ by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/stroke-join-bevel.png) icon under the _Stroke style_ tab in the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog. This will make the corners where the rectangles touch neater.
    
    ![Sides blocked out.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/ISO/iso_01.png)
    
    The sides of the box laid out flat.
    
3.  **Add designs to the box sides.**
    
    You can add any designs you want to the box sides. I will use the NP logo created in the previous tutorial as well as some text.
    
    Import the logo using the File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/document-import.png)Import... (****Ctrl**+**I****) command. The logo will need to be scaled smaller. You can do this by click-dragging on one of its corners. Hold the **Ctrl** key down to keep the height to width ratio constant. Once you have it sized appropriately, you can center the logo within the large rectangle by using the Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-align-and-distribute.png)Align and Distribute... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**A****) dialog. To add the large rectangle to the logo selection, click on it while holding down the **Shift** key. In the _[Align and Distribute]( "Alignment and Distribution of Objects")_ dialog, select from the _Relative to_ drop-down menu _Last selected_. Since the rectangle was the last object selected, it will remain fixed and the logo will move. Click on the _Center on vertical axis_ icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/align-vertical-center.png)) and the _Center on horizontal axis_ icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/align-horizontal-center.png)).
    
    Add some text to the sides as you wish. When finished, group each box side with the objects on that side by first selecting the box side with all the objects inside and the using the Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-group.png)Group (****Ctrl**+**G****) command. When objects are placed in a _[Group]_, they can be manipulated as if they are just one object. This will ensure that when the box sides are transformed, the logo and text will be transformed as well.
    
    ![Sides decorated.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/ISO/iso_02.png)
    
    The sides after adding logo and text.
    
4.  **Transform each box side into place.**
    
    Now the fun begins. We would like to distort each box side into a rhombus with the edges keeping the same length. This cannot be done directly. The distortions require several steps. The steps are to make the box sides narrower and then to skew them. The box top will also have to be rotated.
    
    When the sides are narrowed, we will want to keep the stroke width from narrowing at the same time. The option to scale stroke width when an object is scaled can be toggled on and off in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ when the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ is in use. Make sure the _Scale Stroke Width_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/transform-affect-stroke.png) icon is not highlighted (or if the icon is not shown because the window is too narrow, that the _Scale stroke width_ box is not checked). If it is, toggle off the option.
    
    Select the box front (largest side). We want to be precise when we narrow the sides so we'll use the Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-transform.png)Transform... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**M****) dialog. Bring up the dialog and select the _Scale_ tab. Set the _Width_ box to 86.603%. This is equal to cos(30 ). Click on the _Apply_ button. Use the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ to drag the box front back against the other lower box side. It should snap into place.
    
    Next we need to skew the box front by 30 . This is easiest done with the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_. Click on the box front a second time to change the _scaling_ handles into _rotating_ and _skewing_ handles. When you do so, a small cross, the _[Rotation center](#RotationCenter "Rotation Center")_, should appear in the center of the selection. This is the reference point for rotation or skewing. Click-drag this cross to the upper-right corner of the box front. Be careful that it doesn't snap to the corner of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_. The cross should be centered in the middle of the _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_. If it isn't, it will lead to small alignment problems at end. You can zoom in to check.
    
    Now click-drag the _scaling_ handle (double headed vertical arrow) on the left side of the box front upward while holding down the **Ctrl** key. Using the **Ctrl** key will snap the skewing to multiples of 15 . Drag until the skew is −30  (watch the _[Notification Region](#notification)_).
    
    ![Front positioned.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/ISO/iso_03.png)
    
    After transforming the front of the box into place. The front of the box may be in front (as shown) or behind the top of the box depending on the order in which you grouped the sides.
    
    Repeat the last steps with the box side on the lower right, just interchanging “left” and “right.”
    
    The box top also needs to be narrowed by the same amount as the others, but this time in the vertical direction. Set the _Width_ back to its default value and the _Height_ to 86.603% before scaling the rectangle. Before skewing, move the _Rotation center_ to the lower right corner of the box top. Again make sure the cross is in the middle of the stroke width, aligned with the grid. Skew the rectangle 30  by dragging the top skewing handle right while using the **Ctrl** key. Finally, rotate the box top 30  clockwise by dragging the upper-left rotation handle while holding the **Ctrl** key down.
    
    ![The finished box of playing cards.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/ISO/iso_04.png)
    
    The finished box of playing cards.
    

The box of playing cards is now finished. Save your work as in the previous tutorials.

If you did not place the _Rotation center_ exactly as specified (e.g., on the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ rather than the middle of the stroke), you may have a small misalignment in the box sides. One can either redo the steps or simply nudge the offending side into place using the **Arrow** keys while holding the **Alt** key down.

![The box corner.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/ISO/iso_corner.png)

The corner of the top of the box inside the red circle doesn't meet the other corner correctly. This was the result of aligning the _Rotation center_ to the _bounding box_.

A Can of Soup—A Three-Dimensional Drawing with Gradients
--------------------------------------------------------

We will use Inkscape to draw a soup can. This example will cover: combining and dividing paths, using _[Gradients](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_, making shadows, and distorting text.

![A soup can.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_SoupedUp.png)

A souped-up soup can.

The steps we'll take are:

*   Start Inkscape, set the drawing size, and specify a grid.
    
*   Draw the can shape.
    
*   Add a gradient.
    
*   Add a shadow.
    
*   Add a label background.
    
*   Add the label text.
    
*   Spiff up the can top.
    

**Procedure 1.6. Drawing a Soup Can**

1.  **Set the canvas parameters.**
    
    Start Inkscape. Set the drawing size to 200 by 200 pixels. Set up a _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ with spacing of 5 pixels. Enable overall snapping (first ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap.png) ), snapping of nodes (third ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap.png) , tool tip: _Snap nodes, paths, and handles_), snapping to smooth nodes (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-nodes-smooth.png)), and snapping to the _Grid_. Disable snapping of _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ (second ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap.png) , tool tip: _Snap bounding boxes_).
    
2.  **Draw the can shape.**
    
    The can will be composed of two lines connecting parts of two ellipses. (One could use a rectangle to obtain the straight lines but that has the tendency of producing extra nodes.)
    
    1.  **Draw the top of the can.**
        
        Click on the _[Ellipse Tool]( "Ellipses, Circles, and Arcs")_ icon ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-ellipse.png) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_ on the left of the Inkscape window (or use one of the keyboard shortcuts: **F5** or **e**) to select the _Ellipse Tool_. Draw an ellipse to represent the top of the can by click-dragging between the 50 and 150 pixel marks on the horizontal axis and between the 150 and 180 pixel marks on the vertical axis. Give the ellipse a solid color _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ by clicking on a colored square in the _[Palette](#palette)_ (I've used light red).
        
    2.  **Draw the bottom of the can.**
        
        Duplicate the ellipse by selecting the ellipse (if not selected) and clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-duplicate.png) icon in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_ or using the menu entry Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-duplicate.png)Duplicate (****Ctrl**+**D****). A copy of the ellipse will be placed on top of the original ellipse. The new ellipse will be left selected.
        
        Move the ellipse down by click-dragging it while holding down the **Ctrl** key to constrain the movement to the vertical direction. Move it down until the top is at the 50 pixel mark on the vertical axis. You now have the top and bottom of the can.
        
        ![Top and bottom of soup can.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_01.png)
        
        The top and the bottom of the soup can.
        
    3.  **Draw the side of the can.**
        
        The side of the can will be formed by joining the bottom half of the top ellipse to the bottom half of the bottom ellipse. In the process, we will sacrifice both ellipses. Because we still need a separate top for the can as it will be colored differently from the body, we'll duplicate the top ellipse and sacrifice the new copy.
        
        Select the top ellipse and duplicate it as above. Then with the duplicate ellipse still selected, convert the ellipse into a path object by using the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****) command. The object will not appear to have changed but the underlying description is now an editable path.
        
        To edit the path, select the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png) icon (**F2** or **n**) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_. Select the top node of the path and delete it by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-delete.png) icon (Delete selected nodes) in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ or by using one of the keyboard shortcuts: **Backspace** or **Delete**.
        
        Open the path up by selecting the two side nodes and clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-delete-segment.png) (Delete segment between two non-endpoint nodes) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.
        
        Repeat the previous steps for the bottom ellipse (except for duplicating it). You should have a drawing that looks like the following one if you change the color of the still intact top ellipse:
        
        ![Drawing the side.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_02.png)
        
        The two half ellipses that will form the can side along with a full ellipse (color changed) for the can top.
        
        Next the top and bottom half ellipses need to be joined together. Select both and combine into one path with the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-combine.png)Combine (****Ctrl**+**K****) command.
        
        With the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_, select the two leftmost nodes, one from the top and one from the bottom. Join them by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-join-segment.png) (Join selected endnodes with a new segment) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. Repeat for the two rightmost nodes.
        
        You should now have a well-constructed can side, as shown below.
        
        ![Drawing the side 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_03.png)
        
        The side of the can after completing the side's path.
        
3.  **Add a gradient for a 3D effect.**
    
    A _[Gradient](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ can represent the reflections off the curved part of the can. There are two ways to add a gradient, the first is to use the _[Gradient Tool](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ and the second to use the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog. To add a _Gradient_ using the _Gradient Tool_, select the tool by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/color-gradient.png) icon (**Ctrl**+**F1** or **g**) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_. Then with the can side selected, click-drag from the left side of the can to the right side. To add a _Gradient_ using the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog, open the dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-fill-and-stroke.png)Fill and Stroke... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**F****)). Select the _Fill_ tab, if not already selected, and with the can side selected, click on the _Linear gradient_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-gradient-linear.png)) icon. Both methods create a default _Gradient_ across the can side using the preexisting _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color.
    
    The _[Gradient](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ needs a bit of work to make it look proper which is easiest done with the _[Gradient Tool](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_. Two _Gradient_ handles will appear when the can side is selected.
    
    ![Adding a gradient.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_04.png)
    
    After changing the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of the can side to a _[Gradient](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_. Note the _Gradient_ handles. They are displayed when a selected object has a _Gradient_ and the _[Gradient Tool](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_, _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_, _[Dropper Tool](#Attributes-Color-Dropper "Dropper Tool")_ or one of the _[shape tools]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ is in use.
    
    _[Gradients](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ are defined in terms of _[Stops](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_. A _Stop_ has a color and position (offset) in the _Gradient_. The default _Gradient_ has two _Stops_, both with the same color but with different transparencies. For the side of the can, we'll use three _Stops_.
    
    Add a third _Stop_ by double-clicking on the line connecting the two existing _Stops_ with the _[Gradient Tool](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ enabled and the can side selected. The cursor will have an extra + sign when it is possible to add _Stops_. When you add a _Stop_ it takes on the color of the _Gradient_ at the place where it is added. The look of the _Gradient_ will not change.
    
    The _Stop_ (handle) can be dragged to move it. Move it to the center.
    
    Now let's give our can a shiny metallic look. Select the leftmost _[Stop](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ by clicking once on it. Change the color to dark gray by either clicking on the _80% Gray_ swatch in the _[Palette](#palette)_ (a _[tool tip](#tooltip "tool tip")_ with the color name will be displayed when the cursor is over a swatch) or by using the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog. Both the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ tabs will show the color of the _Stop_ and can be used to change the color. With the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ tab; change the values to R: 51, G: 51, B: 51, A: 255.
    
    Select the middle _[Stop](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ and set its color to _White_ with the _Palette_ or R: 255, G: 255, B: 255, A: 255 with the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog. Finally, select the last _Stop_ and set its color to match the first _Stop_. You should now have a metallic can with a highlight that is in the center.
    
    ![Adding a gradient.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_05.png)
    
    After adding a stop to the _Gradient_ and changing the colors of all stops.
    
    Let's move the highlight to the side. One way to do this would be to further edit the _Gradient_, changing the position of the middle _[Stop](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ and maybe lightening or darkening the side _Stops_. However, the easier way is to move the _Gradient_ handles.
    
    ![Adding a gradient.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_06.png)
    
    After dragging the right _Gradient_ handle to move the highlight.
    
    Before we continue, let's make a couple of quick cosmetic changes: Turn off the _Stroke_ of both the can side and top (click on _x_ at left end of _[Palette](#palette)_ while holding down the **Shift** key). Change the color of the top to _40% Gray_ (R: 153, G: 153, B: 153).
    
    ![A can.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_07.png)
    
    A silver can.
    
4.  **Adding a shadow.**
    
    Our can has a light shining on it from the right but no corresponding shadow. We'll fix that now. To do it perfectly is not an easy feat. Inkscape is a 2D drawing program and cannot project shadows for 3D objects (try POV-Ray for that). But we can do a pretty good approximation.
    
    1.  **Create the shadow object.**
        
        For the shadow, we need to combine copies of the top and of the side of the can into one object. We'll play a similar game to that used to create the side of the can.
        
        Select the top of the can (an ellipse) and duplicate it. Change its color to make it easier to keep track of. Any color will do. Convert the new ellipse to a path (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****)). Remove the bottom node (change to the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_, ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-delete.png) ). Select the two side nodes and remove the line in between them (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-delete-segment.png)).
        
        Select the side of the can, duplicate it, and change its color. Remove the top three nodes. Select the remaining two side nodes and remove the line in between them.
        
        ![A can.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_08.png)
        
        After creating the top and bottom of what will become the shadow.
        
        Select both new objects. Combine them into one path (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-combine.png)Combine (****Ctrl**+**K****)). Select the two nodes on the left side, join them (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-join-segment.png)), and convert the path in between to a line (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/node-segment-line.png)). Do the same for the two right nodes.
        
    2.  **Distort the shadow shape.**
        
        Select the three top nodes and move them down and over, as shown below.
        
        ![A can.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_09.png)
        
        Distorting the shape for the shadow.
        
        It is clear that the side nodes are not properly positioned and the path is distorted. We'll make a few adjustments to set this straight. But first put the shadow object behind the can (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-bottom.png)Lower to Bottom (****End****)).
        
        Node _[handles]( "Bezier Curves")_ are used to control the direction and curvature of a path on either side of a node. The handles are the circles attached by straight lines to a node that are displayed when the node is selected. The lines are always tangent to the path at the point the path intersects the node. The distance between the handle and its node controls the curvature of the path—the farther away, the less curved is the path near the node. If no node handles are visible, make them visible by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/show-node-handles.png) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ or if the icon is not visible, check the _Show handles_ box in the drop-down menu opened by clicking on the down arrow at the right end of the _Tool Controls_.
        
        The nodes indicated by the arrows in the following figure need to be adjusted. The handle on the leftmost node needs to be rotated a small amount counterclockwise so that the handle line is parallel to the side of the shadow. This produces a smooth transition between the straight side and the curved part of the shadow. To make the rotation, drag the handle while holding down the **Alt** key (which keeps the distance between the handle and node constant).
        
        The other node indicated by the arrow also needs to have its handle adjusted in the same way. In addition, the node should be moved slightly down to the right so that the shadow's straight edge is tangent to the can's bottom.
        
        ![A can.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_10a.png)
        
        Adjusting the shadow. The two nodes indicated by the arrows have been adjusted by rotating the handles slightly so the handle lines are parallel to the straight side of the shadow. In addition, the lower node has been shifted up slightly (**Alt**+**Up Arrow**) so the shadow doesn't leak out at the bottom.
        
        Now change the color of the fill to _50% Gray_ (R: 127 G: 127 B: 127).
        
    3.  **Soften the shadow's edge.**
        
        The easiest way to soften the shadow's edge is to use the _Blur_ slider on the _Fill_ tab of the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog. A value of 3% gives a nice shadow.
        
        Select the new blurred shadow. Move the shadow to the back (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-bottom.png)Lower to Bottom (****End****)).
        
        One problem needs to be taken care of. The shadow leaks out from the bottom of the can in the front. Select the shadow and move it slightly up and to the left. You can do this either by dragging the shadow with the mouse or using the **Arrow** keys. Holding down the **Alt** key while using the **Arrow** keys will allow finer adjustments.
        
        ![A basic can.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_11.png)
        
        A basic can.
        
5.  **Add a label.**
    
    The label has the same curvature as the side of the can. To make the label, we'll take a slice from the can side and then decrease its height.
    
    Select the side of the can and duplicate it. Then select the _[Rectangle Tool]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ and draw a rectangle that extends from above the can to below the can and extends from 60 to 140 pixels in the horizontal direction.
    
    Select both the new rectangle and the duplicate of the can side. Use the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-intersection.png)Intersection (****Ctrl**+**\*****) command to form the label from the intersection of the two selected objects.
    
    Change the _Fill_ of the label to a solid red by clicking the red square in the _[Palette](#palette)_ or by first clicking on the _Flat color_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-solid.png)) icon in the _Fill_ tab of the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog and then changing the sliders to red (R: 255: G: 0: B: 0). Change the opacity to 50% using the _0:_ entry box in the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ (at the lower-left corner of the Inkscape window) or using the _Opacity_ slider in the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog. This will allow a bit of the can highlight to leak through. (If you desire a metallic label, just change the color of the gradient.)
    
    With the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_, select the three nodes along the top of the label at the same time and move them down 25 pixels. Move the bottom three nodes of the label up 25 pixels.
    
    ![A labeled can.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_12.png)
    
    A can with a label.
    
6.  **Add text to the label.**
    
    To add text to the label, select the _[Text Tool]( "Chapter 9. Text")_. Click somewhere on the canvas and type in the text “SPLIT PEA SOUP” with a carriage return after each word. To change the size and style of the text, use the drop-down menus in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. Pick an appropriate font (I've used Bitstream Vera Sans) and font size (18 pt or 24 px). The line spacing may need to be adjusted using the _line-spacing_ entry box (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text_line_spacing.png)). Change the line spacing to 1 without any unit in the neighboring unit drop-down menu. Finally, change the text to a nice Split Pea green with the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog (R: 63, G: 127: B: 0).
    
    Now, align the text to the center of the can. First click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-justify-center.png) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ to use the center of the text for snapping. Then in the _[Snap Bar](#snapbar)_ enable snapping of text with the _Snap other points_ (fourth ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap.png) ) and the _Snap anchors and baselines_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-text-baseline.png)) icons as well as the _Snap to grid_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/grid-rectangular.png)) icon. Finally, drag the text until it snaps to the center-most grid line.
    
    ![A can with a label and text.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_13.png)
    
    A can with a label and text.
    
    Now we have flat text on a round can! Inkscape can shift and rotate individual letters of text but it cannot skew the text as is needed for the characters toward the edge of the can. In order to skew the letters, we will convert the text into a path and modify the path. To do this, select the text and then use the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****) command. The text has become a _[Group]_ of path objects and can no longer be edited as text. It will be easier to modify the paths if they form just one path. Ungroup the objects using Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-ungroup.png)Ungroup (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**G****) and then combine the individual letters into one path using Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-combine.png)Combine (****Ctrl**+**K****).
    
    We'll use a couple of very handy _[Extensions]( "Chapter 22. Extensions")_ to do the hard work for us.
    
    Start by using the _[Add Nodes](#Extensions-AddNodes "Add Nodes")_ extension to increase the number of nodes in the path. This will improve the look of the final letters. Select the text path, then select Extensions → Modify Path → Add Nodes... . A small dialog will pop up, allowing you to set the upper limit to the space between nodes. Set the _Maximum segment length_ to 5.0 and click the _Apply_ button.
    
    Next we'll use the _[Pattern along Path](#Extensions-PatternAlongPath "Pattern Along Path (Extension)")_ extension to put the text on a path. There is a Text →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text-put-on-path.png)Put on Path command, but this uses the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ _textPath_ specification, which would result in the letters being rotated to follow the path.
    
    We need a path to put the text on. The path should be an arc with the same shape as the curve of the top ellipse but have the width of the text. Select the top _[Ellipse]( "Ellipses, Circles, and Arcs")_ of the top of the can and duplicate it (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-duplicate.png)Duplicate (****Ctrl**+**D****)). Move the _Ellipse_ straight down to the center of the can. Remove the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ but add a _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_. Add a _[Rectangle]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ that overlaps the bottom of the _Ellipse_, centered on the can and with the width of the text.
    
    ![Creating a path for the text.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_13a.png)
    
    Creating a path for the text from an oval that is a duplicate of the can top and a rectangle with the width of the text.
    
    The _[Rectangle]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ should be on top of the _[Ellipse]( "Ellipses, Circles, and Arcs")_. Select both and use the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-cut.png)Cut Path (****Ctrl**+**Alt**+**/****) command to divide the _Ellipse_ into two pieces. The _Rectangle_ will disappear. Use the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ to select the top piece of the _Ellipse_ and then delete it (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-delete.png)Delete (****Delete** or **Backspace****)).
    
    The extension requires that the _Pattern_ (text in this case) be above the path in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_ (that is, on top of the path). You can move the pattern to the top by selecting it and then clicking on the _Raise to Top_ (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-top.png)Raise to Top (****Home****)) icon.
    
    Next, select the text and the path. Call up the _[Pattern Along Path](#Extensions-PatternAlongPath "Pattern Along Path (Extension)")_ extension (Extensions → Generate from Path → Pattern along Path). This will open a dialog. In the dialog, select _Single_ in the _Copies of the pattern_ menu and _Ribbon_ in the _Deformation type_ menu. All the entry boxes should be 0.0 and none of the boxes should be checked. Click the _Apply_ button. The text might be backward. In that case, flip it with the Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-flip-horizontal.png)Flip Horizontal (****H****) command. Finally, delete the small arc.
    
    ![A can with a label and wrapped text.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_14.png)
    
    A can with a label and wrapped text.
    
7.  **Spiff up the can top.**
    
    There is no stopping at the level of detail you can add. In the final figure, a series of ovals of different sizes, positions, and gradients have been used to give the top of the can more realism. These ovals are shown in an expanded view in the next figure.
    
    ![A can top.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SOUPCAN/SoupCan_15.png)
    
    The ellipses that make up the can top in an expanded view with the relative sizes indicated.
    
    All the ellipses were created by taking the original can top, duplicating it, and then using the _Scale_ tab of the _[Transform](#Transforms-Transform "Transforms with the Transform Dialog")_ dialog. The fill was then changed to either a flat fill or a linear gradient with the same colors as used for the rest of the can.

========================================================

A Vine Design—A Tiling Example
------------------------------

Inkscape has a _[Create Tiled Clones]( "Chapter 19. Tiling")_ dialog that can be used to produce complex tilings. This tutorial covers preparing a base tile that can be used for such tilings. The objects in the base tile can overlap the tile boundaries to produce continuous designs, as shown below.

![A sample tiling.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/TILEPAT/tilepat_07.png)

A 3   3 tiling of a base tile.

The steps to produce a repeated tiling are:

*   Start Inkscape and set the drawing size.
    
*   Create a tile prototype.
    
*   Clone tile.
    
*   Decorate tile.
    
*   Use base tile for tiling.
    

**Procedure 1.7. Creating a Tile Pattern**

1.  **Set up the canvas.**
    
    To begin, start Inkscape and set the drawing size to a width of 400 and a height of 580 pixels. Create a _Grid_ with spacing of 10 pixels. Turn on snapping of nodes to _Grid_ (and off snapping of _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ to _Grid_). Don't forget to turn the _Grid_ on.
    
2.  **Create a tile prototype.**
    
    We need to create a tile prototype that consists of a rectangle in a _[Group]_. Having a _Group_ will allow adding new objects to the tile.
    
    Using the _[Rectangle Tool]( "Rectangles and Squares")_, create a rectangle 100 pixels wide by 160 pixels tall with the upper-left corner 50 pixels from the left edge and top. This will be the size of our base tile. Tile spacing will be determined by the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of this rectangle. There are two definitions for the _bounding box_. The first, called the _Visual_ _bounding box_, includes the _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ width in the calculation while the second, called the _Geometric_ _bounding box_, is calculated using just the nodes of an object. It will be easier to make tilings without worrying about the _Stroke_ width, so select the _Geometric_ _bounding box_ in the _Tools_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)).
    
    So we can visualize the tiles, give the tiles a _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ by either using the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog or by using a **Shift**+**Left Mouse Click** on one of the color swatches in the _[Palette](#palette)_. You can also give the tile a _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ by simply clicking on a swatch.
    
    Now _[Group]_ the tile by selecting the rectangle and using the Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-group.png)Group (****Ctrl**+**G****) command.
    
    ![Base tile.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/TILEPAT/tilepat_01.png)
    
    The base tile.
    
3.  **Clone the tile.**
    
    The next step is to clone the tile. This will give you a way to visualize the tile as it is decorated, making sure that objects that are near or overlap the boundary fit in properly.
    
    Bring up the _[Create Tiled Clones]( "Chapter 19. Tiling")_ dialog (Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-tile-clones.png)Create Tiled Clones... ).
    
    ![Create Tiled Clones dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/TILEPAT/Dialog_Tile_TilePat.png)
    
    _Tile Clones_ dialog.
    
    Select _P1: simple translation_ from the drop-down menu on the _Symmetry_ tab. This will produce a rectangular array of tiles. Choose the _Rows, columns_ option and set the number of columns and rows to three by entering 3 in both entry boxes. Make sure the base tile is selected in the drawing (_[Notification Region](#notification)_ should state that a “Group of 1 object” is selected) and click on the _Create_ button in the dialog.
    
    ![3x3 array of base tile.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/TILEPAT/tilepat_02.png)
    
    A 3   3 array of the base tile.
    
4.  **Decorate the tile.**
    
    It is time to draw the design on the base tile. Nine copies (clones) of the base tile have been created, including one on top of the original tile. It is necessary to modify the original tile if the copies are also to be modified. Select the original tile by clicking on any of the clones (_[Notification Region](#notification)_ will indicate a clone is selected) and using Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-select-original.png)Select Original (****Shift**+**D****). The _[Notification Region](#notification)_ should now say “Group of 1 object.” The original tile is below a clone. Bring it to the top by using Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-top.png)Raise to Top (****Home****) (click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-top.png) in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ bar).
    
    “Enter” the _[Group]_ by either double-clicking on the base tile or selecting _Enter group #xxxx_ from the menu that pops up when you **Right Mouse Click** the base tile. The _[Layer]_ name displayed in the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_ will start with “#g” indicating that a _Group_ is open for editing (the _Group_ has been temporarily been promoted to a _Layer_). While the _Group_ is open, any object added to the drawing will be a member of the _Group_.
    
    ![Layer name showing group being edited.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/TILEPAT/LayerName.png)
    
    The _[Layer]_ name in the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_ showing that a _[Group]_ is open for editing.
    
    Now that the _[Group]_ is open, add any details you want to the tile. Any detail you add to the base tile is automatically included in the cloned tiles. Our example has a continuous grapevine pattern. The main vine is a single line with the place and angle of the ends carefully adjusted for continuity at the base tile boundary. The _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of the base rectangle have been removed (the rectangle, itself, has not been deleted as it will be useful in the next step).
    
    ![3x3 array of decorated base tile.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/TILEPAT/tilepat_03.png)
    
    A 3   3 array of the decorated base tile. Note how some of the decoration extends outside the base tile (indicated by the black rectangle).
    
5.  **Use the base tile for tiling.**
    
    The newly created base tile can be used in several ways to decorate the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of another object. The easiest way is to use the base tile with the _[Create Tiled Clones]( "Chapter 19. Tiling")_ dialog to create a simple tiling that is then clipped with the path of the object.
    
    1.  Delete all the clones of the base tile. This can be done by either selecting each clone and deleting it or, quicker, by selecting the base tile and clicking on the _Remove_ button at the bottom of the _[Create Tiled Clones]( "Chapter 19. Tiling")_ dialog. (Note, the _Remove_ button will only be enabled if you have selected the base tile.)
        
    2.  Select base tile (if not already selected).
        
    3.  With _[Create Tiled Clones]( "Chapter 19. Tiling")_ dialog, create a tiling large enough to fill the object you wish to fill. Make sure _Use saved size and position of the tile_ box is checked. The tiling will then use the saved dimensions of the base tile before it was decorated (the dimensions when the first tiling was made) rather than the current _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_, which may include objects that extend outside the border. (Once an object has been tile cloned, Inkscape keeps a private record of the original tile size and position that can be used for later recloning.)
        
    4.  If one of the base tile objects has partial transparency it may be necessary to delete (or move) the base tile. If the base tile is deleted, the links to the cloned tiles are broken but the cloned tiles remain.
        
    5.  _[Group]_ the tiled clones. Move the object to be filled above the grouped clones in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_. Select both the object and the grouped clones and use the Object → Clip → Set command to make the clipping.
        
    
    ![Clipped tiles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/TILEPAT/tilepat_04.png)
    
    An oval path has been used to clip the tiling. To get the oval border, the oval path was duplicated prior to making the clipping. The duplicated oval was then given a black _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and no _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_.
    
    The base tile can be used for a _[Pattern](#Attributes-Patterns "Patterns")_ by selecting it and using the command Object → Pattern → Objects to Pattern (****Alt**+**I****). When the _Pattern_ is first used, you will notice that the spacing is wrong if some of the objects extended outside the borders of the base tile. This can be corrected by using the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_. In the _svg:defs_ section, select the _svg:pattern_ item that corresponds to the object with the pattern fill. This entry may be linked to another pattern. Follow the links until you find the entry with _height_ and _width_ attributes (and no other pattern links). Change the _height_ and _width_ attributes to the height and width of the base tile. Note that most _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ renderers will not draw areas that are outside the nominal area of the pattern (defined by the _height_ and _width_ attributes) despite setting the _style_ attribute to “overflow:visible”. Batik (which is used for the PDF version of this book) has rendering problems with this type of pattern. Evince, a popular Linux PDF displayer, also has a different bug rendering _[Patterns](#Attributes-Patterns "Patterns")_. Acroread will display _Patterns_ correctly.
    
    ![Base tile used for pattern.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/TILEPAT/tilepat_09.png)
    
    The base tile has been converted to a _[Pattern](#Attributes-Patterns "Patterns")_ that has been used to fill the oval. The pattern's internal height and width attributes have been adjusted to match that of the base tile.
    
    For some purposes, it may be preferred to have the entire design within the edges of the base tile. This is a bit tricky.
    
    1.  Unlink all the clones by selecting the clones and using Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-clone-unlink.png)Unlink Clone (****Shift**+**Alt**+**D****).
        
    2.  Delete the center clone of the 3   3 clone array.
        
    3.  Select base tile and move it to the center (it may be under a clone). Use the _Move_ tab of the _[Transform](#Transforms-Transform "Transforms with the Transform Dialog")_ dialog to precisely move the base tile (by its width and height). The internal information about the position and size of the base tile that is used for cloning is preserved.
        
    4.  For each object that overlaps the base tile but is not part of it, enter the _[Group]_ it belongs to (double-click on the _Group_), cut the object (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-cut.png)Cut (****Ctrl**+**X****)), enter the _Group_ of the base tile, and paste the object in place (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-paste-in-place.png)Paste In Place (****Ctrl**+**Alt**+**V****)). Pay careful attention to the _[Notification Region](#notification)_ to keep track of what is selected and the _[Layer]_ information in the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_ to see which _Group_ is open.
        
    5.  Delete the clones with the leftover objects.
        
        ![Base tile.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/TILEPAT/tilepat_05.png)
        
        The base tile with all the necessary decorations, before clipping.
        
        At this point, one could convert the base tile to a _[Pattern](#Attributes-Patterns "Patterns")_ (see above). There are still problems with some _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ renderers that can be worked around by modifying the _transform_ attribute with a negative translation in _x_ and _y_ for the _Group_ in the _Pattern_. Note that Inkscape ignores this _transform_ attribute.
        
    6.  In the opened base tile group, select the rectangle and cut it. Exit the group and paste it in place. Select both the base tile group and the rectangle and then use the Object → Clip → Set command. The base tile is now finished. You can translate it back to its original position using the _[Transform](#Transforms-Transform "Transforms with the Transform Dialog")_ dialog.
        
        ![Base tile clipped.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/TILEPAT/tilepat_06.png)
        
        The base tile, clipped and moved back to its original position.
        
    7.  The base tile can now be used in a tiling.
        
        ![A tiling.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/TILEPAT/tilepat_07.png)
        
        A tiling with the clipped base tile.
        
    
    Using the clipped base tile has one main drawback. There may be drawing artifacts where tiles abut. This is due to weaknesses in the drawing algorithms that don't properly handle cases where the tile's edge doesn't align with a screen pixel or other display quanta.
    
    Note that the clipped tile cannot be used directly as a _[Pattern](#Attributes-Patterns "Patterns")_. To create a pattern, first convert the tile into a bitmap (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-make-bitmap-copy.png)Make a Bitmap Copy (****Alt**+**B****)), then use that bitmap for the pattern. This method may also create drawing artifacts.

    An oval filled with a bitmap pattern. The pattern was created by first turning the base tile into a bitmap. Note the drawing artifacts between the tiles (e.g., _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ web version).
    

This tutorial has covered creating the most simple base tile. More complex base tiles with different symmetries can be just as easily created, as shown next.

========================================================

An SVG Button—SVG and the Web
-----------------------------

In building web pages it is often necessary to add some sort of button. What better way of doing so than with an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ button? This tutorial guides you through drawing a simple SVG button and then adding some functionality to it.

![An SVG button.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/BUTTON/button.png)

An _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ button.

The steps are:

*   Draw a simple button with 3D shading.
    
*   Use the button in an _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ page to access another web page.
    
*   Animate the button using _[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_.

SVG in HTML5

Support for _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ in browsers has greatly improved in the past few years. However, there are still some inconsistencies between the browsers so cross-browser testing is vital.

**Procedure 1.8. Creating an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ Button**

1.  **Drawing a Button.**
    
    There are countless ways to draw buttons as one can see by searching for button images on the web. This example uses a rather simple style that allows the button color to be defined by a _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ style sheet. The button's color will be the color of a base rectangle. 3D effects will be added using semi-transparent overlays.
    
    1.  **Set up the drawing.**
        
        With the _[Document Properties]( "Document Properties")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-properties.png)Document Properties... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**D****)), set the drawing size to 240   100 pixels. Create a _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ with spacing of 10 pixels and turn snapping nodes to the _Grid_ on (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/grid-rectangular.png)in _[Snap Bar](#snapbar)_).
        
        The default drawing templates in Inkscape include a _[Layer]_. This is a glorified _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ <g> (group) object marked by a special Inkscape specific attribute. _[Layers]_ are useful in Inkscape for a variety of things such as quickly hiding or showing sets of objects. For this project, _[Layers]_ are more a hinderance than a help. Remove the _[Layer]_ by opening the _[Layer]_ dialog (Layer → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-layers.png)Layers... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**L****)) and with the default layer highlighted, click the − button.
        
    2.  **Draw the base rectangle.**
        
        Draw a rectangle 220   80 pixels centered on the page (upper-left corner at 10, 90 pixels). Drag the _Corner Shape_ handle (circle at upper-right corner of rectangle) down as far as it will go to round the corners. Give the rectangle a red (or other color) _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_.
        
        ![Button base.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/BUTTON/button_01.png)
        
        The base of the button.
        
        It is useful to change the _id_ (the internal label) of the rectangle to “ButtonBase”. This will allow us to easily reference the rectangle to change its color via _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ style sheets or [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript").
        
        The _id_ of the rectangle can be changed using the _Object Properties_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-object-properties.png)Object Properties... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**O****)) or the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-xml-editor.png)XML Editor... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**X****)). We'll use the latter as we'll have one case later where the former won't work. Open the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog. Select the rectangle in drawing. The _XML_ entry for the rectangle will be highlighted on the left side of the _XML Editor_ dialog. The attributes for the rectangle are shown on the upper right. Click on the _id_ attribute on the right. This selects the attribute for editing in the entry area on the lower right. Change the _id_ value to “ButtonBase”. Either click the _Set_ button or use **Ctrl**+**Enter** to finalize the change. While looking at the dialog, note that the corner radius _ry_ is set to 40, half the height of the rectangle.
        
        ![XML Editor dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/BUTTON/Dialog_XML_Button.png)
        
        _XML Editor_ dialog (after rectangle relabeled).
        
    3.  **Add a highlight.**
        
        Now we'll add some 3D effects. First we'll add a reflection off the top. First draw a rectangle with a size of 180   40 pixels and with the top 10 pixels below the top of the base rectangle (upper-left corner at 30, 85 pixels). Change the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ to white so that the rectangle can be seen. Make sure that the _Corner Shape_ handle is half-way down the right side. If you have trouble moving the handle, try resetting the handle by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/rectangle-make-corners-sharp.png) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.
        
        The next step is to convert the rectangle to a path via Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****). Then, with the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_, select the path. The nodes should already be _Auto-smooth_ nodes. If not, select all the nodes and convert them to [_Auto-smooth Nodes_](#Paths-Node-AutoSmooth "Auto-Smooth Nodes") by clicking on the _Make selected nodes auto-smooth_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/node-type-auto-smooth.png)) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. Next move the bottom two nodes up 15 pixels. Shorten the bottom handes on the two side nodes to 5 pixels.
        
        Use the _[Gradient Tool](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ to add a _[Gradient](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ to the highlight. First select a linear _Gradient_ by clicking on the _Create linear gradient_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-gradient-linear.png)) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. Next, click-drag from the top of the base rectangle down to its center. This should create a gradient that is solid at the top and transparent at the bottom. If the colors are not white, select the _[Gradient](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ handles and click on the white square in the _[Palette](#palette)_. Then select just the bottom handle (a circle) and set the _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ to zero by clicking with the **Right Mouse** button on the _Opacity_ indicator (0:) in the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_. at the lower-left corner of the Inkscape window and selecting _0 (transparent)_ from the pop-up menu.
        
        Finally, with the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog, change the _id_ of the path to “ButtonHighlight”.
        
        ![Button with highlight.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/BUTTON/button_02.png)
        
        After adding the highlight.
        
    4.  **Add a glow.**
        
        Now we'll make the button glow a little bit by adding a rectangle with a radial gradient. The gradient will have a transparent center and darken toward the edges. First, select the base rectangle and duplicate it (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-duplicate.png)Duplicate (****Ctrl**+**D****)). Change the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ to black. Now use the _[Gradient Tool](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ to create a _Radial Gradient_ by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-gradient-radial.png) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ and then click-dragging from the bottom center of the rectangle upward. This creates a radial gradient that is black in the center and transparent on the edges. Swap the center and edge colors by using **Shift**+**R**. Set the _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ of the rectangle to 50% by selecting _50%_ in the menu that pops-up when **Right Mouse** clicking on the _Opacity_ indicator (O:) at the lower left of the Inkscape window. Stretch the gradient by dragging the horizontal _handle_ to the left about 50 pixels past the left edge of the page. Move the rectangle below the highlight by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-lower.png) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ of the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ or using the shortcut **Page Down**.
        
        With the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog, change the _id_ of the glow rectangle to “ButtonGlow”.
        
        ![Button with glow.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/BUTTON/button_03.png)
        
        After adding the glow.
        
        There are endless ways to enhance the visual effect of the button by adding shadows, more highlights, etc., but for the moment we'll stop here.
        
    5.  **Add some text.**
        
        Add some text to the button using the _[Text Tool]( "Chapter 9. Text")_. Choosing center-aligned text via the _Align center_ icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ makes it easier to keep text centered in the button. Click a bit below the center of the rectangle to begin adding text. Give the text a white fill. Change the _id_ of the `<tspan>` element to “Text” with the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog. To access the `<tspan>` object, you may need to click on the little triangle at the left of the `<text>` entry in the dialog.
        
        To help with a 3D effect, a copy of the text with a black fill can be placed behind the original text and shifted down one pixel. The text can also be moved behind the highlight to make the text look like it is inside the button. If you have added a copy of the text, change the new <tspan> _id_ to “TextShadow” with the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog.
        
        ![Button with text.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/BUTTON/button_04.png)
        
        After adding some text.
        
        Finally, save the button as `button.svg`.
        
2.  **Use the button in an HTML web page.**
    
    In this step we'll use the button in an HTML web page. We'll first use the button as a static object as one would use a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ button. The advantage of using an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ button, of course, is that is scalable.
    
    Here is a simple _[HTML5](#html5 "HyperText Markup Language, Version 5")_ web page to test our button (it uses _[XHTML](#xhtml "eXtensible HyperText Markup Language")_ so save the file as `test.xhtml` and in the same directory as the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file):
    
    <!DOCTYPE html>     ➊
    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">     ➋
      <head>
    
        <meta charset="UTF-8"/>     ➌
    
        <title>Sample use of an SVG Button</title>
    
      </head>
      <body>
    
        <h1>An SVG button</h1>
    
        <a href="http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/">
          <img src="button.svg" alt="A sample button."/>     ➍
        </a>
    
      </body>
    </html>
         
         
    
    ➊ _HTML_ declaration. (With _HTML5_ no “dtd” is required.)
    
    ➋ _HTML_ _Name Space_ declaration. The _XML_ syntax is specified here.
    
    ➌ The character encoding of the file (normally `UTF-8`).
    
    ➍ Inclusion of the _SVG_ file via the `<img>` tag.
    
    The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ button has been included via the `<img>` tag. Unfortunately, this tag does not have a simple means of providing a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ backup. The more useful `<object>` tag, which does have that ability will not pass mouse pointer events from the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ to the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ (i.e. to the `<a>` tag) in most browsers.
    
3.  **Animate the button using _[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_**
    
    The next step is to give our button a little pizazz. We'll do this via _[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_ animation. We could also use [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") ([ECMAScript](#ecmascript "ECMAScript")) but _[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_ animation has the advantages of being simpler and also working inside the <img> tag where scripting won't work. Unfortunately, _[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_ animation is not be supported in Internet Explorer and Edge (_[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_ also appears to be a bit of a resource hog).
    
    You can do a lot of things with _[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_ animation such as shifting or scaling parts of the button. We'll simply make the button “throb” by animating the “glow” rectangle. This will be done by varying the _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ of one of the _[Stops](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ of the “glow” _[Gradient](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_. To make the necessary changes, the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file must be edited using a text editor that can save the file as plain text.
    
    Open the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ button file in the text editor. Look for the rectangle with the _id_ “ButtonGlow”. Note the name (_id_) of the referenced gradient. This will be the value of the “url” for the “fill”. It will be something like “radialGradient3165” (the '#' is not part of the name). Now go to the `<defs>` section near the top of the file at find the radial gradient with the same _id_. This “radialGradient” will reference a “linearGradient” where the _[Stops](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ are defined. The name of this “linearGradient” will be found in the “xlink:href” line. Find the “linearGradient” in the `<defs>` section.
    
    Now that we have found where the _[Stops](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ are defined, we can edit the file. Find the _[Stop](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ with the _stop-opacity_ value of '0'. Change this “stop” from a self-closing tag to an opening tag. That is change: `<stop ... />` to `<stop ... >`. Next, add a “stop” closing tag: `</stop>` after the opening tag. Then insert the following lines between the “stop” opening tag and the “stop” closing tag:
    
           	<animate attributeName="stop-opacity" values="0;0.5;0"
              dur="2s" repeatCount="indefinite"/>
         
    
    The “stop” should look something like this:
    
           <stop
              id="stop3163"
              style="stop-color:#000000;stop-opacity:0"
              offset="0">
             <animate attributeName="stop-opacity" values="0;0.5;0"
               dur="2s" repeatCount="indefinite"/>
           </stop>
         
    
    The button should now slowly throb when viewed in a browser that supports _[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_ (not Inkscape!). The first part of the `<animate>` tag defines which attribute is being animated; most attributes can be, although colors may need a special `<animateColor>` tag. The next part gives a list of values that should be interpolated between. In this case, _stop-opacity_ begins with a value of zero which is ramped up to 0.5 and then back down to zero. The _dur_ parameter gives the time the animation should take to go through one cycle. The _repeatCount_ defines the number of times the animation should be repeated, in this case indefinitely. There are many more options but a full discussion of _[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_ is outside the scope of this book.
    
    ![Throbbing button.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/BUTTON/button_05.png)
    
    The throbbing button.
    
4.  **A two-state button with accessibility features.**
    
    We'll now modify the button to have two states. This will necessitate using [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") ([ECMAScript](#ecmascript "ECMAScript")) which means that the button will not work on a web page if embedded using the `<img>` tag. We'll keep track of the two states by using the value of the attribute _aria-pressed_. We could use any [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") variable to keep track of the state but by using this attribute, which is defined in the [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) specification, the state of the button can be monitored by accessibility programs such as screen readers.
    
    The first step is to add a couple attributes to the opening `<svg>` tag. The first is the _role_ attribute. This attribute, necessary for _[ARIA](#aria "Accessible Rich Internet Applications")_, defines the purpose of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. In this case, the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ is being used as a button so set the value to “button”. The second attribute to add is _aria-pressed_. This attribute, also required by _[ARIA](#aria "Accessible Rich Internet Applications")_, can have the values: “true”, “false”, or “mixed” (we'll use only the first two). It keeps track of the button state. Set the value to “false” to begin with.
    
           <svg
             ...
             role="button"
             aria-pressed="false"
             ... />
         
    
    Next, in the `<g>` tag add the two attributes: _onkeydown_ and _onclick_ to specify actions to be taken when a user activates the button. In both cases, the same [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") function, `buttonEvent(evt)`, is called. The _onkeydown_ attribute is not yet part of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard but is supported by many browsers. It is required for accessibility to allow a person to activate the button using the keyboard. The attributes are added here rather than in the `<svg>` tag to ensure that the button is active only when the mouse is over the visible parts of the button (which are all contained inside the `<g>` tag).
    
           <g id="layer1"
             onkeydown="return buttonEvent(evt);"
             onclick="return buttonEvent(evt);">
         
    
    The final step is to add the [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") just after the “defs” section (after `</defs>`). This is the script:
    
      <script type="text/ecmascript">     ➊
        function buttonEvent(event) {     ➋
          if ((event.type == "click" &amp;&amp; event.button == 0) ||
              (event.type == "keydown" &amp;&amp;
    	  (event.keyCode == 32 || event.keyCode ==13))) {     ➌
    
            var SVGDocument = event.target.ownerDocument;     ➍
            var SVGRoot     = SVGDocument.documentElement;
            var ButtonBase  = SVGDocument.getElementById("ButtonBase");
            var Text        = SVGDocument.getElementById("Text");
            var TextShadow  = SVGDocument.getElementById("TextShadow");
    
            var pressed = false;     ➎
            var fill = "red";
            var text = "OFF";
    
            if ("false" == SVGRoot.getAttribute("aria-pressed")) {     ➏
              pressed = true;
    	  fill = "green";
    	  text = "ON";
            }
    
            SVGRoot.setAttribute("aria-pressed", pressed);     ➐
            ButtonBase.style.setProperty("fill", fill, "");
            Text.firstChild.nodeValue = text;     ➑
            TextShadow.firstChild.nodeValue = text;
          }
        }
      </script>
         
    
    ➊ Start of script section. The “type” must be declared as `text/ecmascript`.
    
    ➋ Start of function called when the button is clicked (or when activated by a key press). A pointer to an “event” structure is passed to the function.
    
    ➌ The event is checked to make sure it is of a type we are interested in.
    
    ➍ References are obtained to the relevant _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ objects.
    
    ➎ Initial variable values. They should match what is declared in the body of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_. (This is not the most optimal way to structure the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ as the same values are defined twice. One could add an initiation function to set the values once.)
    
    ➏ Variables are toggled if necessary.
    
    ➐ The necessary attributes and properties are set.
    
    ➑ The text is changed. Note that the text is stored in a child node of the `<tspan>` object.
    
    ![Two state button.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/BUTTON/button_06.png)
    
    A two state button. Try it! function status(text) { document.getElementById("status").innerHTML = text; } The button is **OFF**.
    
    Our two state button is self-contained and would be useful, for example, in turning on and off an animation inside the same _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. To make it useful to control something external to the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file one just needs to call a function in the parent _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ document with the value of the current state. This is as simple as adding `top.status(text);` at the end of the “buttonEvent” function, where `status` is a function defined in the parent _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_. Inside the <head> section of the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ add:
    
        <script type="text/ecmascript">
    
          function status(text) {
            document.getElementById("status").innerHTML = text;
          }
    
        </script>
         
    
    And in the <body> of the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ add something like:
    
        <p>The button is <b id="status">OFF</b>.</p>
         
    
    ![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)
    
    Note
    
    This may not work locally due to cross-origin restrictions (CORS).
    
    If you would like to use the button several times on one web page you'll need to know which button has been pressed. You can find the _id_ of the object that wraps the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ by adding `var frameId = window.frameElement.id;` in the script inside the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file and then passing `frameId` as an argument in the call to the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ funciton (i.e., `top.status( text, frameId );`).
    
5.  **CSS styling.**
    
    This section will demonstrate how to style _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ with both internal and external style sheets. This section provides only an introduction into style sheets. A full discussion of _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ is outside the scope of this book.
    
    The first step is to remove the “fill” entry in “ButtonBase” rectangle's style attribute. Delete: `fill:#ff0000;`. If this is not removed, it will override any _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ style attribute. All lines referencing “ButtonBase” or “fill” should be deleted in the script as the style sheet will replace their functionality.
    
    For an internal style sheet, add a style section before the <defs> section in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file as shown below. Keeping it at the top makes the style sheet easy to find. The style sheet sets the color of the base rectangle with both a default value and an override value when the button is in a pressed state. As a bonus, the style sheet also dictates that when the mouse cursor is over the button the cursor should be changed to a pointer and that the button should be highlighted.
    
      <style type="text/css">     ➊
        rect\[id="ButtonBase"\] { fill: red; }     ➋
        svg\[aria-pressed="true"\] rect\[id="ButtonBase"\] { fill: green; }     ➌
        g:hover {cursor: pointer}     ➍
        g:hover rect\[id="ButtonGlow"\] {opacity: 0; }     ➎
      </style>
         
    
    ➊ `<style>` start tag with type declaration.
    
    ➋ This selector matches the rectangle with _id_ of “ButtonBase” and assigns a “fill” value of “red” to it.
    
    ➌ This selector matches the rectangle with the _id_ of “ButtonBase” but only when the “svg” attribute _aria-pressed_ is “true”. It overrides the previously line as it follows it in the style sheet.
    
    ➍ This selector matches the `<g>` object, but only when the cursor is above the _Group_. When the selector matches, the cursor is changed to a “pointer”.
    
    ➎ This selector matches the “ButtonGlow” rectangle when the cursor is above the <g> object. When the selector matches, the _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ of the “ButtonGlow” rectangle is set to zero, thereby highlighting the button (as the rectangle normally darkens the button).
    
    ![Styled Button.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/BUTTON/button_08.svg)
    
    The button styled via _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_.
    
    To use an external style sheet, remove the `<style>` section from the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file and paste it into a separate style file, removing the opening and closing `<style>` tags. Add at the top of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file, just after the _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ version and encoding line (if present):
    
    	 <?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="button.css" ?>
           
    
    where the “href” value is the style-sheet file name. This file can be shared between the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ and _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_, allowing one to keep all the styling in one place.
    
    Alternatively, one can include an external style sheet by using:
    
             <style type="text/css">
               @import url(button.css);
             </style>

A Neon Sign—Animation
---------------------

While Inkscape cannot directly handle animation, it is possible to use Inkscape drawings as a starting point for creating animation. This tutorial demonstrates two techniques for creating an animated neon sign. It also discusses a number of issues the artist must consider in creating the animations.

![An animated neon sign: (GIF).](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SIGN/Saturn.gif)

An animated neon sign. (_[GIF](#gif "Graphics Interchange Format")_).

![An animated neon sign (SVG). View page in Firefox, Opera, etc.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/QUICKSTART/SIGN/Saturn2.svg)

An animated neon sign. (_[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_).

 

Several things must be considered in planning an animation. The most critical is how will the animation be displayed? The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard includes provisions for natively incorporating animation via _[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_. Unfortunately, _[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_ is not supported by Internet Explorer 9 or Edge. All major web browsers support animation via [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)[JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") (or [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)[ECMAScript](#ecmascript "ECMAScript")). The browser vendors have put a lot of work ensuring that JavaScript is executed fast. An alternative method to using JavaScript is to use an external program such as Gimp to create an animated _[GIF](#gif "Graphics Interchange Format")_.\[[6](#ftn.idm140091226380896)\] In this case, performance is more than adequate but one loses several advantages of using _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_, such as scalability.

This tutorial is divided into two parts. The first part covers the creation of an unanimated neon sign and the second part covers animating the sign both via an animated _[GIF](#gif "Graphics Interchange Format")_ and by using [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript"). Attention is paid to the first part to facilitate the animation. Heavy use of the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ is made to give the various drawing objects names useful in the animation as well as to adjust some object parameters.

The full tutorial can be found in the print and PDF versions of the book. For more information, check the book's [web site](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/).

\[[6](#idm140091226380896)\] It is normally recommended to save drawings in the _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ format rather than the _[GIF](#gif "Graphics Interchange Format")_ format. Unfortunately, the animated versions of the _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ format, _[MNG](#mng "Multiple-Image Network Graphic")_ and _[APNG](#apng "Animated Portable Network Graphic")_, have limited support. This leaves the _[GIF](#gif "Graphics Interchange Format")_ format as the only real option for animation.

========================================================

A Bank Note—Security Features
-----------------------------

Bank notes are known for their various security features. Most notes include the heavy use of intaglio printing where the design is composed of complicated patterns of fine lines. Inkscape has many features that allow one to design attractive bank notes complete with a variety of security features. In this tutorial, we explore some of the tricks while creating a “50 Inkies” bank note.

The bank note is composed of a variety of different types of objects. Most of these objects are independent of each other. Unlike the other tutorials, there is no natural order in creating the drawing. Just pick and choose which features you want and how and where they are placed.

http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/Bottle.html
========================================================

A Bottle—Photorealism
---------------------

Inkscape can be used to produce photo-realistic drawings. Inkscape features that are useful for this include: _[Gradients](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_, the _[Gaussian Blur](#Filters-GaussianBlur "Gaussian Blur")_ filter, and _[Bitmap Tracing]( "Chapter 20. Tracing Bitmaps")_. This tutorial uses all of these to produce a realistic drawing of an old seltzer bottle. The source photograph is available on the book's [website](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/).

Our goal is to capture the essence of an antique bottle, not to copy all the fine detail (use a photograph for that). The hand-blown glass is irregular, something that would be hard to reproduce by hand drawing, even with gradients and blurring. To simulate the glass, we'll use the auto-tracing routines built into Inkscape. Tracing has its flaws, though, which we'll need to work around. The handle and background, on the other hand, are prime candidates for _[Gradients](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ and _Blurs_.

This section covers the manipulation of the files that are used by Inkscape. This includes the files for storing your drawings in the Inkscape format, and for importing and exporting drawings in other formats. All the commands to manipulate files can be found under the File menu. Several of the commands can also be found in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_ (New, Open, Save, Print, Import, and Export Bitmap).

Inkscape drawings are stored in _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files. While _SVG_ files are scalable, they have a nominal size defined by the _SVG_ "width" and "height" attributes. The width and height may be defined with units such as centimeters and inches, or without units, in which case the numbers are interpreted as pixels.

The internal scale is defined by the _viewBox_ attribute which sets the length of the initial _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ _[user unit](#user_unit "user unit")_. For example, one can use the _viewBox_ to set the internal scale such that a length of one is equivalent to a millimeter when the drawing is rendered with the nominal width and height. If the _viewBox_ attribute is missing then the internal scale is set so that the initial _[user unit](#user_unit "user unit")_ is equal to a pixel.

The nominal drawing size and internal scale can be changed by going to the _Page_ tab of the _[Document Properties]( "Document Properties")_ dialog. See the [the section called “Document Dimensions and Scale”](#File-Properties-Size "Document Dimensions and Scale") section at the end of this chapter.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Do not use absolute units with lengths inside SVG files

Except when setting the nominal width and height of an _SVG_ file, do not use absolute units (inches, millimeters, etc.) with lengths! In the early days of _SVG_, it was envisioned that setting the width of a rectangle to one inch ('1in') should produce a one inch wide rectangle on a CRT screen, a printer, or any other rendering device. This turned out to be impracticable for a variety of reasons. Eventually, the _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ standards group defined that one inch is equal to 96 pixels which in the case of _SVG_ is equivalent to 96 _[user units](#user_unit "user unit")_ (without any scaling transforms applied). Inkscape until v0.92 used a scale of 90 pixels per inch which lead to inconsistent rendering between Inkscape and web browsers when lengths with absolute units were used. Inkscape v0.92 uses the correct 96 pixels per inch value. Recent versions of Inkscape do not save lengths with absolute units but will instead convert them to _[user units](#user_unit "user unit")_ even when the GUI shows lengths with units. The normal user should never have to worry about this.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Sizing an _SVG_ for the Web

If you plan on using an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ in a Web page, see [the section called “Positioning SVG”]( "Positioning SVG").


http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/File-Open.html
========================================================

Creating and Opening Files
--------------------------

Upon starting, Inkscape normally creates a new blank drawing using the default template. This template can be changed by editing or replacing the file `inkscape/templates/default.svg`; see [the section called “Custom Templates”](#Customize-Files-Templates "Custom Templates") in [Chapter 24, _Customization_]( "Chapter 24. Customization").

Depending on how your operating system is set up, a preexisting Inkscape drawing may be opened by clicking on the drawing's icon or by giving the drawing's filename as a command-line argument. Drawings in other formats may be opened the same way if Inkscape supports the format. The supported formats are the same as those that can be imported into an existing drawing (see [the section called “Importing Files”]( "Importing Files") in this chapter for a list).

The following commands for creating and opening files are found under the _File_ menu:

*   _Updated for v0.91 (templates moved to separate menu entry):_
    
    File → New (****Ctrl**+**N****): Create a new drawing after Inkscape has been started using the default template. Clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-new.png) icon in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_ is an alternative way to access this command.
    
*   _New for v0.91:_
    
    File → New From Template... (****Ctrl**+**Alt**+**N****): Create a new drawing after Inkscape has been started using a template. Some templates include options to choose a particular size or allow customization.
    
    ![New From Template dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_NewFromTemplate.png)
    
    _New From Template_ dialog.
    
    ![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)
    
    Scale
    
    Each template has a default scale. Templates typically set the initial _[user unit](#user_unit "user unit")_ equal to the unit used to define the page dimensions, thus a template with a width of 210mm (A4 size) will have an initial _[user unit](#user_unit "user unit")_ equal to 1mm when the drawing is rendered at its nominal size. Normally you do not need to worry about the internal scale but there are some cases where it does have a noticeable effect. Having an appropriate scale helps to avoid small rounding errors where a dimension is stored in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file as 0.99999999 instead of 1. _[Filter Effects]( "Chapter 17. Filter Effects—Custom")_ (like blur) are defined in terms of the _[user unit](#user_unit "user unit")_ so they will look quite different, for example, in inch dimensioned templates where one _[user unit](#user_unit "user unit")_ is equal to one inch. The internal scale can be set on the _Page_ tab of the _[Document Properties]( "Document Properties")_ dialog.
    
    You can also add your own customized templates to your template directory. See [the section called “Custom Templates”](#Customize-Files-Templates "Custom Templates") in [Chapter 24, _Customization_]( "Chapter 24. Customization").
    
*   File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-open.png)Open... (****Ctrl**+**O****): Open an existing file. Multiple files can be opened at the same time by using **Shift**+**Left Mouse Click** to select more than one file from the file opening dialog. This command can also be used to create a new Inkscape drawing from a file with a non-Inkscape format. The file types that can be opened are the same as those listed in the _Importing Files_ section.
    
    ![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)
    
    Opening old Inkscape documents.
    
    Previous to version 0.92, Inkscape defined an inch to be equal to 90 _[user units](#user_unit "user unit")_. Version 0.92 changes this to match the current _SVG_ specification which, following _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_, defines an inch to be equal to 96 _[user units](#user_unit "user unit")_. All other _absolute_ units ("mm", "cm", "pc", and "pt") are defined in terms of inches so they too are effected by this change.
    
    When an old Inkscape file is detected that might be effected by this change, the _Convert legacy Inkscape file_ dialog will open offering the chance to update the file. Initially two options are offered:
    
    *   **This file contains digital artwork for screen display.** This choice is appropriate for pixel based artwork. The only change to the file will be that the internal representations of _[Grids](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ that use absolute units ("mm", etc.) will be converted to _[user units](#user_unit "user unit")_ (they will still be shown in the GUI with the selected _Grid unit_).
        
    *   **This file is intended for physical output, such as paper or 3D prints.** This choice is appropriate for artwork that is meant to be of a fixed physical size. If the drawing size (width and height) is defined in pixels, the width and height need to be scaled to account for the change in definition from 90 _[user units](#user_unit "user unit")_ per inch to 96 _[user units](#user_unit "user unit")_ per inch. If the drawing size is defined using absolute units, the width and height do not need to be scaled. However, in both cases all internal dimensions need to be corrected. There are two options for doing this correction:
        
        *   **The appearance of elements ... is most important.** This option adds an SVG _viewBox_ attribute to the document that sets scale such that the length of the _initial_ _[user unit](#user_unit "user unit")_ to be equal to 90 per inch relative to the _external_ dimensions. Note that if absolute units are used _internally_ in the document they will be interpreted according to the definition of one inch equals 96 _[user units](#user_unit "user unit")_ (at the current scale taking into account transforms). This is only a problem if you wish to hand edit the file and use absolute units internally or are using the drawing as input to software that does not understand the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ _viewBox_ attribute.
            
        *   **The accuracy of the physical unit size ... is most important.** This option attempts to recursively scale all internal dimensions to account for the change in definition of the _[user unit](#user_unit "user unit")_ relative to inches, keeping the _initial_ _[user unit](#user_unit "user unit")_ equal to 96 per inch relative to the _external_ dimensions. Getting all the scaling correct is quite difficult and thus this option should be used only if you need to use absolute units internally or are using the drawing as input to software that does not understand the SVG _viewBox_ attribute.
            
        
    
    The _Open_ dialog includes a folder of Inkscape example drawings under the entry _examples_.
    
*   File → Open Recent: Open a recently used file. Choose file from list in submenu. The _Recent_ menu list may include system-wide recently used files. This list can be cleared in the _Interface_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. Hovering the cursor over a filename will show the entire path to the file.
    
*   File →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-revert-to-saved-ltr.png)Revert: Revert a file to remove all changes made in the current Inkscape session.
    


http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/File-Save.html
========================================================

Saving Files
------------

_Updated for v0.91 (New templates dialog, updated Inkscape Preferences dialog)._

The following commands for saving files are found under the _File_ menu:

*   File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-save.png)Save (****Ctrl**+**S****): Save your drawing to a file.
    
*   File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-save-as.png)Save As... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**S****): Save your drawing to a file with a new name.
    
    The _Save As_ dialog includes a folder for Inkscape templates under the name _templates_. Saving a drawing with the name `default.svg` in this directory will replace the default template (the file opened when **Ctrl**+**N** is used). Saving in this directory under a different name will add the file as a template in the File → New From Template... (****Ctrl**+**Alt**+**N****) dialog.
    
    An option under the _Input/Output_ tab of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog allows one to choose between opening the _Save As_ dialog with the directory set to the same directory as that for the current open document or to the last directory where a file was saved using the dialog.
    
*   File → Save a Copy... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**Alt**+**S****): Save your drawing to a file with a new name but keep the old file name (and type) for future saves.
    

Inkscape will autosave backups if desired. The feature can be toggled on in the _Input/Output → Autosave_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. The interval between saves, the maximum of saves to keep, and the directory where the saves are placed can also be set here.


http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/File-Import.html
========================================================

Importing Files
---------------

_Updated for v0.92._

Inkscape is capable of importing many types of _[vector](#vectorgraphics "vector graphics")_ and _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_ graphics files. Most _bitmap_ files are handled internally by the _[GDK PixBuf](https://developer.gnome.org/gdk-pixbuf/)_ library. Some _vector_ files are handled by external programs, listed under the relevant entries. One special feature allows importing images from the [Open Clip Art Library](http://www.openclipart.org/), a free source of clip art. This is discussed at the end of this section.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

In Case of Failure

If importing fails to work, check the file `extension-errors.log` located on Linux at `~/.config/inkscape/` and on Windows at `%userprofile%\Application Data\Inkscape\`. Any missing programs (dependencies) will be listed.

Two methods exist for importing files into an already open document. The first is to use your window manager to drag a file and drop it onto an open Inkscape window. The second is to use the File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/document-import.png)Import... (****Ctrl**+**I****) dialog. These work for both _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_, _[vector](#vectorgraphics "vector graphics")_, and _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files.

### Bitmap Files

When bitmap files are imported, a dialog will open offering a number of import options.

![Bitmap Image Import dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_BitmapImageImport.png)

_Bitmap Image Import_ dialog.

*   **Image Import Type.** Either to _Embed_ the image or to _Link_ to it. Embedding a file will cause the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file to be larger (sometimes significantly) but the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file will be stand alone as a copy of the bitmap is encoded inside the file. If you link to the bitmap, you will need to move the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file and bitmap file together. If at a later time you change your mind, you can use the _[Embed Images](#Extensions-EmbedAllImages "Embed All Images")_ or the _[Extract Image](#Extensions-ExtractOneImage "Extract One Image")_ extensions to embed or extract images. See [the section called “Images”] in [Chapter 22, _Extensions_]( "Chapter 22. Extensions").
    
*   **Image DPI.** Attempt to extract the image resolution from the file or to use the _Default import resolution_.
    
*   **Image Rendering Mode.** Choose how the image is rendered. Options are:
    
    *   **None (auto).** The renderer can choose how to render the image. Inkscape renders the image using interpolation.
        
    *   **Smooth (optimizeQuality).** The image is rendered using interpolation. This value is appropriate for photos. CSS 3 dictates that this value is deprecated and is to be rendered with the same behavior as _auto_.
        
    *   **Blocky (optimizeSpeed).** The image is rendered using a _nearest neighbor_ algorithm leading to a blocky appearance. This is useful for line art. CSS 3 dictates that this value is deprecated and is replaced by _pixelated_. Inkscape v0.93 will recognize both values.
        
    

As of v0.93, Inkscape recognizes the CSS 3 values _smooth_ and _crisp-edges_, rendering both using interpolation.

**Bitmap Editing.** You can edit linked _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_ images with an external program by doing a **Right Mouse Click** on the image and selecting the _Edit Externally..._ option. The external program specified in the _Bitmap_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog will open with the image loaded. Inkscape will update the image if any changes are saved (updates will happen any time the linked _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_ file changes, not just when the editing was initiated from Inkscape). Note, you cannot edit an embedded image file with an external program.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

SVG Bitmap Support

The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard only requires renderers to support _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_, _[JPEG](#jpeg "Joint Photographic Experts Group")_, and _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ formats. The other formats that Inkscape supports internally due to GDK (ani, bmp, ico, pcx, pnm, ras, tga, tiff, wbmp, xbm, xpm) render fine in Inkscape. Other renderers, however, will most likely not support external files of these types referenced from within an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. When you select the embed option, Inkscape will convert the file first to a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_. Your safest bet is to either embed them or use another program such as Gimp or ImageMagick to convert these formats to _[JPEG](#jpeg "Joint Photographic Experts Group")_ or _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_.

Bitmap file types supported (a \* indicates the author has not tested the file import):

*   .ani (Windows Animated Cursor)
    
*   .bmp (Windows Bitmap)
    
*   .cur (Windows Cursor)
    
*   .gif (GIF: Graphic Interchange Format)
    
*   .icns (Apple Icon Image)
    
*   .ico (Windows icon)
    
*   .jpg, .jpe, .jpeg, jp2, .jpc, .jpx, .j2k, .jpf (JPEG and JPEG2000: Joint Photographic Experts Group)
    
*   .pbm, .pgm, .pnm, .ppm (PNM, Portable Anymap)
    
*   .pcx (PC Paintbrush Bitmap Format) _Dropped from _GDK_._
    
*   .png (PNG: Portable Network Graphic)
    
*   .qtif (Quick Time Image Format)
    
*   .ras (Sun Raster)\* _Dropped from _GDK_._
    
*   .tga, .targa (Truevision Advanced Raster Graphics Adapter) Common in video games.
    
*   .tif, tiff (TIFF: Tagged Image Format)
    
*   .wbmp (Wireless Application Protocol Bitmap Format)\* _Dropped from _GDK_._
    
*   .xbm (X-BitMap).
    
*   .xcf, .xcf.bz2, .xcf.gz (Gimp) Gimp native file format. May require installing extra _PixBuf_ library.
    
*   .xpm (X-Pixmap).
    

### Vector Files

Some _[vector](#vectorgraphics "vector graphics")_ file formats can include _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_ graphics.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

UniConvertor

A number of import types (PLT and SK1) use the program [UniConvertor](#uniconvertor "UniConvertor") to convert the file to _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_. On Linux it should be packaged as part of the distribution. _On recent Linux distributions, [UniConvertor](#uniconvertor "UniConvertor") appears to be broken._ On Windows and Macintosh, [UniConvertor](#uniconvertor "UniConvertor") is not include due to packaging issues.

*   .ai (Adobe Illustrator) Opens version 9.0 and later files (based on PDF). See PDF entry below. Older versions (based on PostScript) can be opened via [UniConvertor](#uniconvertor "UniConvertor") if you explicitly select _Adobe Illustrator 8.0 and below (\*.ai)_ in the file-type menu. If you don't have [UniConvertor](#uniconvertor "UniConvertor") available, change the file extension to ".ps" and open as a PostScript file. On Linux, you can use the **`file`** command to check the AI version.
    
*   .ai.svg (Adobe Illustrator _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_) Strips the input of everything in Adobe Illustrator _[Name Spaces](#name_spaces "name spaces")_, leaving the file as pure _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_.
    
*   _Updated for v0.91._
    
    .cdr, .ccx, .cdt, .cmx (CorelDRAW) Two import methods are possible (depending on how Inkscape was configured); both support versions 7 through X4. The first method imports files using [libcdr](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/DLP/Libraries/libcdr). The second method imports files using [UniConvertor](#uniconvertor "UniConvertor"). You can select which method is used by explicitly choosing the file type from the drop-down menu. [UniConvertor](#uniconvertor "UniConvertor") menu entries have "(UC)" in the menu label.
    
*   .cgm (Computer Graphics Metafile)\* Requires [UniConvertor](#uniconvertor "UniConvertor").

### Open Clip Art Library

The command File →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/document-import-ocal.png)Import From Open Clip Art Library opens a search dialog that connects to the [Open Clip Art Library](http://www.openclipart.org/) website, a source of free clip art. The dialog allows searching for drawings that match descriptive words. Previews of files are shown in a window on the right side of the dialog.

![Import from Open Clip Art Library dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_ImportFromOpenClipArtLibrary.png)

_Import From Open Clip Art Library_ dialog. An example of searching for a butterfly is shown.

You may have to set the server name (`openclipart.org`) in the _Input/Output → OpenClipArt_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. In the future, export to the library will also be supported.

Exporting Files
---------------

Inkscape is capable of exporting drawings to various types of _[vector](#vectorgraphics "vector graphics")_ and _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_ graphics files. Exporting methods are divided between exporting _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ (Portable Network Graphics) files and exporting to all other file formats. The _PNG_ graphics standard is a patent unencumbered standard that is supported natively by all major web browsers and graphics programs.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Setting Page Size to Drawing Size

You can set the page size to match the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of a selection by clicking on the _Fit page to selection_ button (v0.47) or opening the _Resize page to content..._ section and clicking on _Resize page to drawing or selection_ button (v0.48) in the _Document Properties_ dialog. This is useful for setting the page size _after_ creating an illustration. Margins can be set in v0.48.

### Exporting PNG (Portable Network Graphic) Files

Exporting a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ file is done through the _Export Bitmap_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/document-export.png)Export Bitmap... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**E****)).

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Note

This dialog _ONLY_ exports _PNG_ files, regardless of what file extension you use.

![Export Bitmap dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_ExportBitmap.png)

_Export Bitmap_ dialog.

At the top of the dialog are four buttons that give an initial setting as to what area of the drawing should be exported (except for the _Custom_ button, which does nothing). Once given an initial setting, the area can be adjusted.

*   _Page_: Export the area enclosed by the page. The default filename is the _SVG_ filename with the “svg” extension replaced by “png”.
    
*   _Drawing_: Export all objects in drawing (including those outside the page). The initial export area is the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of all the objects. The default filename is the _SVG_ filename with the “svg” extension replaced by “png”.
    
*   _Selection_: Export the region enclosed by the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ surrounding the selected objects. The default filename is the internal name of the last object selected.
    
*   _Custom_: Export the area defined in the entry boxes.
    

The area to be exported can be modified by the entry boxes in the _Export area_ part of the dialog. The units can be changed in the _Units_ pull-down menu.

In the _Bitmap size_ section of the dialog, the size of the exported bitmap can be defined. Inkscape uses a default conversion of 90 _[dpi](#dpi "dots per inch")_. The _Width_, _Height_, or width _dpi_ can be changed; changing one will change the others, preserving the height to width aspect ratio of the drawing.

In the _Filename_ section, a filename can be entered or one can open a dialog to browse for a filename.

There are two options at the bottom of the dialog. The first one, _Batch export n selected objects_, is available if more than one object is selected. If checked, each of the selected objects will be exported into its own file. The name of the file will be the _id_ name for the object (see _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog) unless an object has been previously saved with a specific filename, in which case the previous filename will be used (the filename is stored under the _export-filename_ attribute). The resolution will be 90 _[dpi](#dpi "dots per inch")_ unless previously saved with a different _[dpi](#dpi "dots per inch")_. Note: Batch export will overwrite files without warning.

The second option, _Hide all except selected_, is available if one or more objects are selected. If checked all unselected objects will be hidden during export.

The following figure shows a test file exported to a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_. The file includes basic shapes, a linear _[Gradient](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_, a _[Pattern](#Attributes-Patterns "Patterns")_, a _[Clipping]_, and a blur _[Filter]( "Chapter 17. Filter Effects—Custom")_ applied to text.

![Export test: PNG.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILES/FileExportTest.png)

Export test: PNG.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Slicing a Drawing

To slice a drawing into pieces for use on the web, you can create an array of hidden rectangles (no _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_) in a separate “export” _[Layer]_. Save each rectangle one time to define the export filename (or change each rectangle “Id” with the _[Export Bitmap](#File-Export-PNG "Exporting PNG (Portable Network Graphic) Files")_ dialog prior to any exporting). Then when it is time to export the drawing, go to the “export” layer, use the command Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-select-all.png)Select All (****Ctrl**+**A****) to select all the rectangles in the _[Layer]_, then do a batch export.

![Four slices.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILES/FileExport_Slices2.png)

Four slices created using batch export.

_New in v0.48_: The _[Slicer](#Extensions-Web-JavaScript "JavaScript")_ extension facilitates creating slices and producing the necessary _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ and _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ for their use.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Tip

The default window size for the dialog may be too narrow to view the output filename including the directory path. Just widen the window to see the entire path.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Rendering Errors

Inkscape v0.47 has rendering problems when two objects touch each other along a common border. This is often seen when a _[Pattern](#Attributes-Patterns "Patterns")_ is used for a _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_. This has been significantly improved in v0.48. Firefox, Opera, and Batik do not have this problem. Batik can be used to produce a high-quality _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_, _[JPEG](#jpeg "Joint Photographic Experts Group")_, or _[TIFF](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file.

Inkscape saves metadata, if included in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. Author, Copyright, Creation Time, Description, and Title fields are some of the fields saved. _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ metadata can be viewed using the ImageMagick `identify` command.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

### Exporting Other File Types

Exporting to a type other than a _PNG_ is done through the _Save As_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-save-as.png)Save As... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**S****)). The file type is chosen from a pull-down menu. Additional programs are required for many of the file exports. Required programs are mentioned under each file type entry.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

UniConvertor

A number of export types (PLT, SK1, and WMF) use the program [UniConverter](http://www.sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&product=uniconvertor). Inkscape includes this program in the Windows build. As of UniConvertor version 1.1.4 text is not exported. References to text in the drawing may prevent proper file conversion (even if converted to a path). The work-around is to convert text to path and then search the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file to remove references to fonts. It is planned that UniConvertor version 1.1.5 will handle text.

Note for Fedora Users: The executable `uniconv` was renamed to `uniconvertor` to avoid a naming conflict. You can add a “symbolic link” from `/usr/bin/uniconv` to `/usr/bin/uniconvertor` (if you don't already have a binary with that name) or you can edit files like `cdr_input.inx` and `cdr2svg.sh` in the `share/inkscape/extensions` directory.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

In Case of Failure

If exporting fails to work, check the file `extension-errors.log` located on Linux at `~/.config/inkscape/` and on Windows at `%userprofile%\Application Data\Inkscape\`. Any missing programs (dependencies) will be listed.

File types supported (a \* indicates the author has not tested the file export):

*   .ai (Adobe Illustrator). Inkscape v0.46 and earlier supported export to the Adobe Illustrator version 8.0 file format which is a modified form of the EPS level 2 format. This support has been removed since Adobe Illustrator versions 10 (2001) and later can directly import _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files. This is a better solution as the quality of the AI export was poor.
    
*   .dxf (AutoCAD, Desktop Cutting Plotters). Inkscape provides two distinct DXF export routines. The first is geared toward [CAD](#cad "Computer-Aided Design") uses and the second toward desktop cutting plotters.
    
    *   _AutoCAD DXF_: This routine uses Pstoedit with Ghostscript to produce a DXF file compatible with AutoCAD release 12. This is a rather ancient file format (1992!). QCad can be used to translate the file into a more recent format. There has been a slight improvement in export in v0.48. The options available are the same as for PostScript output.

        Export test: DXF, AutoCAD. As read in by QCad.
        
    *   _Desktop Cutting Plotter_: A built-in routine is used to output files directed at desktop plotters like Wishblade and Craft ROBO. The file format is a simplified form compatible with AutoCAD release version 13 or later. One option targets Craft ROBO Desktop plotters that require an even simpler file format. Another option, added for v0.48, toggles on/off _LWPOLYLINE_ use.
        
        The packages _python-lxml_ and _numpy_ are required.

        Export test: DXF, Desktop Cutting Plotter. As read in by QCad.
        
        Note that there is a [_Convert to Dashes_](#Extensions-ConvertToDashes "Convert to Dashes") extension that turns a _[Path]( "Chapter 7. Paths")_ with _[Dashes](#Attributes-Stroke-Dashes "Dashes")_ to an identical-looking _[Path]( "Chapter 7. Paths")_ composed of individual sub-paths.
        
    
*   .emf (Enhanced Meta File)\*. Only works with Windows. Only exports _[Strokes]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and _[Fills]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ with solid colors.
    
*   .eps (Encapsulated PostScript). With just a few minor differences, the generation of an EPS file is identical to a PostScript file. See .ps section below details of options in the export dialog
    
    The major difference from an artist's perspective is that the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of the EPS file is set to the smallest rectangle that fully encloses all drawn objects as per the [EPS specification](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/postscript/pdfs/5002.EPSF_Spec.pdf). Selecting _Export area is page_: does not change this. This unfortunate “limitation” is encoded in the Cairo graphics package used for PostScript, EPS, and PDF output. If you want the bounding box to match the page, you can use one of the following:
    
    *   Include a white rectangle covering the page in the background.
        
    *   Save as a PostScript file, changing the file extension to `.eps` (this should work in most cases; see following paragraph).
        
    *   Hand-edit the `%%BoundingBox` line near the top of the EPS file.
        
    
    There are a couple more differences between Cairo-generated EPS and PostScript files that mostly concern experts: Both file types include a _%%BoundingBox_ line and a _showpage_ command. The _showpage_ command should be ignored when an EPS file is embedded in a PostScript file. A Cairo-generated EPS file includes code to clean up after itself if it has left junk on the dictionary stack or operand stack. A Cairo-generated PS file includes an error message if the printer supports a lower PostScript level than specified in the file.

Right: The exported EPS file with the _Export area is drawing_ option not selected (this is the default when exporting from the _[GUI](#gui "Graphics User Interface")_). The _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ is shown.
    
*   .fx (JavaFX). Saves file in the [JavaFX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX) format via an internal Inkscape routine. No options are available. Only paths and shapes are supported. _[Gradients](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ are partially supported (endpoints of _Gradient_ are not defined). _[Patterns](#Attributes-Patterns "Patterns")_ are not supported and references to them will need to be hand-edited from the FX file.

    Export test: JavaFX.
    

*   .gpl (Gimp Palette). Saves a list of colors used in the drawing to a Gimp Palette file. The file can then be moved to the Inkscape palette directory (`share/inkscape/palettes/`) and the palette can be selected in the _[Palette](#palette)_ bar or the _[Swatches](#Attributes-Color-Swatches "Palette and Swatches Dialog")_ dialog. Requires PyXML module.
    
*   .hpgl (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language). See also .plt format that follows. Saves file in the [HPGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPGL) format, useful with various plotters and cutters. An Inkscape\-supplied export routine is used. The _Mirror Y-axis_ box should be checked to preserve the same orientation as shown in the Inkscape program.

*   .odg (Open Document Graphic). Limited support, better support planned.\[[7](#ftn.idm140578976519648)\] Currently only export of paths, shapes, and text is supported. Text and paths may initially be invisible. You can select them and change the _Stroke_ style from “Invisible” to “Continuous”. Some objects may be shifted.
    
    ![Export test: ODG.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILES/FileExportTest_PlainText_ODG.png)
    
    Export test: ODG.The text was initially invisible.
    
*   .pdf ([PDF](#pdf "PDF")). Inkscape uses a [Cairo\-based](http://cairographics.org/) exporter. It is recommended that at least _cairo 1.5.2_ be used. Note, a pattern that consists of a _[Group]_ created off the page may not work. Note also that the _[Print]( "Printing Files")_ dialog can also be used to produce a PDF file.
    
    ![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)
    
    Evince and Acroread
    
    Older versions of Evince, a popular Linux PostScript and PDF viewer, do not show gradients with _[transparency](#transparency "transparency")_ nor handle _[Patterns](#Attributes-Patterns "Patterns")_ properly. Try Acroread instead. Note also that Evince PDF processing has better anti-aliasing than Evince PostScript processing.
    
    The _Portable Document Format_ dialog offers a variety of options:
    
    *   _PDF Version_: Only one option: PDF 1.4.
        
    *   _Convert text to paths_: Characters in text strings are converted to paths. Fonts are normally subsetted and saved in the file.
        
    *   _New in v0.48:_
        
        _PDF+LaTeX: Omit text in PDF, and create LaTeX file_: Creates a PDF file with text excluded and a LaTeX file with text to overlay the PDF file so that the text font matches that of the LaTeX document and LaTeX math equations in the drawing can be typeset by LaTeX. Supports text alignment and text color (with transparency). See [PDF, PostScript, or EPS with LaTeX Overlay](#LaTeX_with_Overlay "PDF, PostScript, or EPS with LaTeX Overlay") entry in this section.
        
    *   _Rasterized filter effects_: Converts filter effects to bitmaps. If not enabled, objects with filters are not drawn.
        
    *   _Resolution for rasterization_: Sets _[dpi](#dpi "dots per inch")_ for rasterized filter effects.
        
    *   _Export area is drawing_: Sets the area for the PDF to the area that includes all the drawing elements, even if out of the _[Page](#page)_ area.
        
    *   _Export area is page_: Export only objects in _[Page](#page)_. Useful with following option.(Default when not exporting one object.)
        
    *   _Limit export to object with ID_: Limits export to only the object listed. If you want to select more than one object, use a _[Group]_.

    Uniconverter Failure
    
    If you have a version of UniConvertor older than 1.1.4, conversion will silently fail, producing an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file instead. You can examine the file with a text editor. An _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file will include an _`<?xml version...>`_ declaration on the first line, while a PLT file will be a solid mass of letters and numbers without spaces.

*   .png (PNG via Cairo) Saves file as a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ via Cairo. Better export is performed using the File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/document-export.png)Export Bitmap... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**E****) command. This routine is mainly for testing Cairo-based export. It always adds a non-transparent white background.
    
    ![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)
    
    Note
    
    You will probably have much better results in exporting to a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ if you use the _[Export Bitmap](#File-Export-PNG "Exporting PNG (Portable Network Graphic) Files")_ dialog.
    
*   .pov (POV-Ray). Saves shapes and paths, with color and transparency, as _prism_ objects. Stroke is not saved. To render a drawing, a camera with lights, and so forth, must be defined. See `share/inkscape/examples/istest.pov` for an example.
    
    ![Export test: POV.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILES/FileExportTest_POV.png)
    
    Export test: POV.
    
*   .ps (PostScript). Inkscape uses a [Cairo\-based](http://cairographics.org/) exporter. It is recommended that at least _cairo 1.5.2_ be used. Note, a pattern that consists of a _[Group]_ created off the page may not work. Note also that the _[Print]( "Printing Files")_ dialog can also be used to produce a PostScript file. PostScript output relies on bitmap fallbacks more than PDF output. This includes any place transparency is used. Finally, the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of the PostScript file will by default be scaled by 80% from the %bbox\_nl; of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. This is the ratio of the PostScript standard 72 points per inch to the 90 pixels per inch default of Inkscape.
    
    The _PostScript_ dialog offers a variety of options:
    
    *   _Restrict to PS level_: Either PostScript level 2 or PostScript level 3.
        
    *   _Convert texts to paths_: Characters in text strings are converted to paths. Fonts are normally subsetted and saved in the file.
        
    *   _New in v0.48:_
        
        _PS+LaTeX: Omit text in PS, and create LaTeX file_: Creates a PostScript file with text excluded and a LaTeX file with text to overlay the PostScript file so that the text font matches that of the LaTeX document and LaTeX math equations in the drawing can be typeset by LaTeX.

    There are a number of ways to use Inkscape with LaTeX. The first is to export as a LaTeX file with _PSTricks_ macros. The second is to export as a PDF, PostScript, or EPS file with the text moved to a LaTeX overlay; this allows LaTeX to typeset the text. The third is to export as an EPS file and have LaTeX use the _psfrag_ package to replace text labels with text defined inside LaTeX. A fourth is to use the _[Latex Formula](#Extensions-Latex "LaTeX Formula")_ extension that uses LaTeX to typeset an equation and re-import it into Inkscape as a path. And a fifth is to Inkscape to design LaTeX presentations; see [Latex Presentation Designer](http://jedidiah.stuff.gen.nz/lpd.html). The first three will be discussed here in turn.
    
    *   **LaTeX with PSTricks Macros. ** In the method, Inkscape exports the drawing as series of PSTricks macros. This requires that PSTricks package to be installed, which is normally included with LaTeX.
        
        Here is an example of a LaTeX file to use with Inkscapes tex output saved in the file `FileExportTest.tex`.
        
        \\documentclass\[12pt\]{article}
        \\usepackage{pstricks}
        \\begin{document}
        
        Test of PSTricks with Inkscape.
        
        \\input{FileExportTest.tex}
        
        \\end{document}
               
        
        ![Export test: LaTeX.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILES/FileExportTest_TEX.png)
        
        Export test: LaTeX (with PSTricks).
        
    *   **PDF, PostScript, or EPS with LaTeX Overlay.** In the method, you insert LaTeX text strings into your drawing. On export to PDF, PostScript, or EPS, check the _PDF+LaTeX: Omit text in PDF, and create LaTeX file_ (or equivalent box for PostScript or EPS); the text will be excluded on export and instead be inserted into a LaTeX file that can be overlayed on the figure inside LaTeX. This has the advantage that the text font matches between the drawing and the rest of the document as well as the ability to typeset LaTeX math equations. This method supports text alignment and text color (transparency is supported in PDF export but not PostScript or EPS as the latter formats do not support transparency). See [svg-inkscape](http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/svg-inkscape/) on CTAN for more details.
        
        Here is an example of its use:
        
        \\documentclass\[12pt\]{article}
        \\usepackage{graphicx}
        \\usepackage{color}
        \\begin{document}
        
        \\Huge
        \\def\\svgwidth{3.333in}
        \\input{FileExportText\_LaTeX.pdf\_tex}
        
        \\end{document}
        
               
        
        ![Export test: PDF with LaTeX overlay.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILES/FileExportTest_LATEX.png)
        
        Export test: PDF with LaTeX overlay. The phrase “Export Test” has been replaced by a LaTeX expression in the Inkscape file.
        
    *   **LaTeX with psfrag LaTeX Package.** In the method, you put text tags as placeholders inside of Inkscape. You then export the file to EPS (without converting the text to a path and without manual kerning!). The _psfrag_ package then finds the tags and replaces them with LaTeX expressions.
        
        Here is an example of a LaTeX file to use with Inkscapes tex output saved in the file `FileExportTest.tex`.
        
        As of v0.47, this method will fail as the Cairo-based export uses font subsetting (storing only the characters actually used and then using an index to reference these characters) to save space thus your strings can't be found. A work-around is to search the PostScript file for strings of the form _<01020304>Tj_ or _\[<010203>-1<0405>-1<06>-1<07>1<08>129<090a06>\]TJ_ and replace them by strings of the form _(Export Test)Tj_. It is probably better just to use the previous method of saving a PDF, PostScript, or EPS file with a LaTeX overlay.
        
        Here is an example of its use:
        
        \\documentclass\[12pt\]{article}
        \\usepackage{graphicx}
        \\usepackage{psfrag}
        \\begin{document}
        
        \\Huge
        \\psfrag{Export Test}{PSFrag: $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$}
        \\includegraphics{FileExportTest\_PlainText.eps}
        
        \\end{document}
        
               
        
        ![Export test: LaTeX with psfrag.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILES/FileExportTest_PSFRAG.png)
        
        Export test: LaTeX using an EPS file with simple text with psfrag. The phrase “Export Test” has been replaced by a LaTeX expression.
        
    
*   .svg, .svgz (_SVG_, _SVG_ compressed). Several options are available: Plain _SVG_ and _SVG_ with Inkscape extensions (for storage of Inkscape meta data). In theory, any program that reads _SVG_ files should ignore the Inkscape extensions. One additional option is to save an “Optimized” _SVG_ file. This file has been passed through the [_Scour_](http://www.codedread.com/scour/) script to make the file as small as possible.
    
*   .wmf (Windows Metafiles)\*. Requires [UniConverter 1.1.4](http://www.sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&product=uniconvertor). No options available.

Export resolution is fixed at one Inkscape pixel to one Gimp pixel. Requires Python, PyXML, and Gimp 2.2 or higher. Both Gimp and Inkscape must be in the executable path.
    
    In the export dialog for XCF one can choose whether the _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ and _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_ should be saved. If saved, they can be viewed in Gimp by toggling them on under the View → Show Grid and View → Show Guides menu items. Only rectangular _Grids_, and vertical and horizontal _Guide Lines_ will be saved.

*   .zip (Compressed Inkscape _SVG_ with Media). This option will save the drawing as an Inkscape _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file and then package that along with all included (linked) graphics files as a _zip_ package. The resulting file cannot be read directly by Inkscape. However, when the file is uncompressed, all the included graphics should be placed where Inkscape can find them when the _SVG_ file is opened.

Printing Files
--------------

Printing your drawing can be done through the File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-print.png)Print... (****Ctrl**+**P****) dialog. The standard GTK print dialog is used. This allows printing to any PostScript-capable printer as well as to either a PostScript or PDF file. Printing uses [Cairo\-based](http://cairographics.org/) routines. The PostScript back-end makes heavy use of rasterizing the image. This is partly due to the fact that PostScript does not support transparency.

![Print dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Print.png)

_Print_ dialog.

There are two options for rendering output found under the _Rendering_ tab. The first _Vector_ uses vector operators. The drawing is scalable.

The second option is _Bitmap_, which rasterizes the output. There is an option to set the DPI for the output.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Using a PS File as an EPS File

An Inkscape PostScript file can be normally be used as an Encapsulated PostScript file (EPS) as it already has a “BoundingBox” line. You may need to change the first line from `%!PS-Adobe-3.0` to `%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0` and delete the “showpage” at the end of the file.

Vacuuming Files
---------------

The command File →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/document-cleanup.png)Vacuum Defs removes unused definitions from the _[<defs>]_ section of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. This includes things like unused gradients, patterns, markers, and filters.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

(****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**D****) dialog. Document properties include things like the document dimensions and internal scale, metadata such as copyright and license information, color profiles, etc.

### Document Dimensions and Scale

_Updated for v0.92._

The document (page) size can be changed at anytime by going to the _Page_ tab of the _[Document Properties]( "Document Properties")_ dialog. You can choose a predefined _Page size_ such as A4 or US Letter, or you can set a custom size. The _Resize page to content..._ option allows you to automatically set the size of the drawing to the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of the drawing or a selection within the drawing, and with or without margins.

### File Metadata and License

_Updated for v0.91._

You can add _Metadata_ to a drawing via the _Metadata_ tab of the _[Document Properties]( "Document Properties")_ dialog. This includes a variety of fields such as author and copyright date. A license for the document can be selected on the _License_ tab of the same dialog.

The view presented by the Inkscape window can be changed in many ways. The changes can be divided into two types: those that change the way drawings appear and those that change how the Inkscape interface appears. A few of the latter type of changes are covered in other chapters such as [Chapter 5, _Positioning and Transforming_]( "Chapter 5. Positioning and Transforming"), for _[Grids](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ and _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_, and [Chapter 24, _Customization_]( "Chapter 24. Customization"), for changing parts of the _[GUI](#gui "Graphics User Interface")_.

An Inkscape drawing can be viewed in many different ways. The view can be changed by panning and by zooming the canvas. The Inkscape window can be made full screen. Multiple views of the same canvas are possible. An _[Outline](#View-Misc-OutlineMode "Outline Mode")_ or _Wire-frame_ mode is available as well as an _[Icon Preview](#View-Misc-IconPreview "Icon Preview")_ window.

Panning the Canvas
------------------

The region of the canvas that is visible can be changed via

*   _[Scroll Bars](#scrollbars)_: Perhaps the easiest method. The visibility of the scroll bars can be toggled using **Ctrl**+**B**.
    
*   **Mouse Wheel**: pan up and down. **Shift**+**Mouse Wheel**: pan sideways.
    
    By checking the _Mouse wheel zooms by default_ button under the _Scrolling_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog, the function of the **Mouse Wheel** changes to zooming while the normal **Ctrl**+**Mouse Wheel** changes to panning up and down. This is the normal behavior in CorelDRAW and AutoCAD.
    
*   **Middle Mouse Drag**. With a two-button mouse, use **Shift**+**Right Mouse Drag** or **Ctrl**+**Right Mouse Drag**.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**Arrow** keys.
    
*   **Space Bar**+**Left Mouse Drag** will pan the canvas if the _Left mouse button pans when Space is pressed_ option is checked in the _Scrolling_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. Turning this option on prevents using the **Space Bar** to toggle between tools.

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

Zooming the Canvas
------------------

The canvas can be zoomed in and out in many ways. For many of the options, the zoom changes by a default factor of 1.41 (repeat twice to zoom by a factor two). This factor can be changed in the _Steps_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog.

By default, a zoom of “1” corresponds to one Inkscape pixel per screen pixel. If you would like to calibrate the zoom to a real physical measurement unit (like inches or centimeters), you can do so under the _Interface_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. You will find there a slider that can be dragged to set a _Zoom correction factor_. Simply hold up your ruler to the screen and drag until the onscreen ruler matches.

*   **+** or **\=** keys to zoom in, **\-** key to zoom out. Zoom is around center of viewable canvas.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**Middle Mouse Click** or **Ctrl**+**Right Mouse Click** to zoom in, **Shift**+**Middle Mouse Click** or **Shift**+**Right Mouse Click** to zoom out. Zoom in is around cursor position.
    
*   **Shift**+**Middle Mouse Drag** to zoom in on area within _[rubber-band](#rubberband "rubber band")_.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**Mouse Wheel** to zoom in and out. Very convenient. The cursor position is the center of the zoom.
    
    By checking the _Mouse wheel zooms by default_ button under the _Scrolling_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog the function of the **Mouse Wheel** changes to zooming while the normal **Ctrl**+**Mouse Wheel** changes to panning up and down. This is the normal behavior in CorelDRAW and AutoCAD.
    
*   Zoom section of the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_. This is the best way to select a precise zoom level. One can activate the entry box via the keyboard shortcut **Alt**+**Z**.
    
*   _Zoom Tool_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/zoom.png) (**F3**) from the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_. Click on the canvas with the _Zoom Tool_ to zoom in around the cursor. Use **Shift** click or click with the **Right Mouse** button to zoom out.
    
*   _Zoom Tool_: _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ and under the View → Zoom menu. When the _Zoom Tool_ is selected, the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ will show a series of icons representing different zoom options. The View → Zoom menu has the same options.

### Outline Mode

Inkscape has an _Outline_ or _Wire-frame_ mode. In this mode, all paths and shapes are drawn as outlines with a one screen-pixel-wide stroke and no fill, regardless of zoom level. Text is drawn with an inverse fill and no stroke. Images are outlined in red, clip paths in green, and masks in blue.

The _Outline_ mode is useful for seeing the overall structure of a drawing, precise node editing, and for finding and selecting those pesky, hidden objects that may have been created by accident. The mode is marginally faster than the normal mode. It can be turned on via View → DisplayMode → Outline, turned off by View → DisplayMode → Normal, and toggled via View → DisplayMode → Toggle (****Ctrl**+**Keypad 5****).

![Normal vs. Wire frame view.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/VIEW/Wireframe.png)

The same drawing shown in the normal view on the left and the wire-frame view on the right (the text has been converted to a path).

The colors used by the _Outline_ mode can be changed by editing the _wireframecolors_ group in the preferences file (Linux: `~/.config/inkscape/preferences.xml` for v0.47, `~/.inkscape/preferences.xml` for v0.46). Inkscape can be forced to start up in _Outline_ mode by adding <group id="startmode" outline="1"/> to the preferences file inside the _options_ group.

### Duplicate Window

A duplicate Inkscape window can be created with the View →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/window-new.png)Duplicate Window command. Both the original and new window refer to the same drawing. Thus, one can use one window for detailed work while keeping watch over how the work affects a larger region of a drawing.

### Icon Preview

_Updated for v0.48._

An _Icon Preview_ window can be created with the View →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-icon-preview.png)Icon Preview command. This allows one to see what a drawing (or selection) will look like as icons of different sizes. In v0.47 one needs to click on the _Refresh_ button to update the previews. In v0.48 the update is automatic. One can choose between viewing the whole drawing or a selected object by clicking the _Selection_ button in v0.47 or by checking the _Selection_ box in v0.48. In v0.48, by default, the previews are “locked” to the initial selected object's region. To change the region, uncheck and recheck the _Selection_ box while a different object is selected.

Which sizes are displayed can be specified in the preferences file (Linux: `~/.config/inkscape/preferences.xml`) under the _iconpreview_ group. In v0.48, you can also toggle on/off the automatic refresh of the previews, change the arrangement of the icons from compact to stacked (as in v0.47), change the previews to not follow the selected object, or to remove the frame around the icon previews.

We discuss here some of the basic editing concepts of Inkscape, including: undoing and redoing changes, selecting objects, copying and deleting objects, and grouping objects. It is assumed that you have some familiarity with Inkscape by having worked through some of the examples in [Chapter 1, _Quick Start_]( "Chapter 1. Quick Start"), or through the tutorials included with Inkscape (Help →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/help-contents.png)Tutorials).

Undo and Redo
-------------

One can undo and redo changes made to your drawing in the current Inkscape session. The _Undo_ and _Redo_ commands can be repeated to undo or redo multiple changes. These commands can be accessed both in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_ and under the _Edit_ menu in the _[Menu Bar](#menubar)_. When accessed through the _Edit_ menu, a description of the change that would happen if the command is selected is given.

*   Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-undo-ltr.png)Undo (****Ctrl**+**Z****) (or **Shift**+**Ctrl**+**Y**): Undo change.
    
*   Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-redo-ltr.png)Redo (****Ctrl**+**Y****) (or **Shift**+**Ctrl**+**Z**): Redo change.
    

Multiple changes can also be undone or redone in one step by using the _Undo History_ dialog (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-undo-history.png)Undo History... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**H****)).

![Undo History dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_UndoHistory.png)

Two views of the _Undo History_ dialog, both showing the drawing of a rectangle followed by changing the color and and four resizings. Clicking on any line returns the drawing to the state when the change described on the line was completed. Consecutive changes of the same type may be collapsed to one line to improve readability; the number of such changes is given on the top line of the group. Clicking on the triangle collapses (left) or uncollapses (right) the list.

All changes to a file can be undone with the File →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-revert-to-saved-ltr.png)Revert command.

Selecting Objects
-----------------

Before objects can be manipulated, they must be selected. This section covers the myriad of ways selection can be done.

Normally, the _Select Tool_ is used for selecting objects. To activate, click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-pointer.png) icon in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_ or use the keyboard shortcut (**F1**). One can toggle between another tool (except the _[Text Tool]( "Chapter 9. Text")_ when in _text enter_ mode) and the _Select Tool_ by using the **Space Bar** if that other tool was selected first.

Some objects can be directly selected by other tools. For example, shapes (e.g., _[Rectangles]( "Rectangles and Squares")_) can be directly selected with any of the _[shape tools]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_.

Rapid double-clicking on an object when the _Select Tool_ is active will select an object and change the tool to a tool appropriate for editing that object. For example, double-clicking on a rectangle will select the rectangle and change the tool to the _[Rectangle Tool]( "Rectangles and Squares")_.

Multiple objects can be selected at the same time. The _[Notification Region](#notification)_ lists the number and type of objects selected. This is especially useful when objects overlap and it isn't clear which are selected. By default, a box is drawn around each selected object. This can be changed to a small diamond _Selection Cue_ under the _Tools-Selector_ tab of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)).

![Selection cues.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/BASICS/Selection.png)

Selection indicated by dashed boxes (on left) and by small diamonds (on right). Only one of these two methods can be active at a time.

The _[Find](#Select-Find "Selecting with the Find Dialog")_ dialog (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-find.png)Find... (****Ctrl**+**F****)) discussed at the end of this section, is another way of selecting objects.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Locked Objects

If an object cannot be selected, it may be _locked_. Objects can be locked against modification in the _Object Properties_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-object-properties.png)Object Properties... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**O****)). Unlocking individual objects requires use of the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ (look for the locked object and then either delete the “sodipidi:insensitive” attribute or uncheck the _Lock_ box in the _Object Properties_ dialog; see [Chapter 18, _XML Editor_]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")). One can unlock all objects with the command Object → Unlock All. Objects may also be in a locked _[Layer]_ (see [the section called “Layers”]).

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Hidden Objects

It is possible to “hide” an object by checking the _Hide_ box in the _Object Properties_ dialog.\[[8](#ftn.idm140578975883488)\] This raises the question: How do you select a hidden object? There are several ways. One is to use the _[Find](#Select-Find "Selecting with the Find Dialog")_ dialog (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-find.png)Find... (****Ctrl**+**F****)); search for the Style _display:none_ with the _Include hidden_ box checked. A second way is to look for it with the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ (see [Chapter 18, _XML Editor_]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")). A third way is to enable the selection of hidden objects using the **Tab** key in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog's _Selecting_ tab. A fourth way is to unhide all hidden objects using the Object → Unhide All command. While these are solutions, the ultimate solution is just to not hide objects. Instead put them on a separate _[Layer]_ and hide the _Layer_ (see [the section called “Layers”]).

### Selecting with the Mouse

This section covers selecting objects with a mouse. By adding **Ctrl** to many of the commands below, objects within a _[Group]_ can be selected (see [the section called “Groups”]).

*   **Left Mouse Click**: Select Object: Select an object by clicking on it.
    
*   **Shift**+**Left Mouse Click**: Toggle Selection: Add or subtract an object to or from a selection. This allows multiple objects to be selected. If the object clicked on is not already selected, it will be. If it is already selected, it will be deselected.
    
*   **Alt**+**Left Mouse Click**: Select Under: Select next object below the currently selected object under the pointer. This allows one to select objects covered by others. Repeat to move downward in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_. If the bottommost object is already selected, this will select the topmost object.
    
*   **Left Mouse Drag**: Select Multiple Objects: When started from empty space, this will select all objects that are completely within the rectangle that is formed by the start and stop points of the drag. This is often referred to as _[rubber-band](#rubberband "rubber band")_ selecting. The _rubber band_ is the temporary line drawn while dragging.
    
*   **Shift**+**Left Mouse Drag**: Add Objects to Collection: Add objects within the _rubber band_ to a preexisting selection. Also inhibits selection of an object under the start of the drag (without the shift, an object under the start of a drag is selected _and_ moved). Selected objects within the _rubber band_ are _not_ deselected.
    
*   **Alt**+**Left Mouse Drag**: Touch Select Multiple Objects: This will select all objects that the mouse cursor touches while being dragged. A red line will indicate the path the cursor took. This is _very_ useful when needing to select multiple paths as found in engravings or hair. Holding the **Shift** down will prevent dragging an already selected object if the drag begins over that object.
    
    ![Touch selection.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/BASICS/Selection_Touch.png)
    
    Using **Alt**+**Left Mouse Drag** to “touch” select the individual paths.
    
*   **Shift**+**Alt**+**Left Mouse Drag**: Touch-Add Multiple Objects to Collection: This will add all objects touched to a selection. It can also be used when the drag begins over an already selected object.

### Selecting with the Keyboard

Most selecting of objects is done with the mouse. However, there are a few handy keyboard shortcuts.

*   **Tab**: Select next object in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_, that is the next object above the previous selected object. If no object is selected, it will select the lowest object. Works for objects in current _[Layer]_.
    
*   **Shift**+**Tab**: Select previous object in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_, that is the next object below the previous selected object. If no object is selected, it will select the highest object, which is normally the last object created. Works for objects in current _[Layer]_.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**A**: Select All: Selects all objects in current _[Layer]_.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**A**: Select All in All Layers: Selects all objects in all visible and unlocked _[Layers]_.
    
*   **!**: Invert Selection: Invert selection in current _[Layer]_. That is, all selected objects are deselected and all unselected objects are selected.
    
*   **Alt**+**!**: Invert selection in all visible and unlocked _[Layers]_. That is, all selected objects are deselected and all unselected objects are selected.
    
*   **Esc**: Deselect: Deselect all selected objects.
    

Select All, Select All in All Layers, Invert Selection, and Deselect are also available under the _Edit_ menu.

### Selecting with the Find Dialog

The _Find_ dialog (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-find.png)Find... (****Ctrl**+**F****)) is another way to select objects with common features. A search is made through the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file and the found objects are selected on the Inkscape canvas.

![Find dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Find.png)

_Find_ dialog.

The _Find_ dialog has two parts. The top part defines what is searched for, while the bottom part defines where to search.

You can specify a _Text_ string (in a text object), _ID_ name (e.g., “rect1314”), _Style_ feature (e.g., “fill-opacity”), or an _Attribute_ type (e.g., “width”) for the search. The matches can be full or partial (i.e., “rect” would match “rect1314” and “rect1316”).

With the check boxes, you can specify where to search. If the _All types_ box is checked, the search will take place in all objects (shapes, paths, text strings, etc.). If the box is not checked, a list of object types is presented that can be individually included or excluded from the search.

The _Search in selection_ box determines if the search is limited to the currently selected objects. The _Search in current layer_ box determines if the search is limited to the currently selected layer. The _Include hidden_ box determines if hidden objects are included in the search, while the _Include locked_ box determines if locked objects are included in the search.

At the very bottom of the dialog are two buttons: the first, _Clear_, to clear the search entry boxes and the second, _Find_, to perform the actual search. All objects that are found to match the search criteria are selected.

  

* * *

\[[8](#idm140578975883488)\] Why would you want to hide and object? One example would be to save a text object before converting it into a path in case you ever wanted to edit the text again.

Copying, Pasting, and Deleting Objects
--------------------------------------

Inkscape includes commands to copy, paste, and delete objects. Commands of this type can be found in three places: Under the _Edit_ menu (see below), in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_ (Cut, Copy, Paste, and Duplicate), and in the pop-up menu when you **Right Mouse Click** over the canvas (Cut, Copy, Paste, Duplicate, and Delete).

**Clipboard: ** Inkscape uses the system-wide _clipboard_ (a place where a description of one or more objects is stored temporarily in memory). You can copy and paste between different instances of Inkscape and other applications that support _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_. Adding an object or group of objects (a selection) to the _clipboard_ removes any previous selection stored in the _clipboard_.

The commands available under the _Edit_ menu are:

*   Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-cut.png)Cut (****Ctrl**+**X****): Selection is removed from drawing, but stored in _clipboard_.
    
*   Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-copy.png)Copy (****Ctrl**+**C****): Copy of selection is stored in _clipboard_.
    
*   Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-paste.png)Paste (****Ctrl**+**V****): A copy of objects stored in _clipboard_ is placed in the drawing at the location of the cursor.
    
*   Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-paste-in-place.png)Paste In Place (****Ctrl**+**Alt**+**V****): Objects are copied from _clipboard_ to original location of objects. This is very useful in copying a selection from one drawing to the corresponding spot in another drawing.
    
*   Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-paste-style.png)Paste Style (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**V****): The style (fill and stroke attributes or for text the font, size, and style) of the object in the _clipboard_ are given to the selected object(s).
    
*   Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-duplicate.png)Duplicate (****Ctrl**+**D****): An object is copied and placed on top of the original object. The copied object is left selected.
    
*   _Modified for v0.48:_
    
    Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-make-bitmap-copy.png)Make a Bitmap Copy (****Alt**+**B****): The selection is exported as a bitmap then pasted back into the drawing at the same place. The original objects remain unchanged. In v0.47 the exported bitmap is _not_ stored in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. In v0.48 the bitmap is embedded in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file.
    
    The bitmap will have a resolution specified by the _Resolution for Crate Bitmap Copy_ entry in the _Bitmaps_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. If the resolution is specified to be 90 _[dpi](#dpi "dots per inch")_ (the default) the pixels will be snapped to the pixel grid.
    
*   Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-delete.png)Delete (****Delete** or **Backspace****): Selection is removed from drawing and _not_ stored in _clipboard_.
    

Hitting the **Space Bar** while dragging or transforming an object with the mouse will “drop” a copy of the object at the current point.

Another method for copying objects, _cloning_, is discussed in the next section.

========================================================

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Clones
------

Cloning is a special way to copy an object. The cloned copy retains a link to the original object so if that object is changed, the clone will change in the same way. The copies, however, can be _[transformed]_ (moved, scaled, rotated, and skewed) independently. Technically, the cloning is achieved through the use of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ _\>use<_ object type.

The style (color, fill pattern, etc.) of the clones can be changed independently but only if the style of the cloned object is _Unset_. See [the section called “Fill and Stroke Paint”]( "Fill and Stroke Paint") in [Chapter 10, _Attributes_]( "Chapter 10. Attributes").

Only a single object can be cloned at a time. If more than one object needs to be cloned, then those objects can be placed into a _[Group]_.

The original may be cloned any number of times. It is also possible to clone a clone. In this case, changing the original will change both clones, while changing the first clone will only change the second clone. It is not possible, however, to set the _Attributes_ independently with multiple layers of cloning.

Inkscape has the ability to “relink” clones to a another object. To do this, copy the new “original” to the clipboard. Select all the clones to be _relinked_ and then use the Edit → Clone → Relink to Copied command. The clones will probably shift in place. In practice, this just changes the _xlink:href_ attribute of the clones to point to the new “original”.

Inkscape also has the ability to “relink” clones when the original and clones are copied. Normally, the duplicated clones are linked to the original object, and the duplicate of the original object is not linked to anything. The behavior can be changed by enabling the _Relink duplicated clones_ option in the _Clones_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog so that new copies are linked to the copy of the original object.

Inkscape includes the _[Create Tiled Clones]( "Chapter 19. Tiling")_ dialog for creating a set of cloned objects that are automatically placed via tiling algorithms. This dialog is very powerful and is sufficiently complex that it deserves its own chapter. See [Chapter 19, _Tiling_]( "Chapter 19. Tiling"), for more information.

The following commands are available for working with clones (_Clone_ and _Unlink Clone_ are also located in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_).

*   Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-clone.png)Create Clone (****Alt**+**D****): Clone object. Clone is placed exactly over original.
    
*   Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-tile-clones.png)Create Tiled Clones... : Opens up _[Create Tiled Clones]( "Chapter 19. Tiling")_ dialog.
    
*   Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-clone-unlink.png)Unlink Clone (****Shift**+**Alt**+**D****): Remove link between clone and original object. Clone will no longer update when original object is modified.
    
*   Edit → Clone → Relink to Copied: Link any clone of an object to a duplicate (not clone) of the original object. To use, first copy the duplicate to the clipboard (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-copy.png)Copy (****Ctrl**+**C****)). Next, select the clones to be relinked and then use this command.
    
*   Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-select-original.png)Select Original (****Shift**+**D****): Select original of clone. Use to find the original of a cloned object. Select clone before using. Use multiple times to find original if starting with a clone of a clone. A line is drawn between the clone and the original for one second.
    

What happens when you move a cloned object? By default, the clones don't move. This is because if you select an object that was cloned and one of its clones, the two will move together as expected. In the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog under the _Clone_ section, you can change this behavior so that if a cloned object is moved, its clones also move. But in this case, if you select a cloned object and one of its clones, then move them, the clone will move “twice” as far—once because the cloned object moved and once because the clone itself was moved. Things can get really strange if you move a cloned object that has been cloned and that clone has been cloned!

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

Ordering Objects (Z-Order)
--------------------------

The _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_ determines the order in which objects are drawn on the canvas. Those object with high _z-order_ are drawn last and therefore drawn on top of objects with lower _z-order_. The order is determined by the order that the objects are listed in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file.

![Illustrating a change in Z-order.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/BASICS/Z_Order.png)

The yellow star has the highest _z-order_ on the left but the lowest on the right.

Inkscape has a number of commands to change _z-order_. The commands are available from the Menu and via Keyboard Shortcuts. They are also available in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ when the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ is active.

*   Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-raise.png)Raise (****Page Up****): Move selected object(s) up one step.
    
*   Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-lower.png)Lower (****Page Down****): Move selected object(s) down one step.
    
*   Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-top.png)Raise to Top (****Home****): Move selected object(s) to top.
    
*   Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/selection-bottom.png)Lower to Bottom (****End****): Move selected object(s) to bottom.
    

The _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog can also be used to change _z-order_. There is also a [_Restack_](#Extensions-Arrange-Restack "Restack") extension that can reorder arrays of objects.

Groups
------

A set of objects can be collected into a _Group_. Once placed in a _Group_, the objects can be manipulated together, the _Group_ acting as a single object. _Groups_ can be nested; that is, a _Group_ can be combined with other _Groups_ or objects to make a higher level _Group_.

The following commands, found both in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_ and under the _Edit_ menu, can be used to make and break up groups:

*   Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-group.png)Group (****Ctrl**+**G****): Group selected items.
    
*   Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-ungroup.png)Ungroup (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**G****)(**Ctrl**+**U**): Ungroup selected _Group_. Ungroups one level.
    

An alternative method to break up a _Group_ is to select the _Ungroup_ command from the menu that pops up when you **Right Mouse Click** over a _Group_.

Objects within _Groups_ can be edited and manipulated without breaking up the _Group_. The following commands select objects within _Groups_:

*   **Ctrl**+**Left Mouse Click**: Select Within Group. Select an object within a _Group_. This command selects objects regardless of how many levels of _Groups_ they are buried in.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**Left Mouse Click**: Select Under Within Group. Select an object within a _Group_ that is under the cursor and that is next lower in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_ than the currently selected object. If the currently selected object is at the bottom in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_, the top object is selected. This command selects objects regardless of how many levels of _Groups_ they are buried in.
    
*   **Shift**+**Ctrl**+**Alt**+**Left Mouse Click**: Toggle Under in Groups. Add an unselected object or remove a selected object within a _Group_ to or from a selection.
    

A _Group_ can be _entered_ or turned into a temporary _[Layer]_ for editing. Two ways to _Enter a Group_ and _Exit a Group_ are available:

*   **Double**+**Left Mouse Click** on a _Group_ to enter a _Group_. Click an object outside the _Group_ to exit.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**Enter** on a _Group_ to enter a _Group_. **Ctrl**+**Backspace** to leave a _Group_. This will take you up one group level.
    
*   **Right Mouse Click** over _Group_ to pop up a menu. Select the _Enter group_ command to enter the _Group_. The command line included the name of the _Group_ that will be entered. Once in a _Group_, the menu option _Go to parent_ will exit the _Group_ (although there is no visible feedback).

Layers
------

One can think of _Layers_ as the acetate sheets that were once used to make animated cartoons. Each _Layer_ can contain one or more objects. The final image is made up of all the (visible) _Layers_ stacked on top of each other. _Layers_ can be made visible or invisible, given an opacity, moved up or down relative to other _Layers_, locked, deleted, and named.

Internally, _Layers_ are just _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ _[Groups]_ with a few extra Inkscape specific parameters that Inkscape uses to control the _Layer_ interface. Like _Groups_, _Layers_ can contain sub-_Layers_.

_Layers_ can be manipulated by using the _Layers_ dialog, through commands in the _Layers_ menu, or through items in the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_. The _Layers_ dialog can also be used to quickly blend a _Layer_ with the background. See the next section for details.

### Layers Dialog

The _Layers_ dialog is the easiest way to manipulate _Layers_. Call up the dialog via the Layer → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-layers.png)Layers... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**L****) command.

![Layer dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Layers.png)

_Layers_ dialog with the default _Layer_.

The dialog will list all the _Layers_ in the document. The currently selected _Layer_ is highlighted. Selecting an object in a different _Layer_ will select the _Layer_ that object is in. One can also click on a _Layer_ name to select that _Layer_. Only one _Layer_ can be selected at a time.

In front of the _Layer_ names are two icons that show if a _Layer_ is visible (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-visible.png)) or not (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-hidden.png)) and if a _Layer_ is locked (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-locked.png)) or unlocked (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-unlocked.png)). Clicking on one of the icons toggles the state of that icon. A _Layer_ need not be selected in order to toggle its states. Objects in locked or invisible _Layers_ cannot be selected or changed.

A **Right Mouse Click** on any _Layer_ name will pop up a small and rather useless menu where you can access the rename, duplicate, and add _Layer_ functions. The only really interesting thing in this menu is the ability to toggle on and off at the same time all other _Layers_ than the one clicked on. This is done by clicking on the _Show/hide other layers_ item.

The buttons below the _Layer_ list can be used to add or delete a _Layer_ and to move the selected _Layer_ up or down relative to other _Layers_. A sub-_Layer_ cannot be moved outside of the _Layer_ it is under; you can use the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ to do this.

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-add.png): Add a new _Layer_. A dialog will pop up allowing input of the _Layer_ name. A drop-down menu allows you to add the new _Layer_ above, below, or as a sub-_Layer_ of the currently selected _Layer_.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-goto-top.png): Move selected _Layer_ to top.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-go-up.png): Move selected _Layer_ up one step.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-go-down.png): Move selected _Layer_ down one step.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-goto-bottom.png): Move selected _Layer_ to bottom.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-remove.png): Delete selected _Layer_.
    

Beneath the row of buttons is a drop-down menu for the _Blend mode_. This is a short cut to applying the _[Blend](#Filters-Blend "Blend")_ filter to the entire _Layer_. The _Normal_ entry corresponds to no _Filter_. Selecting one of the other entries creates a _[Blend](#Filters-Blend "Blend")_ filter with the selected mode. The first input to the filter is the _Layer_ (recall that a _Layer_ is just a _[Group]_) and the second input is the _Background Image_. If the menu is returned to the _Normal_ setting, the _[Blend](#Filters-Blend "Blend")_ filter is automatically deleted.

A demonstration of using _Layer_ blending. The two texts are in different _Layers_ with “Layer 1” beneath “Layer 2.” The _Blend mode_ is set to _Screen_ for the upper _Layer_.

At the bottom of the dialog is a slider and an entry box that can be used to change the opacity of the _Layer_.

### Layers Menu

The _Layers_ menu has commands to create, rename, delete, and change the order of _Layers_. There are also commands to move objects between _Layers_. The commands in the _Layers_ menu are

*   Layer → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/layer-new.png)Add Layer... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**N****): Add a new _Layer_.

Inkscape has a variety of ways to position objects as precisely as required. These include onscreen _[Grids](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ and _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_ where objects “snap” into alignment, dialogs for moving individual objects or for aligning multiple objects, and the _[Create Tiled Clones]( "Chapter 19. Tiling")_ dialog for placing multiple clones of an object. Additional features allow you to scale, skew, or rotate an object. This section will begin with a discussion of the coordinate system of Inkscape followed by a discussion of the way Inkscape describes object transformations. Then the commands and dialogs for transforming objects are discussed.

One key thing to know is that transforming a _Regular Shape_ object or a _[Group]_ of objects by the methods described in this chapter does not (usually) change the underlying description of the object(s). For example, suppose you have an ellipse that is 100 pixels wide but you need it to have a width of 50 pixels. There are two different ways to achieve the required width. The first is to scale the object by 50% in the horizontal (_x_) direction. The underlying definition of the ellipse width remains 100 pixels but when the ellipse is drawn a scale factor of 50% is applied in the horizontal direction. The second way to change the ellipse is to use the _[Ellipse Tool]( "Ellipses, Circles, and Arcs")_ to resize the ellipse. In this case, the underlying description of the ellipse changes and no scale factor is applied.

An exception to this rule is for _Rectangle_ objects. Inkscape will attempt to change the description of the rectangle itself when a simple transformation is applied. This behavior can be changed under the _Transforms_ tab in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)). Change the _Store transformation_ parameter to _Preserved_.

Note that in _[Paths]( "Chapter 7. Paths")_, the individual points are transformed (unless the _Store transformation_ parameter has been changed as above).

Inkscape Coordinates
--------------------

Understanding the way Inkscape handles coordinates is necessary to be able to fully take advantage of the tools Inkscape has for positioning objects. When you open the main Inkscape window, _[Rulers](#rulers)_ are drawn by default at the top and left edges of the canvas (see [the section called “The Anatomy of the Inkscape Window”]( "The Anatomy of the Inkscape Window")). The units of the _Rulers_ are the same as the default units of the canvas. If you hover the pointer over a _Ruler_, a _[tool tip](#tooltip "tool tip")_ will show the current unit. The default unit can be changed via the _Document Properties_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-properties.png)Document Properties... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**D****)). Options for the coordinates system units are:

cm

Centimeters

ft

Feet

in

Inches

m

Meters

mm

Millimeters

pc

Picas

pt

Points

px

Pixels

Conversion between the units is fairly straightforward: 1 inch = 1/12 ft = 2.54 cm = 25.4 mm = 0.0254 m = 6 pc = 72 pt. The pixel (px) unit is adjustable in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)) under the _Import/Export_ tab (Default export resolution). It is also equivalent to the _User Unit_ in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ specification. Inkscape takes care of conversions when changing units. Note: Feet and meters are not _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ or _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ defined units.

Various Inkscape parameters can be set using independent units. For example, the default _x_ scale can be set to millimeters, while the alignment _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ can be defined in inches.

One confusing aspect is that Inkscape uses a different scale internally. On the canvas, the _x_ and _y_ coordinates increase as one moves right or up. Internally the _y_ coordinate is flipped as per the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard. Thus, (0, 0) is defined from the upper-left corner of the page region internally but at the bottom-left corner in the canvas window. The internal scale is fixed (by default) to 90 _[dpi](#dpi "dots per inch")_. The internal scale is important if you wish to edit by hand an object using the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_.

There are two competing camps for how angles should be defined. Fortunately for the peace, Inkscape supports both through the _Compass-like display of angles_ option under the _Steps_ tab in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)).

Transformations
---------------

Objects can be moved, scaled, rotated, skewed, and flipped. Inkscape provides a variety of ways to make these transformations. These include: using the _[mouse](#Transforms-Mouse "Transforms with the Mouse")_, the _[keyboard](#Transforms-Keyboard "Transforms with the Keyboard")_, items in the _[Tool Controls bar](#Transforms-ToolControl "Transforms with the Tool Controls Bar")_, the _[Object menu](#Transforms-ObjectMenu "Transforms with the Object Drop-Down Menu")_, the _[Transform dialog](#Transforms-Transform "Transforms with the Transform Dialog")_, the _[Paste Size commands](#Transforms-PasteSize "Transforms with Paste Size Commands")_, and the _[XML Editor dialog](#Transforms-Xml "Transforms with the XML Editor")_. Each method will be discussed in turn. Each method begins by selecting an object or group of objects to be transformed. The _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ must be active for making transformations with the mouse or keyboard. To activate, click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-pointer.png) icon in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_ or use the keyboard shortcut **(F1)**.

There are a couple of things to note:

First, some operations use _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ pixels while some use _Screen pixels_. The former is the scale used in the _SVG_ file. It is fixed (by default) to 90 _[dpi](#dpi "dots per inch")_. The latter refers to a pixel on the screen and changes as the zoom level changes.

Second, positions and dimensions are often with reference to the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_. One can choose between two definitions for the _bounding box_ in the _Tools_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)). The _Visual bounding box_ includes the stroke width if the stroke is visible. For example, a square 100 pixels to one side (between corner nodes) will have a width of 102 pixels if the stroke width is 2 pixels. The _Visual bounding box_ also includes any _[Markers](#Attributes-Stroke-Markers "Markers")_ and both the _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ _Join_ and _Cap_ styles are assumed to be _Round_. The _Geometric bounding box_ mode uses only the nodes to determine the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_.

![Bounding Boxes.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/POSITION/BoundingBox.png)

The dashed lines are _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ for the same path with _[Markers](#Attributes-Stroke-Markers "Markers")_. Left: _Visual bounding box_. Right: _Geometric bounding box_.

Third, transformations do _not_ change the underlying definition of regular shape objects or grouped objects, as discussed in the introduction of this chapter (an exception being simple transformations of _Rectangle_ objects when the _Store transformation_ parameter is set to _Optimized_).

Fourth, there are a number of options that can be toggled on and off in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ when the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ is being used. The following are active when the icon is highlighted:

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/transform-affect-stroke.png)When scaling objects, scale the stroke width by the same proportion.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/transform-affect-rounded-corners.png)When scaling rectangles, scale the radii of rounded corners.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/transform-affect-gradient.png)Move gradients (in fill or stroke) along with the objects.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/transform-affect-pattern.png)Move patterns (in fill or stroke) along with the objects.
    

Fifth, rotation and skewing take place around a _[Rotation center](#RotationCenter "Rotation Center")_ point. The point is indicated by a draggable “plus”\-shaped handle that is viewable when using the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ in rotation or skewing mode. See the next section for details.

#### Scaling, Rotating, and Skewing

When an object or objects are first selected, eight double-headed arrows will appear in a rectangle around the selection. A **Left Mouse Drag** of any handle will rescale the selection. The corner arrows will scale both in the horizontal (_x_) and vertical (_y_) directions. The side arrows will scale in only one direction.

![Scaling arrows.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/POSITION/transform_arrows.png)

Scaling arrows (left). Rotation arrows on corners, skewing arrows on sides (right). The “plus” in the center of the square on the right is the _Rotation center_ handle.

Clicking a second time on a selected object or using the keyboard shortcut **Shift**+**S** will change the direction of the double-headed arrows. Now, a **Left Mouse Drag** of a handle will rotate the selection if used on a corner arrow, or skew the selection if used on a side arrow. Click again to revert to the scaling mode.

**Rotation Center. ** Rotation takes place around the _Rotation center_ indicated by a “plus”\-shaped handle. The handle (and thus the center of rotation) can be dragged. Dragging while holding the **Ctrl** down will restrict movement to the horizontal and vertical directions. The handle will snap to the edge of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ or the center axis of the selection's _bounding box_. It will also snap to a _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ or _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_ if snapping of nodes to those items is turned on. The movement of the _Rotation center_ handle can be undone (**Ctrl**+**Z**). Holding the **Shift** key down while clicking on the _Rotation center_ handle will restore the handle to the center of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_. The _Rotation center_ is preserved when an object is moved, scaled, duplicated, cloned, or converted to a path. It is also preserved between editing sessions.

When multiple objects are selected, the _Rotation center_ of the first selected object will be used if it has been moved from its default position. Otherwise, the center of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of all selected objects will be used.

The **Shift**, **Ctrl**, and **Alt** keys can be used with the **Left Mouse Drag**. They can be used in combination when scaling, rotating, or skewing.

##### Scaling

*   **Ctrl**: Preserve width to height ratio.
    
*   **Shift**: Rescale symmetrically, around center of selection.
    
*   **Alt**: Restrict scaling up to an integer factor (2, 3, 4, ...) or down to a simple fraction (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...). Negative values are also allowed (i.e., mirroring object around _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ edge).

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

##### Rotating and Skewing

*   **Ctrl**: Constrain a rotation or skew to a multiple of the _Rotation snap angle_. Allows stretching in the orthogonal direction to a skew by a multiple of the width or height of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_.
    
*   **Shift**: Keep opposite corner fixed for rotation or opposite side fixed for skew. (This is opposite of what happens for scaling.)

### Transforms with the Tool Controls Bar

The _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ contains a number of items for transforming an object when the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ is in use. An object can be translated using the X and Y entry boxes. An object can be stretched by using the width (W) and height (H) entry boxes. These quantities are specified in a unit of length determined by a selection box just to the right of the entry boxes. The ratio of the height and width can be locked by clicking on the lock icon so that changing one dimension automatically changes the other. There are also icons for rotating and flipping objects.

### Transforms with the Transform Dialog

Objects can be moved, scaled, rotated, and skewed using the _Transform_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-transform.png)Transform... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**M****)). There is a different tab in the dialog for each of these transforms. In addition, there is a _Matrix_ tab that allows the application of a _[Transformation Matrix](#transmatrix "transformation matrix")_ to a selection.

The _Transform_ dialog contains an option to apply the chosen transformation to a selection as a group or to the individual objects within the selection. (This option has no effect for the _Matrix_ tab.) The dialog also has a _Clear_ button to reset the entered values to their default values.

#### Move Tab

Using the _Move_ tab, you can translate an object.

![Move tab.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Transform_Move.png)

_Move_ tab.

An object will be translated relative to its current position if the _Relative move_ box is checked. If the box is not checked, the lower-left corner of the objects _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ will be moved to the given coordinate.

Enabling the _Apply to each object separately_ option causes objects to move so that they are more spread out (with a positive displacement) and closer together with a (negative displacement). For example, in displacing objects horizontally, the leftmost object moves the specified amount, the next leftmost moves twice as much, and the third leftmost three times as much. The algorithm uses the left edges of the _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ for horizontal movement and the bottom edges of the _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ for vertical movement. If two objects have the same left position, they will still move different amounts.

_Scale_ tab.

An object will be scaled relative to the center of its _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_. The _Scale proportionally_ option forces the width and height to scale by the same percentage. Note that a scale factor of 100% corresponds to leaving an object unchanged.

#### Rotate Tab

Using the _Rotate_ tab, you can rotate an object.

![Rotate tab.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Transform_Rotate.png)

_Rotate_ tab.

An object will be rotated relative to _[Rotation center](#RotationCenter "Rotation Center")_. The direction of the rotation is positive in the counterclockwise direction.

#### Skew Tab

Using the _Skew_ tab, you can skew an object.

![Skew tab.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Transform_Skew.png)

_Skew_ tab.

You can skew in the horizontal and vertical directions separately. The skewing is relative to the center of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_. The magnitude of the skew can be specified as a distance, percentage, or angle. In all cases, the skew is relative to the size of the _bounding box_.

Examples for a horizontal skew of a 100 by 50 px _bounding box_ with the _[Rotation center](#RotationCenter "Rotation Center")_ in the middle of the _bounding box_:

*   Distance of 20 px: The top edge of the box is moved 10 px (half of 20 px) to the right, the bottom 10 px to the left.
    
*   Percentage of 20%: The top edge is moved 5 px to the right (half of 20% of the height) to the right, the bottom 5 px to the left.
    
*   Angle of 30 : The top edge of the box is moved 14.4 px (tan(30 )   50 px   0.5) to the _left_ (angles are defined to be positive in the counterclockwise direction), the bottom 14.4 px to the right.
    

Note: The center of the new _bounding box_ is not necessarily at the center of the original _bounding box_ if the skewed object was not a rectangle.

#### Matrix Tab

Using the _Matrix_ tab, you can apply a generic transformation to an object.

![Transformation matrix tab.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Transform_Matrix.png)

_Matrix_ tab.

The transformation is described by a 3   3 _[Transformation Matrix](#transmatrix "transformation matrix")_ of which only the upper two rows are displayed and modifiable. The upper-left 2   2 submatrix (A, B, C, and D) controls scaling, rotating, and skewing, while the upper-right 1   2 submatrix (E and F) controls translations.

The tab includes the option _Edit current matrix_ to select if the entered matrix should post-multiply the existing transformation matrix (option not selected) or if it should replace the current matrix (option selected).

There are two important points to note. First, the transformation matrix is with respect to the point (0, 0) in _screen_ coordinates if not editing the current matrix. If editing the current matrix, the transformation is with respect to the _User Coordinate System_ which, if an object is not in a _[Group]_, is equivalent to the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ coordinate system (_Initial View Port_) where the origin is at the top-left corner of the page. See the [SVG standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html) for more details.

Second, Inkscape will modify the matrix and other parameters of an object internally so that the internal E and F terms are zero if the _Store transformation_ parameter under the _Transforms_ section in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog is set to _Optimized_. This means, for example, that for a horizontal skew of a rectangle, the internal height parameter may change. The displayed object will still look correct.

### Transforms with Paste Size Commands

The commands in the Edit → Paste Size submenu can be used to scale a selection or the objects in a selection to match the width and/or height of a selection that is stored in the _[clipboard](#Clipboard "Clipboard:")_. To use the commands, first copy (or cut) a selection with the desired dimension(s) to load the selection into the _clipboard_. Then select the target object or objects and use one of the commands below.

The first three commands scale a selection as a whole to match the clipboard while the last three commands scale each object to match the clipboard. Dimensions are determined by _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_. The _Scale ratio lock_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-locked.png)/  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-unlocked.png)) located in the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ controls how the width and height transform in some cases.

*   Edit → Paste Size → Paste Size: The selection is scaled so its _bounding box_ matches that of the selection in the _clipboard_. Scaling is around the center of the selection's _bounding box_.
    
*   Edit → Paste Size → Paste Width: The selection is scaled so the width of its _bounding box_ matches that of the width of selection in the _clipboard_. The height is left alone if the _Scale ratio lock_ is off; otherwise, the height is scaled in the same proportion as the width.
    
*   Edit → Paste Size → Paste Height: The selection is scaled so the height of its _bounding box_ matches that of the height of selection in the _clipboard_. The width is left alone if the _Scale ratio lock_ is off; otherwise, the width is scaled in the same proportion as the height.
    
*   Edit → Paste Size → Paste Size Separately: Each object in the selection is scaled so its _bounding box_ matches that of the selection in the _clipboard_. Scaling is around the center of each object's _bounding box_.
    
*   Edit → Paste Size → Paste Width Separately: Each object in the selection is scaled so the width of its _bounding box_ matches the width of the selection in the _clipboard_. The heights are left alone if the _Scale ratio lock_ is off; otherwise, the heights are scaled in the same proportion as the widths.
    
*   Edit → Paste Size → Paste Height Separately: Each object in the selection is scaled so the height of its _bounding box_ matches the height of the selection in the _clipboard_. The widths are left alone if the _Scale ratio lock_ is off; otherwise, the widths are scaled in the same proportion as the heights.

### Transforms with the XML Editor

Full control over the transformation of an object is available through the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-xml-editor.png)XML Editor... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**X****)). Selecting an object in the document window will bring up the object's attributes in the _XML Editor_ dialog. Any transform an object is subject to is described by the _transform_ attribute. A transform can be of type “translate”, “scale”, “rotate”, “skewX”, “skewY”, or “matrix”. In most cases, the transform will be of the “matrix” type. A _matrix_ entry contains the _[Transformation Matrix](#transmatrix "transformation matrix")_ in the order (A, B, C, D, E, F) where (ACE) is the first row of the matrix.

One thing to note is that the matrix describes a transformation with respect to the _User Coordinate System_ which, if an object is not in a _[Group]_, is equivalent to the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ coordinate system (_Initial View Port_) where the origin is at the top-left corner of the page (in contrast to the screen coordinate system where the origin is at the bottom-left of the page). See the [SVG standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html) for more details.

Snapping
--------

To help precisely place objects on the canvas, an object can be made to _snap_ to a target. The target can be a points on another object, the page boundary, a _Grid_ line, or a _Guide Line_. Snapping takes place when some defined point on an object, a snapping point, is near a target. _Snapping_ can be divide into two parts: defining snapping points and setting targets. This is mostly done with the _[Snap Bar](#snapbar)_. Snapping was introduced in the tutorials at the beginning of the book.

Snapping can be set to always happen or only happen when a snapping point is within a set distance (the _Snap Distance_) from a target. Setting _Snap Distance_ is made under the _Snap_ tab of the _Document Properties_ dialog.

![Snap tab.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_DocPref_Snap.png)

_Snap_ tab in the _Document Properties_ dialog.

When a snapping point is snapped to a target, a small cross will flash at the snapping site. Next to this indicator, a message indicates what snapping point and snapping target were used. In v0.48, a _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ will also flash when it is a target of snapping. The indicator can be disabled in the _Snapping_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog by unchecking the _Enable snap indicator_ option.

A few other options can be found under the _Snapping_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog:

*   _Delay (in ms):_ Sets the delay between the time the cursor stops moving and snapping is attempted. Useful if there are many snapping targets (e.g., with a _Grid_).
    
*   _Only snap the node closest to pointer_: If this option is enabled, only one node is used as a snapping point on a target. This node will be highlighted as an object is dragged. Useful if an object has many snapping points. Note: if an object has too many nodes, and this option is disabled, a “convex hull”\[[9](#ftn.idm140578975071424)\] is used for snapping.
    
*   _Weight factor:_ If multiple snapping possibilities exist, the value of this parameter determines if the smallest distance between a snap point and snap target is favored (0.0) or if a snap using the closest snap point to the cursor is preferred (1.0).

### Snapping Objects

This section covers defining snapping points and targets associated with objects. Defining _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_ and _[Grids](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ as targets is covered in following sections.

The _[Snap Bar](#snapbar)_ includes a variety of clickable icons that toggle various snap points and targets on and off. It is divided into a number of sections. The first section has one icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap.png)) for globally toggling on or off snapping (this includes snapping to _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_ and _[Grids](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_). The second section concerns snapping to and from points defined by objects' _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_. The third section covers options for snapping to and from nodes and handles. The last section has icons for toggling on and off snapping to the page boundary, _Guide Lines_, and _Grids_. Note that snapping of _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ is independent of snapping of nodes (i.e., a node cannot be directly snapped to a point on a _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ and vice versa). Both _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ and nodes, however, can be snapped to the page boundary, _Guide Lines_ and _Grids_.

The section for snapping _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ items includes the icons for enabling and disabling:

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-bounding-box.png): Snap _bounding box_ corners. Global control for _bounding box_ snapping. If enabled, _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ corners are always snap points.
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-bounding-box-edges.png): Snap to edges of a _bounding box_. Note that edges are never snap points.
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-bounding-box-corners.png): Snap to _bounding box_ corners.
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-bounding-box-midpoints.png): Snap from and to midpoints of _bounding box_ edges.
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-bounding-box-center.png): Snapping from and to centers of _bounding boxes_.

Most types of nodes and handles can be snap points and/or targets. These include path nodes, regular _[Shape]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ nodes and handles, _[Rectangle]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ round-corner handles, and _[Rotation center](#RotationCenter "Rotation Center")_ handles. The options in the _Snap Bar_ section for nodes and handles includes icons for enabling and disabling:

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-nodes.png): Snap nodes or handles. If enabled, selected nodes are always snap points.
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-nodes-path.png): Snap to paths.
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-nodes-intersection.png): Snap to path intersections. Snap to paths must be enabled for this option to be enabled.

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-nodes-midpoint.png): Snap from and to midpoints of line segments. This includes straight line segments on either _[Shapes]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ or paths).
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-nodes-center.png): Snap from or to centers of objects. (The same point as the center of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_.)
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/snap-nodes-rotation-center.png): Snap from an to an item's _[Rotation center](#RotationCenter "Rotation Center")_.

Snapping can be globally toggled on/off via View → Snap (****%****).

### Guides

_Guide Lines_ are individual lines that can be arbitrarily placed. They are defined by an _x_\-_y_ _anchor_ (origin point) through which the line passes and an angle. The _anchor_ is shown as a small circle on the line.

_Guide Lines_ can be hidden or unhidden by using View → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/show-guides.png)Guides (****|****). To be active, a _Guide Line_ must be visible. Snapping to _Guide Lines_ can be enabled or disabled by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/guides.png) icon in the _Snap Bar_.

The color of _Guide Lines_ can be changed under the _Guides_ tab in the _Document Properties_ dialog. Snapping of _Guide Lines_ to other objects can be enabled or disabled also under this tab.

#### Guide Creation

To create a _Guide Line_, **Left Mouse Drag** from the left _[Ruler](#rulers)_ onto the canvas for a vertical _Guide Line_ or from the top _Ruler_ for a horizontal _Guide Line_. An angled _Guide Line_ can be created by dragging from the end of a _Ruler_. By default, the angle is set to 45  if a rectangular _Grid_ is displayed or parallel to the angled lines if an axonometric _Grid_ is displayed.

_Guide Lines_ can also be automatically created at the edges of the _[Page](#page)_ by using the Edit → Guides Around Page command. They can also be created around objects as discussed in a following section.

#### Guide Adjustment

_Guide Lines_ can be translated and rotated using the mouse:

*   **Left Mouse Drag**: Translate _Guide Line_. Both the _Guide Line_ and _anchor_ are moved. If dragged off the page, the _Guide Line_ is deleted.
    
*   **Shift**+**Left Mouse Drag**: Rotate _Guide Line_. Rotation is around the _anchor_. You must be a small distance away from the _anchor_ for rotation to be enabled.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**Left Mouse Drag**: Move the _anchor_, constrained to the _Guide Line_.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**Left Mouse Drag**: Rotate _Guide Line_ with constraint. Angle snaps to multiples of the _Rotation snap angle_, (15 degrees, by default).
    
*   **Del**: While over a _Guide Line_, delete the _Guide Line_.
    

_Guide Lines_ can be precisely placed by using the _Guide Line_ dialog, called up by double-clicking on a _Guide Line_. A check box toggles between absolute and relative placement.

#### Guides Created from Objects

_Guide Lines_ can be created from objects using the Object → Object to Guides (****Shift**+**G****) command. The keyboard shortcut works with the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_, _[shape tools]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_, _[Bezier Tool](#Paths-Bezier "The Bezier (Pen) Tool")_, and _[Pencil Tool](#Paths-Pencil "The Pencil Tool")_. Different objects are converted in different ways. In each case, the selected objects are deleted unless the _Keep objects after conversion to guides_ entry is checked in the _Tools_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog.

*   _[Rectangles]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ and _[Boxes]( "3D Boxes")_: _Guide Lines_ are drawn along edges, even when rotated, if the _Conversion to guides uses edges instead of bounding box_ box is checked under the _Rectangle_ or _3D Box_ sections in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. Otherwise the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ is used.
*   Paths: A _Guide Line_ is drawn along each straight line segment.
*   Other objects: _Guide Lines_ are drawn along _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_. The _Geometric_ or _Visual_ _bounding box_ is used depending on which is selected in the _Tools_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog.

If a _[Group]_ is selected, _Guide Lines_ are drawn for each object in the _Group_, unless the _Treat groups as a single object_ entry is checked in the _Tools_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog.

### Grid

A _Grid_ is composed of two or three sets of evenly spaced parallel lines. A _Rectangular_ _Grid_ consists of horizontal and vertical lines, much like a sheet of ordinary graph paper. An _Axonometric_ _Grid_ consists of three sets of parallel lines, typically one vertical and two at 30  angles from the horizontal. It is often used to draw three-dimensional objects.

![Rectangle and axonometric grids.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/POSITION/Grids_Type.png)

Examples of a _Rectangular Grid_ (left) and _Axonometric Grid_ (right).

_Grids_ can be created and edited on the _Grids_ tab of the _Document Properties_ dialog. To create a _Grid_, select the type (_Rectangular_ or _Axonometric_) from the drop-down menu at the top of the dialog and then click on the _New_ button. The parameters for the new _Grid_ will then be editable under a tab in the bottom of the dialog. It is possible to have more than one _Grid_ defined (and in use). Each _Grid_ will have a tab entry.

_Grids_ tab in _Document Properties_ dialog showing the parameters for a _Rectangular_ _Grid_ with the default parameters.

Each _Grid_ can individually be _Enabled_ and made _Visible_ by the check boxes on the _Defined_ _Grid_ tabs. If a _Grid_ is not enabled, it will not be visible. However a _Grid_ can be enabled and not visible. All _Grids_ can be enabled or disabled by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/grid-rectangular.png) in the _[Snap Bar](#snapbar)_ or by using the global command View → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/show-grid.png)Grid (****#****). This setting overrides the settings on the individual _Grid_ tabs. Note: There is no visual indication whether this overall setting is on or off if the visibility of the individual _Grids_ are all set off. Note also that, depending on the zoom scale, not all _Grid_ lines are shown. “Missing” lines will not be snapped to if the _Snap to visible grid lines only_ box is checked under the _Grids_ tab.

For both types of _Grids_, the _Grid unit_ can be selected from a drop-down menu and the _Grid_ origin can also be specified. For _Rectangular_ _Grids_, the _x_ and _y_ spacing can be set independently. For _Axonometric_ _Grids_ the _x_ and _z_ spacings are derived from the _y_ spacing and the angle settings. In both cases the color of the lines can be set by clicking on the color box and making changes in the dialog that pops up.

The default _Grid_ parameters can be modified in the _Grids_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog.

Different “views” of the same drawing share the same _Grids_ but the _Grids_ can be enabled or made visible independently for each view.

Alignment and Distribution of Objects
-------------------------------------

This section describes the _Align and Distribute_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-align-and-distribute.png)Align and Distribute... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**A****)) which allows the positioning of objects with respect to other objects or to the selection, drawing, or page. Two types of positioning are available: _alignment_ where the centers or edges of objects are aligned to one another, and _distributing_ where objects are distributed in some direction based on their centers or edges.

### Align

The alignment of objects is with respect to an _anchor_. The anchor can be an object or be defined by the selection, drawing, or page; the choice of what is used is set in the pull-down menu _Relative to_. The object may be specified to be the first or last object selected. If multiple objects are selected at the same time, this is equivalent to the top or bottom object in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_. Alternatively, the object can be specified to be the biggest or smallest item, where size is determined by the size of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_, the width for vertical alignment and the height for horizontal alignment. The _bounding box_ sides are used as the reference points for alignment except for text, where the _[baseline](#baseline "baseline")_ is used.

When the _Treat selection as group:_ box is checked, all selected objects are treated as if they were in a _[Group]_. This saves on having to group and ungroup the selected objects when you wish to align them together to the _[Page](#page)_ or to the drawing. Alignment relative to other criteria is unpredictable.

The various alignment options are:

*   Horizontal:
    
    *    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/align-horizontal-right-to-anchor.png)Align right sides to left side of anchor.

As of v0.48, text anchor position depends on alignment and orientation of text (e.g. the anchor box will be on the right for right-aligned text).
        
    
*   Vertical:
    
    *    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/align-vertical-top-to-anchor.png)Align top sides to bottom side of anchor.

### Distribute: Uniform

The distribute part of the _Align and Distribute_ dialog allows objects to be evenly spaced in the horizontal or vertical direction based on some criteria. Two options are included in this part of the dialog, which perhaps should be included separately: randomizing the center of objects and unclumping. They will be considered in the next section.

The distribution of objects is between the two objects at the extremes (i.e., the leftmost and rightmost objects for horizontal distribution). The definition of which is the leftmost and rightmost object is made using the objects' _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_, and it may depend on the type of distribution selected. For example, if a distribution is based on the rightmost edge of the objects, then the objects rightmost edge will be used to determine which objects are at the extremes.

The various distribution options are:

*   Horizontal:
    
    *    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/distribute-horizontal-left.png)Distribute left sides evenly.
        
    *    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/distribute-horizontal-center.png)Distribute centers evenly.
        
    *    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/distribute-horizontal-right.png)Distribute right sides evenly.
        
    *    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/distribute-horizontal-gaps.png)Distribute with uniform gaps between objects.
        
    *    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/distribute-horizontal-baseline.png)Distribute baseline anchors evenly.

### Distribute: Non-Uniform

The distribute part of the _Align and Distribute_ dialog has two options that modify the distribution of objects in a non-uniform way. Both affect the horizontal and vertical distributions at the same time.

The two options are:

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/distribute-randomize.png)Randomize the center of objects.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/distribute-unclump.png)_Unclump_ objects (i.e., move objects to more evenly space the edge-to-edge distances). Repeated application approaches the use of the _Distribute with uniform gaps_ commands described previously.

### Distribute: Remove Overlaps

Another section of the _Align and Distribute_ dialog allows one to move objects just enough that they don't overlap. Two entry boxes, one for the horizontal direction and the other for the vertical direction, allow the addition of a minimum space between adjacent objects.

### Rows and Columns

The _Rows and Columns_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-rows-and-columns.png)Rows and Columns... ) can be used to arrange an arbitrary number of objects into a two-dimensional grid.

![Rows and Columns dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_RowsandColumns.png)

_Rows and Columns_ dialog.

To use the dialog, first select all the objects you wish to arrange into a grid. The dialog will default to a one-dimensional array. You can use the _Row_ and _Column_ entry boxes to change the number of rows and columns. If you use the up or down arrow to change the number of rows, the number of columns will change to give you the minimum number required to include all the objects in the selection. A similar change to the number of rows will happen if you change the number of columns. The maximum number of rows or columns is 100.

The algorithm for determining the _order_ the objects are placed in the array attempts to preserve any existing rows. For this algorithm, the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of each object is used. Technically, the objects are first sorted by their vertical positions. Then objects that overlap vertically are sorted by their horizontal positions. Finally, the objects are placed from left to right and from top to bottom in the array. The algorithm works pretty well but cannot handle all situations since determining what objects are in a row is objective. (If in the vertical direction A overlaps B and B overlaps C but A does not overlap C, are A and C in the same row?)

![Grid align 1.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/POSITION/grid_align1.png)

Twelve object before (left) and after (right) aligning with a 3 by 4 grid.

For placing objects, the grid is divided into cells. First, the cell size and placement is determined and then the objects are positioned inside the cells, one object to one cell.

Cells are given the height of the tallest object if the _Equal height_ box is checked; otherwise, they are given the height of the tallest object in their row. A similar policy is followed for width.

![Grid align 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/POSITION/grid_align2.png)

Alignment with the _Equal height_ box checked (left) and unchecked (right). Note how the height of the “8” has been used for all rows on the left and just its own row on the right.

If the _Fit into selection_ option is selected, the rows and columns of cells are evenly spaced with the edge rows and columns flush against the bounding box of the selection. If the _Set spacing_ option is selected, the rows and columns are separated by the amount entered in the _Row spacing_ and _Column spacing_ entry boxes. The spacing can be negative.

Once the cell positions have been determined, the objects are placed inside the cell according to the selected _Align_ options (top, middle, bottom; left, center, right).

![Grid align 3.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/POSITION/grid_align3.png)

Grid alignment with alignment to top (left), center (middle), and bottom (right) of cell.

Note that the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of all the objects after alignment may not be the same as the _bounding box_ of the selection prior to alignment even though the _Fit to selection_ option has been chosen. This is because the selection _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ has been used to place the _cells_. The objects within the cells may not touch the cell walls. (There also appears sometimes to be a gratuitous shift: Bug?)

    *   [Perspectives](#Shapes-Boxes-Perspectives)
    *   [Attributes](#Shapes-Boxes-Attributes)
*   [Ellipses, Circles, and Arcs]

Inkscape provides a number of tools for drawing geometric shapes. The tools for drawing regular\[[10](#ftn.idm140578974469008)\] geometric shapes (rectangles, boxes, ellipses, regular polygons, stars, and spirals) are covered here. Path (pencil and pen) tools, discussed in the next section, may be used to draw arbitrary shapes.

**Current Style: ** The style of an object includes attributes that determine how the inside of the shape (_fill_) and how the boundary path (_stroke_) are drawn. It also includes shape-specific attributes such as the number of points in a star. New objects are drawn with the _Current style_. Some components of the _Current style_ are displayed (e.g. _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color) or changed (e.g. number of points in a star) in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ of a relevant tool.

![The Rectangle Tool Controls.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TOOL_BARS/ToolBar_Rectangle.png)

The _Rectangle Tool_\-_Tool Controls_ showing the current _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color (blue) and _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color (black), as well as the _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ width (1 px).

A component of the _Current style_ is changed when that component is modified through, for example, an entry in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ or the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-fill-and-stroke.png)Fill and Stroke... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**F****)) discussed in [Chapter 10, _Attributes_]( "Chapter 10. Attributes"). Note that if in the _Current style_, a star has five points, just selecting a star with six points (and even modifying its color) is not enough to change the number of points in the _Current style_. The number of points must be explicitly changed.

By default, the _[shape tools]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ (except the _[Spiral Tool]_ and _[Box Tool]( "3D Boxes")_) as well as the _[Calligraphy Tool](#Paths-Calligraphy "The Calligraphy Tool")_ are drawn with a global _Current style_. Changing the style for one of these tools, changes the style for all. Control over which tools use the global _Current style_ and setting a default _Current style_ can be done on each tool's entry in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)).

Each of the shape tools can be given a fixed style by selecting the _This tool's own style_ option under the tool's entry in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)). Clicking on the _Current style_ color swatches will open the correct section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. Set the style by selecting an object with the desired style and click on the _Take from selection_ button. The _[Box Tool]( "3D Boxes")_ style cannot be changed. (However the _Box Tool_ with the _Last used style_ option will remember its own style.)

While drawing some objects (arcs, stars, regular polygons, and spirals), some features (such as the orientation of a polygon) can be constrained to specific angles with respect to the center of the shape and the horizontal axis. These angles are multiples of the _Rotation snap angle_. The default snap angle is 15 . It can be set under the _Steps_ entry in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog.

Shapes can be scaled, rotated, and skewed. (See [Chapter 5, _Positioning and Transforming_]( "Chapter 5. Positioning and Transforming").) When doing so, a transformation is applied to the shape. The internal parameters defining the shape (such as the width and height of an ellipse) remain _unchanged_.\[[11](#ftn.idm140578974255072)\] This is important to remember if you later modify a shape, for example, by editing the _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ file directly.

  

* * *

\[[10](#idm140578974469008)\] The _[Star Tool]( "Regular Polygons and Stars")_ includes a randomization feature so that the resulting shapes are not regular. The underlying description is still based on a regular shape.

\[[11](#idm140578974255072)\] This is not always true for rectangles. If the option _Optimized_ is selected in the _Store transformation_ section of the _Transforms_ entry of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog, the _x_, _y_, _width_, and _height_ attributes will change rather than adding a _transformation matrix_ for simple translating and scaling operations.

Rectangles and Squares
----------------------

The _Rectangle Tool_ allows one to draw rectangles and squares. Basic use of the tool is introduced in [Chapter 1, _Quick Start_]( "Chapter 1. Quick Start"). To draw a rectangle or square, select the tool by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-rectangle.png) icon (**F4** or **r**) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_. To draw a rectangle, use a **Left Mouse Drag** from one corner to the opposite corner. To force a square to be drawn, hold down the **Ctrl** while dragging the mouse. This also allows rectangles with an integer height to width or width to height ratio to be drawn. As a special case, rectangles with sides constrained to the [“Golden Ratio”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) are also allowed with the **Ctrl** key. Holding the **Shift** key down while dragging will create a rectangle centered around the starting point.

The size of a preexisting rectangle can be changed by selecting the rectangle via a **Left Mouse Click** on the rectangle with the _Rectangle Tool_. Once the rectangle is selected, handles (small squares and circles) will appear at some of the rectangle's corners. **Left Mouse Drag** the handle (square) at the top left or bottom right to change the size of the rectangle.

![A rectangle with handles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Rectangle.png)

A rectangle showing the _Resize_ (square) and _Corner Shape_ (circle) handles.

A rectangle can be given rounded corners. There are two ways to do this. The first is to use the handle(s) at the top-right corner of the rectangle. Initially, only one handle is visible. If this handle is dragged down, a rounded corner in the shape of a quarter circle is created. A second handle is now visible. Dragging this second handle to the left will create an elliptical rounded corner. Upon dragging the second handle, the radii of curvature in the horizontal (_x_) and vertical (_y_) directions are independent.

![A rectangle with handles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Rectangle_Rounded.png)

A rectangle with circular rounded corners.

![A rectangle with handles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Rectangle_Rounded2.png)

A rectangle with elliptical rounded corners (different x and y corner radii).

A second way to set the radius of curvature of a rectangle is to use the settings _Rx_ and _Ry_ in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ when the _Rectangle Tool_ is selected. The settings will affect any selected rectangle as well as rectangles that are drawn afterward. Rounded corners can be removed from a rectangle by using the _Make corners sharp_ button (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/rectangle-make-corners-sharp.png)). The width and height of a rectangle can also be set using entry boxes in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.

3D Boxes
--------

The _Box Tool_ allows you to draw three-dimensional boxes that remain editable in Inkscape but display normally in other _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ renderers. A box is composed of an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ _[Group]_ of six paths. Information about the vanishing points, and so forth are stored in the Inkscape _[Name Space](#name_spaces "name spaces")_. This extra information is only used by the _Box Tool_. All other tools treat the box as a normal _[Group]_. The sides of the box can be styled independently (or even deleted).

To draw a 3D box select the _Box Tool_ by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-cuboid.png) icon (**Shift**+**F4**) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_. Use a **Left Mouse Drag** to draw the left side of the box (in the _x_\-_y_ plane). The start of the drag sets one corner while the end of the drag sets the opposite corner. The other sides of the box are automatically drawn with the right side of the box set to a default width. Pressing the **Shift** while creating the box changes the function of the cursor to defining the depth (width of the right side or _z_ dimension) of the box.

![Simple 3D box.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Box.png)

A simple 3D box showing two sides and the box coordinate system. There are an additional four hidden sides.

When a box is selected and the _Box Tool_ active, a variety of handles are displayed. The eight handles at the corners of the box are used to adjust the size of the box. The four in front (see figure below) change the size of the left box face in the _x_\-_y_ plane. The other four change the depth (_z_) of the box. Holding the **Shift** down swaps the functions of the handles. With the **Ctrl** down, the handles are restricted in movement to lines along the box edges or to a box diagonal. This allows adjusting one dimension of a box face while keeping the other fixed in the first case or keeping the aspect ratio fixed in the latter case.

Dragging the _Cross_ handle moves the box while keeping the same perspective. Without a modifier key, the box is kept in the _x_\-_y_ plane. Holding the **Ctrl** down while dragging limits movement to lines along the box edge or along the box diagonal. Holding down the **Shift** while dragging moves the box in the _z_ direction.

![A 3D box with handles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Box1.png)

A simple 3D box showing showing its handles. Two of the _Front Resize_ handles are labeled. The other two are directly above those. The four remaining handles at the corners of the box are the _Back Resize_ handles. The cross in the middle is use to move the box while keeping the same perspective.

By default, a box is drawn with two vanishing points, one each on the left (_x_) and right (_z_) sides. The vanishing points are initially placed at the edge of the page, halfway between the top and bottom. These points are determined when the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ drawing is first created so resizing the page does not move them. The vanishing points can be dragged to new locations. Dragging the points a ways off the page will probably give you a more satisfactory perspective than the default.

All boxes that share the same vanishing points will change together. If you wish to change the vanishing points of just selected boxes, hold down the **Shift** while dragging. If multiple boxes are selected with different vanishing points, dragging a vanishing point for one box near that of another box will “merge” the points together.

![A 3D box with handles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Box4.png)

All the boxes share the same vanishing points. The “stack” was created by duplicating the bottom-center box and then dragging the _Move In Perspective_ handle with the **Shift** key or **Ctrl** key. Two moves were required for each box.

![A 3D box with handles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Box5.png)

The _Box Tool_ can be used to draw boxes with 1, 2, and 3-point perspectives as well as a box using an isometric projection. The above examples use a 2-point perspective with two vanishing points. The type of perspective is changed via the _Box Tool_ _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. Each of the three perspective points (_x_, _y_, and _z_) can be set to infinity or to a specific point. To set or unset a perspective point to infinity, toggle the “Parallel Lines” button (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/perspective-parallel.png)) in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ next to the appropriate angle (or use the keyboard shortcuts: **Shift**+**X**, **Shift**+**Y**, and **Shift**+**Z** that are available when using the _Box Tool_). When set to infinity, the direction of a perspective point is set by an _Angle_ parameter. The angles can be changed via the entry boxes in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ or by using the keyboard shortcuts: _x_: **\[**, **\]**; _y_: **(**, **)**; and _z_: **{**, **}**. The angles will be changed by the _Rotation snap angle_ (15  by default, settable in the _Steps_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog). With the **Alt** key, the angle change will be 0.5 .

The _[Box Tool]( "3D Boxes")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_, showing the default parameters for a 2-point perspective.

**1-point Perspective: ** Set the _x_ and _y_ vanishing points to infinity by using the _x_ and _y_ “Parallel Line” buttons (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/perspective-parallel.png)) in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. Set _Angle X_ to 180  and _Angle Y_ to 90 . Toggle off the “Parallel Line” button for _z_ and drag the vanishing point to the desired point (typically near the center of the drawing).

![1-Point Perspective.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Box6.png)

The boxes have been drawn using a 1-point perspective. The front side of the outer box has been made transparent.

**2-point Perspective: ** The default perspective. Set the _y_ vanishing point to infinity by toggling on the _y_ “Parallel Line” button (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/perspective-parallel.png)) in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. Set _Angle Y_ to 90 . Enable the _x_ and _z_ vanishing points by toggling off their “Parallel Line” buttons. Drag the _x_ and _z_ vanishing point to the desired points (typically at the same level on opposite sides of the page).

**3-point Perspective: ** Enable the _x_, _y_, and _z_ vanishing points by toggling off their “Parallel Line” buttons (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/perspective-parallel.png)) in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. Drag the _x_, _y_, and _z_ vanishing points to the desired places. Typically the _x_ and _z_ vanishing points are at the same level on opposite sides of the page. They are either above or below the page depending on if the observer is looking down or up at the scene. The _y_ vanishing point is then on the opposite side, either below or above the page.

![3-Point Perspective.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Box7.png)

The box has been drawn with a 3-point perspective. The vanishing points have been dragged off the page as indicated by the red, yellow, and blue lines. Dragging the _y_ vanishing point below the others turns the box inside out. The proper perspective can be achieved by changing the _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_ of the sides or by swapping the _x_ and _z_ vanishing points.

**Isometric Projection: ** Boxes can be drawn with an _Isometric Projection_ by toggling on all “Parallel Line” buttons in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ and setting the _x_, _y_, and _z_ angles to be: 150 , 90 , and 30 , respectively.

The perspective information is stored in the _defs_ section of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. Look for the “inkscape:perspective” tag. With the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ one can precisely place vanishing points. There is a triplet of numbers for each point (e.g., "inkscape:vp\_x"). The first two are the _x_ and _y_ coordinates of the vanishing point and the third is a flag to indicate if the perspective lines converge or are parallel.

### Attributes

The attributes of the six sides can be changed independently. To select one of the sides, one must use one of the methods of selecting an object in a _[Group]_. There is one problem: The common method for entering a _Group_, namely double-clicking on an object with the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_, won't work as this enables the _Box Tool_ instead. The _Group_ can be entered by selecting the box and using **Ctrl**+**Enter** or by selecting the _Enter group_ line from the pop-up menu when you **Right Click** on the box. Using **Ctrl**+**Left Mouse Click** will select a side of the box without entering the _Group_. Using **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**Left Mouse Click** to select a hidden side.

By default, a box will always be drawn with sides of the same default colors (shades of blue), even after editing the attributes for one side. This behavior can be changed by selecting the _Last used style_ option on the _3D Box_ page in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. If this option is selected, Inkscape will remember the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ colors independently for each side. Changing the color of one side will change the _[Current style](#CurrentStyle "Current Style:")_ for all other shapes but the inverse is not true.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Nested Boxes

Inkscape does not prevent you from creating a box inside another box _[Group]_. This can lead to strange behavior.

Ellipses, Circles, and Arcs
---------------------------

The _Ellipse Tool_ allows one to draw ellipses, circles, and arcs. Select the tool by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-ellipse.png) icon (**F5** or **e**) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_. To draw an ellipse or arc, use a **Left Mouse Drag**. An ellipse will be drawn with the sides touching a rectangular box defined by the starting and stopping points of the drag. To force a circle to be drawn, hold down the **Ctrl** while dragging the mouse. This also allows ellipses with a height to width or width to height ratio that is either an integer or in the “Golden Ratio” to be drawn. Holding the **Shift** key down while dragging will create an ellipse centered around the starting point. Holding down the **Alt** key while dragging will create an ellipse with the circumference passing through the start and end points of the drag. Using **Alt**+**Ctrl** while dragging will create a circle with a diameter defined by the distance between the start and stop point of the drag.

When an ellipse is selected and the _Ellipse Tool_ is active, the ellipse will have a set of handles (small squares and circles) that can be used to resize it or convert it to an arc. (The handles are also available if one of other shape _Tools_ or the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ is active.)

To change the size of the ellipse, drag the handle at the top or left. The **Ctrl** key can be used to force the ellipse to be a circle.

![An ellipse with handles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Arc.png)

An ellipse showing the _Resize_ and _Arc_ handles.

To convert an ellipse into an arc, use the two _Arc_ handles. Initially both handles are on top of each other. Drag one handle to set one end of the arc, then drag the second handle to set the other end. Holding down the **Ctrl** key while dragging an _Arc_ handle will force the angle of the arc to begin or end at a multiple of the _Rotation snap angle_ (15  by default).

![An arc with handles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Arc2.png)

An arc showing the _Resize_ and _Arc_ handles.The path of the arc is closed by an extension to the point at the center of the arc's curvature.

If an _Arc_ handle is dragged with the pointer outside the curve of the virtual ellipse, the arc will be defined with a closed path that has a wedge that extends to the center of curvature (as shown above). If the _Arc_ handle is dragged with the pointer inside the curve, the path defining the arc will start and stop at the two _Arc_ handles, as shown below.

![An arc with handles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Arc3.png)

An open arc.

An arc can also be defined using the settings in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ when the _Ellipse Tool_ is selected. The settings will affect any ellipse or arc that is selected as well as any that are drawn afterward. The _Start_ and _End_ angles are defined in degrees and are measured in the _clockwise_ direction starting at the _x_\-axis. There are two buttons that toggle arcs between opened (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-ellipse-arc.png)) and closed (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-ellipse-segment.png)) (switchable if either angle is not zero). There is also a button to reset an arc to an ellipse (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-ellipse-whole.png)).

Regular Polygons and Stars
--------------------------

The _Star Tool_ can be used to draw regular polygons and stars. To draw one of these objects, select the tool by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-polygon-star.png) icon (**Shift**+**F9** or **\***) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_. To draw a polygon or star, use a **Left Mouse Drag**. A star will be drawn with the center at the starting point of the drag and one vertex at the ending point of the drag. The vertex can be forced to be at a multiple of the _Rotation snap angle_ (15 degrees by default) by holding down the **Ctrl** key during the drag.

Stars can be reshaped by either dragging handles (small diamonds) on the star or by using the settings in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ when the _Star Tool_ is selected. Two important parameters can only be changed in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. The first is an option to specify that the shape drawn be a star or a polygon. This is controlled by two toggled buttons (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-polygon.png)and ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-star.png) ). The second is a parameter that controls the number of points in a star or the number of corners of a polygon.

The _[Star Tool]( "Regular Polygons and Stars")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.

There are two handles for stars (one for polygons). The _Tip radius_ handle (see the _[Notification Region](#notification)_ if in doubt which is which) is used to control the position of the tip of a star or corner vertex of a polygon. This is the handle that was used when first drawing the star or polygon. Using the **Ctrl** key while dragging the handle restricts it to a radial line.

![A star with handles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Star.png)

A star showing the _Tip radius_ and _Base radius_ handles.

The _Base radius_ handle controls the position of the “inner” vertex of a star. The _Base radius_ handle can be constrained to have an angle halfway between adjacent tips by holding down the **Ctrl** key while dragging it. Note that it is possible that the radius of the _Base_ vertex be larger than the _Tip_ vertex or it can be _negative_ as shown next.

![A star with a negative Base radius.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Star2.png)

Holding the **Shift** key while dragging either handle will round the corners of the star or pentagon.

![A star rounded corners.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Star4.png)

Holding the **Alt** key while dragging either handle will move all the star's or polygon's vertices independently in a random fashion.

![A star a random factor added.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Star5.png)

A star with a random factor added.

As mentioned above, the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ area contains entries to determine if a star or regular polygon is drawn and to set the number of points or vertices. For stars, it also contains a box to set the _Spoke ratio_. This is defined as the ratio of the _Base_ radius to the _Tip_ radius. Useful values are: for a regular 5-pointed star, 0.382; for a regular 6-pointed star, 0.577; and for a regular 8-pointed star, 0.541. Numerical values for _Rounded_ and _Randomized_ can also be entered (try −10 for _Rounded_!). And lastly, there is a _Defaults_ button (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-clear.png)) to reset all of the settings to their default values.

Spirals
-------

The _Spiral Tool_ can be used to draw [Archimedes' spirals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral). Other types of spirals can be drawn using the _[Function Plotter](#Extensions-FunctionPlotter "Function Plotter")_ extension with polar coordinates. Select the tool by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-spiral.png) icon (**F9** or **i**) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_. To draw a spiral, use a **Left Mouse Drag**. The start of the drag will be the spiral's center. Holding down the **Ctrl** key while dragging will constrain the position of the spiral end point to a multiple of the _Rotation snap angle_ (default 15 degrees). To reverse the direction of the spiral, flip it (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-flip-horizontal.png)Flip Horizontal (****H****) or Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-flip-vertical.png)Flip Vertical (****V****)).

Spirals can be reshaped by either dragging handles (small diamonds) on the spiral or by using the settings in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ when the _Spiral Tool_ is selected. There are two handles, the _Inner_ and _Outer_. Dragging either handle allows _rolling_ and _unrolling_ the spiral from its respective end (i.e., making the spiral longer or shorter, or changing the radius of the inner and outer ends). Holding down the **Ctrl** key forces the end to be at a multiple of the _Rotation snap angle_ with respect to the center. Holding down the **Shift** key while clicking on the _Inner_ handle will set the inner radius to zero.

![A spiral with handles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Spiral.png)

A spiral showing the Inner and Outer handles.

![A spiral.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Spiral1.png)

A spiral after unrolling one turn with the Inner handle.

The _Inner_ handle can also be used to change the divergence of the spiral by dragging the handle up or down while holding down the **Alt** key. The divergence is a measure of how rapidly the radius changes with respect to the angle as the spiral progresses. A divergence of one gives a spiral where the distance between successive turns remains uniform (an Archimedes' spiral). Divergences smaller (larger) than one give a spiral where the distance between successive turns decreases (increases) moving outward. Mathematically, the radius of a point is proportional to its angle (measured in radians) raised to a power equal to the divergence. Clicking on the _Inner_ handle while holding down the **Alt** key will reset the divergence to one.

![A spiral with a divergence of 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Spiral2.png)

A spiral with a divergence of 2.

![A spiral with a divergence of 0.5.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Spiral3.png)

A spiral with a divergence of 0.5.

The _Outer_ handle can be used to scale and rotate the spiral by dragging it with the **Shift** key pressed. If both the **Shift** and **Alt** keys are held down, then the spiral will only rotate, keeping the radius fixed.

The number of turns, divergence, and inner radius can all be set in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. These values can also be reset to their default values by clicking on the _Defaults_ button (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-clear.png)).

The _[Spiral Tool]_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.

To understand the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of spiral one must understand how Inkscape calculates _Fill_. This is covered in detail in [Chapter 10, _Attributes_]( "Chapter 10. Attributes"). A spiral is basically an open path. The _Fill_ is drawn as if the path was closed with a line segment between the path ends (the _Inner_ and _Outer_ handles). Then the current _[Fill Rule](#Attributes-Fill-Rule "Fill Rule")_ is applied.

![Spiral Fill 1.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SHAPES/Spiral_Fill1.png)

_Even-odd_ fill rule (left). _Non-zero_ fill rule (right).

How do you completely fill a spiral with the _Even-odd_ fill rule? The trick is to use a second duplicate spiral, with one less turn (drag _Outer_ handle to unwind the spiral one turn).

Paths are arbitrary shaped objects. This chapter first covers some path terminology and how paths are described in Inkscape, then moves onto how paths can be created, and finally how paths are edited. [Chapter 8, _Live Path Effects (LPEs)_]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)"), covers effects that can be applied to paths.

Paths can be _Open_ (have two ends) or _Closed_ (have no ends). They can also be _Compound_ (composed of separate open and/or closed paths).

![An Open path.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Path_Open.png)

A Compound path.

Paths differ from _[Shapes]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ in that there is no predefined structure. For example, a _[Rectangle]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ shape is defined in terms of a width and height with an _x_ and _y_ offset. A corner point cannot be moved independently of at least one other corner point. A path, in the shape of a rectangle, consists of the coordinates of the four corner points. A single corner point can be moved by itself with the resulting shape no longer rectangular.

Bezier Curves
-------------

Most paths are described internally in Inkscape (and in many other drawing programs) as a series of Bezier curves. It is very useful to understand the basic properties of Bezier curves for drawing and manipulating paths. Bezier curves are defined by four points, two of which are the _end_ points or _nodes_ of the curve. The other two are _control_ points or handles, each paired with one of the end points. The control points have the useful property that a line starting at one end of the curve and ending at the corresponding control point is tangent to the curve at the end point. This enables the smooth joining of multiple Bezier curves to form a path.

![A Bezier curve with control points.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Bezier1.png)

A Bezier curve showing the _end_ points (_nodes_) and _control_ points (_handles_).

Two or more Bezier curves can be joined to form a more complex path. The node where they are joined may be smooth, indicated by a square (normal) or circle (auto-smooth node, see [_Auto-smooth Nodes_](#Paths-Node-AutoSmooth "Auto-Smooth Nodes")).

![Two Bezier curves joined with a smooth point.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Bezier2.png)

Creating Paths
--------------

Paths can be created by the _[Pencil](#Paths-Pencil "The Pencil Tool")_ (Freehand), _[Bezier](#Paths-Bezier "The Bezier (Pen) Tool")_ (Pen), and _[Calligraphy](#Paths-Calligraphy "The Calligraphy Tool")_ drawing tools. They can also be created by conversion from a regular shape or text object.

By default, paths created with the _Pencil_ and _Bezier_ tools have a black stroke with a width of one pixel while the _Calligraphy_ tool will use the _[Current style](#CurrentStyle "Current Style:")_. These behaviors can be changed in the corresponding sections of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. (**Right Mouse Click** on the _[Current style](#CurrentStyle "Current Style:")_ indicator in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ to open the dialog.)

### The Pencil Tool

The _Pencil (or Freehand) Tool_ is perhaps the easiest tool with which to draw a path. Simply click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-freehand.png) icon (**F6** or **p**) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_ and then click-drag the mouse over the canvas to draw a line. Holding down the **Shift** key while drawing temporary disables nodes snapping to the _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ or _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_. It also, if a path is selected, add the new sub-path to the selected path.

Holding down the **Alt** key while drawing enables the _Sketch_ mode. While in this mode, all strokes are averaged to create a final stroke, temporarily shown as a red path. Releasing the **Alt** key finalizes the path. This feature is considered experimental and does not give the expected result if one strokes a line back and forth. Instead, draw all your strokes in the same direction.

As long as a path is selected, you can extend the path by click-dragging from one of the path's ends. To prevent adding to a path, deselect the path with the **Esc** key.

To delete an unfinished path, use **Esc** or **Ctrl**+**Z**.

Paths drawn with the _Pencil Tool_ tend to be composed of many Bezier curves leading to an erratic-looking path. One can smooth and simplify such curves by using the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-simplify.png)Simplify (****Ctrl**+**L****) command one or more times.

![A path drawn with the Pencil Tool.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Freehand.png)

A path drawn with the _Pencil Tool_ after zero, one, and multiple applications of the _Path Simplify_ command (with nodes shown).

There are two possible modes for the simplify command. The default is to treat all of the selected paths as one object. The second mode is to treat each sub-path separately. To use the second mode, add an entry in the “options” section with “simplifyindividualpaths” set to 1 in the `preferences.xml` file.

A variety of options are available from the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. These include selecting the drawing mode, the amount of smoothness, and a “brush”.

Using the _Pencil Tool_, a high _Smoothness_ value is more useful. The width can be adjusted by varying the _Width_ parameter in the _[Path Effect Editor]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)")_ dialog when the path is selected.
    

Single dots can be created by using **Ctrl**+**Left Mouse Click**. The size of the dot can be set in the _Pencil_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog as a multiple of the current _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ width. The dot is represented in _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ as a filled path. Adding the **Shift** key doubles the dot size (and prevents snapping) while adding the **Alt** creates a random-size dot. The _[Bezier Tool](#Paths-Bezier "The Bezier (Pen) Tool")_ has the same options.

### The Bezier (Pen) Tool

As mentioned previously, all paths are represented in Inkscape as a series of Bezier curves. The _Bezier (or Pen) Tool_ allows you to more directly control the Bezier parameters as you draw a path. To select the tool, click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-path.png) icon (**Shift**+**F6** or **b**) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Tip

This is one place where paying attention to the _[Notification Region](#notification)_ is especially useful. The region not only lists your options at each step but also gives the distance and angle the cursor is from the last node when placing a new node or dragging a handle.

To begin to draw a curve, click-drag on the canvas. The point where you click becomes the end point or node of the curve. As you drag the cursor, you'll see a gray line between the end point and the cursor. This line is a tangent to your curve at the end point. Release the mouse button to establish the first control point.

![Start of drawing Bezier curve.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/BezierTool0.png)

Start of drawing Bezier curve.

Move the cursor to the position of the next Bezier curve end point or node. A red line will show you the shape of the curve.

![End point of Bezier curve.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/BezierTool1.png)

Positioning of next Bezier curve end point (node).

Click-drag from the end point to draw out a handle that allows you to set the second control point. The pointer is actually pointing to the sister of the second control point, which is the initial control point of a second Bezier curve to be attached to the first. The two points are collinear with and the same distance from the Bezier curve end point or node.

![Setting of second Bezier curve.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/BezierTool2.png)

Setting of second Bezier curve control point.

Next, move the cursor to the end point of the second Bezier curve.

![End point of second Bezier curve.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/BezierTool3.png)

Positioning of end point (node) of second Bezier curve.

One can repeat the above steps to add as many Bezier curves to the path as required. To end the path, press **Enter** or do a **Right Mouse Click** after placing the last Bezier curve end point.

![A two Bezier curve path.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/BezierTool4.png)

The finished path, composed of two Bezier curves.

Other useful things to know while using the Bezier Tool:

*   To create a path of straight lines, click rather than click-drag at each node.
    
*   You can use the **Arrow** keys to move the last node created while drawing a path. **Shift**+**Arrow** moves the node by ten times the normal step, **Alt**+**Arrow** will move the node by a screen pixel.
    
*   To set the two control points of a node separately (and force the node to be a _corner_ point), first set the control point for the end point of the previous Bezier curve, then without releasing the mouse button hold down the **Shift** key while setting the control point for the next Bezier curve.
    
*   To constrain a node to be at a multiple of the _Rotation snap angle_ with respect to the previous node, hold down the **Ctrl** key while setting it.
    
*   To constrain a control point to be at a multiple of the of the _Rotation snap angle_ with respect to a node, hold down the **Ctrl** key while setting it. (Can be used in conjunction with the **Shift** key.)
    
*   To delete the last node drawn, use the **Backspace** key or the **Del** key.
    
*   To delete an unfinished path, use **Esc** or **Ctrl**+**Z**.
    
*   To change an unfinished segment (the red line) from a curve to a line, use **Shift**+**L**. To change an unfinished segment from a line to a curve, use **Shift**+**U**.
    
*   To extend a previously drawn path, select the path, then click or click-drag on an end point.
    
*   To close a path, click on the first endpoint when placing the last endpoint.
    

Two options are available from the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. They are selecting the drawing mode and selecting a “brush”.

### The Calligraphy Tool

As the name suggests, the _Calligraphy Tool_ can be used to draw calligraphic lines. The resulting paths are different than those drawn with the _[Pencil](#Paths-Pencil "The Pencil Tool")_ and _[Bezier](#Paths-Bezier "The Bezier (Pen) Tool")_ tools in that they are composed of two parallel (or almost parallel) sub-paths, allowing the resulting line to have a variable width. The path is not stroked, but the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ is solid (see [Chapter 10, _Attributes_]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")).

![A calligraphy path.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Calligraphy.png)

A path drawn with the _Calligraphy Tool_. The bottom path shows how the nodes are placed.

To begin drawing a Calligraphy path, select the tool by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-calligraphic.png) icon (**Ctrl**+**F6** or **c**) in the _Tool Box_ and then click-drag the mouse over the canvas to draw a line. The line will have by default the _[Current style](#CurrentStyle "Current Style:")_. You can choose to draw all lines with a fixed style by selecting the _This tool's own style_ option under the Calligraphy section in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. If you turn off the _Select new path_ option in the dialog, a newly drawn object will not remain selected; you can then choose a color from the _[Palette](#palette)_ for the next calligraphic stroke without changing the color of the previously drawn stroke.

The Calligraphy Tutorial (Help → Tutorials → Inkscape: Calligraphy) has many ideas on how to use the _Calligraphy Tool_.

The _Calligraphy Tool_ has many options, several accessible from the keyboard and the rest from the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. It is best just to try changing the various option settings to get the feel for them. With so many options, it is desirable to be able to save the settings for future use. You can create and access “Presets” from the drop-down menu at the left side of the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.

Options with keyboard:

*   To change the pen width while drawing: **Left Arrow** and **Right Arrow**. The **Home** key sets the width to the minimum while the **End** key sets the width to the maximum. Typing **Alt**+**X** will enable the _Width_ entry box in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_; enter a number and then hit **Enter** to set an exact width while drawing.
    
*   To change the pen angle while drawing: **Up Arrow** and **Down Arrow**.
    
*   To add to an existing (selected) path (form a union), hold the **Shift** down while drawing. _[Shapes]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ are automatically converted to paths.
    
*   To subtract from an existing (selected) path, hold the **Alt** down while drawing. _[Shapes]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ are automatically converted to paths.
    
*   To delete an unfinished path, use **Esc** or **Ctrl**+**Z**.

*   Predefined and custom presets: There are six predefined presets as shown in the figure below. You can add your own custom presets by selecting _Save..._ in the _Preset_ menu. A window will pop up where you can enter a name for your preset. The presets are stored in your preference file so they are available for future drawing sessions.

    Paths drawn with _Calligraphy Tool_ presets. From top to bottom: Dip pen, Marker, Brush, Wiggley, Splotchy, Tracing.
    
*   Pen width (1 to 100): number is tenths of percent of canvas width (i.e., 15 is 1.5% of canvas width). Note that if you change the zoom level, the effective pen width will change. To keep the pen width constant, check the _Width is in absolute units_ box under the _Tools-Calligraphy_ page in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. The pen width will then be in units of _px_.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/draw-use-pressure.png): On/Off button: Use tablet pressure for width (requires tablet input device).
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/draw-trace-background.png): Trace background: Vary the width of the pen as a function of the background. A dark background yields a wider pen.
    
*   Thinning (−100 to 100): How the width change depends on the speed of the drawing stroke:
    
    *   \> 0: Line width decreases with speed.
        
    *   \= 0: Line width independent of speed.
        
    *   < 0: Line width increases with speed.
        
    
*   Angle (−90 to 90 degrees): Angle of pen relative to horizontal axis.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/draw-use-tilt.png): On/Off button: Use tablet tilt for pen orientation (requires tablet input device).
    
*   Fixation (0 to 100): How the angle of the pen follows the direction of the pen.
    
    *   0: Angle follows pen direction (always perpendicular to motion).
        
    *   100: Angle fixed to angle defined in _Angle_ entry.
        
    
*   Caps (0.0 to 5.0): How round is the end of the stroke. This can be used to produce round end-caps when the fixation is small (i.e., simulating a round brush). Note that the cap extends beyond where the stroke would normally end.
    
    *   0.0: Flat end.
        
    *   1.0: Approximately semicircular.
        
    *   5.0: Elliptical, approximately five times longer than wide.
        
    
*   Tremor (0 to 100): How much random shake should the stroke have. This parameter can be used to create a more realistic looking calligraphic stroke by adding some randomness to the thickness of the stroke. It works by adding randomness to the node handle orientations.
    
    *   0: Smooth
        
    *   100: Chaotic.
        
    
*   Wiggle (0 to 100): How resistant the pen is to movement. With a value of 100, the pen will _wiggle_ all over the paper.
    
*   Mass (0 to 100): How the line follows pen movement. The more _massive_ the pen, the smoother the stroke but the less responsive the pen will be. Try a value of 10 for a good compromise between smoothness and responsiveness.
    

Two options require the use a tablet (e.g., Wacom): using tablet pressure to control the width of a stroke and using tablet tilt to control the orientation of the pen's nib. This is discussed in the next section.

#### Using a Tablet

_Updated for v0.48 and v0.48.1_

Inkscape can make good use of a tablet for input. This is especially true with the _Calligraphy Tool_ where stroke width and nib orientation can be controlled directly with a pen. Before using the special features of a tablet, the _extended input devices_ must be configured and enabled with the _Input Devices_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-input-devices.png)Input Devices... ). The dialog received a major change between v0.47 and v0.48. and a minor update between v0.48 and v0.48.1.

For each device (or pseudo device) there are three possible modes:

*   Disabled: Special features of extended input device disabled. Treat as a regular mouse.
*   Screen: Special features of extended input device enabled. Note that device will work as regular mouse outside of Canvas region.
*   Window: Extended input device works only in Canvas region. Normally, this mode is not needed and has been eliminated in v0.48.1.

**0.47 Dialog. ** To enable pressure and tilt control, select the device to be used from the pull-down menu at the top left then set the mode using the drop-down menu on the top right.

The _Axes_ tab allows you to swap input assignments; that is, the _x_\-axis for the _y_\-axis if you rotate the tablet by 90 degrees (although the axis are backward).

The _Keys_ tab allows you to assign key combinations to the macro keys, if any, on the tablet.

Pressure and tilt do not work properly on OS X due to problems with the X11 implementation.

![Input dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Input_0.47.png)

_Input Devices_ dialog in v0.47.

**0.48 Dialog. ** To enable pressure and tilt control, select the device to be used from the tree menu in the _Configuration_ tab. In v0.48, click on the entry at the right (Disabled/Screen/Window) to open a pop-up menu to set the mode (you may have to hold the button down for a bit to open the menu). If you don't see the entries on the right, widen the dialog window. In v0.48.1, check box at the far left of each line to switch to _Screen_ mode.

The _Hardware_ tab allows you to test an input device. If a device has been set in _Screen_ mode, then with the cursor in the test area, the little circles will change color in response to button events while the rectangles will change color in response to motion events (_x_ position, _y_ position, pressure, tilt left/right, tilt forward/back, wheel). An icon in the center of the test area shows the type of device in use (mouse, pen, eraser, pad). An addition, if the device you are testing is selected in the tree menu, the incoming data will be displayed numerically and graphically in the lower right.

Panning via Mouse Wheel Bug

In v0.48, if you enable the Wacom cursor, you may lose the ability to pan the canvas by using the mouse wheel. As there are no special features (tilt, pressure, etc.) associated with the cursor, it is best to leave it disabled.

#### Hatchings

The _Calligraphy Tool_ has an option that allows parallel lines (hatchings), as found in engravings, to be easily drawn. To use this option, first select a guide path. Any path, _[Shape]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ or text can be used as a guide. Then with the **Ctrl** key held down, drag the pointer along a line parallel to the guide path. The closest distance between the start of the drag and the guide path determines the distance the new line will be away from the guide. This is indicated by the gray circle around the pointer. As you begin to drag, the circle turns green. This indicates that the cursor is tracking the guide. When you finish drawing a line, don't release the **Ctrl**! Just start drawing (**Left Mouse Drag**) another line. As long as you hold the **Ctrl** key down, each new line will use the last drawn line as a guide and the spacing will remain the same.

If you deviate too far from the guide, the pointer will break free. This is indicated by a red circle. This is an intentional design decision to allow one to continue a line past the end of the guide. If you accidentally break free, you can delete the last path and start again; but you must reset the interline spacing. A slow steady hand works best. If the cursor is consistently closer or farther away from the guide path than the set spacing, the interline spacing will gradually decrease or increase. This is a subtle effect. Note: if the _Mass_ value is zero, you may get small discontinuities in the path that disrupt the tracking.

![Engraving 1.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Engraving1.png)

A series of “engraved” lines created with the _Calligraphy Tool_ while holding down the **Ctrl** key. The red line is the guide path.

The _Trace Background_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/draw-trace-background.png)) option can be used to generate hatchings with pen width reflecting the background darkness as shown below.

![Engraving 3.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Engraving3.png)

A tracing of the shadow on the left is shown on the right. The _[Tweak Tool]( "Chapter 11. Tweak Tool")_ was used to clean up the ends.

By default, each new line uses the previous line as its guide path. To use the original guide path for each line, turn off the option _Select new path_ found under the _Calligraphy Tool_ section in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. The author finds it easier to make hatchings with this option turned off.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Tip

Use _[Touch selection](#Select-Mouse-Touch)_ to select the lines in the hatchings. It is often easier to keep hatchings in a separate _[Layer]_.

### Paths from Other Objects

There are several ways to generate paths indirectly. One is to _convert_ a regular shape or text object into a path. Another is to use _Stroke to Path_, which converts a path into a closed path with two parallel sub-paths. A third way to generate a path is to trace a bitmap image. This method is considered in [Chapter 20, _Tracing Bitmaps_]( "Chapter 20. Tracing Bitmaps").

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

#### Object to Path

To convert a regular shape or text object to a path, use Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****). Once an object is converted, the object loses any special knowledge associated with its previous existence. For example, the text font cannot be changed. But once an object is converted to a path, it can be modified in any arbitrary way, as shown in [the section called “A Hiking Club Logo—An Exercise in Paths”]( "A Hiking Club Logo—An Exercise in Paths").

Converting text to path produces a _[Group]_ of paths with one path for each glyph. This allows the resulting characters to be manipulated easier as well as preserves any custom attributes (i.e., color) that individual glyphs might have had.

#### Stroke to Path

A stroked path can be converted to a filled object consisting of two parallel sub-paths using Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/stroke-to-path.png)Stroke to Path (****Ctrl**+**Alt**+**C****). The path should have a non-zero thickness. The before and after objects look the same but have different structure and behavior. See the difference in the nodes in the figures that follow.

![A stroked path.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Stroke_Path1.png)

A stroked path consisting of three nodes.

![A filled path made from a stroked path.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Stroke_Path2.png)

A filled path made from the stroked path by using the _Stroke to Path_ command. It consists of ten nodes.

The _Stroke to Path_ command can be used to make a sets of parallel lines. Simply draw the path you desire, setting the width to the desired gap plus the desired final stroke width. Convert the stroke to path, remove the fill, and add the stroke paint. The line segments at the ends can be removed if desired by selecting each pair of end nodes and using the _Delete segment between two non-endpoint nodes_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-delete-segment.png) command in the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ (see next section). The _[Path Offset](#Paths-Offsets "Path Offset Commands")_ commands (for closed paths) or _[Complex Strokes](#Attributes-Stroke-Complex "Complex Strokes")_ are alternative ways of creating parallel lines.

Creating parallel lines. From left to right: Single line, Filled path after _Stroke to Path_ command, Fill removed — Stroke painted, Paths at ends removed.

The _Stroke to Path_ command can also be used to make polygons with uniformly rounded corners, as shown below. The trick is to use a wide _Stroke_ and set the _[Join](#Attributes-Stroke-Join "Join Style")_ style to _Round_.

![A polygon with rounded corners.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Rounded_Polygon.png)

From left to right: A simple triangle; the triangle with a wide _Stroke_ (the _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ of the _Stroke_ has been set to 50% to allow the triangle shape to be seen); the finished triangle with rounded corners after using the _Stroke to Path_ command and after removing the inner triangle.

Editing Paths
-------------

_Updated for v0.48._

The primary means for editing paths is to use the _Node Tool_ to modify one or more path nodes. A few exceptions are covered at the end of this section (simplifying, reversing, and offsetting paths) and in [Chapter 11, _Tweak Tool_]( "Chapter 11. Tweak Tool").

### Using the Node Tool

Paths are normally edited using the _Node Tool_. This flexible tool enables the addition, deletion, and movement of nodes. A _Sculpting_ mode allows easy fine tuning of paths with many nodes. [_Auto-smooth_](#Paths-Node-AutoSmooth "Auto-Smooth Nodes") nodes enable nodes to be moved while maintaining smooth curves.

Select the _Node Tool_ by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png) icon (**F2** or **n**) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_. Then click on the path you wish to edit. All of the path's nodes will be shown. _New in 0.48:_ Additional paths can be added (or removed) from the selection with **Shift**+**Left Mouse Click**.

When the _Node Tool_ is over a path, the path's outline will briefly be displayed. The duration and color of this outline can be altered under the _Node_ entry in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (double-click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_ or call up the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog via File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)). _New in v0.48:_ If you are editing a complex drawing, you can improve performance by disabling updating of the path outline while dragging nodes. You can also disable updating the path itself while dragging nodes.

Parallels in Node and Object Editing

Many of the things you can do with objects, you can do with nodes using the same methods. This is especially true for selecting and moving nodes. For example, the **Arrow** keys move selected objects by the _Nudge factor_ when the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ is active; they move selected nodes by the _Nudge factor_ when the _Node Tool_ is active. (The _Nudge factor_ is a parameter that can be set in _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)) dialog under the _Steps_ tab.) Knowing this should make learning to use the _Node Tool_ quicker.

#### Selecting Nodes

Nodes must be selected before they can be edited (with one exception, click-dragging a path will move the path by adjusting the handles on the nearest nodes). Selected nodes are indicated by a change in color as well as a slight enlargement in size. _New in v0.48:_ Nodes from different paths can be selected at the same time if the paths are selected.

By default, the handles of the selected nodes are shown, as are the handles for adjacent nodes. If the handles get in the way of selecting nodes, they can be toggled off by clicking on the _Hide Handles_ icon ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/show-node-handles.png) in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. Clicking the icon a second time toggles the handles back on.

Nodes can be selected for editing a number of ways:

*   **Left Mouse Click** on a node to select that node. A node turns red when the pointer hovers over it and it can be selected (or deselected). Note that a node can be selected and moved in one step by click-dragging on the node.
    
*   **Left Mouse Click** on the path to select the nearest node on each side of the place where you clicked. The hand symbol is added to the pointer when hovering over a clickable path. Note that the path can be adjusted by click-dragging on the path. In this case, nearest nodes are not selected.
    
*   **Left Mouse Drag** will select all nodes within the rubber-band box. The drag must not begin on a path unless the **Shift** is used. Using the **Shift** key allows the drag to begin on a path except over a node (broken in v0.48).
    

Nodes can be added (or removed) from the selection by holding down the **Shift** key while using one of the previous methods.

Nodes can also be added to or removed from the selection by hovering the cursor over a node and using the **Mouse Wheel**, moving “up” to add nodes and “down” to remove nodes. The **Page Up** and **Page Down** keys can be used in place of the **Mouse Wheel** (broken on v0.48, fixed in v0.48.1). This selection technique is especially useful in conjunction with _[node sculpting](#Paths-Node-Sculpting "Sculpting Nodes")_.

Two modes are possible: The default mode adds nodes based on the _spatial_ distance from the cursor. If the **Ctrl** key is held down, the nodes are selected based on the _linear_ distance measured _along the path_ (swapped in v0.48, fixed in v0.48.1). In this latter case, only nodes in the same sub-path can be selected.

**Tab** selects the _next_ node in a path if one is already selected. This is usually the adjacent node in the direction the path was drawn. If no node is selected, it will select the first node. **Shift**+**Tab** will select the _previous_ node in a path. **Ctrl**+**A** selects _all_ nodes in a selected path. **!** inverts the node selection for any sub-path with at least one node selected. **Alt**+**!** inverts the node selection for the entire path (or paths).

#### Editing Nodes with the Mouse

The mouse can be used to move nodes and handles by dragging them. It can also be used to alter the shape of a path between two nodes by dragging the path. And finally, nodes can be inserted anywhere along a path by double-clicking the path or by clicking the path while holding down the **Ctrl**+**Alt** keys.

*   **Left Mouse Drag**: Move selected nodes: If the pointer starts over a selected node, all selected nodes will move. If the pointer starts over an unselected node, that node will be selected and moved.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**Left Mouse Drag**: Move selected nodes in either the horizontal or vertical direction.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**Left Mouse Drag**: Move selected nodes along a line collinear with a node handle or to its perpendicular (passing through the node). The handles used are those belonging to the node where the pointer begins the drag.
    
*   **Shift**+**Left Mouse Drag**: Temporarily disable snapping nodes to the _[Grid](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ or to _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_ (if snapping of nodes enabled). Broken in v0.48, fixed in v0.48.1.
    
*   **Left Mouse Drag**+**Space**: While dragging, drop an unlinked copy of the nodes. The copy is of the entire path even if only a few nodes are selected. Broken on v0.48.

##### Handles

A handle becomes active when the mouse hovers over its control point. The control point will turn red. The **Shift**, **Ctrl**, and **Alt** keys can be used in combination for the options listed below.

*   **Left Mouse Drag**: Move handle.
    
*   **Shift**+**Left Mouse Drag**: Rotate both handles of a node together (useful for corner nodes).
    
*   **Ctrl**+**Left Mouse Drag**: Snap handle to either a multiple of the _Rotation snap angle_ (15 degrees by default), a line collinear with or orthogonal to the original handle position, a line collinear with the opposite handle (if it exists), or a line collinear with the opposite straight line segment (if it exists).
    
*   **Alt**+**Left Mouse Drag**: Allow only angle and not length to change as handle is dragged.

#### Editing Nodes with the Keyboard

This section covers using the keyboard to move nodes and to adjust their handles. The keyboard can also be used to add and delete nodes, change the type of node, and to join or break paths. For these latter uses, see the keyboard shortcuts in the following section on the _Node Tool_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.

In this section, **Left-** and **Right-** applied to the **Ctrl** and **Alt** modifying keys refers to the keys on the left and right side of the **Space** bar. Using a left modifying key causes the left handle of a node to be modified; using a right modifying key modifies the rightmost handle. The definition of which handle is left or right is not always completely obvious as when one handle is directly above the other or when the leftmost handle is moved to the right of the former rightmost handle.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Multinode Operations

The scaling and rotating operations described below are different if one node is selected as compared to two or more nodes. If two or more nodes are selected, the nodes act like an object and scale or rotate around the center of the selection, as described in [the section called “Transforms with the Keyboard”](#Transforms-Keyboard "Transforms with the Keyboard") in [Chapter 5, _Positioning and Transforming_]( "Chapter 5. Positioning and Transforming"). If the mouse is over a node, then that node is used as the center of rotation. It is also possible to flip the nodes horizontally and vertically by using keyboard shortcuts.

![Node editing.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/NodeEditing.png)

An example of editing multiple nodes. The rectangles on the right are formed by one path. By selecting all the nodes on the right side of the path and using the normal transformation commands a perspective effect can be achieved. Use **<** to move the nodes closer together and the **Arrow** keys to move the nodes to the left and up.

#### Using the Node Tool-Tool Controls

The _Node Tool_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ provides an easy way to access many of the methods of editing nodes.

![The Node Tool-Tool Controls.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TOOL_BARS/ToolBar_Nodes.png)

The _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-add.png)(**Insert**): Insert new nodes into selected segments. (Note: Clicking on the path will select the nearest node on both sides of the point where the path was clicked. Double-clicking on the path or clicking the path once using the **Ctrl**+**Alt** keys will also insert a node, in this case under the pointer. Inkscape will try to add the node without changing the shape of the path by adjusting the handles of the nodes adjacent to the new node.)
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-delete.png)(**Backspace**, **Delete**, or **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**Left Mouse Click**): Delete selected nodes. Inkscape will attempt to preserve the shape of the path when nodes are removed by adjusting the handles of adjacent nodes. If you wish to remove a node and _not_ change the handles of adjacent nodes use **Ctrl**+**Backspace** or **Ctrl**+**Delete**.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-join.png)(**Shift**+**J**): Join (merge) selected endnodes. Normally the merged node is placed at the midpoint between the end nodes. With the keyboard shortcut, hovering the mouse over one of the end nodes will result in the merged node being placed at the position of that end node. _New in v0.48:_ If more than two end nodes are selected, pairs of end nodes will be merged, starting with the end nodes closest to each other until either zero or one end nodes are selected. If zero or one end node is selected at the start, then any adjacent stretches of selected nodes (including non-end nodes), will be merged into one node.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-break.png)(**Shift**+**B**): Break path at selected nodes. Each selected node is converted into two end nodes.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-join-segment.png): Join selected endnodes with a new segment. _New in v0.48:_ If more than two end nodes are selected, pairs of end nodes will be joined with a segment, starting with the end nodes closest to each other until either zero or one end nodes are selected. If zero or one end node is selected at the start, then any adjacent stretches of selected nodes (including non-end nodes), will have their middle nodes removed, leaving one segment between outermost selected nodes.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-delete-segment.png): Delete segment between two non-endpoint nodes.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/node-type-cusp.png)(**Shift**+**C**): Make selected nodes corner (or cusp). If the nodes are already cusp, both handles are retracted.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/node-type-smooth.png)(**Shift**+**S**): Make selected nodes smooth. When the keyboard shortcut is used, placing the mouse over a handle will preserve the position of that handle, rotating the partner handle, if extended, to be collinear. If the partner handle is not extended, the partner handle will be extended so that it is collinear and of the same length as the preserved handle. If the node is next to one straight line segment (the other segment being curved) and the opposite handle is not collinear with the segment, the keyboard shortcut will rotate it to be collinear, extending the handle if necessary. A second application will extend out the second handle.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/node-type-symmetric.png)(**Shift**+**Y**): Make selected nodes symmetric (and smooth).

#### Auto-Smooth Nodes

An _auto-smooth_ node is a special node that will automatically adjust to maintain a smooth path when it or one of its neighboring nodes are moved. To create _auto-smooth_ nodes, select the nodes and either use the keyboard shortcut **Shift**+**A** or click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/node-type-auto-smooth.png) in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. _Auto-smooth_ nodes revert to normal smooth nodes if their handles are explicitly adjusted or if the path is dragged on either side of the node.

A demonstration of using _auto-smooth_ nodes. From left to right: A path with _corner_ nodes. The path after converting the nodes to _auto-smooth_. The path after moving the two lower nodes.

_Auto-smooth_ nodes work by adjustments to the length and direction of the node's handles. The length of the handles are kept about one-third of the distance to the neighboring nodes, and the change in direction is a function of the relative position of the neighboring nodes.

#### Sculpting Nodes

The _Sculpting_ mode of the _Node Tool_ allows one to easily manipulate a complex path, adjusting multiple nodes at the same time. The basic use is to select a group of nodes and then drag one of the selected nodes with the mouse while holding down the **Alt** key. Only the dragged node moves the full amount. The selected nodes at the end remain fixed, and all the other selected nodes will move a distance that is a function of how far they are from the dragged node. The function takes the form of a _Bell Curve_ distribution. This is best illustrated by the following diagram.

![Basic node sculpting.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/NodeSculpting_Basic.png)

Adjusting a group of nodes using the _Sculpting_ mode. Top: A straight line with many nodes. Middle: The line after selecting all nodes and dragging the middlemost node with the mouse while holding down the **Alt** key. Bottom: The line after selecting only the leftmost nodes and dragging the center of the selected nodes down while holding down the **Alt** key.

As usual with the _Node Tool_, only paths may be sculpted. Any other objects must be converted to a path first. In the following illustration, a star has been converted to a path and then the innermost nodes were selected and one was dragged.

![Star node sculpting.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/NodeSculpting_Star.png)

Sculpting a star. Left: A star converted to a path. Right: After selecting the center nodes and dragging one node to the left while holding down the **Alt** key.

The uses of _Sculpting_ are endless. One can easily manipulate text into interesting shapes. In the following example, the text is sculpted in two different ways.

![Star node text.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/NodeSculpting_Text.png)

Top: Regular text. Middle: Text converted to a path with additional nodes added. First the leftmost characters were selected and one of the middle nodes dragged upward. This was repeated twice for each three letter group on the right. Bottom: The same text as above, but this time the bottommost nodes of each letter were excluded from the selection.

With a tablet, pressure sensitivity can be used to control the extent to which neighbor points are dragged. Neighbor nodes will move farther if the pressure used is greater. The tablet input device must be enabled; see the _[Calligraphy Tool](#Paths-Calligraphy "The Calligraphy Tool")_ section. Broken in v0.48.

![Sculpting with tablet.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/NodeSculpting_Pressure.png)

### Path Offset Commands

There are four commands grouped under this category, although one of them might be better thought of as a cloning tool. Each allows a path to be enlarged or reduced by moving each point perpendicular to a line tangent to the path at that point. A regular shape or text object is converted to a path automatically, except for the _Linked offset_ command. The new paths are all closed, even if the original is open.

### Miscellaneous Path Commands

The commands have in common that they act on the entire path, and not on a subset of a path's nodes.

*   Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-combine.png)Combine (****Ctrl**+**K****) Combine paths: Combine selected paths into a compound path. This will work for any set of paths regardless of how the paths are arranged in _[Groups]_.
    
*   Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-break-apart.png)Break Apart (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**K****) Break apart paths: Break selected compound path(s) into simple paths.
    
*   Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-reverse.png)Reverse (****Shift**+**R****) (keyboard shortcut only works with _Node Tool_): Reverse path: Reversing the direction of a path will affect things like the order in which nodes are selected by **Tab** and in the direction of _[Markers](#Attributes-Stroke-Markers "Markers")_ (e.g., arrows). _New in v0.48:_ It is possible to display “harpoons” indicating path direction by selecting _Show path direction on outlines_ in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. The outline must be visible (toggle on either by selecting _Always show outline_ in the dialog or clicking the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/show-path-outline.png) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_).
    
*   Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-simplify.png)Simplify (****Ctrl**+**L****) Simplify path: This command reduces the number of nodes in a path while keeping the shape of the path almost the same. The larger the selection, the more aggressive the simplification. The command may be repeated. If repeated within a set time period (0.5 seconds), the simplification also becomes more aggressive. The _Simplification threshold_ can be changed under the _Misc_ tab in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences...

Path Operations
---------------

Inkscape has a number of commands to form new paths from two or more preexisting paths. The _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_ (see [the section called “Ordering Objects (Z-Order)”]( "Ordering Objects (Z-Order)")) of the paths is important. In all cases except for the _Cut Path_ command, the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of the new path is inherited from the _bottom_ path. For some operations, the _top_ path can be thought of as operating on the _bottom_ path; that is, part of the _bottom_ path remains and the _top_ path is thrown away. This is explained in more detail for each operation that it applies to below. All commands are accessible under the _Path_ menu.

Any open paths are, for the purpose of these commands, closed by a line between the path's end points. Shape objects and text objects are automatically converted to paths.

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-union.png)Union (**Ctrl**+**+**): Union of one or more paths. One new path is created, containing all the areas of the original paths. A union of one path removes self-intersections, creating individual sub-paths for each section. Note that this is different from the _Path Combine_ command where no nodes are lost or created.
    
    ![The path Union operation.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Path_Union.png)
    
    The path _Union_ operation.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-difference.png)Difference (**Ctrl**+**\-**): Difference of two paths. The area of the top path is removed from the bottom path.
    
    ![The path Difference operation.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Path_Difference.png)

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-intersection.png)Intersection (**Ctrl**+**\***): Intersection of two or more paths. The new path encloses the common area of the original paths.
    
    ![The path Intersection operation.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/Path_Intersection.png)
    
    The path _Intersection_ operation.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-exclusion.png)Exclusion (**Ctrl**+**^**): Exclusion of two or more paths. One new path consisting of multiple sub-paths is created according to an [_Even-Odd Fill_](#Attributes-Fill-EvenOdd "Even-odd rule.") rule. Inkscape v0.46 and earlier allowed only two paths to be used.

_Live Path Effects_, or _LPEs_ for short, is a system for applying some kind of effect to a path. Inkscape stores the original path data in the Inkscape _[Name Space](#name_spaces "name spaces")_ so that it can be modified at a later time (it will not be displayed by other _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ renderers). If the original path is modified, the _LPE_ will be regenerated. The resulting path is stored as a normal _SVG_ path.

Inkscape includes a handful of _LPEs_. With a solid framework in place, it is planned to migrate most of the path effects found under the _[Extensions]( "Chapter 22. Extensions")_ menu to _[LPEs]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)")_. This has two advantages: The effects will be faster to render and the original path is stored for future editing. _[LPEs]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)")_ also work with _[Groups]_ of paths. Regular _[Shapes]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ are converted to paths automatically.

To use an _[LPE]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)")_, select a path (the _skeleton_ path), call up the _Path Effect Editor_ dialog (Path → Path Effect Editor... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**7****)), select the desired effect from the drop-down menu in the dialog, and then click the _Add_ button. Multiple effects can be chained (stacked) together. The order in which each effect is applied can be changed using the arrow icons. Each effect can be temporarily “turned off” by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-visible.png) icon next to the effect name. This is handy if you want to edit the _skeleton_ path (or a _[Group]_ of _skeleton_ paths).

![Path Effect Editor dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_PathEffectEditor.png)

_Path Effect Editor_ dialog with a path selected.

When an object is selected that was generated by an _[LPE]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)")_ and the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ is enabled, the original _skeleton_ path nodes are displayed. In addition the path itself may be displayed in red. Visibility of the path is controlled by the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/show-path-outline.png) icon located in the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. This path can be edited like any other path.

Several of the effects require one or more additional _control_ paths. In this case, the needed paths are automatically generated (straight green lines). To see these paths, either click on the node editing icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png)) in the dialog or press **7** while the object is selected and the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ is active. A _control_ path is fully editable like any other path. The path can be replaced by another through pasting from the _[clipboard](#Clipboard "Clipboard:")_ using the paste icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-paste.png)) in the dialog. You may need to translate the _control_ path (select all nodes then drag with the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_). The path can also be copied to the _clipboard_ by using the copy icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-copy.png)) in the dialog.

An existing path can be used as a control path through linking. To create a link, first copy the path (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-copy.png)Copy (****Ctrl**+**C****)) to the _clipboard_ and then click the link icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-clone.png)). Note that the linked path must be copied and not cut. Linking can be used with _[Shapes]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ and Text without converting them to paths first.

_LPEs_ are normally applied recursively to all objects in a _[Group]_. The [_Bend_] and [_Deformation_]( "Envelope Deformation") _LPEs_, however, are applied to the whole _[Group]_ once.

An _[LPE]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)")_ can be converted to a regular path(s) by using the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****) command. An _[LPE]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)")_ can be removed using the Path → Remove Path Effect command. An _LPE_ can be copied from one object to another using the Path → Paste Path Effect (****Ctrl**+**7****) command. To do so, first copy the object with the _LPE_ you wish to paste using the Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-copy.png)Copy (****Ctrl**+**C****) command.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

The implementation of _LPEs_ has many bugs, especially if removing effects from a path or chaining _LPEs_. Paths can be left with _LPE_ cruft in their attributes and without a valid _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ path. You can always check objects with the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog. It may be useful to vacuum the file (File →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/document-cleanup.png)Vacuum Defs) to remove unused _LPE_ definitions. Save work often!

Bend
----

This effect takes an existing path (_skeleton_) and allows one to “bend” it in a well-defined way via a _control_ path. The _control_ path is automatically created. The style of the bent path is taken from the style of the original path.

To apply the effect, with the source path selected, and using the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ select the _Bend_ option from the drop-down menu in the _[Path Effect Editor]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)")_ dialog. Click on the _Add_ button. The path will turn red. A red path always corresponds to the original source or _skeleton_ path. Next, click on the node icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png)) in the _Path Effect Editor_ dialog. A green, horizontal path will appear in place of the red path. This path controls the bending. It can be manipulated in all the ways that a regular path can be including adding new nodes and dragging the path.

The effect assumes that the _skeleton_ path is orientated in the horizontal direction. If it is in the vertical orientation, one can check the _Original path is vertical_ box. This distorts the aspect ratio. Restore the aspect ratio by checking the _Width in units of length_ box. The size of the bent path can be changed by changing the size of the _control_ path.

Construct Grid
--------------

This effect uses the first three nodes of a path to define a two dimension grid. The center node defines the origin, the first and third nodes define the direction and length of the two adjacent sides of the first cell. If a path has more than three nodes, the other nodes are ignored. One can select the number of cells in the two orthogonal directions.

Envelope Deformation
--------------------

This effect deforms a path by using four _control_ paths, one for each side of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_. Each _control_ path can be edited individually by clicking on the corresponding ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png) icon. When editing of one _control_ path is enabled, that path will be shown in bold green; the other _control_ paths will be shown with thinner green lines in v0.47 (not shown in v0.48). Note that the when copying, pasting, or linking a _control_ path, the _control_ path is referenced from the bottom left corner of the page.

There are options to enabling and disabling the top and bottom paths separately from the left and right paths.

Gears
-----

This effect draws a series of intermeshed gears. It is more of a toy effect, designed to demonstrate the possibilities of _LPEs_. The _[Gear](#Extensions-Gear "Gear")_ extension can also be used to draw gears with a bit more control.

The effect uses the nodes of a path to determine how the gears are drawn. At least three nodes are needed to specify the first gear. Additional gears require one additional node each. Some nodes may be skipped if they would result in impractical gears.

![Gear effect.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_Gears.png)

An example of using the _Gear_ LPE. The original path is shown in red. Point 1 defines the orientation of the first gear. Point 2 defines the center of the first gear. Point 3 defines the radius of the first gear. Points 4, 5, and 6 determine the centers of additional gears. The radius of the second gear is determined by subtracting the radius of the first gear from the distance between the centers of the first and second gears.

Two parameters are available: _Teeth_ determines the number of teeth on the first gear. _Phi_ determines the _Pressure Angle_ of the gears. For real gears the _Pressure Angle_ is typically 14.5, 20, or 25 degrees. Note: The default angle is 5 degrees, not a very realistic value.

Hatches (Rough)
---------------

This effect fills the area inside a path with a squiggly line that simulates quick, hand-drawn shading. Shapes are automatically converted to paths. Note: the squiggly line is constructed like a calligraphic stroke, that is by two almost parallel lines. This allows for variations in line thickness. You may get better results by adding a _Fill_ and removing the _Stroke_ (not automatically done by the effect). Warning: this effect appears to make heavy demands on the CPU.

There are a great many options to control the way the hatches are drawn. The spacing, direction, and amount of _bend_ are determined by on-canvas nodes, visible when the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ is in use. The other options are controlled in the _[Path Effect Editor]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)")_ dialog. Many of the options have a random factor. One can “re-roll the dice” by clicking on the _randomize_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/randomize.png)) icon.

![Hatches (rough) effect: nodes.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_Hatches1.png)

Definition of the nodes used to control the spacing, direction, and amount of bend of the hatches. The circle nodes are reference points. The distance and direction the diamond nodes are displaced from the circle nodes determines the applicable parameters.

Interpolate Sub-Paths
---------------------

This effect creates additional paths by interpolating between two sub-paths. A _Trajectory_ (_control_) path dictates where the additional paths are placed. Note: Only the first and last sub-paths are used.

The total number of paths (including the two sub-paths) can be specified by the _Steps_ parameter. An additional option _Equidistant spacing_ determines if the nodes of the _Trajectory_ path are used in the interpolation. If the option _Equidistant spacing_ is checked, the additional paths are spaced evenly along the _Trajectory_ path. If it is not checked, the additional paths are divided between the intermediate nodes (see following figure).

Knot
----

This effect attempts to turn a path into a knot. That is, at each point where the path crosses itself, part of the path is hidden so it appears that that part is below the other part. As one follows the path, the effect attempts to alternate between going above and below.

Left: A path created by the [_Parametric Curves_](#Extensions-ParametricCurves "Parametric Curves") extension. Right: After applying the _Knot_ LPE. (Note: the path was closed by merging the first and last nodes before applying the LPE.)

The gap (length of hidden path) is the sum of the: _Fixed width_ (in terms of _stroke width_ if the _In units of stroke width_ box is checked or pixels otherwise), the stroke width (if the _Stroke width_ box is checked), and the crossing stroke width (if the _Crossing path stroke width_ box is checked).

Two circular paths in a _[Group]_. From left to right: Default values. Unchecking _In units of stroke width_. Unchecking _In units of stroke width_ and _Stroke width_. Unchecking _In unit of stroke width_ and _Crossing path stroke width_.

You can set which path crosses the other or remove the gap completely by using the _Switcher_. The _Switcher_ is visible when the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ is active. It consists of a circular arrow centered around the crossing point. Clicking on the diamond node at the crossing point toggles between the three states. To change another crossing, drag the diamond node to that crossing; the _Switcher_ will follow. Note: as of now, the _Switcher_ does not work when paths are in a _[Group]_.

Pattern Along Path (LPE)
------------------------

This effect puts one or more copies of one path (_pattern_) along a second, _control_ or _skeleton_ path. The resulting object takes the attributes (_[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_, etc.) of the _skeleton_ path.

This _LPE_ duplicates much of the functionality of the _[Pattern along Path](#Extensions-PatternAlongPath "Pattern Along Path (Extension)")_ extension. The advantage of using the _LPE_ version is that both the pattern and the _skeleton_ path can be edited at a later time. The disadvantages are that only paths can be used for the pattern and that there are fewer options. One subtle difference is that the _LPE_ version will bend straight lines drawn with two nodes while the extension version leaves them straight.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Note

Only a path can be used as a pattern. Many objects such as _[Rectangles]( "Rectangles and Squares")_, _[Ellipses]( "Ellipses, Circles, and Arcs")_ and text must first be converted to a path (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****)).

To put a pattern on a path:

1.  **Copy the pattern: ** Select the pattern and copy it to the _[clipboard](#Clipboard "Clipboard:")_ (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-copy.png)Copy (****Ctrl**+**C****)). The pattern must be a single path.
    
2.  **Select the skeleton path: ** Only one can be selected.
    
3.  **Apply the effect to skeleton path: ** In the _[Path Effect Editor]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)")_ dialog, select _Pattern Along Path_ and click on the _Add_ button.
    
4.  **Paste pattern: ** Click on the _Paste_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-paste.png)) icon in dialog.
    

The _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of the pattern is used for placing the pattern along the path, with the _bounding box_ of one pattern copy touching the _bounding box_ of the next copy (if no additional spacing is specified).

![Bend Along Path effect.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_PatternAlongPath.png)

Demonstration of the _Pattern Along Path_ effect. Top: Pattern path. Middle: Skeleton or control path. Bottom: After pasting pattern to skeleton path and enabling editing of the skeleton path. Note that the created object takes the attributes of the skeleton path.

To edit the pattern, click on the node editing icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png)) in the dialog. A temporary green copy of the pattern will appear at the pattern's original location. Any edit to this copy will be reflected in the final object.

To edit the _skeleton_ path, select the object with the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_. A temporary red copy of the _skeleton_ path will appear. This can be edited as any other path.

A different pattern can be applied to the _skeleton_ path by copying the pattern to the _[clipboard](#Clipboard "Clipboard:")_ ((Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-cut.png)Cut (****Ctrl**+**X****) or Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-copy.png)Copy (****Ctrl**+**C****)) and then clicking on the _Paste_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-paste.png)) button in the dialog.

A copy of the original pattern can be placed on the _clipboard_ by clicking on the _Copy_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-copy.png)) button in the dialog. The copy will have all attributes unset.

The _Pattern copies_ drop-down menu has options to stretch the pattern to the path length and/or to put multiple copies along the _skeleton_ path.

![Bend Along Path effect: Repeat.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_PatternAlongPath2.png)

A small lizard is put on a path with _Pattern copies_ set to, from top to bottom: _Single_; _Single, stretched_; _Repeated_; _Repeated, stretched_.

The _LPE_ assumes that the pattern is drawn horizontally. This can be changed to vertical by checking the _Pattern is vertical_ box.

![Bend Along Path effect: Vertical pattern.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_PatternAlongPath3.png)

A small lizard is put on a path with the _Pattern is vertical_ box checked.

You can specify the spacing between each copy of the pattern with the _Spacing_ parameter. You can also specify a transverse (_Normal offset_) and/or a tangential (_Tangential offset_) for each copy. The spacing and offsets are specified in pixels by default. Checking the _Offsets in units of pattern size_ will use units of the pattern size (width for spacing and transverse offset, height for tangential offset).

![Bend Along Path effect: Offsets.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_PatternAlongPath4.png)

From left to right: A blue square pattern is placed along the the path indicated by the arrowed line. _Spacing_ set to 10 pixels. _Normal offset_ set to 10 pixels. _Tangential offset_ set to 10 pixels.

One last option, _Fuse nearby ends_, joins copies of the pattern into a continuous path. It is similar to using the _Join selected endnodes_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-join.png)) option of the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ to connect sub-paths.

Sketch
------

This effect simulates sketching a path. There are two different kinds of lines drawn: The first are _Strokes_ that follow the curvature of the path. The second are _Construction lines_ that are straight and tangent to the path.

![Sketch effect.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_Sketch1.png)

Top to bottom: The _skeleton_ path. The resulting path when the Sketch effect is applied with default values. After setting _Strokes_ to 1 and _Construction lines_ to 0. After setting _Strokes_ to 0 and _Construction lines_ to 5.

The following parameters are available for _Strokes_:

*   Strokes: the average number of strokes along any point on the line (not counting overlaps).
*   Max stroke length: maximum stroke length in pixels.
*   Stroke length variation: random variation in stroke length in units of _Max stroke length_.
*   Max. overlap: maximum amount strokes overlap in units of _Max stroke length_.
*   Overlap variation: random variation in stroke overlap relative to _Max. overlap_.
*   Max. end tolerance: random variation in position of outermost stroke ends relative to _Max stroke length_. A non-zero value effectively shortens the length of the sketched path relative to the original path.
*   Average offset: average displacement of strokes from _skeleton_ path in pixels. Strokes follow a uniform distribution between twice this distance on either side of the _skeleton_ path.
*   Max. tremble: maximum fluctuation of a stroke from its nominal position.
*   Tremble frequency: roughly the number of intermediate nodes in a stroke used to create the tremble.

![Sketch effect 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_Sketch2.png)

Stroke parameters. All figures with _Strokes_ set to 1, _Max stroke length_ set to 100.00, and _Average offset_ set to 5. All other parameters are set to zero unless otherwise noted. The dashed box shows the length of the _skeleton_ path and the maximum offsets (twice _Average offset_). From top to bottom: All parameters as above. _Max stroke length_ set to 20. _Stroke length variation_ set to 1.00. _Max. overlap_ set to 0.50. _Max. end tolerance_ set to 0.20; note that the ends are only shortened and never lengthened. _Max. tremble_ set to 10.00 and _Tremble frequency_ set to 10.00.

The following parameters are available for _Construction lines_:

*   Construction lines: number of lines to draw.
*   Placement randomness: How lines should be distributed: 0.0 for even spacing, 1.0 for maximum randomness.
*   Scale: factor correlating curvature to length of lines. The effect attempts to keep the distance at the end of the lines equal distance from the path (given smooth curvature).
*   Max. length: maximum length of construction lines. Lines will be shorter if the _Scale_ factor requires them to be so that their ends are not too far from curve.
*   Length variation: random variation on line lengths. Always smaller.

Spiro Spline
------------

This effect turns a series of nodes into a silky-smooth path defined entirely by the position of the nodes. The method was devised by Raph Levien for use in designing fonts. [_Spiro_](http://www.levien.com/spiro/) curves have splines that are joined together smoothly.

The _Spiro Spline_ _LPE_ can be enabled two different ways. The first is to use the _Path Effect Editor_ dialog like for any other _LPE_. The second is to enable the _Spiro_ path option in the _[Pencil Tool](#Paths-Pencil "The Pencil Tool")_ or _[Bezier Tool](#Paths-Bezier "The Bezier (Pen) Tool")_ _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ by selecting the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/path-mode-spiro.png) icon. Note that the _Spiro_ path will not be shown until the _skeleton_ path is completed. Using the _Spiro Spline_ _LPE_ is probably not so useful with the _Pencil Tool_ unless _Smoothing_ is set to a moderate value.

The _Spiro Spline_ _LPE_ uses the following node types:

*   Smooth node: curve smooth at node and rate of curvature continuous. This is indicated by either a square or diamond node with both handles collinear. To convert a node to a smooth node, select it and either click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/node-type-smooth.png) icon or use **Shift**+**S**.
*   Corner node: connects two different curved splines at a corner. This is indicated by a node with either one or both handles being retracted or the handles being noncollinear. To convert a node to a corner node either retract a handle (**Ctrl**+**Left mouse click** on handle), or change to a corner (diamond) node (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/node-type-cusp.png), **Shift**+**C**) and move one or retract one of the handles so the handles are no longer collinear (using **Shift**+**C** a second time will retract both handles).
*   Tangent node (also called a left or right node): connects a straight line segment smoothly to a curve. To make a tangent node, ensure one side of the node consists of a straight line (select both nodes on either side of the segment and either click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/node-segment-line.png) icon or use (**Shift**+**L**).

![Spiro Spline effect.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_SpiroSpline1.png)

A path composed of a line and two _Spiro_ splines (separated by a _Corner_ node).

Visualization of the _skeleton_ path is probably not very useful. It can be toggled off by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/show-path-outline.png) icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. It is sometimes useful to see the node handles. They can be toggled on by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/show-node-handles.png) icon. They are only shown for selected nodes and nodes adjacent to selected nodes. Bug: If the handles are not visible when they should be, toggle off, then back on the node handles.

![Spiro Spline effect 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_SpiroSpline2.png)

The same path as in the previous figure, but showing the _skeleton_ path with node handles. Note that what is important for a _Spiro_ spline is the collinearity of the handles with each other (smooth vs. corner node) or with a line segment (corner vs. tangent node). The actual directions of the handles for a smooth or corner node are irrelevant.

The algorithm for generating _Spiro_ splines is not particularly robust and sometimes yields wild curves. You can always return to a sane point by undoing the edit that caused the curves to go berserk.

For the technically inclined, in a Spiro curve, splines are joined such that the curve is smooth and the curvature is continuous. Although the _Spiro_ package allows for _G4_ nodes (continuous to the fourth derivative), Inkscape uses only _G2_ nodes (continuous to the second derivative).

_Spiro Spline_ paths are also implemented in the font editing program [_FontForge_](http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/editspiro.html). Unfortunately, there is currently no way to share _Spiro Spline_ paths between the two without first converting to Bezier splines.

Stitch Sub-Paths
----------------

This effect draws a series of _Stroke paths_ between points on sub-paths. Some of the things it is useful for are drawing hatched shading and for drawing hair.

To stitch a sub-path:

1.  **Draw the sub-paths: ** Draw two simple paths. Combine into a compound path consisting of two sub-paths using Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-combine.png)Combine (****Ctrl**+**K****). The two sub-paths should be drawn in the same direction. If not, use the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-reverse.png)Reverse (****Shift**+**R****) command on one of the sub-paths (prior to combining) to reverse its direction.
    
2.  **Apply the effect to compound path: ** In the _[Path Effect Editor]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)")_ dialog, select _Stitch Sub-Paths_ from the _Apply new effect_ menu and click on the _Add_ button.
    
3.  **Adjust _Stroke path_: ** Click on the node editing icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png)) to edit the _Stroke path_.
    

![Stitch path effect: basics.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_StitchPath1.png)

A basic example of using the _Stitch Sub-Paths_ LPE. Left: A simple path was drawn and duplicated. The two paths were then combined into a compound path (Path → ![Stitch path effect: basics.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-combine.png)Combine (****Ctrl**+**K****)). The effect was then applied. The red lines are shown when the LPE object is selected with the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ enabled. Right: The _Stroke path_ (green) has been enabled via clicking on the node-editing icon (  ![Stitch path effect: basics.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png)) and the path adjusted. The original sub-paths (not normally visible) are shown by blue-dashed lines. Note how the ends of the _Stroke path_ are no longer on the original sub-paths. This is because Inkscape uses the center on the left and right of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ to place the _Stroke path_.

The _Stitch Sub-Paths_ effect can be used to create the hatchings typically used in engravings as shown in the following example. While the [_Interpolate Extensions_](#Extensions-Interpolate "Interpolate") could be used to created some of the shadings, it cannot create the horizontal shadings on the cylinder below (likewise, the _Stitch Sub-Paths_ effect cannot easily create the precise circular hatching inside the cylinder).

![Stitch path effect: hatchings.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_StitchPath2.png)

A simple example of using the effect for hatchings. Left: The _[Box Tool]( "3D Boxes")_ was used to draw a box. Then the _[Bezier Tool](#Paths-Bezier "The Bezier (Pen) Tool")_ was used with snapping to draw paths on both sides of a box face. The paths were combined and the effect applied. For the right side of the box, the effect was used twice, once for the horizontal lines and once for the vertical lines. Right: Two ovals were drawn to fit in two opposite side of a box. The ovals were converted to paths and split into two sections. The left sections were used for the inside hatching and the right sections for the outside. The circular hatching inside the cylinder was done by using the [_Interpolate_](#Extensions-Interpolate "Interpolate") extension.

By varying both the sub-paths and the _Stroke path_ quite complicated hatchings can be created. The hatchings can be [clipped] to limit their range. The _[Tweak Tool]( "Chapter 11. Tweak Tool")_ could also be used to refine the hatchings if the hatchings are converted to stroked paths (see [Chapter 11, _Tweak Tool_]( "Chapter 11. Tweak Tool")).

![Stitch path effect: hatchings 3.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_StitchPath4.png)

Hatching created by: 1. Copying the bottom half of the object's path. 2. Duplicating the copy with an offset to the upper left. 3. Applying the _Stitch Sub-Paths_ LPE with 50 paths. 4. Adjusting the sub-paths and _Stroke path_. 5. Repeating with the duplicate offset to the upper right. 6. Grouping the hatchings and clipping with a copy of the original path.

The _Stroke Sub-Paths_ _LPE_ has options that add random shifts to the start and end of each stitching path. The “variance” options can be used to draw hair as shown below. Each variance has a dice icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/randomize.png)) next to it which, if clicked, sets a new starting random number seed. This will change the random shifts but keep the average shift the same.

![Stitch path effect: hair.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_StitchPath5.png)

Drawing hair: The sub-paths are shown in red. The number of paths was set to 200 and the following variances were used: Start edge: 0.02, Start spacing: 0.10, End edge: 0.10, End spacing: 0.10.

Interesting geometric patterns can be created with this effect as shown next.

![Stitch path effect: Circles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_StitchPathY.png)

For these designs, a circle was converted to a path and then duplicated. The path copy was rotated and then the two paths combined into a compound path. Left: The duplicate path was rotated 45  and the _Number of paths_ was set to 37 (the first and last path are on top of each other). Right: The duplicate path was rotated 150  and the _Number of paths_ set to 25. The _Stroke path_ was bent until the path ends joined new paths.

What if multiple sub-paths are used? Each sub-path will be connected to every other sub-path by the specified _Number of paths_. This can be used to created some interesting patterns.

![Stitch path effect: Decagons.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_StitchPathZ.png)

An example of using the multiple sub-paths. A decagon was drawn with the _[Star Tool]( "Regular Polygons and Stars")_ tool. The decagon was converted to a path (Path → ![Stitch path effect: Decagons.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****)). The path was broken into 10 sub-paths by using the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ (select node, click on ![Stitch path effect: Decagons.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-break.png) in _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_). Finally, the _Stitch Sub-Paths_ LPE was applied. Left: _Number of paths_ set to two. Right: _Number of paths_ was set to three. Higher numbers yield rendering errors in Inkscape (but display correctly in Firefox 3 and Opera 9.26).

VonKoch
-------

This effect creates fractals. The most classic fractal is perhaps the Von Koch snowflake. An alternative to using this _LPE_ is to use the _[L-System](#Extensions-Lindenmayer "L-System (Fractal-Lindenmayer)")_ extension.

Applying this effect to a path creates two additional _control_ paths: a _Reference segment_ and a _Generating path_. The structure of the fractal is completely determined by these _control_ paths. The first _generation_ is created by placing copies of the _skeleton_ path so that the _Reference segment_ of each copy lies on top of one of the sub-path segments of the _Generating path_. Each additional generation is created in the same way, using the _Generating path_ of each copy of the previous generation.

![VonKoch effect 1.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_VonKoch1.png)

Left: A _skeleton_ path. Center: After applying the _VonKoch_ with default parameters. Right: Showing the default _Reference segment_ (top line) and _Generating path_ (bottom two lines).

When applying the _VonKoch_ _LPE_ to a path, the _Reference segment_ is created so that it divides the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ vertically in half. The _Generating path_ is initially composed of two single-segment sub-paths, each covering one-third of the lower edge of the _bounding box_. The _Reference segment_ and the _Generating path_ can be edited just like normal paths by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png) icon in the _Reference segment_ or _Generating path_ lines of the _LPE_ dialog.

![VonKoch effect 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_VonKoch2.png)

Left: A diamond path with the _VonKoch_ LPE applied. The default _control_ paths are shown. Center: After moving the _Generating path_s. Right: After increasing the number of generations to six and changing the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_.

If each sub-path of the _Generating path_ consists of a single segment, then each copy of the _skeleton_ path is simply scaled and/or rotated. With multiple segments, one can skew each copy. The first path segment controls scaling in the orthogonal direction to the _Reference segment_ and it controls skewing. The second path segment is matched to the _Reference segment_. The use of the first segment can be disabled by checking the _Use uniform transforms only_ box.

![VonKoch effect 3.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_VonKoch3.png)

Left: A square path with the _VonKoch_ LPE applied. The default _control_ paths are shown. Center: After editing the _Generating path_ to add a second path segment to each sub-path. Right: After increasing the number of generations to two.

Like all _LPEs_, this one can also be applied to groups.

Left: A fourth generation Sierpinski triangle (triangle with three _Generating paths_). Right: The same _VonKoch_ LPE applied to a group consisting of a triangle and circle.

Here is a short tutorial to create one side of a Von Koch snowflake:

1.  Create a regular six-pointed star using the _[Star Tool]( "Regular Polygons and Stars")_ (set _Spoke ratio_ to 0.577).
2.  Convert star to a path (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****)); remove nodes as shown in figure below (use ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-delete.png) and ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-delete-segment.png) from the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_).

    Left: A regular six pointed star. Right: The _skeleton_ path after deleting nodes from the star.
    
3.  Make a duplicate of the path as we will need a copy later; move it aside.
4.  Apply the _VonKoch_ effect to the original path, this will create default _control_ paths.
5.  We need to edit both _control_ paths, it is perhaps slightly easier to start with the _Generating path_. This _control_ path, by default, consists of two separate path segments. We need four segments exactly like in the _skeleton_ path. Select the duplicate of the _skeleton_ path and use ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-break.png) on each of the middle three nodes. When you are finished, the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_ should report the path consists of eight nodes.
6.  Copy the duplicated path to the _[clipboard](#Clipboard "Clipboard:")_; select the original path and in the _[Path Effect Editor]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)")_ dialog click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-paste.png) in the _Generating path_ line. This will replace the default path. You will probably see the first-generation paths jump to the upper-right corner. Don't panic! We'll need to drag the _Generating path_ to where it belongs.
7.  Click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png) icon in the _Generating path_ line of the _LPE_ dialog. You should see the _Generating path_ as a green path. Select all the nodes and drag them to overlap the _skeleton_ path.
    
    ![VonKoch effect: star step 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/PATHS/LPE_VonKoch_Star2.png)
    
    Left: After copying the _skeleton_ path and applying the _VonKoch_ LPE. Both the _Reference segment_ and _Generating path_ are shown (the _skeleton_ path _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ has been set to gray so it is easier to see the _control_ paths). Right: The duplicate of the _skeleton_ path has been separated into four sub-paths. It was then pasted into the LPE to replace the _Generating path_. The resulting _Generating path_ has been translated as shown.
    
8.  Next we need to edit the _Reference segment_. Click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-node-editor.png) icon in the _Reference segment_ line of the _LPE_ dialog. Select both nodes and move them down to them to overlap the base of the _skeleton_ path.
9.  Finally, you can increase the number of generations. If you select four or more generations, you will have to increase the _Max complexity_ value. You can also uncheck the _Draw all generations_ box.

Inkscape has a sophisticated system for creating and manipulating text. Text strings can include **Bold** or _Italicized_ substrings and changes in font type and size. Text can be justified on the right and/or left. It can be horizontal or vertical. Individual characters can be kerned. Text can be put on a path or flowed into an arbitrarily shaped path.

![Some sample text.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TEXT/Text_Sample.png)

Some sample text.

There are three types of text objects in Inkscape. The first is _regular_ text. The second is _flowed_ text; this is a text object that includes a rectangular frame. The third is _linked-flowed_ text. This is a text object where the text is flowed into a separate arbitrary shape or path object(s). It is discussed at the end of this chapter. When a text object is selected, its type is shown in the _[Notification Region](#notification)_.

Creating Text
-------------

Text is created with the _Text Tool_. To add text to a document, select the tool by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-text.png) icon (**F8** or **t**) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Note

The _Text and Font_ dialog has an entry box for entering text on the _Text_ tab. This entry box will not be active unless some preexisting text object is selected or at least one character is entered into a new text object using the _Text Tool_. This is because a text object must be created first. Simply clicking on the screen with the _Text Tool_ does not create an object.

There are two ways to add text to an Inkscape drawing. The first is as _regular_ text. In this case, as text is typed, the _text box_ grows to accommodate the text. Line breaks must be manually added.

The second way to enter text is as a _flowed_ text object. The text is typed into a presized rectangular _text box_. Line breaks are automatically made. The _flowed_ text object includes both the box and text and is thus moved and transformed as such. For a discussion of _flowed_ text in an arbitrary shape, see the last section in this chapter.

A few things to note that apply to both entry methods:

*   If you click on an already existing text object with the _Text Tool_, the text object will be selected and the cursor will be placed between the letters closest to where you clicked. The text can then be edited.
    
*   Many of the keyboard shortcuts will not work while in the enter text mode. The **+** and **−** keys on the numeric keypad will type the corresponding characters if **Num Lock** is on; otherwise, they retain their zoom functions.
    
*   Special characters can be entered by two different methods:
    
    *   **Unicode Mode: ** In this method, special characters are entered by typing in _[Unicode](#unicode "Unicode")_ values. To toggle between normal and _Unicode_ modes use **Ctrl**+**U**. Once in Unicode mode, type in the two to four digit hexadecimal _Unicode_ value followed by the **Space** bar. Repeat to add more characters. Typing any non-hexadecimal character or **Esc** while in Unicode mode will return you to normal mode.
        
        ![A sentence with Kanji characters.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TEXT/Text_Japanese.png)
        
        A sentence with Kanji characters. The characters were entered by typing: **Ctrl**+**U** 65e5 **Space** 672c **Space** 8a9e **Space****Esc**. (You must have a Kanji font installed to see the characters.)
        
    *   **Glyphs Dialog: ** _New in v0.48._ You can use the _Glyphs_ dialog to enter special characters. Open the dialog by using the menu entry Text →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/apps/fonts.png)Glyphs.... In the dialog, you can choose in which font family and style you wish to search. Available characters will depend on the font. You can also limit the search to specific _Scripts_ or _[Unicode](#unicode "Unicode")_ _Ranges_ by using the two drop-down menus. Once you have found the character you want to add, _double_\-click on it with the **Left Mouse Button**. This will add the character to the entry box at the bottom left of the dialog. Click the _Append_ button to add the characters to a selected text object. Note that you must have already created a text object. A text object is not created until at least one character has been entered (just clicking on the canvas with the _[Text Tool]( "Chapter 9. Text")_ does not create a text object).
        
        Note that you should use either the _Script_ or _Range_ menus as they independently limit the list of characters shown. If you select “Latin” in the _Script_ menu and “Greek and Coptic” in the _Range_ no characters will be shown. The reason for having two different menus is that many scripts have characters in multiple ranges. If you want all “Latin” characters use the _Script_ menu. If you already know that the character you want is in the “Latin B” block use the _Range_ menu.

*   One problem you may encounter with saving text in _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files as text objects is that if the font is not available on the computer where the file is to be viewed, it may not be visible. To avoid this problem, you can convert the text to a path. This, though, will prevent the text from being edited as a text object (and it makes your _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ less accessible and indexable).
    
    ![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)
    
    Tip
    
    Make a duplicate of the text before you convert the text to a path. Put the copy on a separate layer and make that layer invisible. Then if you ever need to edit the text as a text object, you will have a copy available.
    
*   When a text object is selected, a small square is shown at the left of the first line's baseline. This is the _baseline anchor_, which is used for snapping and alignment.

### Entering Regular Text

To add _regular_ text, click on the document where you desire the text to start. You should see a cursor (blinking bar) indicating you are in the text enter mode and showing where the text will start. To add text, just start typing. You can enter multiline text by inserting a carriage return. The _text box_ will grow as text is entered.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

SVG and Regular Text

_Regular_ text created by Inkscape is always inside a <tspan> object that is wrapped by a <text> object. The first <tspan> in a line is marked by a private Inkscape attribute to indicate it is the start of a new line. This is how Inkscape knows how to insert new lines in the middle of a section of text and move the following lines down (_[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ includes no such mechanism). Text in _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files created not by Inkscape will be missing this attribute and may be structured differently. Inkscape may have problems editing such text.

### Entering Flowed Text

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

SVG and Flowed Text

_Flowed_ text was a draft _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ 1.2 specification that will not in the end be adopted. The text is not likely to be viewable by other renderers. In addition, some programs will not render any of a file with _flowed_ text (Squiggle, for example). You can convert the _flowed_ text to a _regular_ text object before saving to avoid this problem.

To add _flowed_ text, click-drag on the document with the _Text Tool_ to create a blue rectangle box for the text. Once the box is drawn, you can move the cursor into the box area and begin to type. Carriage returns are automatically made. Prior to v0.48, if the text fills the box, you cannot add more text with out enlarging the box. As of v0.48, you can add text but it will not be shown. Instead the rectangle will turn red to indicate that not all the text is displayed. The box can be enlarged or the proportions changed by dragging on the handle at the lower-right side with the _Text Tool_, _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_, or any of the _[shape tools]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_; however, the _text box_ will only be shown when using the _Text Tool_. Use the **Ctrl** key while dragging to constrain the change in box size to a horizontal or vertical direction. The box and text can be moved together.

Selecting Text
--------------

Editing and applying attributes to text requires positioning the cursor or selecting text. The following methods are available when using the _Text Tool_:

*   Moving text cursor:
    
    *   **Left Mouse Click**: Position cursor under pointer.
    *   **Arrows**: Move forward/backward one character, move up/down one line.
    *   **Ctrl**+**Arrows**: Move forward/backward one word, move up/down one line.
    *   **Home**: Move to start of line.
    *   **End**: Move to end of line.
    *   **Ctrl**+**Up Arrow**: Move up one paragraph.
    *   **Ctrl**+**Down Arrow**: Move down one paragraph.
    *   **Ctrl**+**Home**: Move to start of text.
    *   **Ctrl**+**End**: Move to end of text.
    *   **Page Up**: Move up one screen worth of text.
    *   **Page Down**: Move down one screen worth of text.
    
*   Selecting text:
    
    *   **Left Mouse Drag**: Select text under drag.
    *   **Double Left Mouse Click**: Select word under pointer.
    *   **Triple Left Mouse Click**: Select text line under pointer.
    *   **Shift**+**Arrows**: Move start or end of selection one character in arrow direction.
    *   **Shift**+**Ctrl**+**Left/Right Arrows**: Move start or end of selection to beginning of word in arrow direction.
    *   **Shift**+**Ctrl**+**Up/Down Arrows**: Move start or end of selection to character in line above or below current line.
    *   **Ctrl**+**A**: Select all text in current text object.

Editing Text
------------

Editing text is done with the _Text Tool_. As already mentioned, clicking on existing text will select that text object and enable editing. All the normal text editing keys function as expected: **Backspace**, **Arrows**, **Enter**, and so forth. Cut and paste also work (see above for selecting text): Cut: **Ctrl**+**X**, Copy: **Ctrl**+**C**, and Paste: **Ctrl**+**V**.

An alternative way to edit text is to use the _Text_ tab of the _Text and Font_ dialog (Text → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-text-and-font.png)Text and Font... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**T****)). Editing text in the tab may be easier, especially for long texts.

### Spell Checking

Inkscape offers on-canvas spell checking. All text is checked, regardless whether or not it is selected. To spell check a document, call up the _Check Spelling_ dialog (Text → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-spell-check.png)Check Spelling... (****Ctrl**+**Alt**+**K****)). When a suspect word is found, it will be highlighted on the canvas by a red box. If using the _[Text Tool]( "Chapter 9. Text")_, the cursor will be placed at the start of the word. And if the _Text_ tab of the _Text and Font_ dialog is open, the word will underlined with a red squiggle.

![The Check Spelling dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_CheckSpelling.png)

The _Check Spelling_ dialog.

A list of suggested corrections will appear in the _Check Spelling_ dialog. You can choose to _Accept_ (if you have highlighted the correct spelling in the _Suggestions:_ list), _Ignore once_, or _Ignore_ (all other similarly spelled words in the document). You can also add the word to a dictionary by clicking the _Add to dictionary:_ button. This will cause the spell checker to accept the word as correctly spelled permanently. You can select which language dictionary the word is added by the drop-down menu to the right.

You can select which languages to use (up to three) in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog in the _Spellcheck_ section. At the moment, on Windows, only an English dictionary is included. On Linux, one can install additional dictionaries by installing the [_Gnu Aspell_](http://aspell.net/) package with any language packs required.

If no action is taken for a period of time, the spell-checking process will time out. You can restart it by clicking the _Start_ button. Spell checking will begin with the text at the top-right and work down the canvas.

Formatting Text
---------------

_Updated for v0.48._

Text in text objects can be formatted. This section covers changing the font, style, size, justification, letter/word/line spacing, kerning, and orientation. Specifying the fill (color, pattern, etc.) of text is covered in [Chapter 10, _Attributes_]( "Chapter 10. Attributes").

There are three methods to format text. The first is to use the items in the _Text Tool_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_, the second is to use keyboard shortcuts, and the third is to use the _Text and Font_ dialog (Text → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-text-and-font.png)Text and Font... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**T****)). The _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ received a major upgrade in v0.48 of Inkscape.

![The Text Tool-Tool Controls, v0.47.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TOOL_BARS/ToolBar_Text.png)

The _[Text Tool]( "Chapter 9. Text")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_, v0.47.

The _[Text Tool]( "Chapter 9. Text")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_, v0.48.

When changing properties of text, if characters within a text object are selected, the changes apply only to those characters. Otherwise, the changes apply to all selected text objects (to select more than one text object, switch temporarily to the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_). Changes made when no text object is selected (or a new blank text object is created) change the default style. The default style can also be set with the _Set as Default_ button in the _Text and Font_ dialog.

### Font Family

The _Font Family_ can be changed via the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ or the _Font_ tab of the _Text and Font_ dialog. The two methods behave slightly different.

**Via _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_: ** The leftmost drop-down menu selects the font family. When activated, the menu shows samples of the various fonts available to Inkscape. This can be disabled in v0.48 in the _Text_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog if the rendering of the samples takes too much time when starting Inkscape (which can happen if you have a large number of fonts installed on your system). The text used for the sample can be customized by editing your `preferences.xml` file. Use **Alt**+**X** to access the menu directly. Once accessed, **Alt**+**Down arrow** will open the drop-down list, **Up arrow** and **Down arrow** move up and down the list as does using the scroll wheel, and **Enter** sets the family. Typing into the font entry box will open a list of all fonts that start with the characters typed. _New in v0.48:_ A warning icon will be displayed if the selected font is not available to Inkscape.

**_Text and Font_ dialog: ** The font family can be chosen from a list of all possible font families available to Inkscape on your system. The font is previewed with the text in the bottom of the dialog. Changes are not made to the drawing until the _Apply_ button is clicked.

### Font Size

The _Font Size_ can be changed via the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ or the _Text and Font_ dialog. In both cases, the font size (in pixels) can be selected from a drop-down menu. To select a size that is not in the menu, simply type the number in. The change takes effect upon selection or hitting **Enter** in the case of the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ and upon clicking _Apply_ in the case of the _Text and Font_ dialog.

### Font Style

_[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ directly supports **Bold** and _Italic/Oblique_ styles.\[[12](#ftn.idm140578971640384)\] You can toggle on and off these styles (if the font family supports them) by clicking the corresponding buttons in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ or with keyboard shortcuts:

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-bold.png)(**Ctrl**+**B**) Toggle **Bold** on/off.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-italic.png)(**Ctrl**+**I**) Toggle _Italics_ on/off.
    

A font may have other styles available (e.g. narrow, semi-bold). All possible styles (including Bold, and Italic/Oblique) can be selected in the _Style_ section of the _Text and Font_ dialog.

### Superscripts and Subscripts

_New in v0.48._

Superscripts and subscripts can be created by selecting text and clicking on the corresponding icons (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text_superscript.png),  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text_subscript.png)) in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. The selected text will be shifted up or down and reduced in size. Superscripts and subscripts can be removed by selecting and then clicking on the same icons. Inkscape implements superscripts and subscripts by setting the _baseline-shift_ attribute to either “super” or “sub”, and by setting the _font-size_ attribute to 65%. Inkscape will only recognize a superscript or subscript if the _baseline-shift_ attribute is set in this manner. The font size can be changed after the superscript or subscript is created. The _baseline-shift_ attribute is not supported by all browsers (e.g. Firefox 4). As a workaround, one can manually shift the text vertically.

### Line Spacing

Line spacing (the distance between text _[baselines](#baseline "baseline")_) applies to an entire text object. Note that although Inkscape uses the attribute _line-spacing_ to store the line spacing value, it is not part of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard (it is, however, part of the _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ standard). Inkscape uses the value to position lines of text. The positions are stored in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file and are used by _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ renderers to place the text.

Line spacing can be changed by the _Line spacing_ entry boxes in both the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text_line_spacing.png)) (_new in v0.48_) and in the _Text and Font_ dialog. It can also be changed by the following keyboard shortcuts (note adjustments are specified in _Screen pixels_ and thus depend on the zoom level):

*   **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**\>**: Make text object one _Screen pixel_ taller.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**<**: Make text object one _Screen pixel_ shorter.
    
*   **Shift**+**Ctrl**+**Alt**+**\>**: Make text object ten _Screen pixels_ taller.
    
*   **Shift**+**Ctrl**+**Alt**+**<**: Make text object ten _Screen pixels_ shorter.

Letter spacing can be changed via an entry box in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text_letter_spacing.png)) (_New in v0.48_) or by keyboard shortcuts. Changes apply to selected text if text is selected or the entire text block if not. Note that the keyboard shortcuts are defined in terms of _Screen pixels_ and thus depend on the zoom level. Also note that if some text already has letter spacing applied to it, the letter spacing of that text will not be changed if the text cursor is elsewhere.

*   **Alt**+**\>**: Expand line (paragraph) or selected text by one _Screen pixel_.
    
*   **Alt**+**<**: Contract line (paragraph) or selected text by one _Screen pixel_.
    
*   **Shift**+**Alt**+**\>**: Expand line (paragraph) or selected text by ten _Screen pixels_.
    
*   **Shift**+**Alt**+**<**: Contract line (paragraph) or selected text by ten _Screen pixels_.

### Kerning, Shifting, and Rotating Characters

Individual characters in a line of _regular_ (but not _flowed_) text may be shifted left or right to change their _[kerning](#kerning "kerning")_, shifted up or down, or rotated. (Both _regular_ and _flowed_ text do utilize the internal _kerning_ that is included with fonts.)

#### Kerning and Shifting

Changing the _kerning_ and shifting characters up and down are treated the same in Inkscape. If no characters are selected, all the characters following the cursor are shifted. If some characters are selected, only the selected characters are shifted. Shifts can be made through the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text_vert_kern.png),  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text_horz_kern.png)) (_New in v0.48_) or through keyboard shortcuts. Note that shifts via the _Tool Controls_ are in pixels while shifts via the keyboard are in _Screen pixels_, thus, in the latter case, the zoom level will affect the magnitude of the shift.

*   **Alt**+**Arrows Key**: Shift character(s) by one _Screen pixel_ in arrow direction.
    
*   **Shift**+**Alt**+**Arrows Key**: Shift character(s) by ten _Screen pixels_ in arrow direction.

#### Rotating

If no characters are selected, only the character following the text cursor will be rotated. If characters are selected, all the selected characters will be rotated. Rotations can be made through the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text_rotation.png)) (_New in v0.48_) or through keyboard shortcuts. Note that rotations via the _Tool Controls_ are in degrees while some via the keyboard are in _Screen pixels_, thus, in the latter case, the zoom level will affect the magnitude of the rotation.

*   **Alt**+**\[**, **Alt**+**\]**: Rotate character(s) counterclockwise, clockwise by one _Screen pixel_.
    
*   **Ctrl**+**\[**, **Ctrl**+**\]**: Rotate character(s) counterclockwise, clockwise by 90 degrees.

Text on a Path
--------------

Text can be put along an arbitrary path.

![Text on a spiral path.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TEXT/Text_Path.png)

Text on _Spiral_ paths. On the right, the path has been hidden by turning off the _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_.

To place text on a path, enter the text as a _Regular_ text or _Flowed_ text. Draw the desired path. Select both text and path, then use the Text →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text-put-on-path.png)Put on Path command. The text should now appear along the path. Note that _[Shapes]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ except for _[Rectangles]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ are described internally by Inkscape as paths and thus don't require converting to a path.

Both the text and the path can be edited in place. The text should adjust to any changes in the path. The path can be made invisible by selecting only the path, then removing the _Stroke paint_ with the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog. To select an invisible path for editing, select the text and use Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-select-original.png)Select Original (****Shift**+**D****). To remove text from a path, use Text →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text-remove-from-path.png)Remove from Path.

Parts of the text can be selected and the style, _[kerning](#kerning "kerning")_, and so forth can be adjusted as for _regular_ text. Text can also be moved independently of the path by selecting the text only and using the normal means for moving objects.

![Adjusted text.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TEXT/Text_Path_Adjusted.png)

Text can be adjusted or moved relative to the path. Left: the text has been adjusted and kerned with the **Alt**+**arrow** keys. Placing the cursor at the beginning of the text and using the **Alt**+**arrow** keys will move the starting position of the text. Right: the text has been moved independently of the path by selecting the text only and dragging it to its new position with the mouse.

Text on a path is initially placed on the “left” side of the path (referenced from the path direction) starting at the beginning of the path. One can change the direction of the text (and the side it is placed on) by reversing the direction of the path (e.g., Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-reverse.png)Reverse (****Shift**+**R****)). If the text is center justified prior to being put on a path, it will centered along the path.

![Text on a circle.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TEXT/Text_Path_Circle.png)

To place text on a circle so that it reads from left to right on both the top and bottom, two circles must be used as seen on the left. The larger circle has been flipped horizontally (Object → ![Text on a circle.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-flip-horizontal.png)Flip Horizontal (****H****)) so the text is placed inside the circle starting from the left. The smaller circle has been rotated 180 degrees. (The path of a circle when first drawn starts from the rightmost point. The circle must be rotated or flipped to move the starting point of the path to the left.) By turning the circles into half circles and setting the text to center-justified, the text will automatically be centered at the top or bottom of the circle. Note that _[kerning](#kerning "kerning")_ may be necessary as the characters of text placed on the outside of a curve will be too far apart while those on the inside of a curve will be too close together.

See the [_Generate from Path_](#GenerateFromPathText) extension for an alternative way of putting text on a path.

Text in a Shape
---------------

Text can be flowed inside any arbitrary shape by linking a text object to a shape or path. (This “Link Flowed Text” was a draft _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ 1.2 specification and will not work with _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ 1.1 viewers.)

![Text flowed into a path with the shape of an old Chinese coin.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TEXT/Text_Chinese.png)

Text flowed into a path with the shape of an old Chinese coin. The path consists of both the outer circle and inner square.

To create a linked flowed text object, select a text object and one or more shape/path objects. Then use the Text → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text-flow-into-frame.png)Flow into Frame (****Alt**+**W****) command. If multiple shape/path objects are selected, the text will flow into the _last_ object selected first.

![Text flowed into three circle objects.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TEXT/Text_Multiple.png)

Text flowed into three circles. The circles were selected from right to left so that the text would flow first in the left hand circle.

Flowed text can be edited in place, including selecting part of the text and changing the style or changing the letter and line spacings. The center circle above has had some adjustments made to the style and the letter spacing. To select all the text, use Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-select-all.png)Select All (****Ctrl**+**A****) command while a text object is selected with the _Text Tool_.

If the flowed text is selected, the Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-select-original.png)Select Original (****Shift**+**D****) command will select the first shape or path object (especially useful if the path has been made invisible). **Tab** will then rotate the selection one by one through any other shape or path objects that are part of the _linked-flowed_ text object, as well as the text itself.

Flowed text can be converted back to a _regular_ text object with the Text → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text-unflow.png)Unflow (****Shift**+**Alt**+**W****). The resulting text will be on a single line.

The Text →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/text-convert-to-regular.png)Convert to Text command converts _link-flowed_ text to a _regular_ text object while preserving the appearance of the text. The text is still editable but will no longer reflow inside the shape or path frame. This is necessary for display of the drawing in another _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ renderer.

An object has attributes such as color and line style. An attribute can apply to the _Fill_ or to the _Stroke_ of the object. The _Fill_ refers to how the area inside an object's boundary path is painted while the _Stroke_ refers to the path itself. The _Fill_ or _Stroke_ (_Stroke paint_) can be a single color, a _Gradient_ of colors, a _Pattern_, or nothing at all. With the exception of a few small differences, _Fill_ and _Stroke paint_ have the same properties and are treated together in the following discussion. A _Stroke_ can have additional attributes such as width, dash pattern, and marker type (_[Stroke style]( "Stroke Style")_). These are treated in a separate section.

Text can be given the same attributes as other objects with a few small differences: Individual letters, words, or phrases can be given different solid colors, but _Gradients_ and _Patterns_ must be assigned to an entire text object.

There are a number of ways to change attributes:

*   _Fill and Stroke_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-fill-and-stroke.png)Fill and Stroke... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**F****)): Three tabs in the dialog allow the setting of the _Fill_, _Stroke paint_, and _Stroke style_. At the very bottom of the dialog is a slider and entry box for the _Opacity_ to set the overall _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ (or _[transparency](#transparency "transparency")_) of an object.
    
*   _[Palette](#palette)_: To change _Fill_ and _Stroke paint_ colors.
    
*   _[Swatches](#Attributes-Color-Swatches "Palette and Swatches Dialog")_ dialog: To change _Fill_ and _Stroke paint_ colors (View → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-select-color.png)Swatches... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**W****)).
    
*   _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ menu (pops up when a bar in the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ is **Right Mouse Clicked**). An entry box in the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ can be used to set an object's _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_.
    
*   _[Color Gestures](#Attributes-Color-StyleIndicator-Gestures "Color Gestures")_ and _[Stroke Width Gestures](#Attributes-Stroke-Width-Gestures "Stroke Gestures")_ where one does a **Left Mouse Drag** from the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_.

Fill and Stroke Paint
---------------------

There are a number of different options for the _Fill_ and _Stroke paint_ of an object. Examples of the different options are shown below. The use of these options for the _Fill_ and the _Stroke paint_ is basically the same, so we'll use the word _fill_ to talk about both at the same time.

![Fill.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Fill.png)

Choices for the _Fill_ of an object, from left to right: No paint, Flat color, Linear gradient, Radial gradient, Pattern, Unset paint.

![Stroke paint.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Fill_Stroke.png)

Choices for the _Stroke paint_ of an object, from left to right: No paint, Flat color, Linear gradient, Radial gradient, Pattern, Unset paint. The stroke has been widened to make it easier to see the effect of the different options.

The fill type can be set using the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-fill-and-stroke.png)Fill and Stroke... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**F****) or click on ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-fill-and-stroke.png) in the _[Command Bar](#commandbar)_) under the _Fill_ and _Stroke paint_ tabs. The fill type can be one of the following choices (set by clicking an icon):

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-none.png)No paint (transparent).
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-solid.png)Flat (solid) color.

### Flat (Solid) Colors

Color can be the simplest or the most complicated aspect of a drawing depending on your needs. Color is stored internally in Inkscape as a six-digit _[hexadecimal](#hexadecimal "hexadecimal number")_ number consisting of three pairs of digits. Each pair of digits corresponds to the amount of Red, Green, Blue (_[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_). This matches the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ specification for describing color. For example, a color defined as #FF7F00 has red, blue, and green components of 100%, 50%, and 0%, respectively, of the maximum values.

In some cases, a fourth pair of digits is added to describe _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ (_[RGBA](#rgba "red-green-blue-alpha")_). The A or _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ attribute may not be familiar to many people. This attribute specifies how transparent the fill should be. It can range from 0 for complete _[transparency](#transparency "transparency")_ to 255 (_[hexadecimal](#hexadecimal "hexadecimal number")_ FF) for complete _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_. The term _opacity_ is often used in place of _Alpha_. Its value ranges from 0% (0.0) for a transparent object to 100% (1.0) for an opaque object.

In principle, this is a simple description for specifying any color. The complexity comes from assuring that the color reproduced on a display or in printing matches the color the artist envisioned. Various color “systems” have been developed to facilitate this. Inkscape supports base [ICC](http://www.color.org) profile functionality through the use of [LittleCMS](http://www.littlecms.com/). Setting up color management can be done under the _Color management_ section in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. You can declare multiple ICC profiles for a document in the _Color Management_ tab of the _Document Properties_ dialog. If everything is setup properly the “Color Managed View” can be toggled on/off via View → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/color-management.png)Color-managed View or by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/color-management.png) icon in the lower right corner of the window. This will give a better representation of what you can expect to see in the final rendering of the drawing as well as mark out-of-gamut colors. Note, profiles internal to a _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_ are not used. A complete discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this book.

The fill color of an object can be modified a variety of ways, including using the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog, the _[Palette](#palette)_, the _[Swatches](#Attributes-Color-Swatches "Palette and Swatches Dialog")_ dialog, and the _[Dropper Tool](#Attributes-Color-Dropper "Dropper Tool")_. Some of these methods can also be used to change the color of a _Gradient_ stop when a _Gradient_ handle is selected.

#### Fill and Stroke Dialog—Color

When the use of a flat (or solid) color is specified for the _Fill_ and _Stroke paint_ of an object, the corresponding tab of the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog will show five sub-tabs, each one corresponding to a different method of specifying the color plus one for color management. Each method is described next in its own section.

Except for the _Wheel_ tab, each color parameter can be set by either dragging a slider (small triangles), typing the desired value into the entry box, using the up/down arrows in the widget (**Right Mouse Click** on an arrow causes the value to change to the minimum or maximum, **Middle Mouse Click** cause the value to increment or decrement by 10), or the **Up/Down Arrow** keys after the entry box is selected. The slider bar shows the current value (triangles) and what the color will look like as that slider is dragged.

Methods for setting a color parameter.

The A or _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ attribute specifies how transparent the fill should be, 0 for completely transparent and 255 (100) for completely opaque in the case of the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_, _[HSL](#Attributes-Color-HSL "HSL")_, and _[Wheel](#Attributes-Color-Wheel "Wheel")_ (_[CMYK](#Attributes-Color-CMYK "CMYK")_) methods.

##### RGB

_[RGB](#rgb "red-green-blue")_ (Red, Green, Blue) is a method for specifying a color in terms of the three additive primary colors. This is the native method for computer screens. Range of allowed values is from 0 to 255 (0 to FF in _[hexadecimal](#hexadecimal "hexadecimal number")_).

##### HSL

_[HSL](#hsl "hue, saturation, lightness")_ (_Hue_, _Saturation_, _Lightness_) is a method for specifying color in terms of hue (color in optical spectrum), saturation (intensity-purity), and lightness. The range for saturation is from a pure color to gray. The range for lightness is from black to pure color to white. Range of allowed values is from 0 to 255 (0 to FF in _[hexadecimal](#hexadecimal "hexadecimal number")_).

##### CMYK

_[CMYK](#cmyk "Cyan Magenta Yellow Key (Black)")_ (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key \[Black\]), is a method for specifying color in terms of _subtractive_ primary colors and is commonly used in printing. Range of allowed values is from 0 to 100.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

Inkscape stores color internally in the _[RGB](#rgb "red-green-blue")_ format. This is the only color specification supported by _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_. Furthermore, the entry boxes are set up so that the value in one is always zero. (Any color in _RGB_ color space can be defined using only three of the _CMYK_ terms. The definition is not unique.) Better support for _CMYK_ is planned.

The _Wheel_ is an alternative way of changing color in the _[HSL](#hsl "hue, saturation, lightness")_ paradigm. Dragging the line around the circle changes the _Hue_. Dragging the small circle within the triangle parallel to the edge that varies from white to black changes the _Lightness_ and dragging perpendicular to that edge changes the _Saturation_.

They can also be used to set the _[Current style](#CurrentStyle "Current Style:")_. Their use is essentially identical so they will be treated together. The visibility of the _Palette_ can be toggled via a check box in the View → Show/Hide submenu.

![Swatches dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Swatches.png)

Swatches dialog. Note that clicking on the   rectangle sets the _Fill_ to _None_.

The following methods are available for both the _Palette_ and the _Swatches_ dialog:

*   **Left Mouse Click** on a swatch to change the _Fill_ of selected objects or the color of selected _Gradient_ _Stops_ to the color of the swatch. **Shift**+**Left Mouse Click** on a swatch to change the _Stroke_ of selected objects. The _Current style_ will also change (no object need be selected). Note, the _Current style_ is not displayed correctly in v0.48 if the _Auto_ palette is selected.
*   **Left Mouse Drag** from a swatch to an object's _Fill_ or _Stroke_ or to a _Gradient_ _Stop_ to change the corresponding attribute to the swatch's color. **Shift**+**Left Mouse Drag** to anywhere on an object to set the _Stroke_ color (except to a _Gradient__Stop_). The target object need not be selected. The _Current style_ will not change.
*   **Left Mouse Drag** from a swatch to the _Fill_ or _Stroke_ part of the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ to change the _Fill_ or _Stroke_ of selected objects. The _Current style_ will also change.
*   **Right Mouse Click** on a swatch to open a small dialog which allows you to assign the color to the _Fill_ or _Stroke_ of selected objects. The _Current style_ will also change. In v0.48, one can also edit or delete a _[Custom Swatch](#Attributes-CustomSwatches "Custom Swatches")_ through this dialog.

You can also drag colors to or from other applications that support _Drag and Drop_.

Inkscape has a variety of built-in palettes (some copied from Gimp). More palettes can be added by installing palette files in the directory `share/palettes`. The files use the Gimp palette file structure where colors are defined in terms of a triplet of numbers in a _[RGB](#rgb "red-green-blue")_ format. See [the section called “Custom Swatches or Palettes”](#Customize-Files-Swatches "Custom Swatches or Palettes") in [Chapter 24, _Customization_]( "Chapter 24. Customization"), for details.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Auto Palette

_New in v0.48._

An _Auto_ palette was added in v0.48. This is the default palette shown in the _Swatches_ dialog. Initially it is empty. It will automatically include _[Custom Swatches](#Attributes-CustomSwatches "Custom Swatches")_ as they are added to a document. This palette is document dependent.

Both the _Palette_ and the _Swatches_ dialog have a pull-down menu (far right, small arrow) where you can set the size and shape of the swatches, if the colors should be displayed in one row or in multiple rows, and which palette should be used. Hovering the pointer over a swatch will display a color's name in a _[tool tip](#tooltip "tool tip")_ and in the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_. A scroll bar gives access to colors in a palette that are not displayed when there are too many colors to fit.

#### Style Indicator

The _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ located on the left side of the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_ displays information on selected objects, text fragments, or _Gradient_ stops. The indicator includes a number of methods to alter style, including: pop-up menus, targets for Drag and Drop colors, and [Color Gestures](#Attributes-Color-StyleIndicator-Gestures "Color Gestures").

##### Display

The _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ has three parts showing _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_, _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_, and _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ (O), which show attributes for selected objects or text fragments. The _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ parts are referred to as the _fill indicators_.

![Style Indicator.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/StyleIndicator.png)

The _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ showing the attributes of an object with a red _Fill_, a blue _Stroke paint_, a _Stroke_ width of 10 pixels, and an _Opacity_ of 100%.

A displayed _fill attribute_ can be one of:

*   Color swatch: Shows color with (left) and without (right) _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ (_Alpha_ refers to the _Fill_ and _Stroke paint_ attributes and not the object's _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_).
    
*   N/A: Not Applicable (i.e., no object selected).
    
*   None: No fill defined.
    
*   Unset: fill is unset.
    
*   L: fill is a linear _Gradient_.
    
*   R: fill is a radial _Gradient_.
    
*   Pattern: fill is a pattern.
    
*   Different: More than one object selected with different fill.
    

When multiple objects are selected and all of the selected objects have a color fill, then one of the following letters will be shown:

*   m: Selected objects have same fill color.
    
*   a: Selected objects have different fill colors. The color displayed is an average of the colors in the selected objects.
    

For _Gradient_ handles, both parts (_[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_) show the handle color.

The _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ has a number of features that depend on the part.

*   Fill/Stroke Paint indicators:
    
    *   A **Left Mouse Click** opens the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog with the corresponding tab selected.
        
    *   A **Middle Mouse Click** on a bar removes the fill from the selected objects if a fill is defined. If no fill is defined, it sets the fill to black.
        
    *   A **Right Mouse Click** on a bar opens a pop-up menu as discussed below.
        
    *   A color from the _[Palette](#palette)_ or _[Swatches](#Attributes-Color-Swatches "Palette and Swatches Dialog")_ dialog can be dragged and dropped onto one of the _fill indicators_ to change the fill of all selected objects.
        
    
*   Stroke indicator:
    
    *   A **Left Mouse Click** opens the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog to the _Stroke style_ tab.
        
    *   A **Right Mouse Click** opens a pop-up menu that allows the stroke width unit to be changed as well as a preset width to be selected. The stroke can also be removed with this menu.
        
    
*   Opacity indicator:
    
    *   A **Right Mouse Click** on the numeric field opens up a pop-up menu with preset opacity values.
        
    *   A **Middle Mouse Click** on the "O:" label cycles through the opacity values 0%, 50%, and 100% (0.0, 0.5, and 1.0).

##### Fill Indicator Pop-up Menu

A **Right Mouse Click** on either the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ bar opens a pop-up menu with entries that act on the _Fill_ or _Stroke paint_ of the selected objects or text fragments, depending on which bar was clicked. If a _Gradient_ handle is selected, the menu entries apply to that handle.

![Style Indicator Menu.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/StyleIndicatorMenu.png)

The _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ pop-up menu.

*   Edit fill... (Edit stroke...): Opens _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog. (The dialog can also be opened directly by a **Left Mouse Click** on the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ part of the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_.)
    
*   Last set color: Applies the last _set_ color to the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of selected objects. A color is set when a color is applied to any object or when a color is selected from the _[Palette](#palette)_.
    
*   Last selected color: Applies the last _selected_ color to selected objects. The last selected color is the color of the previously selected object(s) prior to selecting the object(s) whose color is to be changed. If the color is to be applied to multiple objects, they must be selected together using a _[rubber-band](#rubberband "rubber band")_ selection. In v0.48, _[Custom Swatches](#Attributes-CustomSwatches "Custom Swatches")_ are ignored in determining last selected color.
    
*   Invert: Inverts the color of the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of selected objects. If more than one object is selected, the colors of those objects are averaged before the color is inverted. The _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ is not changed.
    
*   White: Set _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ to white.
    
*   Black: Set _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ to black.
    
*   Copy color: Copies color of selected objects to the clipboard in _[hexadecimal](#hexadecimal "hexadecimal number")_ format. If more than one object is selected, the colors of those objects are averaged.
    
*   Paste color: Pastes color to selected objects from the clipboard.
    
*   Swap fill and stroke: Exchanges _Fill_ and _Stroke paint_ colors.
    
*   Make fill (stroke) opaque: Sets _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ to full _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_. (Does not affect _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_.)
    
*   Unset fill (stroke): Unsets the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of selected objects.
    
*   Remove fill (stroke): Removes the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of selected objects.

##### Color Gestures

_Color Gestures_ is the name given to changing the color of a _Fill_, _Stroke_, or _Gradient_ _Stop_ by dragging the mouse from a fill indicator into the Inkscape window. The principle is that as you drag the mouse, the color will change proportionally to the distance from a 45  line from the indicator. The farther away you are, the more subtle the changes can be. Changes are made in the _[HSL](#Attributes-Color-HSL "HSL")_ color space.

![Gestures diagram.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Gestures.png)

_Color Gestures_: Dragging the cursor away from the _Fill_ indicator to the left or up from the dash line increases hue (blue to red) while dragging to the right or down decreases hue (blue to green). Dragging straight up or straight across results in the maximal change possible (blue to yellow).

Without any modifier key, changes are made to hue. With the **Shift** changes are made to saturation while with the **Ctrl** changes are made to lightness. Note that the letter next to the cursor will change to indicate the mode. Key modifiers can be changed while dragging. When a key modifier is changed, the “zero” line (normally at 45 ) changes to pass through the current cursor position. This is to avoid abrupt changes in color when changing modifiers. The **Alt** modifier disables changes to the color so that the cursor can be repositioned.

If more than one object or _Gradient_ _Stop_ is selected, the starting color will be the average color of the selected items and the final color will be the same. If you wish to shift the color in the same way for a number of objects but preserve the relative differences use the _[Tweak Tool]( "Chapter 11. Tweak Tool")_.

Color gestures are very useful once you get the hang of them. It is well worth spending a little time to play with them!

#### Dropper Tool

The _Fill_ and _Stroke paint_ color of an object can be changed by using the _Dropper Tool_ to grab an existing color in the drawing. Options allow for grabbing the average color over a circular region, inverting the grabbed color, and saving the grabbed color to the system _[clipboard](#Clipboard "Clipboard:")_ (as a _[RGBA](#rgba "red-green-blue-alpha")_ hexadecimal number).

To use the _Dropper Tool_, first select the object that you want to modify with a tool other than the _Dropper Tool_. Recall that you can switch temporarily to the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ by using the **Space Bar**.

Then select the _Dropper Tool_ by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/color-picker.png) icon (**F7** or **D**) in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. Finally click with the _Dropper Tool_ on the desired color. The shortcut **D** will toggle between the _Dropper Tool_ and any other tool.

The **Shift** causes the chosen color to be applied to the object's _Stroke paint_ rather than the _Fill_. The **Alt** causes the inverse color to be applied. The **Shift** and **Alt** keys can be used in combination. However, neither of the modifier keys are useful when copying a color to the _clipboard_.

*   **Left Mouse Click**: Pick _Fill_ color.
    
*   **Left Mouse Drag**: Pick average _Fill_ color (color is averaged over circle created during drag).
    
*   **Ctrl**+**C**: Copy color under cursor to system _clipboard_ in the form of an 8-digit hexadecimal number (2 digits for each of _[RGBA](#rgba "red-green-blue-alpha")_).
    

The _Dropper Tool_ _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ has two buttons that determine if the _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ (_[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_) of a color should be _Picked_ and/or _Assigned_. These settings affect the way a color is picked if the “Picked” object has an _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ different from 100% (or 1.0).

![Dropper Tool Controls.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TOOL_BARS/ToolBar_Dropper.png)

The _Dropper Tool_\-_Tool Controls_.

*   **Pick opacity disabled: ** The color picked is as shown on the screen. For example, picking the color from an object with a dark blue fill but an opacity of 50% would result in a light blue color with an opacity of 100%. Opacity of set object not changed.
    
*   **Pick opacity enabled, Assign alpha disabled: ** The color picked is the color that the object would have if its opacity was 100%. A dark blue object with an opacity of 50% would result in a dark blue color (an opacity of 100%). Opacity of set object not changed.
    
*   **Pick opacity enabled, Assign opacity enabled: ** The color and opacity are both copied from the picked object. A dark blue object with an opacity of 50% would result in a light blue color composed of a dark blue fill with an opacity of 50%. Opacity of set object changed. Note: This is only applicable if the color is picked from an object with _[transparency](#transparency "transparency")_ that is not over another object.

![Dropper tool and opacity.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Dropper.png)

### Gradients

_Gradients_ are a smooth blending from one color to another. _Gradients_ can be used to build up complex shading of an object as shown in the flower petal below. Note: Inkscape supports the _[Gaussian Blur](#Filters-GaussianBlur "Gaussian Blur")_ filter, which may be an easier way to produce complex shadings.

![Flower Petal.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Gradient_Petal.png)

A flower petal consisting of four layers. From left to right: The finished petal. The base layer. A highlight. A duplicate of the base layer with partial transparency to mask part of the highlight layer. Top shadow layer. The background is gray to show the transparency in some layers.

In Inkscape, _Gradients_ can be _linear_ or _radial_ and can consist of transitions between two or more well-defined colors referred to as _Stops_.

![Examples of gradients.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Gradient1.png)

An example of a linear (left) and a radial _Gradient_ (right), both with three defined colors or _Stops_.

Inkscape does not support nonlinear _Gradients_. Nonlinear _Gradients_ can be simulated by adding extra _Stops_.

There are three parts to using a _Gradient_; each treated in the next three sections:

1.  Attach a _Gradient_ to an object.
2.  Edit the _Stops_.
3.  Adjust the orientation and extent of the _Gradient_.

The use of _linear_ and _radial_ _Gradients_ is essentially the same and both will be treated together.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Note

If you want a _Gradient_ to transform with an object, you must toggle on this option using the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/transform-affect-gradient.png) icon that is in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ when the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ is in use.

#### Attaching Gradients to Objects

_Gradients_ can be attached to an object either with the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog or through the use of the _Gradient Tool_.

To attach a _Gradient_ with the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog, simply select an object and click on either the linear ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-gradient-linear.png) or radial _Gradient_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-gradient-radial.png) icons in the dialog. A _Gradient_ with two _Stops_ will automatically be created and applied to the object. The _Stops_ will have the color of the previous _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ with one _Stop_ having full _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ and the other full _[transparency](#transparency "transparency")_. The following figure shows the dialog after attaching a _Gradient_ this way.

![Gradient dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_FillStroke_Linear.png)

Gradient selected in _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog.

An already defined _Gradient_ can be assigned to the object by selecting the _Gradient_ from the drop-down menu under the _Fill_ tab of the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog. A _Gradient_ can also be assigned to the _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of an object under the _Stroke paint_ tab.

To attach a _Gradient_ with the _Gradient Tool_, select the tool by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/color-gradient.png) icon (**Ctrl**+**F1** or **g**) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_.

The _Gradient Tool_ _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ has options to choose a linear ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-gradient-linear.png) or a radial ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-gradient-radial.png) _Gradient_ and the application of the _Gradient_ to the _Fill_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-fill.png) or _Stroke_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-stroke.png) of an object. Once the options are selected, **Left Mouse Drag** across an object to attach a _Gradient_. The start and stop point of the drag will define the range of the _Gradient_ (where the start and end _Stops_ are placed, see below). If an already defined _Gradient_ has been chosen from the drop-down menu in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ it will be applied to the object. Otherwise a two _Stop_ _Gradient_ will automatically be created with both _Stops_ the color of the objects existing _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and with one _Stop_ full _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ and the other with full _[transparency](#transparency "transparency")_.

#### Editing Stops

_Gradients_ can be modified by adding, deleting, moving, or changing the color and _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ of _Stops_. They can be edited onscreen. This is much more convenient than using the _[Gradient Editor](#Attributes-Gradients-Define-Editor "Using the Gradient Editor Dialog")_ dialog.

##### Onscreen Editing

An object with a _Gradient_ displays _Gradient_ handles when the _Gradient Tool_, _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_, or one of the _[shape tools]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ is active (the latter two if enabled in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog). Some editing actions work when any of these tools is active, others work only with the _Gradient Tool_.

Circle, diamond, and square handles represent start, intermediate, and end _Stops_, respectively. Editing _Stops_ has many parallels to editing nodes.

![Examples of Gradients;.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Gradient3.png)

Linear and radial _Gradients_ showing the __Gradient__ handles.

_Stops_ can be selected by clicking on them with the _Gradient Tool_, the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_, or one of the _[shape tools]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_. To select more than one use **Shift**+**Left Mouse Click**. With the _Gradient Tool_ you can use a _[rubber-band](#rubberband "rubber band")_ selection by using **Shift**+**Left Mouse Drag** or you can select all the _Stops_ by using **Ctrl**+**A**.

To add a new intermediate _Stop_, with the object selected and the _Gradient Tool_ active:

*   Double-click on the _Gradient_ path. A new _Stop_ will be added where you clicked. The _Stop_ will take the existing color under the path.
*   **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**Left Mouse Click** on the _Gradient_. A new _Stop_ will be added where you clicked. The _Stop_ will take the existing color under the cursor.
*   Select two adjacent _Stops_ and press **Insert**. A new _Stop_ will be added halfway between the selected _Stops_ and with a color halfway in-between.
*   Drag a color from the _[Palette](#palette)_ or the _[Swatches](#Attributes-Color-Swatches "Palette and Swatches Dialog")_ dialog unto the _Gradient_ path. A new _Stop_ will be created with the dragged color at the point of the drop (drop too far from the path and the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ will be changed to solid with the dragged color). This also works if the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ or one of the _[shape tools]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ is active.

To remove an intermediate _Stop_, with the _Gradient Tool_ active:

*   Click on it using **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**Left Mouse Click**. This also works if the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ or any of the _[shape tools]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ are active.
*   Use the **Del** to remove selected _[Stops](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_. If there is at least one intermediate _Stop_, then deleting the start or end _Stops_ will shorten the _Gradient_ with the nearest intermediate _Stop_ becoming a start or end _Stop_. If there is no intermediate _Stop_, then deleting a start or end _Stop_ will replace the _Gradient_ with a solid _Fill_ of the color of the remaining _Stop_.
*   Using **Ctrl**+**L** will attempt to simplify the _Gradient_ over the a region defined by selected _Stops_ by adjusting and removing some _Stops_. This is particularly useful for removing redundant _Stops_.

To move an intermediate _Stop_:

*   Drag it with the _Gradient Tool_, _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_, or one of the _[shape tools]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_. If more than one _Stop_ is selected, they will all move together. Dragging with the **Ctrl** snaps the _Stops_ at points that are multiples of 1/10th of the distance between the nearest neighboring unselected _Stops_. Dragging with the **Alt** moves selected _Stops_ according to how far away they are from the dragged _Stop_.
*   With one or more _Stops_ selected and the _Gradient Tool_ active, use the **Arrow** keys. If multiple intermediate _Stops_ are selected, they will move together. Using the **Shift** with the **Arrow** keys accelerates the shift by a factor of 10. Using the **Alt** moves the selected _Stops_ one screen pixel at a time. Using **Shift**+**Alt** moves the _Stops_ 10 screen pixels at a time.

Note: You cannot move a _Stop_ past an adjacent _Stop_.

There are several ways to see and change the style (color and/or _[transparency](#transparency "transparency")_) of one or more _Stops_. In general, if no _Stop_ is selected, indicators and changes apply to the whole object; if one _Stop_ is selected, indicators and changes apply to that _Stop_; and if multiple _Stops_ are selected, indicators show an average value for the selected _Stops_ and changes apply to all selected _Stops_.

*   The _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog: If no _Stop_ is selected, the _Gradient_ is previewed at the top under the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ tab. Otherwise the current color and _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ values for selected _Stops_ are shown. Changes apply to all selected _Stops_.
    
*   The _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_: If no _Stop_ is selected the indicators show previews of the _Gradients_ (_[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_). Otherwise the current values for selected _Stops_ are shown. Changes apply to all selected _Stops_. See [the section called “Style Indicator”](#Attributes-Color-StyleIndicator "Style Indicator"), earlier in this chapter for more details.
    
*   Drag-and-Drop: Colors can be dragged from either the _[Palette](#palette)_ or from the _[Swatches](#Attributes-Color-Swatches "Palette and Swatches Dialog")_ dialog onto _Stops_ (or onto the _Gradient_ path to add a new _Stop_).
    
*   Copy-and-Paste: Colors can be copied to and from the _clipboard_. Copying to the _clipboard_ (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/actions/gtk-copy.png)Copy (****Ctrl**+**C****)) will copy a _Stop_ color and _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ if one _Stop_ is selected or the average color if more than one is selected. Pasting the style (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-paste-style.png)Paste Style (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**V****)) copies from the _clipboard_ the color and _opacity_ to all selected _Stops_.

There is a dedicated _Gradient Editor_ dialog for editing _Gradients_. It is envisioned that this dialog be removed as redundant in the future. To call up the dialog, click on the _Edit..._ button, either in the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog or the _[Gradient Tool](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. Note that which _Gradient_ is being edited does not change automatically when you select an object with a different _Gradient_.

![Gradient Editor dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Gradient_Editor.png)

_Gradient Editor_ dialog showing first default _Stop_.

In this dialog, the _Gradient_ is shown at the very top. Next down is the current _[Stop](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_. You can see that the _Stop_ shown above is a solid blue, fully opaque with _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ = 255. You can also see from the _Offset_ slider that the _Stop_ shown is set all the way to the left (and as the _Stop_ is at one limit of the _Gradient_, its position can't be moved). The color and transparency of this _Stop_ can be changed in the _Stop Color_ section. The tabs work the same as those described in the _[Flat Colors](#Attributes-Color "Flat (Solid) Colors")_ section above. The _[Dropper Tool](#Attributes-Color-Dropper "Dropper Tool")_ can also be used to change one of the end _Gradient_ colors by first selecting the corresponding _Gradient_ handle. (To modify a non-end _Gradient_ color, copy the color to the _[clipboard](#Clipboard "Clipboard:")_ by using **Ctrl**+**C** with the desired color selected with the _Dropper Tool_ and then paste into the _Gradient Editor_ _[RGBA](#rgba "red-green-blue-alpha")_ entry box.)

To edit another _Stop_, select that _Stop_ in the pull-down menu. In the default case described above, the second _Stop_ has the same color as the first but is fully transparent (e.g., _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ = 0). This is shown in the current _[Stop](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ section by the divided box. The left half shows the color with _Alpha_ and the right half without _Alpha_. Note also that the _Offset_ slider is fully to the right.

![Gradient Editor dialog: Second Stop.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Gradient_Editor2.png)

_Gradient Editor_ dialog showing second default _Stop_.

To add a _Stop_, click on the _Add stop_ button. The new _Stop_ will be added to the right of whichever _Stop_ was selected, unless that _Stop_ was the farthest to the right, in which case the new _Stop_ will be added to the left. The position, color, and transparency for the new _Stop_ will be set to halfway between its neighbors.

The following figures show a third _Stop_ added to a _Gradient_ after its color and position have been adjusted.

![Gradient Editor dialog: Added stop.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Gradient_Editor3.png)

_Gradient Editor_ dialog showing added third _Stop_. Note that the new _Stop_ has an offset of 0.25, that is the center of the _Stop_ will be one quarter of the _Gradient_ width from the left.

![Examples of gradients.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Gradient2.png)

An example of a _Gradient_, before and after adding a third _Stop_.

To delete a _Stop_, select the _Stop_, then click on the _Delete stop_ button. As at least two _Stops_ are required to define a _Gradient_, you cannot delete a _Stop_ via the dialog if only two are defined.

#### Adjusting Gradients

Once a _Gradient_ has been applied to an object, the orientation and extent of the _Gradient_ can be changed via dragging the outer two _Gradient_ _Stops_ indicated by the square and circle handles. The handles appear when the _Gradient Tool_ is selected. They will also appear by default when many of the other tools are selected (controlled by the _Enable _Gradient_ editing_ option in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog under each tool tab). For linear _Gradients_, one set of handles define the range of the _Gradient_. The _Gradient_ is parallel to the line connecting the two handles. For radial _Gradients_, there are two sets of handles (or _Stops_) at right angles to each other, sharing the square center handle. The center, handle controls the origin of the _Gradient_ (one “edge”), while the two circular handles control the range of the _Gradient_ in orthogonal directions. This allows a radial _Gradient_ to have an elliptical shape.

![Examples of Gradients.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Gradient4.png)

Linear and radial _Gradients_ showing the _Gradient_ handles after adjusting the orientation and range of the _Gradient_.

A radial _Gradient_ can be made asymmetric by dragging the center handle (diamond) while holding down the **Shift** key. A cross will appear where the center of the _Gradient_ is located. The cross can be dragged to make further adjustments.

![Examples of Gradients.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Gradient7.png)

A radial _Gradient_ with a symmetric fill (left) and an asymmetric fill (right).

_Gradient_ handles from two different objects will snap together if one is placed over the other. This facilitates aligning _Gradients_ between different objects. The handles will then move together. If multiple objects are selected when a _Gradient_ is created, all the objects will share a common _Gradient_.

![Examples of Gradients.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Gradient8.png)

The eight objects share a common _Gradient_.

An option only accessible through the _Gradient_ tabs of the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog is defining how the area outside the _Gradient_ range is filled. The three options are: fill with the solid color of the edge _Stops_ (None), fill with a reflection of the same _Gradient_ (Reflect), and fill with a translation of the same _Gradient_ (Direct). The effect of these three options is shown next.

![Examples of gradients.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Gradient5.png)

An example of a linear _Gradients_ with different repeat options. From left to right: None, Reflected, and Direct.

![Examples of Gradients.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Gradient6.png)

An example of a radial _Gradient_ with different repeat options. From left to right: None, Reflected, and Direct.

The keyboard shortcut **Shift**+**R** reverses the _Gradient_ direction when the _Gradient Tool_ is active. This is especially useful for radial _Gradients_ where one cannot just drag the _Gradient_ handles to reverse the _Gradient_.

### Patterns

Any object or set of objects can be turned into a _Pattern_ and used in the fill of an object. The _Pattern_ can be shifted, rotated, and stretched as necessary. Inkscape includes a set of _Patterns_ accessible through the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog. The _[Vine Design]( "A Vine Design—A Tiling Example")_ tutorial covers creating and using _Patterns_.

![Pattern examples.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Pattern0.png)

A few of the _Patterns_ included in Inkscape.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

Check the licenses of the bitmap patterns included with Inkscape to see if they are compatible with your artwork. They are not public domain! (Look inside the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file or use the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ to look in the “defs” section.)

The _Patterns_ included with Inkscape are defined in the file `patterns/patterns.svg` located in the Inkscape “share” directory. Edit or replace this file to include your own stock _Patterns_.

To use a _Pattern_, two or three steps are necessary. The first, optional step, is to create a _Pattern_. The second is to apply the newly created _Pattern_ or an Inkscape provided _Pattern_ to an object. And the third is to adjust the _Pattern_ position and scaling as necessary.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

#### Creating Patterns

_Patterns_ are very easy to create. Simply select the object or objects you wish to use as a _Pattern_ and then use the Object → Pattern → Objects to Pattern (****Alt**+**I****) command.

After converting the selection to a _Pattern_, the original selection is replaced by a _[Rectangle]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ shape object filled with the new _Pattern_ (and with an invisible stroke). This new object can be deleted but the _Pattern_ will remain. _Patterns_ have a life of their own.

The “tile” size of the _Pattern_ is the total _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of the objects in the _Pattern_. If space is required around the objects, a non-visible rectangle object can be added or the _Pattern_ size can be edited with the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog.

The object(s) in any _Pattern_ can be edited by selecting an object that is filled with that _Pattern_ and then using the Object → Pattern → Pattern to Objects (****Shift**+**Alt**+**I****) command. The original objects will reappear in their original place (built-in _Patterns_ will appear in the upper-left corner). After editing, the objects can be again turned into a _Pattern_. Both the old and new _Patterns_ are available for use. Other objects filled with the original _Pattern_ remain unchanged. The new _Pattern_ must be “reapplied” to the object the _Pattern_ came from.

#### Using Patterns

To change the fill of an object to a _Pattern_, simply click on the _Pattern_ icon (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-pattern.png)) in the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog. Then select the required _Pattern_ from the pull-down menu. User created _Patterns_ will be listed first.

Unfortunately, there is no preview of the _Patterns_ (as with the _Gradient_ tab).

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Note

If you want a _Pattern_ to transform with an object, you must toggle on this option using the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/transform-affect-pattern.png) icon that is in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ when the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ is in use.

#### Adjusting Patterns

Adjusting _Patterns_ is done by a set of handles. The handles will appear when an object with a _Pattern_ fill is selected and the node or one of the shape tools is active. The handles will appear on the original objects that defined the _Pattern_, or the former location of those objects if they have been moved or deleted (unless the _Pattern_ has been previously adjusted). In the case of built-on _Patterns_ they will appear in the upper-left corner of the canvas. The following figure shows the location of the handles for a _Pattern_ that has not been adjusted.

![Pattern example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Pattern1.png)

A _Pattern_ (right) with an object filled with that _Pattern_ (left). The translation handle is a " " overlaying a _Rectangle_ shape handle. The size handle is a square and the rotation handle a circle.

To adjust the origin, scale, and orientation of the _Pattern_, drag the translation handle ( ), scale handle (square), and rotation handle (circle). The translation handle can conveniently be dragged over the object with the _Pattern_ fill. Holding the **Ctrl** key down while dragging will restrict the movement to the horizontal or vertical direction. The scale is governed by the distance between the translation handle and scale handle, the orientation by the relative position of the rotation handle with the translation handle. The _x_ and _y_ directions can be scaled independently. Hold the **Ctrl** down to force the scaling to be uniform. Handles can be snapped.

The following figure shows how the fill changed after the handles have been adjusted.

Tip

For _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ viewers that don't support clipping, you can crop a bitmap by turning the bitmap into a _Pattern_ and using it to fill an arbitrary path.

#### Hatchings

Inkscape now includes many _Patterns_ that can be used as hatchings. If you need to create a new hatching, here is the general procedure. The simplest hatching is to group two rectangular boxes, one with black fill and one with no fill as shown below.

![Creating hatching.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Pattern3.png)

The hatching _Pattern_ on the left (surrounded by the dotted line) has been used for the star's _Fill_. The _Pattern_ consists of two rectangles in a _Group_.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

Inkscape has problems properly displaying _Patterns_ at the _Pattern_ boundaries. Inkscape export to a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ also has problems. To work around this problem, you can make the _Pattern_ rectangles wider than the maximum width needed to fill an object. Firefox, Opera, and Batik will display patterns without artifacts. Batik can be used for producing a high-quality _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_.

### Custom Swatches

_New in v0.48._

_Custom Swatches_ allow per document palettes with swatches of solid colors and _[Gradients](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_. _Custom Swatches_ are automatically added to a special _Auto_ palette as they are created (selectable in the _[Palette](#palette)_ or _[Swatches](#Attributes-Color-Swatches "Palette and Swatches Dialog")_ dialog). Solid color swatches are implemented as one-stop _[Gradients](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_.

To create a _Custom Swatch_, with an object selected that has the desired solid fill or _Gradient_, click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-swatch.png) icon in the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog (in the _Fill_ or _Stroke paint_ tab as appropriate). After creation, the color or _Gradient_ of a swatch can be edited using the _Swatch fill_ section of the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog or by using the _Gradient Editor_ dialog that is accessed by selecting _Edit..._ in the menu that pops up when you **Right Click** on a swatch in the _[Palette](#palette)_ or _[Swatches](#Attributes-Color-Swatches "Palette and Swatches Dialog")_ dialog (when the _Auto_ palette is displayed). Any change to a swatch affects the fill of all objects that reference that swatch.

![Swatch fill dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_FillStroke_Swatch.png)

_Swatch_ section of _Fill and Stroke_ dialog.

To assign a _Custom Swatch_ to the fill of an object, either select the desired swatch from the menu in the _Swatch fill_ section of the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog (if a swatch is already assigned to the fill) or click on the desired swatch in the _[Palette](#palette)_ or _[Swatches](#Attributes-Color-Swatches "Palette and Swatches Dialog")_ dialog (if the _Auto_ palette is selected).

To delete a swatch, select _Delete_ from the menu that pops up when you **Right Click** on the swatch in the _[Palette](#palette)_ or _[Swatches](#Attributes-Color-Swatches "Palette and Swatches Dialog")_ dialog (the _Auto_ palette must be selected). Note that using File →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/document-cleanup.png)Vacuum Defs will not remove unused swatches.

### Fill Rule

The _Fill Rule_ dictates what areas are filled when a path overlaps itself or one part of a complex path surrounds another part. The rule applies only to the _Fill_ of an object (and not the _Stroke paint_). One can choose the _Fill Rule_ from the two choices:

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/fill-rule-even-odd.png)Even-odd.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/fill-rule-nonzero.png)Non-zero.
    

The difference between these rules is demonstrated in the following figures.

![Fill rule even/odd versus non-zero.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Fill_Rule1.png)

Fill rule: Even-odd vs. Non-zero.

**Even-odd rule. ** In this rule, you start outside the path with the number zero. Every time you cross the object's path, you add one to the number. If the current number is odd, the region is inside the path and therefore colored. If the current number is even, the region is outside the path and is not colored.

![Fill rule even/odd.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Fill_Rule1a.png)

Fill rule: a demonstration of counting. Even regions are _outside_ the path, odd regions are _inside_.

**Non-zero rule. ** In this rule, you start outside the path with the number zero. Every time you cross the object's path with the path going to the left, you add one to the number. If the path is going to the right, you subtract one. If the number is non-zero, the region is inside the path; if it is zero, the region is outside the path.

![Non-zero, direction of path.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Fill_Rule2.png)

Non-zero fill rule applied to a path consisting of two sub-paths. Zero regions are _outside_ the path; non-zero regions are _inside_ the path. The arrows on the paths show the paths' direction.

Stroke Style
------------

In addition to _Stroke paint_, discussed in the previous section, _Stroke_ attributes include stroke _Width_, _Join_ style, _Cap_ style, _Dashes_, and _Markers_. All of these attributes can be set using the _Stroke style_ tab in the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog. Stroke width can also be set using the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ (see below). The last part of this section is a discussion on how to make complex strokes.

### Stroke Width

_Stroke_ width can be changed by using the _Stroke style_ tab in the _Fill and Stroke_ dialog, or by using the _Style Indicator_ via a pop-up menu or by _Stroke_ gestures.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

If you want the line width to transform with an object, you must toggle on this option using the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/transform-affect-stroke.png) icon that is in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ when the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ is in use.

**_Stroke style_ tab. ** Stroke width can be changed by using the _Width_ entry box on the _Stroke style_ tab of the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog. The units are specified by the drop-down menu on the right.

**_Style Indicator_. ** A **Right Mouse Click** on the _Stroke_ width part of the _[Style Indicator](#styleindicator)_ opens a pop-up menu that allows the stroke width unit to be changed as well as a preset width to be selected. The stroke can also be removed with this menu.

**_Stroke_ Gestures. ** _Stroke Gestures_ is the name give to changing the _Stroke_ width by dragging the mouse from the _Stroke_ width section of the _Stroke style_ indicator into the Inkscape window. The principle is that as you drag the mouse, the line width will change proportionally to the distance from a 45  line from the indicator. The farther away you are, the more subtle the changes can be. The maximum width increase is a factor of 4 and the minimum width is zero. See _[Color Gestures](#Attributes-Color-StyleIndicator-Gestures "Color Gestures")_ for more details.

### Join Style

The _Join_ style is how two lines meeting at a corner should be joined together. The options are:

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/stroke-join-miter.png)Miter join.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/stroke-join-round.png)Round join.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/stroke-join-bevel.png)Bevel join.
    

The different _Join_ styles are shown in the figure following.

![Join styles.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Join1.png)

_Join_ styles: Miter (left), Round (center), Bevel (right). Note how the node is at the center of curvature for the Round style.

When the _Miter_ option is selected, the length of the projection can become quite long if the two lines intersect at a small angle. In this case, it may be preferable to use the _Bevel_ style. The _Miter limit_ controls the point at which a _Miter_ join automatically is converted to a _Bevel_ join. If the distance from the inner intersection point to the tip of the triangle ("m" in the following figure) measured in stroke widths is more than the _Miter limit_, the join will be drawn in the _Bevel_ style.

![Miter limit.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Join2.png)

On the left is a Miter join. If the distance "m" as measured in stroke widths is more than the Miter limit, the corner will be drawn with a Bevel join as shown on the right. (The nodes are shown as diamonds.)

### Markers

_Markers_ are objects like arrow heads placed along a path. Different _Markers_ can be specified for the start, middle, and end of a path. Middle _Markers_ are placed at the location of every non-end node.

![Markers.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Markers.png)

Examples of _Markers_. From the top down: _Start arrow_ at the start of a line. _Start arrow_ at the end of a line. _Start arrow_ in the middle of a line (a node has been added). Scissors at middle nodes. Scissors at middle nodes, path reversed.

A custom _Marker_ can be created by selecting the object or objects that you wish to use as a _Marker_ and then using the Object → Object to Marker command. The selected objects will disappear and a new entry will appear in the _Marker_ pull-down menus of the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog. The _Marker_ is created assuming a horizontal orientation for the path. The point of attachment to a node is the center of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ for the _Marker_. Warning: While the marker will display fine in Inkscape, only a fourth of it will be displayed in most other _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ renderers. Adding the attribute _style="overflow:visible"_ to the _Marker_ definition will fix the problem (Bug). Note, that custom _Markers_ can be added to Inkscape; see [the section called “Custom Markers”](#Customize-Files-Markers "Custom Markers") in [Chapter 24, _Customization_]( "Chapter 24. Customization").

![Custom Markers.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Markers_Custom.png)

Examples of custom _Markers_. The objects on the left were converted to _Markers_ by first duplicating and then using the Object → Object to Marker command. They were then applied to the paths on the right.

Note: The Object → Object to Marker procedure is a bit buggy. The new _Marker_ may not show up in the list until another _Marker_ is applied to the path. If multiple objects are converted, the _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_ is reversed. _[Group]_ the objects first to avoid this problem.

Two problems exist with _Markers_. The first is that _Markers_ do not take the color of the stroke. This can be worked around by using the _[Color Markers to Match Stroke](#Extensions-ColorMarkers "Color Markers to Match Stroke")_ extension, by editing the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file with the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_, or adding a custom, pre-colored _Marker_. An alternative solution is to convert the path with the _Markers_ to a path (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****)). This creates a _[Group]_ with the _Markers_ converted to separate objects, which can be colored independently.

The second problem is that _Markers_ scale with line width. The line width had to be reduced in the above figure for the scissors examples, to give the scissors a reasonable size. Again, one could edit the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file to adjust the _Marker_ size.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Tip

To place middle _Markers_ evenly along a path you need to have evenly spaced nodes. For straight horizontal and vertical lines, nodes can be distributed evenly using the _[Align and Distribute](#Paths-Node-Align "Editing Nodes with the Align and Distribute Dialog")_ dialog. To add just one node halfway between two existing nodes click on the _[Insert](#Paths-Node-ToolControls "Using the Node Tool-Tool Controls")_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-add.png) icon in the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. To add one node anywhere on an existing path, double-click on the path where you want the node (or single click while holding down the **Ctrl**+**Alt** keys). To add multiple nodes evenly spaced between existing nodes, use the _[Add Nodes](#Extensions-AddNodes "Add Nodes")_ extension.

Another thing to note is that _Markers_ are included in the _Visual_ _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ calculation.

### Complex Strokes

A complex _Stroke_ can be created by overlaying two or more paths with different _Stroke_ attributes. The easiest way to make exact copies of a path is to use the Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-duplicate.png)Duplicate (****Ctrl**+**D****) command.

If one uses _[Clones]_ of a path (Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-clone.png)Create Clone (****Alt**+**D****)), then one can adjust the original path at a later time and all the _[Clones]_ will change too. This requires unsetting the _Stroke_ attributes of the original path (use the _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ editor to unset the _Stroke_ width). Since the original path's attributes are unset, it will not be visible and cannot be used as part of the visible _Stroke_.

![Complex Strokes.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ATTRIBUTES/Attributes_Complex.png)

Examples of complex _Strokes_. From top to bottom: Road: consists of a 5 pixel-wide red path over a 10 pixel-wide black path. Divided road: consists of a 2 pixel-wide dashed black path over an 8 pixel-wide red path, over a 12 pixel-wide black path. Railroad tracks: consists of a 7 pixel-wide dashed path, with dash pattern (1.75, 1.75) over a 2 pixel-wide solid path. Border: consists of an 8 pixel-wide dashed path, with dash pattern (2, 8) and an offset of 7 pixels (use _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ editor to set) over a 2 pixel-wide dashed path with dash pattern (8, 2).

Chapter 11. Tweak Tool
----------------------

**Table of Contents**

*   [Tweaking Objects]
*   [Tweaking Paths]
*   [Tweaking Colors]

The _Tweak Tool_ is used to make small changes to objects, paths, and colors. While at first objects, paths, and colors may seem to have little to do with each other, the use of _Tweak Tool_ to edit them is surprisingly very similar.

To use the _Tweak Tool_ select the tool from the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-tweak.png)) or use either of the shortcuts: **W** or **Shift**+**F2**.

The _Tweak Tool_ works like a _brush_ that covers a circular part of the screen, indicated by an orange circle. The affect of the brush is strongest in the center and falls off smoothly till the edge. Two parameters, located in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ affect the “physical” nature of the brush:

*   **_Width_: ** Determines the size of the brush. The range is from 1 to 100, where 20 corresponds to a radius of 100 screen pixels. As the brush width is defined in screen pixels, zoom can be used to quickly change the size of the brush relative to the size of an object. The **Left Arrow** and **Right Arrow** keys can be used to decrease and increase the width at anytime. **Home** sets the _Width_ to 1, while **End** sets it to 100.
    
*   **_Force_: ** Determines how strongly a movement of the brush affects the objects on the screen. The range is from 1 to 100. If the “Use Pressure” button (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/draw-use-pressure.png)) is toggled on, a pressure-sensitive tablet can be used to control the force; maximum pressure corresponds to the _Force_ parameter setting. See the _[Calligraphy Tool](#Paths-Calligraphy "The Calligraphy Tool")_ section for use of a tablet. The **Up Arrow** and **Down Arrow** keys can be used to decrease and increase the (maximum) _Force_.
    

The _Tweak Tool_ has a number of modes for editing objects, paths and colors. The mode is selected by clicking on the corresponding icon in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ or using a keyboard shortcut. Many of the modes have their own cursor. The various modes are discussed in the next three sections.

Objects must be selected to be tweaked. Using the **Space Bar** is a quick way to switch back and forth between the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ and the _Tweak Tool_. Note that there is no onscreen indication of what objects are selected when the _Tweak Tool_ is in use. If no objects are selected, a message to that effect will be displayed in the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_.

![Tweak - Example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TWEAK/Tweak_Example.png)

An example of using the _Tweak Tool_ on a series of _[Rectangles]( "Rectangles and Squares")_. The brush size is indicated by the orange circle and the _Mode_ by the cursor (in this case _Push_).

Tweaking Objects
----------------

A number of _Tweak Tool_ modes modify objects. A typical use would be to create an array of cloned objects using the _[Create Tiled Clones]( "Chapter 19. Tiling")_ dialog and then use the _Tweak Tool_ to move them around.

The following object modes are available:

*   **Move. ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-tweak-push.png) (**Shift**+**M**) Moves objects in direction of drag.
    
*   **Move In/Out. ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-tweak-attract.png) (**Shift**+**I**) Pulls the objects toward the cursor. With the **Shift** held down, pushes the objects away from the cursor.
    
*   **Move Jitter. ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-tweak-randomize.png) (**Shift**+**Z**) Moves the objects in random directions by random amounts.
    
*   **Scale. ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-tweak-shrink.png) (**Shift**+**<** or **Shift**+**\>**) Shrinks the objects near the cursor. With the **Shift** held down, enlarges the objects near the cursor.
    
*   **Rotate. ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-tweak-rotate.png) (**Shift**+**\[** or **Shift**+**\]**) Rotates clockwise the objects near the cursor. With the **Shift** held down, rotates counterclockwise the objects near the cursor.
    
*   **Duplicate (Delete). ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-tweak-duplicate.png) (**Shift**+**D**), Randomly duplicates the objects near the cursor. Duplicates are placed directly over the original so you may not see immediately the effect. Switching temporarily to the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ via the **Space** will update the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_ with the new number of selected objects (newly created objects are automatically added to the selection or _[Group]_). With the **Shift** held down, randomly deletes objects.
    
*   **Blur. ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-tweak-blur.png) (**Shift**+**B**), Blurs objects near cursor. With the **Shift** held down, reduces blurring.

========================================================

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

Tweaking Paths
--------------

A variety of _Tweak Tool_ modes modify paths. If an object is not a path (i.e., _[Rectangles]( "Rectangles and Squares")_, _[Ellipses]( "Ellipses, Circles, and Arcs")_, text) it is first converted to a path. Unlike the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_, nodes do not need to be selected.

All path modes share the _Fidelity_ parameter. The range for the parameter is from 1 to 100. A low value gives a rough distortion using few nodes, a high value gives a smoother distortion but at the cost of creating large numbers of nodes. Note that any path distortion will affect the entire path, even the parts that are far away from the cursor.

The tool has several known problems. If used on an open path, the path will become closed. It doesn't work well on straight lines or lines with just two nodes.

The following path modes are available:

*   **Push. ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-tweak-push.png) (**Shift**+**P**) Default. Displaces path in direction of drag.
    
*   **Shrink (Grow). ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-tweak-shrink.png) (**Shift**+**S**) Insets path near cursor while dragging. With the **Shift** held down, outsets the path near the cursor while dragging. In v0.46 these are separate modes.
    
*   **Attract (Repel). ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-tweak-attract.png) (**Shift**+**A**) Displaces path inward toward cursor while dragging. With the **Shift** held down, displaces path outward from cursor while dragging. In v0.46 these are separate modes.
    
*   **Roughen. ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-tweak-roughen.png) (**Shift**+**R**) Roughens path near dragged cursor.
    

![Paint Tweak - Text Example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TWEAK/Tweak_PathText.png)

The _Tweak Tool_ was applied with a different mode to each of the text objects. In each case the cursor was moved from top to bottom. The mode is indicated by the text. The original text is outlined in red.

A few short cuts exist: **Ctrl** switches temporarily to _Shrink_ mode. **Ctrl**+**Shift** switches temporarily to _Grow_ mode.

The _Tweak Tool_ is very useful for manipulating hatchings.

![Paint Tweak - Sphere.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TWEAK/Tweak_Sphere.png)

The hatching was created by using the _[Interpolate](#Extensions-Interpolate "Interpolate")_ extension twice to create two quasi-orthogonal sets of lines that were then clipped by a circle. When created, each set of lines belonged to one compound path. The compound paths were broken apart (Path → ![Paint Tweak - Sphere.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-break-apart.png)Break Apart (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**K****)) and then the strokes converted to paths (Path → ![Paint Tweak - Sphere.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/stroke-to-path.png)Stroke to Path (****Ctrl**+**Alt**+**C****)). Finally, the _Tweak Tool_ was used in _Shrink_ mode to narrow the width of the lines to create a 3D-shading effect.

Tweaking Colors
---------------

The _Tweak Tool_ can be used to make small color changes to objects. In doing so, it changes the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and/or _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color of an entire object. While it can be used to change the color of _[Gradient](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ stop, it cannot create _Gradients_ nor can it modify part of an object leaving the rest alone. This is due to the fundamental nature of vector objects. It can, however, be used to adjust the color of a group of objects, with the objects closer to the cursor changing the most.

Two modes with several options exist for tweaking colors.

*   **Paint. ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-tweak-paint.png) (**Shift**+**C**) Paint with current _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ style. When the tool is selected, changing the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ or _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ by using the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog or the _[Palette](#palette)_ will change only the _[Current style](#CurrentStyle "Current Style:")_ and not any objects. If either _Fill_ or _Stroke_ are not set, the _Fill_ or _Stroke_ of tweaked objects will remain unchanged. _New in v0.47_: Holding the **Shift** will invert the color applied.
    
*   **Jitter. ** ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-tweak-jitter-color.png) (**Shift**+**J**) Randomize colors. The _Current style_ is not used.
    

![Tweak - Color.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TWEAK/Tweak_Color.png)

The _Tweak Tool_ was used to modify a grid of gray squares. Left: In _Paint_ mode the tool was used to paint diagonal red and blue lines. Right: In _Jitter_ mode the tool was used to add a random color to the squares.

The _Tweak Tool_ in a color mode has four options. It can act independently on a color's hue, saturation, lightness (_[HSL](#Attributes-Color-HSL "HSL")_) and _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_. The options can be toggled on independently by the H, S, L, and O icons next to the _Channel_ label in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.

Chapter 12. Spray Tool
----------------------

_New in v0.48._

The _Spray Tool_ is used to distribute copies of an object (or objects) much like an airbrush would paint drops. Three modes are available in the _Spray Tool_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_:

*   **_Copy mode_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/spray-copy-mode.png)): ** The distributed copies are separate objects that are independent of each other. Attributes of one object can be changed independent of other objects. This mode is especially useful for creating objects to manipulate with the the _[Tweak Tool]( "Chapter 11. Tweak Tool")_.
    
*   **_Clone mode_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/spray-clone-mode.png)): ** The distributed copies are clones of the original object. Changing the attributes of the original object changes the attributes of all copies. The _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color of the original object was changed from yellow to blue after spraying the stars. This mode is moderately less demanding on renderers than the _Copy_ mode.
    
*   **_Single Path mode_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/spray-union-mode.png)): ** The distributed copies are part of the same _[Path]( "Chapter 7. Paths")_. Overlaps of objects are removed. This mode is more CPU intensive during spraying. The source object may need to be converted to a path first.
    

![Spray Mode Example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SPRAY/Spray_Mode.png)

Examples of the three spray modes. From top to bottom: _Copy_ mode: The style of each copy can be changed individually as was done here using the _Color Jitter_ mode of the _[Tweak Tool]( "Chapter 11. Tweak Tool")_. _Clone_ mode: All clones must have the same style. If the original object is changed, all the clones are changed in the same way. _Path_ mode: The copies are merged into one path with overlaps removed.

To use the _Spray Tool_ first select one or more objects you which to spray with the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ or any other selection method. Then select the _Spray Tool_ from the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/tool-spray.png)) or use either of the shortcuts: **A** or **Shift**+**F3**. Hold the **Left Mouse Button** down while moving the mouse or the mouse scroll wheel. Once the _Spray Tool_ has been selected, you can toggle between the _Spray Tool_ and the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ using the **Space Bar**.

A number of parameters are available in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ to modify the behavior of the _Spray Tool_:

*   **_Width_: ** Determines the area of the spray (indicated by the orange circle when the _Spray Tool_ is selected). The range is from 1 to 100, where 20 corresponds to a radius of 100 screen pixels. As the spray width is defined in screen pixels, zoom can be used to quickly change the size of the spray relative to the size of the drawing. The **Left Arrow** and **Right Arrow** keys can be used to decrease and increase the width at anytime. **Home** sets the _Width_ to 1, while **End** sets it to 100.
    
*   **_Amount_: ** Determines how the relative number objects sprayed. The range is from 1 to 100. If the “Use Pressure” button (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/draw-use-pressure.png)) is toggled on, a pressure-sensitive tablet can be used to control the rate objects are sprayed; maximum pressure corresponds to the _Amount_ parameter setting. See the _[Calligraphy Tool](#Paths-Calligraphy "The Calligraphy Tool")_ section for use of a tablet. The **Up Arrow** and **Down Arrow** keys can be used to decrease and increase the (maximum) _Amount_.
    
*   **_Rotation_: ** Adds a random rotation to each copy if non-zero. The setting determines the maximum rotation amount. The range is from 1 to 100 where 100 corresponds to plus or minus 180 .
    
*   **_Scale_: ** Adds a random scale to each copy if non-zero. The setting determines the maximum scaling amount. The range is from 0 to 100 where 100 corresponds to twice the original size.
    
*   **_Scatter_: ** Determines how the items are scattered. The range is from 1 to 100 where 1 corresponds to all the objects being sprayed under the cursor and 100 corresponds an even distribution over the spray region.
    
*   **_Focus_: ** Determines the spread of the scattered items. The range is 0 to 100 where 0 corresponds to all the items being sprayed under the cursor while 100 corresponds to items being sprayed at the edge of the spray area.
    

![Spray Parameters Example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/SPRAY/Spray_Parameters.png)

Examples of several of the spray parameters. From top to bottom: _Scale_: Parameter set to 0 on left, 100 on right. _Scatter_: Parameter set to 1 on left, 100 on right. _Focus_: Parameter set to 0 on left, 100 on right (_Scatter_ set to 5, cursor jiggled in place).

Eraser Cut-Out Mode
-------------------

In the _Cut-Out_ mode, the eraser is used to draw a red path, similar to a path created by the _[Calligraphy Tool](#Paths-Calligraphy "The Calligraphy Tool")_. This path is then subtracted from any other paths it crosses. Regular _[Shapes]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_ crossed are first converted to paths. This mode does not work on _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_ images or directly on _[Groups]_ (enter _Groups_ first to use). If many objects are crossed, it may take awhile for the subtraction to be processed.

To enable _Cut-Out_ mode, click on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-difference.png) icon in the _[Eraser Tool]( "Chapter 13. Eraser Tool")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.

Use with Tablets

If you are using a tablet with input devices enabled (set to _Screen_ mode), the input devices will be pressure sensitive. There is no option to turn off this sensitivity as with the _[Calligraphy Tool](#Paths-Calligraphy "The Calligraphy Tool")_. You may find it is better to use the _Calligraphy Tool_ in _subtract_ mode (hold down the **Alt** key) as there is better control over the pen's parameters.

Inspired by the need for cartoonists to color their drawings, the _[Paint Bucket Tool]( "Chapter 14. Paint Bucket Tool")_ flood fills a region with a color. True to an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ drawing program, the new object is defined by vectors and thus is fully scalable. The region to be filled, however, is defined by the pixels on the screen at the time of the fill. This is best explained by the examples in the sections that follow.

Simple Use
----------

The simplest use is to fill an area defined by two different objects. Select the _Paint Bucket Tool_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/color-fill.png), **Shift**+**F7**) from the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_ and then click in the overlapping region. A new object is created with the current _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color.

![Paint Bucket - Simple Use.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/BUCKET/Bucket_SimpleUse.png)

Left: Before _Paint Bucket_ fill. Right: After clicking on the overlapping region with the _Paint Bucket Tool_ (with the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color set to red).

The cursor position when clicking determines the starting point of the fill region. The filling algorithm recursively adds neighboring areas to the region until pixels are found that don't meet the criteria determined by the parameters in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.

The _Threshold_ parameter controls how close a color must match the color (or _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_) under the cursor. Lower thresholds will match a smaller range.

![Paint Bucket - Threshold.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/BUCKET/Bucket_Threshold.png)

The gray areas have been filled by clicking on the centers of the rectangles with the _[Paint Bucket Tool]( "Chapter 14. Paint Bucket Tool")_. From left to right, the _Threshold_ parameter was set to 5, 10, 20, and 40.

The _Fill by_ parameter controls what color value is used to determine the the color matching. Choices are: _Visible Colors_ (default), _Red_, _Blue_, _Green_, _Hue_, _Saturation_, _Lightness_, and _Alpha_.

![Paint Bucket - Channels.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/BUCKET/Bucket_Channels.png)

The circles were first filled with a blue to green gradient. The gray areas were created with the _Paint Bucket Tool_ by clicking on the centers of the circles. In both cases, the _Threshold_ parameter was set to 10. The _Fill by_ parameter was set to _Visible Colors_ on the left and _Red_ on the right. With a value of _Red_ the blue and green of the circle are ignored in the color matching, thus the bucket fill area reaches the circle's edge where there is a large change in the red level.

Holding the **Ctrl** down while clicking on an object with the _[Paint Bucket Tool]( "Chapter 14. Paint Bucket Tool")_ will set the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ to the current style without preforming any filling.

Filling Fidelity
----------------

The filling process works first by determining which pixels should be filled and then tracing those pixels to produce a vectorized path. The tracing process has limited precision which can result in inaccuracies in the filled region. You can improve the filling accuracy several ways. The first way is to zoom in on the region you are filling. Zooming in increases the number of screen pixels in the filled region which results in a more accurate tracing.

![Paint Bucket - Zoom.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/BUCKET/Bucket_Zoom.png)

The moon man was given a gray fill using the _Paint Bucket Tool_, while the zoom level was 25% on the left and 200% on the right.

The second way to improve the filling accuracy is to expand the fill region slightly in a process akin to “trapping” that printers use to account for small misalignments in their printing plates. This works especially well for cartoons where the fills can be put on a separate _[Layer]_ beneath a _Layer_ containing the black lines. The amount of expansion is controlled by the _Grow/shrink by_ parameter. As the name suggests, one can both expand and reduce the fill area.

![Paint Bucket - Trap.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/BUCKET/Bucket_Trap.png)

The moon man was given a gray fill using the _Paint Bucket Tool_, while the zoom level was 200%. On the left, no “trapping” was used. On the right the _Grow/shrink by_ parameter was set to 1 pixel. The fill was then moved behind the line drawing. On both sides, the region around the eye has been expanded by a factor of four.

Filling Multiple Regions
------------------------

Click-dragging the _[Paint Bucket Tool]( "Chapter 14. Paint Bucket Tool")_ while holding the **Alt** key down across several noncontiguous regions will cause all the regions to be filled. (Not holding the **Alt** down will cause the borders to also be filled.)

![Paint Bucket - Touch Fill.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/BUCKET/Bucket_Touch.png)

The _[Paint Bucket Tool]( "Chapter 14. Paint Bucket Tool")_ was click-dragged with the **Alt** key down across the object on the left as shown by the red line. This resulted in the figure on the right.

Closing Gaps
------------

Small gaps in borders can be “filled” by setting the _Close gaps_ to a value other than _None_. This prevents fills from leaking into undesired areas just because there is a small break in a line (as might happen in tracing a cartoon). Note that the gaps are defined in terms of screen pixels so different zoom levels will give different results. Also note, calculating the fill when there are gaps can take some time.

![Paint Bucket - Fill Gap.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/BUCKET/Bucket_Gap.png)

The _[Paint Bucket Tool]( "Chapter 14. Paint Bucket Tool")_ was applied to the leftmost region in the three figures. The square areas are separated from this region by dashed lines with gaps of 1, 2, and 4 pixels from top to bottom. The _Close gaps_ parameter was set, from left to right, to _Small_, _Medium_, _Large_. The filling was done at a zoom of 100%.

Adding to a Fill
----------------

Since the _[Paint Bucket Tool]( "Chapter 14. Paint Bucket Tool")_ uses pixels to calculate the area to be enclosed, Inkscape will clip the region off-screen to prevent the number of pixels that go into the filling algorithm from becoming too large. If this happens you can either zoom out to do the fill or you can do the fill in pieces. By holding the **Shift** down while clicking you can add to an existing fill. Unfortunately, this can lead to rendering artifacts between adjacent pieces even though they are part of the same path. Two solutions: (1) Set the _Grow/shrink by_ parameter to 0.10. This will ensure a slight overlap during the filling process. The overlap is removed in the unioning step. (2) Use the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ to adjust the nodes to overlap areas and then use the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-union.png)Union (****Ctrl**+**+****) command to remove the overlap.

The _[Paint Bucket Tool]( "Chapter 14. Paint Bucket Tool")_ was applied to the left moon under high zoom. The part visible onscreen is shown by the dotted rectangle. Note the missing fill at the top and bottom. On the right, the missing sections have been added by scrolling in turn so that each missing section was visible onscreen and then with the first filled section selected, **Shift**\-clicking on the missing area.

Chapter 15. Clipping and Masking
--------------------------------

**Table of Contents**

*   [Clipping]
*   [Masking]

Clipping and masking are methods for restricting what part of an object (or _[Group]_ of objects) is visible. For clipping, a _clipping path_ defines the visible part of the object, while for masking, the _[transparency](#transparency "transparency")_ or _[lightness](#hsl "hue, saturation, lightness")_ of one object determines the opacity of a second object. In both cases, the target object is not changed and can be unclipped or unmasked if needed.

![Example of clipping and masking.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/CLIP/ClipMask.png)

Simple examples of clipping (top) and masking (bottom). The left column shows the text that serves as the clipping path and the text for masking, both overlaying blue rectangles that are the targets of the clipping and masking. In the right column are the results of the clipping and masking.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Tip

A clipped or masked object can be edited (transformed, style changed, nodes edited, etc.) while clipped or masked. Objects within a clipped or masked _[Group]_ can also be moved relative to the clipping path or masking object if the _Group_ is entered.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Tip

The clipping or masking path can be edited without unclipping or unmasking. With the clipped or masked object selected and the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ active, click on either the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-clip-edit.png) (clipping) or ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-mask-edit.png) (masking) icons in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_. _New in v0.48:_ The clip or mask path and the object can be edited at the same time. (This only works if the mask path is an actual path and not a shape.)

![Example of clip and mask editing.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/CLIP/ClipMask_Edit.png)

Demonstrating the editing of a clip path (left) and a mask path (right).

_New in v0.48:_ By default, Inkscape will clip or mask each object separately if several objects are selected. In the _Clippaths and masks_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog you can change this to have Inkscape first group the objects before applying a single clip or mask.

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

Clipping
--------

Any path, regular shape, or regular text object can be used as a clipping path.

To clip an object (or _[Group]_), select both the object and the clipping path. The clipping path must be above the object to be clipped in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_. Then use the Object → Clip → Set command. To unclip a clipped object, select the object and use the Object → Clip → Release command. The clipping path is then restored as a regular object, placed just above the formerly clipped object in _z-order_.

More than one object (or _[Group]_) can be clipped at the same time. Just follow the above instructions but include all the objects to be clipped in the selection (with the clipping path on top). Inkscape will store one copy of the clipping path in the _[<defs>]_ section of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file for each clipped object; thus, the clipped objects can be edited separately.

When a clipped object is selected, the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_ will display the type of object clipped along with the word “clipped.” The _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of the clipped object is defined by the intersection of the _bounding box_ of the unclipped object with the _bounding box_ of the clipping path. (However, if an object inside a clipped _[Group]_ is selected, the unclipped _bounding box_ of that object will be displayed.)

Masking
-------

Any object can be used to mask another object. The opacity and lightness of the mask determines the opacity of the masked objects. A masked object will be fully opaque only at places that are: inside the mask path, where the mask has maximum lightness (i.e., white), and the mask has maximum _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_. So to summarize:

*   Regions with minimum lightness (i.e., black) will be fully transparent.
    
*   Regions with minimum _Alpha_ (zero alpha) will be fully transparent.
    
*   Regions outside the mask will be fully transparent.
    

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

Masking has a few problems in v0.47 and v0.48. First, masks should use _luminosity_ values; instead they use a linear combination of red, green, and blue values. Second, the mask value should be calculated in [linear RGB](#linearrgb "Linear Red Green Blue Color Space") color space; instead it is calculated in [sRGB](#srgb "Standard Red Green Blue Color Space") color space. Third, export via Cairo to PDF and PostScript is broken for regions outside the nominal mask area. The first and third problems are fixed in v0.48.1.

To mask an object (or _[Group]_), select both the object to be masked and the object to be used as a mask. The mask must be above the object to be masked in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_. Then use the Object → Mask → Set command. To unmask a masked object, select the object and use the Object → Mask → Release command. The mask is then restored as a regular object and is placed just above the formerly masked object in _z-order_.

More than one object (or _[Group]_) can be masked at the same time. Just follow the above instructions but include all the objects to be masked in the selection (with the mask on top). Inkscape will store one copy of the mask in the _[<defs>]_ section of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file for each masked object; thus, the masked objects can be edited separately.

When a masked object is selected, the _[Status Bar](#statusbar)_ will display the type of object clipped along with the word “masked.” The _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of the masked object is the same as that of the unmasked object.

[_Filter Effects_](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/filters.html) (_Filters_) are a feature of _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ that allow an _SVG_ viewer to change the presentation of an object in a well-defined manner such as adding texture to a _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_, giving an object a blurred shadow, or modifying the object's color. Inkscape supports almost all _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ _Filter_ primitives (see next chapter) and includes many _Preset_ (predefined) filters.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Browser Filter Support

Support of _Filters_ is rather new in many web browsers. Don't be surprised to find bugs. Internet Explorer 9 will still not support filters. For work-arounds, see [the section called “Supporting Older Browsers”](#Web-Use-Old "Supporting Older Browsers").

This chapter covers _Preset_ filters, that is those _Filters_ that are preconstructed for your use. The following chapter covers _Custom_ filters where you build the filters yourself.

Use of Preset Filters
---------------------

Inkscape includes a couple of hundred _Preset_ filters. These filters are accessed from the _Filters_ menu. To use a built-in filter, just select the object(s) you wish to apply it to then select the _Filter_ from one of the sub-menus. A few of the built-in _Filters_ have dialogs where you can adjust basic parameters.

With so many _Preset_ _Filters_, finding the correct one isn't easy. It is best just to look through the following examples. Note that most filters fall into one of two categories: those that work with normal objects and those that work with bitmaps. Pay attention to the _[Notification Region](#notification)_ for hints on what the filter is suppose to do.

If you have developed your own _Filters_, you can add them as _Presets_ by _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files with the _Filters_ defined to the `filters` directory (Linux `~/.config/inkscape/filters`). By default, the filters will be added to a _Personal_ submenu. You can have more control over where the filters are placed if you define the following attributes:

*   `inkscape:label`: Command label.
    
*   `inkscape:menu`: Submenu name
    
*   `inkscape:label`: Tool tip (for _[Notification Region](#notification)_).
    

Inkscape includes an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file with samples of all the _Preset_ _Filters_. The file, `filters.svg`, is located in the `examples` directory that can be found in the _File_ _[Open]( "Opening and Saving Files")_ dialog. Be prepared to wait as the file requires processing hundreds of _Filters_.

Basic Use
---------

_Filters_ can be defined and applied through the _[Filter Effects]( "Chapter 17. Filter Effects—Custom")_ dialog. The _[Gaussian Blur](#Filters-GaussianBlur "Gaussian Blur")_ filter can also be used directly through the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog. The _[Blend](#Filters-Blend "Blend")_ filter can also be applied to an entire _[Layer]_ through the _[Layers]_ dialog.

The _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog has a _Blur_ slider that when moved from zero, creates and attaches a _[Gaussian Blur](#Filters-GaussianBlur "Gaussian Blur")_ filter to selected objects. If the slider is reset to zero, the filter is automatically removed and deleted. The same principle works on the _[Layers]_ dialog where a choosing anything but _Normal_ creates a _[Blend](#Filters-Blend "Blend")_ filter and attaches it to the _Layer_. Setting the drop-down menu back to _Normal_ deletes the filter. Filters can also be removed from an object by using the menu entry Filters → Remove Filters.

The _Filter Effects_ dialog (Filters → Filter Editor...) is used to build complex _Filters_ out of _Filter_ primitives. An example of a complex _Filter_ is the “Drop-Shadow” filter. The dialog is also used to apply _Filters_ to objects.

The source of the graphic used as an input for a _Filter_ primitive is either the output of another _Filter_ primitive or one of the following sources:

*   Source Graphic. Use the object as the source for the _Filter_ primitive.
*   Source Alpha. Use the _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ of the object as the source for the _Filter_ primitive.
*   Background Image. Use the region under the _Filter_ at the time the _Filter_ is invoked.
*   Background Alpha. Use the _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ of the region under the _Filter_ at the time the _Filter_ is invoked.
*   Fill Paint: _Not implemented._ Use the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of the target object as the input to a _Filter_ primitive as if the object had an infinite extent. Useful if the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ is a _[Gradient](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ or _[Pattern](#Attributes-Patterns "Patterns")_ with transparent or semitransparent regions.
*   Stroke Paint: _Not implemented._ Use the _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of the target object as the input to a _Filter_ primitive (see Fill Paint above).

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Need to add “enable-background” tag!

Whenever an input to a _Filter_ is specified to be _Background Image_ or _Background Alpha_, the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file must include the “enableBackground” tag to tell the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ renderer it must keep a copy of the background around. Inkscape does not add this tag for you except in the case of using the _[Layer]_ dialog to add a blend. A work-around is to use the _[Layer]_ dialog to temporarily add and then remove a _[Blend](#Filters-Blend "Blend")_ filter; this will leave the necessary tag in place.

A filter effect is applied to a region defined relative to the object to which it is attached. By default, the _Filter Effects Region_ ranges from −0.1 to 1.1 in units of the object's _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ width and height. This area may not always be sufficient. For example, if a large shift is prescribed in the _[Offset](#Filters-Offset "Offset")_ filter, the area must be increased. The area can be adjusted under the _Filter General Settings_ tab of the _Filter Effects_ dialog. (It can also be set through the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog, attributes _x_, _y_, _width_, and _height_.)

![Filter Effects Region.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Effect_Region.png)

The default _Filter Effects Region_ is shown for the red circle.

The _Filter Effects Region_ can be defined in terms of the object's _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ or by units in the current user coordinate system by setting the “filterUnits” parameter to “objectBoundingBox” or “userSpaceOnUse”. Inkscape currently supports only the use of the first in the _[GUI](#gui "Graphics User Interface")_.

Color Space For Filters

Inkscape uses the [_sRGB_](#srgb "Standard Red Green Blue Color Space") color space with filters. The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard specifies that by default, the [_linearRGB_](#linearrgb "Linear Red Green Blue Color Space") color space should be used. This is a known problem with Inkscape. If you wish your drawings to look the same in other _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ renderers, you need to manually add the attribute `color-interpolation-filters="sRGB"` to the <filter> tag. (This is already done for the _prebuilt_ filters.)

### Defining a Filter

A filter is defined by selecting filter primitives from the drop-down list next to the _Add Effect_ button. A short description of the filter is displayed when a filter is selected. The description can be toggled on or off under the _Filters_ tab of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog.

Once a primitive is selected, click on the _Add Effect_ button to add it to the filter. The input(s) of the filters are automatically attached to the _Source Graphic_ or the output of a previously added filter primitive. The default connections are shown as gray lines originating from a triangle right of the filter primitive name. Explicitly defined connections are shown in black.

The inputs of a filter can be reassigned by click-dragging from the triangle at the right of the filter name to one of the columns on the right (e.g., _Source Graphic_), or by click-dragging to another of the filter primitives.

The filter primitives can be reordered by click-dragging a filter primitive in the list to another place in the list.

Mini Tutorial—A Drop Shadow
---------------------------

Drop shadows are a perfect use for filters. The shadow automatically updates when the source object changes. Here is a step-by-step tutorial on creating a drop shadow:

![Drop Shadow.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_DropShadow4.png)

A drop shadow created using only filters.

**Procedure 17.1. Drop Shadow**

We will construct a compound filter that creates a drop shadow when applied to a text object.

1.  **Add Text**
    
    Create a text object. In the example, I've used the text “Drop Shadow”. Give the text a color. I've used dark red.
    
2.  **Add Gaussian Blur**
    
    Select the text. Use the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog to add a _[Gaussian Blur](#Filters-GaussianBlur "Gaussian Blur")_ by dragging the _Blur_ slider to a non-zero value. Doing so automatically creates a _Gaussian Blur_ filter and attaches it to the text.
    
    The blurred text has the attributes of the original text, in this case, the dark red color. As the blurred text will become the shadow, we'll change the color to black in a moment.
    
    We used the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog to rapidly create a filter object for the text. Further work will need to be done with the _Filter Effects_ dialog. Open the dialog. Select the new filter (with a name like “filter3362”) by clicking on it. You should see something like:
    
    ![Filter Effects dialog: Drop Shadow.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Dialog_FilterEffects_DropShadow1.png)
    
    _Filter Effects_ dialog after adding _Gaussian Blur_ filter.
    
    Let's first give our filter a new name: “MyDropShadow”. Clicking on the filter name when selected allows editing the name.
    
    Our filter consists at the moment of a single _Gaussian Blur_, as shown under the _Effect_ column. The line connecting a triangle to the right of “Gaussian Blur” label to a square dot in the _Source Graphics_ column shows that the input for the _Gaussian Blur_ filter is the original source object (in this case the text). The default height of the dialog is too short to show the complete column labels. The dialog can be stretched so that the labels are completely visible.
    
    To get a black shadow, we'll use _Source Alpha_ for the input to the _[Gaussian Blur](#Filters-GaussianBlur "Gaussian Blur")_ primitive. To make the link, left-drag the mouse from the triangle next to the _Gaussian Blur_ label to the _Source Alpha_ column. The _Filter Effects_ dialog should look like:
    
    ![Filter Effects dialog: Drop Shadow.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Dialog_FilterEffects_DropShadow2.png)
    
    _Filter Effects_ dialog after changing the input of the _Gaussian Blur_ filter to _Source Alpha_.
    
    The amount of blurring can be changed by using the _Standard Deviation_ sliders at the bottom of _Filter Effects_ dialog (when the _[Gaussian Blur](#Filters-GaussianBlur "Gaussian Blur")_ primitive is selected). There are two sliders: the top for _x_ and the bottom for _y_. By default, the sliders are linked together so the blur is the same in both directions. Note that the blur amount (_Standard Deviations_) is defined in terms of pixels in this dialog, while it is defined in terms of a percentage of 1/8 of the perimeter of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ in the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog.
    
3.  **Add Offset**
    
    The shadow should be shifted relative to the text. This can be achieved through the use of the _[Offset](#Filters-Offset "Offset")_ primitive. To add the primitive, select it from the drop-down menu next to the _Add Effect:_ button and then click on the button to make the addition. Note the bent line connecting the triangle to the right of the “Offset” entry under the _Effect_ column to the “Gaussian Blur” entry above. This (the default) indicates that the _[Offset](#Filters-Offset "Offset")_ primitive is using the output of the _[Gaussian Blur](#Filters-GaussianBlur "Gaussian Blur")_ primitive as its input. The amount of the offset can be changed by the _Delta X_ and _Delta Y_ sliders at the bottom of the _Filter Effects_ dialog when the _Offset_ label is highlighted. Set the offsets both to 3 (pixels). You should see the shadow text shift as the sliders are dragged.

    _Filter Effects_ dialog after adding the _[Offset](#Filters-Offset "Offset")_ primitive.
    
4.  **Add Merge**
    
    Now that we have the shadow, we need to add back in the original text. This can be done with the _[Merge](#Filters-Merge "Merge")_ primitive that merges graphics from multiple inputs. Select the _Merge_ primitive in the drop-down menu list of _Filter_ primitives. Click on the _Add Effect:_ button to add the primitive.
    
    When first created, there are no inputs defined. Left-drag the mouse from the triangle at the right of the “Merge” label to the “Offset” label above, to create a link from the output of the _[Offset](#Filters-Offset "Offset")_ primitive to the input of the _Merge_ primitive.
    
    When an input link to a _Merge_ primitive is made, a new, empty input node (triangle) is created. To add back in the original text, unmodified, left-drag the mouse from the empty triangle to the “Source Graphic” column.
    
    ![Filter Effects dialog: Drop Shadow.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Dialog_FilterEffects_DropShadow4.png)
    
    The completed drop-shadow filter.
    
    The drop shadow is now complete. You can modify the amount of blur or the amount of offset by selecting the appropriate _Filter_ primitive under the _Effects:_ column and using the sliders at the bottom of the _Filter Effects_ dialog.

### Color Matrix

The _Color Matrix_ primitive maps each _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ and _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ value to a new value. The transformation is described by a 5   5 matrix with the bottom row fixed, thus a general transformation is described by a 5   4 matrix. The fifth column adds a value that is independent of _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ or _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_, allowing for nonlinear color correction.

![Matrix formula.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_ColorMatrix_Formula.png)

Four types of transformations are defined, of which three are special classes of the first.

*   Matrix: The full 5   4 matrix is defined. This is the most general case.
*   Saturate: The saturation is reduced by specifying one number, _s_. The range of _s_ is 0.0 (completely desaturated) to 1.0 (unchanged). Only the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ values are changed. The exact formula is:
    
    *   R' = (0.213 + 0.787_s_)R + 0.715   (1 − _s_)G + 0.072   (1 − _s_)B;
    *   G' = 0.213   (1 − _s_)R + (0.715 + 0.285_s_)G + 0.072   (1 − _s_)B;
    *   B' = 0.213   (1 − _s_)R + 0.715   (1 − _s_)G + (0.072 + 0.928_s_)B.
    
*   Hue Rotate: The hue is shifted by specifying one number. Like the _Saturate_ case, only _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ values are changed. The exact formula is quite complicated. It is not just a red to yellow to green and so on rotation.
*   Luminance to Alpha: The luminance is converted to _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ via a fixed formula: _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ = 0.2125   R + 0.7154   G + 0.0721   B (from ITU-R Recommendation BT709, the HDTV color standard).

![Color Matrix Primitive.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_ColorMatrix.png)

Examples of using the _[Color Matrix](#Filters-ColorMatrix "Color Matrix")_ primitive. From top to bottom: Source object. _Matrix_ mode set to swap red and blue. _Saturate_ mode with input of 0.5. _Hue Rotate_ mode with input of 90 . _Luminance to Alpha_ mode.

A “negative” can be made by setting the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ diagonal matrix elements (_a_00, _a_11, _a_22) to −1.00 and the top three elements of the fifth column (_a_04, _a_14, _a_24) to 1.00.

### Component Transfer

_Partially implemented, No user interface._

The _Component Transfer_ primitive changes the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ and _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ of an object by applying independent functions to each of the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ and _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ input values. The following modes for defining the functions are available: Identity, Table, Discrete, Linear, and Gamma.

Compositing Filter Primitives
-----------------------------

These primitives composite two or more graphics. The graphics may be from an object, a background, or the output of another primitive.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Need to add “enable-background” tag!

Inkscape has a problem in using one of these filters. When using either _Background Image_ or _Background Alpha_ as an input to the filter, the “enabled-background” tag must be added to the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file (this tells _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ renderers to keep a copy of the background in memory). This is not done. A work-around is to use the _[Layers]_ dialog to add a _[Blend](#Filters-Blend "Blend")_ filter to a _[Layer]_. The _[Layer]_ blend can then be removed, leaving the necessary tag in place.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Double counting background

The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ 1.1 specification has a problem when an object is composited with a background that is not fully opaque. The background is included twice (once with the composited image and once as a background). There are three ways to deal with this problem. The first is to avoid using a _Background Image_ or _Background Alpha_ as a filter input. The second is to replace a transparent background with a solid background (you can use the _[Dropper Tool](#Attributes-Color-Dropper "Dropper Tool")_ to replace a transparent _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ with an equivalent solid _Fill_ \[turn off “Pick alpha” in the _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_\]). The third is to use the _[Flood](#Filters-Flood "Flood")_ filter to create a solid white background and include this as the first input to a _[Merge](#Filters-Merge "Merge")_ filter (if using a _[Merge](#Filters-Merge "Merge")_ filter, include the flood first; if using a _[Blend](#Filters-Blend "Blend")_ or _[Composite](#Filters-Composite "Composite")_ filter, add a _[Merge](#Filters-Merge "Merge")_ filter with the first input being the output from the _[Flood](#Filters-Flood "Flood")_ filter and the second input being the output from the _[Blend](#Filters-Blend "Blend")_ or _[Composite](#Filters-Composite "Composite")_ filter). This solution runs into trouble when it is desired that the overall image have transparency. The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ 1.2 standard corrects this deficiency.

![Transparent backgrounds.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Background.png)

The circle (red) is combined with the background using the _[Merge](#Filters-Merge "Merge")_ filter. The background color is black with a transparency of 50%. On the left, the area within the filter region is too dark, a result of the background being added in twice. On the right, the filter region was first filled with white using the _[Flood](#Filters-Flood "Flood")_ filter. For this to work with Batik and many other _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ renderers, the attribute _color-interpolation-filters="sRGB"_ must be added to the <filter> tag.

### Blend

The _Blend_ primitive blends two overlapping objects or an object with its background by doing a pixel-by-pixel combination using one of five defined blend modes. The five modes are listed below. Except for the _Normal_ mode, the result is independent of which object is on top.

For each mode, the mathematical definition is given. In the definitions, _a_ corresponds to an object on top of _b_; _c_ is the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ color of the object (premultiplied by the _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_); while _q_ is the _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_. Both _c_ and _q_ range from 0 to 1. Each of the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ colors is combined independently.

*   Normal: Top object in front of bottom object as if filter not present. (In fact Inkscape removes the _[Blend](#Filters-Blend "Blend")_ filter primitive when “Normal” is selected for a blend added to a _[Layer]_ with the _[Layers]_ dialog.) _cr = (1 − qa)   cb + ca_.
*   Multiply: Top object filters light from bottom object or background. (Like looking through a transparency with color of top object at bottom object.) Examples: Blue object over red object yields black since the blue object filters out all the red light. Cyan object over purple object yields blue since the cyan filters out the red but allows the blue to pass. _cr = (1 − qa)   cb + (1 − qb)   ca + ca   cb_.
*   Screen: Top object adds light to bottom object. (As if both top and bottom objects are projected independently onto a screen.) Examples: Blue object over red object yields purple. Cyan object over purple object yields white since cyan contains green and blue and purple contains red and blue. Thus red, green, and blue are present in equal amounts. (Why doesn't the result contain more blue? Because both cyan and purple already contain the maximum amount of blue.) _cr = cb + ca − ca   cb_.
*   Darken: Top object darkens bottom object. _cr = Minimum ( (1 − qa)   cb + ca, (1 − qb)   ca + cb )_.
*   Lighten: Top object lightens bottom object. _cr = Maximum ( (1 − qa)   cb + ca, (1 − qb)   ca + cb )_.

![Blend.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Blend2.png)

Top: The blue and red squares contain linear _[Gradients](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ that range from full _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ to full _[transparency](#transparency "transparency")_ over a white or black background. Bottom: Blue squares overlaying red squares with different _Blend modes_.

![Blend.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Blend.png)

Three circles on top of each other. The same _[Blend](#Filters-Blend "Blend")_ has been applied individually to each circle in a set. Note that the circles are on either a white or black background with maximum _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_.

![Blend.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Blend3.png)

An illustration of the difference between the _Screen_ (left) and _Lighten_ (right) _Blend modes_. Each circle has a red value of 128 (50%) and an _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_ of 128 (50%). If the _opacity_ was set to 255 (100%), the two figures would be identical.

The _Blend_ filter primitive can also be applied to a _[Layer]_ through the _[Layers]_ dialog. In this case, input one is the selected object while input two is set to the _Background Image_.

### Composite

The _Composite_ filter primitive allows two overlapping objects or an object and background to be merged pixel-by-pixel according to a mode-dependent rule. See the introduction to this section for problems when using a background as one of the inputs.

The possible modes are:

*   Over: The upper object is placed over the lower object. This is equivalent to the normal way overlapping objects are drawn.
*   In: The bottom object determines which part of the top object is visible.
*   Out: The bottom object determines which part of the top object is hidden.
*   Atop: The bottom object determines what part of the top object is visible. The bottom object is also visible.
*   XOR: The non-overlapping regions of the top and bottom objects are visible.
*   Arithmetic: The inputs _K1_, _K2_, _K3_, and _K4_ are used in the equation: result = _K1   i1   i2_ + _K2   i1_ + _K3   i2_ + _K4_ to determine the output; _i1_ and _i2_ are the input values of the two source objects.

![Composite Filter.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Composite.png)

Examples of the different modes available in the _Composite_ filter primitive. The first input is the blue square. The second input is a red square derived from the blue square using the _[Color Matrix](#Filters-ColorMatrix "Color Matrix")_ and _[Offset](#Filters-Offset "Offset")_ filter primitives. The parameters for the _Arithmetic_ mode are all set to 0.5.

### Merge

The _Merge_ filter allows the combining of two or more objects or outputs of filter primitives. It works by layering one image on top of another, much as regular objects are layered on top of each other in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_, or, for the case of two inputs, as the _[Composite](#Filters-Composite "Composite")_ filter primitive using the “Over” mode.

When the _Merge_ filter is added to a complex filter an unassigned input node is created. As each input is assigned, another empty input node is created. This empty node is not included in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ tree structure.

### Image

_Partially Implemented._

The _Image_ primitive renders an external graphics file or an internal _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ object. It allows more than one object to be referenced in a complex filter (the first being the object attached to the filter).

Unfortunately, this very useful filter primitive is not yet fully implemented in Inkscape with only external images supported. The _[GUI](#gui "Graphics User Interface")_ will create a reference with an absolute path to the external image. Use the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ to change an absolute path to a relative one if required.

By default, the image is shrunk or stretched to fit inside the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of the object to which the filter is attached.

The placement of the image within the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ can be controlled using the parameters _x_, _y_, _width_, and _height_. The coordinate system is the same as used for the object. The _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ must be used to modify these parameters. An additional parameter, _preserveAspectRatio_, is not supported by Inkscape.

### Turbulence

The _Turbulence_ primitive allows the creation of artificial textures such as marble surfaces or clouds. It is based on the work of [Ken Perlin](http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/doc/oscar.html) who won an Academy Award for creating realistic textures with computers. Perlin solved the problem of using random numbers to produce _smooth_ random fluctuations in color. A simplified version of his method is to generate random intensities at given intervals and then connect these points smoothly together.

Note that Firefox, Opera, and Batik will render this filter differently than Inkscape if the attribute `color-interpolation-filters="sRGB"` is not added to the filter definition.

The following figure gives an idea of how the filter would be implemented in one dimension:

![Turbulence: 1D.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Turbulence_Perlin.png)

A one-dimensional illustration of the Perlin method of generating noise. _Fractal Noise_ is shown on the left and _Turbulence_ on the right. The _Base Frequency_ is set to 0.05 giving a “wave length” of 20 pixels (indicated by the vertical dotted lines). The contributions from three _Octaves_ are shown individually and then summed.

The _[RGB](#rgb "red-green-blue")_ and _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ components are each derived separately.

![Turbulence: Components.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Turbulence_Components.png)

The components of a _Fractal Noise__Turbulence_ filter. From left to right: Red, Green, Blue, Alpha, Combined. There is a black rectangle behind the right half of the latter. The _[Color Matrix](#Filters-ColorMatrix "Color Matrix")_ primitive was used to extract the individual components.

The _Type_ menu can be set to either _Fractal Noise_ or _Turbulence_. _Turbulence_ tends to have more dramatic dark regions as the absolute values of the noise terms are used, creating “visual cusps”.\[[13](#ftn.idm140578969004816)\]

![Turbulence: Types.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Turbulence_Type.png)

The two types of noise available: Left: _Fractal Noise_. Right: _Turbulence_. Top: Only red channel. Bottom: All channels. There are black rectangles behind the right halves.

The _Base Frequency_ is defined by default in terms of inverse _Screen pixels_. For example, a frequency of 0.1 would have a “wave length” of 10 pixels. Inkscape cannot yet create resolution independent noise. Reasonable values for this attribute range from 0.01 (a slowly varying texture) to 0.2 (a rapidly varying texture).

![Turbulence: Base Frequency.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Turbulence_Frequency.png)

_Fractal Noise_ as a function of _Base Frequency_. From left to right: 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, Top: Only red channel. Bottom: All channels, a black rectangle has been placed behind the right halves.

The number of _Octaves_ determines the complexity of the noise, the more _Octaves_, the more complex. Each _Octave_ adds a term with twice the _Frequency_ but half the amplitude. Using more than four or five _Octaves_ isn't so useful as the spatial and color variations become too small to be seen (and increases the CPU load).

![Turbulence: Octaves.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Turbulence_Octaves.png)

_Fractal Noise_ as a function of _Octaves_. All with _Base Frequency_ of 0.05. From left to right: 1 octave, 2 octaves, 3 octaves. Top: Only red channel. Bottom: All channels, a black rectangle has been placed behind the right halves.

The _[Turbulence](#Filters-Turbulence "Turbulence")_ primitive uses a pseudo-random number generator. In principle, renderings with different _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ viewers should use the same generator and produce the same textures (at the same scale). If you use the filter twice on two identical objects, the textures should be the same. Changing the seed will force the random-number sequence to be different and thus the textures will be different too.

Lighting Filters Primitives
---------------------------

Two primitives, _[Diffuse Lighting]( "Lighting Filters Primitives")_ and _[Specular Lighting]( "Lighting Filters Primitives")_, are included to simulate light shining on objects. They represent two of the three parts of the [Phong reflection model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model) for modeling light in computer graphics. The three parts of the model are:

*   Ambient light: The light present everywhere in a scene. In _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ this would be represented by a solid _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_.
*   Diffuse light: The reflection of a light source off a surface that does not depend on the location of the observer. The intensity is a function of the angle between a line connecting the surface to a light source and a line normal to the surface.
*   Specular light: The reflection of a light source off a surface that does depend on the location of the observer. For example, the highlights seen on shiny surfaces. The intensity is maximum when the angle between the normal to a surface and the light source is equal to the angle between the normal and the viewer.

![Phong Model.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Phong.png)

An illustration of the components of the Phong model. From left to right: ambient light, diffuse light, specular light. All light sources combined. The diffuse and specular light source is the same, a red distant light coming from the upper left. The specular image has had a black background added to set off the specular light.

The Phong model does not take into account shadows that would be caused by one area of an object on another, that is it does not do ray tracing.

The contour of an object in the _z_ (out of the drawing) direction is described by a _[bump map](#bumpmap "bump map")_ that is defined by the _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ channel of an object. The values of the pixel and the neighboring pixels in the _bump map_ define the normal to the surface for the pixel.

The two lighting filters share in common most of their attributes such as the type of light source, its color, and its position; thus we'll discuss them together.

*   _Diffuse Color_, _Specular Color_: The color of the light source.
*   _Surface Scale_: Sets the scale of the surface in order to calculate normals to the surface. The number represents the maximum height (corresponding to _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ = 1.0) of the surface in the same units as _x_ and _y_.
*   _Constant_: Diffuse or Specular Reflection Constant: How much of the light that hits the surface is reflected diffusely or specularly. A value greater than 1.0 oversaturates the object.
*   _Exponent_ (_[Specular Lighting]( "Lighting Filters Primitives")_ only): Determines how sharp or narrow the specular reflections are. A value of 1.0 (the minimum) suggests a dull surface with wide reflections; as the value increases, the surface appears more polished with narrower reflections.
*   _Kernel Unit Length_ (Unused): Sets the pixel size used to calculate the reflections (screen pixels are used by default).
*   _Light Source_: One of three types of light: _Distant Light_, _Point Light_, or _Spot Light_ (see below).

When applying a lighting filter with a large _Surface Scale_, the limited resolution of the _[bump map](#bumpmap "bump map")_ may create artifacts. These can be removed by applying a small amount of Gaussian blur to the image.

![Large Sphere.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Light_Sphere.png)

The limited resolution of the _[bump map](#bumpmap "bump map")_ has resulted in artifacts on the sphere on the left. A small amount of blurring has removed the artifacts on the sphere on the right (the sphere has also been clipped).

### Distant Light Source

This light source simulates a light at a large (infinite) distance from the illuminated object. The required attributes are:

*   _Azimuth_: The direction (angle) of the light source in the drawing plane. The angle is defined in degrees from the horizontal (_x_) axis in the clockwise direction. Note that this does not match either angle definition used by Inkscape (see [the section called “Transformations”]). Recall that _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ uses a left-handed coordinate system where the positive _y_ direction is down.
*   _Elevation_: The direction (angle) of the light source above the drawing plane (in degrees).

### Point Light Source

This light source simulates a point light source near an illuminated object. One triple set of numbers (_x_, _y_, _z_) is required to set the _Location_ of the light. The units are in the coordinate system of the lit object. Note: _z_ represents the distance out of the plane (toward the viewer of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ drawing) if _x_ or _y_ are not inverted.

### Spot Light Source

This light source simulates a point light source near an illuminated object but with a limited cone of light. One triple set of numbers (_x_, _y_, _z_) is required to set the _Location_ of the light and another to set the direction the center of the cone points (_Points At_). See previous section for the definition of the coordinate system. The _Specular Exponent_ sets how well-focused is the light; the higher the value, the more sharply focused the light. The _Cone Angle_ (degrees) defines the maximum angle for the light.

Five spheres illuminated by _Spot Light_ sources. The light from the left is a _Specular_ reflection, while that on the right is a _Diffuse_ reflection. The small red and blue circles indicate the positions of the light sources. The lights are directed at each other. The cone angle is 25 .

### Convolve Matrix

The _Convolve Matrix_ primitive uses neighboring pixels to modify the color of a pixel. How the pixel is changed is determined by an _N_   _M_ matrix with one entry for each neighboring pixel.

![Convolve Matrix formula.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_ConvolveMatrix_Formula.png)

The following is an example of a “Gaussian Blur” that uses a 5   5 matrix around the center pixel. The _Kernel_ is an integer representation of a 2-dimensional Gaussian with a standard deviation of 1.4 pixels. It is normalized by the _Divisor_.\[[14](#ftn.idm140578969145712)\]

![Convolve Matrix Filter, Gaussian Example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_ConvolveMatrix_GaussianBlur.png)

The above _Gaussian Blur_, _Convolve Matrix_ filter is applied to a photograph.

The parameters for the effect are:

*   _Size_: Size of matrix (_x_   _y_).
*   _Target_: Which matrix element corresponds to the target pixel, default is to center _Kernel_ on target pixel.
*   _Kernel_: The matrix.
*   _Divisor_: Scale factor after _Kernel_ applied.
*   _Bias_: Value added after _Kernel_ applied, default 0.
*   _Edge Mode_: The method that the input image is extended so that pixels at the edge can be evaluated. The options are: _Duplicate_ (the edge pixels are duplicated), _Wrap_ (the pixels are taken from the opposite side of the input image), _none_ (the extended pixels are given _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ and _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ values of zero). At the moment Inkscape does not use this parameter despite it being in the user interface.
*   _Preserve Alpha_: If box is checked, _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ will be copied directly from the input graphics. Otherwise, it will be calculated just like _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_.

The _[Convolve Matrix](#Filters-ConvolveMatrix "Convolve Matrix")_ primitive is necessarily linked to evaluating pixels. By default, the pixel size is that of the display. This means that the resulting image is not resolution independent. The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard provides ways to avoid this through the _filterRes_ and _kernelUnitLength_ attributes but Inkscape does not yet support them.

### Displacement Map

The _Displacement Map_ primitive distorts one _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_ using another as input. A pixel in the source _bitmap_ is translated to a new coordinate via the equations _x_' = _scale_   (_CX(x,y) − 0.5_) and _y_' = _scale_   (_CY(x,y) − 0.5_) where _CX_ and _CY_ are the any of the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ components or _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_, selectable by the _X Channel_ and _Y Channel_ attributes. The _X Channel_ and _Y Channel_ can be mapped with different colors.

The _[Displacement Map](#Filters-DisplacementMap "Displacement Map")_ filter can be used to produce some interesting effects, but figuring out a correct map can be difficult. Many of the _Preset_ filters use the output of a _[Turbulence](#Filters-Turbulence "Turbulence")_ filter to generate random distortions.

In the following examples, the _x_ displacement is set to red and the _y_ displacement is set to green. The olive green background corresponds to red and green values of 127, which corresponds (almost) to no displacement.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Note

Zero displacement? Not possible in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard. Color and _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ are described by a byte (8 bits). This corresponds to a range of 0 to 255. A zero displacement would be a value halfway between 0 and 255, or 127.5. But these are integer numbers and you can't have a value of 127.5. Take your pick, 127 or 128. In most practical cases, the shift won't be noticeable.

### Gaussian Blur

The _Gaussian Blur_ primitive blurs objects. Realistic highlights and reflections can be added to drawings as well as making objects out-of-focus. The primitive creates an output image by using a [Gaussian](#gaussian "Gaussian distribution") weighted average of the input pixels around the location of each corresponding output pixel.

Internally, the amount of blur is defined in terms of the _blur radius_, which for the mathematically inclined is just the standard deviation of the Gaussian. Technically, a Gaussian function extends to infinity. For practical reasons, the limit of an object's blur is two times the _blur radius_ outside the _bounding box_ at maximum blur.

The _Gaussian Blur_ primitive is highly CPU intensive. The output is a trade-off between speed and quality. One can set the _Blur quality_ for the screen display in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)) under the _Filter_ entry. Choosing a low-quality option will affect blurring of thin objects the most. Bitmap export is always done at the highest quality (and thus may be slow). In v0.48, one can set the number of threads used to render the filter in the dialog.

A _Gaussian Blur_ filter can be created through both the _Filter Effects_ and the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialogs.

#### Blurring with the Fill and Stroke Dialog

Using the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog to create a blur is fast and easy. The dialog automatically creates the filter for you (and removes it if the blur is removed). In this dialog, the amount of blurring is defined in terms of a percentage. A blurring of 100% (the maximum blurring allowed) is equivalent to a _blur radius_ of 1/8 of the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ perimeter. For a square _bounding box_, this would be half of a side.

To apply a _Gaussian Blur_ to an object, select the object and then adjust the blur with the _Blur_ slider near the bottom of the dialog. Only a symmetric blur can be applied with this dialog.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Tip

Blurs created through the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog depend on the size of the blurred object. To get the exact same amount of blur on different size objects, you can either use the Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-paste-style.png)Paste Style (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**V****) command (if all the attributes are to be the same) or use the _[Filter Effects]( "Chapter 17. Filter Effects—Custom")_ dialog to set the _blur radius_ (_standard deviation_) to the same values.

##### Clipping and Masking

The _Gaussian Blur_ primitive is applied to an object before any _[Clipping or Masking]( "Chapter 15. Clipping and Masking")_. This will give a sharp edge along the clipping path to a blurred object. If you wish the clipped edge to be blurred, put it in a _[Group]_ by itself and then blur the _Group_. If you want a feathered edge to an object like a bitmap, create a white _[transparency](#transparency "transparency")_ mask with the edge blurred.

### Offset

The _Offset_ primitive shifts a graphic by the specified amounts in _x_ and _y_. The classic example is the use of this primitive to create a shadow. See the Drop Shadow example earlier in this section.

This primitive has two parameters: _Delta X_, the offset in the horizontal direction and _Delta Y_ the offset in the vertical direction. Note that the positive _y_ direction is in the downward direction (as defined by the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard).

If the specified offset is large, the filter region needs to be enlarged. You can increase the filter region under the _Filter General Settings_ tab at the bottom of the _[Filter Effects]( "Chapter 17. Filter Effects—Custom")_ dialog.

![Offset.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/FILTERS/Filters_Offset.png)

Examples of the _[Offset](#Filters-Offset "Offset")_ primitive. The three squares are drawn on top of each other. The green and red squares are then shifted with the _[Offset](#Filters-Offset "Offset")_ primitive. The filter region for the green and red squares had to be enlarged.

### Neon

This example uses the _[Morphology](#Filters-Morphology "Morphology")_ primitive to create the glow around a neon tube. The glow color is derived from the neon color using the _[Color Matrix](#Filters-ColorMatrix "Color Matrix")_ primitive. A couple _[Gaussian Blur](#Filters-GaussianBlur "Gaussian Blur")_ primitives create the soft feel of the neon and a _[Merge](#Filters-Merge "Merge")_ primitive combines the neon and glow together.

The _XML Editor_ dialog allows one to directly edit the _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ description of an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ drawing. (Recall that Inkscape is an _SVG_\-based drawing program and that _SVG_ is an _XML_\-based file format.)

The ability to directly edit an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ file is very powerful. It allows the user more control over objects in their drawing such as specifying the exact size or position of an object and by giving access to _SVG_ parameters that are not directly or easily available through the Inkscape interface.

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

Basic Usage
-----------

To edit the _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ file, open the _XML Editor_ dialog (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-xml-editor.png)XML Editor... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**X****)). This will open a window like the following for an empty drawing.

![XML Editor dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_XML.png)

_XML Editor_ dialog (with nothing selected).

The “tree” structure of the empty drawing is shown on the left in the dialog. Even an empty Inkscape drawing contains information, including an empty _[Layer]_ ("layer1"). The _Layer_, like all the items listed, is represented by a “node” in the tree. If the layer contained objects, they would be represented by nodes under the layer's node. The objects under a particular node can be hidden in the tree view. To hide and unhide these objects click on the small triangles just in front of a node's name.

Upon adding an ellipse to the drawing, an entry (node) is added for the new ellipse under the formerly empty _Layer_ (see next figure). The line is highlighted and the ellipse's parameters are shown on the right. Note that the name of the object is given in the highlighted line (in this case, "path1599").

Now, suppose you would like the ellipse to have a width of 400 pixels (i.e., a radius of 200 pixels in the _x_ direction). You can specify this by clicking on the “sodipodi:rx” attribute. The attribute is shown below with the current value in the attribute entry box. Change that value to 200 and then click on the _Set_ button (or use **Ctrl**+**Enter**).

![XML Editor dialog with ellipse.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/XMLEDIT/ellipse2_xml.png)

_XML Editor_ dialog after changing the width of the ellipse.

The ellipse should now be 400 pixels wide. You could also change the height (sodipodi:ry) and the location of the center of the ellipse (sodipodi:cx and sodipodi:cy). And you can change attributes like the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color and _[Stroke style]( "Stroke Style")_.

To add a new attribute, type the name of the new attribute in the upper entry box, enter the value in the lower entry box, and then either click the _Set_ button or use **Ctrl**+**Enter**.

Sometimes it is useful to know what the allowed attributes are for a given type of object. The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard is described in detail at the [_Official W3C SVG_](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/) website. Note that not all the _SVG_ standard is currently supported in Inkscape. It is possible, however, to add nonsupported attributes via the _XML Editor_. These attributes may not be displayed by Inkscape but will appear in any program that supports those attributes.

Elements in the Inkscape file fall under two categories: those included in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard and those that are private to Inkscape. In the above example, the attributes with the “sodipodi” tag are internal to Inkscape (the “sodipodi” tag is the result of Inkscape being branched from the Sodipodi program). These attributes are used to calculate the “real” _SVG_ path definition given by the 'd' attribute. (See [the section called “Paths”] in [Appendix B, _File Format_]( "Appendix B. File Format").)

The Inkscape internal elements should be ignored by other _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ rendering programs. This may not always be true, thus Inkscape includes the possibility to export a drawing without the Inkscape internal elements.

### Adding Color to a Marker Arrow

Markers on paths in Inkscape do not inherit the attributes of the path. This is most noticeable for colored paths where the markers are drawn in black. Inkscape now includes the _[Color Markers to Match Stroke](#Extensions-ColorMarkers "Color Markers to Match Stroke")_ extension for changing the color of markers to match the stroke color. This section is kept for pedagogical reasons.

To add color to a marker, open up the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_. Select the path with the marker in the canvas window. In the “style” attribute for the line, locate the marker entry (marker-end:url(#Arrow2Lend), for example). Then expand the “<svg:defs>” line by clicking on the triangle at the beginning of the line (if not already expanded). You should see an entry for the marker. Select that entry. The attributes for the marker should be displayed on the right. Select the “style” attribute. Add “fill:#rrggbb” to the attributes in the entry box at the bottom right, where #rrggbb is the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ color in _[hexadecimal](#hexadecimal "hexadecimal number")_ form (obtainable from the attributes for the path).

The marker should change color. If it doesn't, then expand the "<svg:marker>" line. Select the path entry and remove any _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and/or _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_. For this change to show up, you must save and reopen the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file.

If you wish to have markers of the same type with different colors, then you must add copies in the <svg:defs> section. You can use the _Duplicate Node_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/xml-node-duplicate.png) icon to duplicate a marker entry. Rename the new entry to a suitable name and change the reference to the marker in the path object you want the marker to be associated with. Again the file must be closed and reopened for the changes to be seen.

You are not limited to changing color. You can change other attributes such as the marker size.

### Underlined Text

Underlined text cannot be added through the normal Inkscape interface, nor will Inkscape display underlines. But you can add underlined text that will be displayed properly by another _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ program.

To underline text, open the _XML Editor_. Select the text you wish underlined. Go to the "<svg:tspan>" object found inside an "<svg:text>" tag. If you are selecting part of the text, you may need to add some attribute temporarily (color for example) to create a corresponding “tspan” object; the color can be removed later. Add to the style: “text-decoration: underline”.

Here is an example as rendered by the Squiggle program.

Tiling or tessellation is the covering of a surface with the repeated use of the same shape tile. A typical example is the tiling in a bathroom. In Inkscape, this concept is expanded to include a multitude of options, including progressively changing the tile size, spacing, and orientation.

The tiles are in reality just clones of the source tile or object. Thus the same methods that apply to clones apply to tiles. (See [the section called “Clones”] in [Chapter 4, _Editing Basics_]( "Chapter 4. Editing Basics").)

While random use of the _Tile Clones_ dialog can produce exquisite patterns, it is useful to understand the fundamentals of tessellation in order to have more control over the final design.

![Tiling example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TILES/Tiles_Example.png)

An example of using the _Tile Clones_ dialog with a simple calligraphic stroke and the _P6M_ symmetry group (see text).

To construct a tiling, open up the _[Create Tiled Clones]( "Chapter 19. Tiling")_ dialog (Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-tile-clones.png)Create Tiled Clones... ).

![Tiling dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Tile_Symmetry.png)

The _Tile Clones_ dialog with no objects selected.

At the bottom of the dialog is a fixed section where you can choose the size of the tiling either by the number of rows and columns or by the width and height of the area you wish to cover. The terms _Rows_ and _Columns_ are only really appropriate for tiling of rectangular tiles (see below). Checking the “Used saved size and position of the tile” forces the tiling to use the size and position of the base tile at the last time the tile was used in a tiling. This preserves the spacing between tiles if the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ has changed due to editing the base tile. Clicking on the _Reset_ button resets most of the entries under the tabs to their default values. The _Remove_ button can be used to undo a tiling when the base tile is selected. The _Unclump_ button can be used to spread out the clones in a somewhat random fashion (can be repeated). And, finally, the _Create_ button creates the tiling.

With a circle and the default values (P1 symmetry, two rows and two columns), you will get the following tiling:

![Default tiling](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TILES/Tile_Default.png)

The simple tiling of a circle. The symmetry is "P1" and there are two rows and two columns.

The circle has been replicated four times in two rows and two columns. The original circle is still there, under the top-left cloned circle. The _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of the circle has been used as the base tile size.

This example is not so interesting, but there are many options under the dialog's tabs that can produce many interesting effects. Each tab will be covered in turn in the following sections.

Symmetry Tab
------------

The _Symmetry_ tab is at the heart of the tiling process. Understanding the different symmetries is necessary to have full control over the outcome of a tiling. The symmetry of the tiling is selected from the pull-down menu under the _Symmetry_ tab (see previous figure).

There are three regular geometric shapes that can be replicated to cover a surface completely (without gaps or overlaps). These shapes are: triangles, rectangles (parallelograms), and hexagons. A complete set of tiling symmetries requires taking these shapes and adding rotations and reflections. It is known that there are 17 such tiling symmetries. (See: [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group).) All 17 symmetries are included in the Inkscape _[Create Tiled Clones]( "Chapter 19. Tiling")_ dialog. The symmetries are shown next.

![Tilings based on a rectangle tile (or 45-45-90 degree triangle).](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TILES/Tiles_Rect.png)

Tilings based on a rectangle tile (or 45-45-90 degree triangle). The outlined dark blue tile is the basic unit. Red and yellow dots show the reflection and rotation symmetries. Points of twofold and fourfold rotational symmetry are shown by pink diamonds and green squares, respectively. The P1 and P2 symmetries also work with parallelograms.

![Tiling based on tiles that are symmetrical subdivisions of a hexagonal.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TILES/Tiles_Hex.png)

Tiling based on regular subdivisions of a hexagonal. The outlined dark blue tile is the basic unit. All tilings have points of threefold rotational symmetry (orange triangles). Two also have twofold and sixfold rotational symmetries (pink diamonds and purple hexagons). The pairs of numbers indicate the row and column numbers.

The basic tile for each of the 17 symmetries is shown in dark blue in the preceding figures. Inkscape uses the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of an object to determine the basic tile size. For rectangular base tiles, the _bounding box_ corresponds to the base tile. However, for triangular base tiles, the base tile covers only part of the _bounding box_ area. This can result in tiles “overlapping” if an object extends outside the base tile shape (but is still within the _bounding box_) as in the tiling in the introduction to this chapter. Overlapping can also occur if the base tile is altered after the tiles are positioned.

![Tiling problems with a triangular base tile-0.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TILES/Tile_BoundingBox0.png)

On the left is a triangle and circle that are grouped together. The triangle corresponds to the base tile for a P6M symmetry. Note that the red circle is outside the base triangle but is still within the _bounding box_ of the group (and triangle). On the right is a P6M tiling with the triangle and circle. Note how the red circle ends up above some but below other triangles as determined by the order in which the tiling is made.

Inkscape always uses the _Geometric_ _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ to determine the tile size. This avoids problems when creating a triangular tile with a _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ where the _Visual_ _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ doesn't have the same width to height ratio as the _Geometric_ _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_.

If you need to adjust the base tile size after having created a tiling, you can use the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog to change the parameters “inkscape:tile-h” and “inkscape:tile-w” (these will appear after you have cloned the object and are used only if the _Use saved size and position of the tile_ button is checked).

Shift Tab
---------

The _Shift_ tab allows one to vary the spacing between tiles. With the default parameters, rectangular tiles are arranged so that their _Geometric_ _[bounding boxes](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ are touching. The following options are available to add or subtract space between the tiles:

*   _Shift X_, _Shift Y_: Adds (or subtracts) to the tile spacing in units of _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ width and height. A random factor can also be added.
*   _Exponent_: Changes the exponent factor _z_ so that position of each tile is _x_ (or _y_) = (1 + “shift”)_z_.
*   _Alternate_: The shift alternates between being added and subtracted.
*   _Cumulate_: The previous shift is added to the new shift. For example, if there was a _Shift X_ of 10%, normally the space between subsequent tiles would be 10%, 20%, 30%, and so on. With this option, the shifts become 10%, (10+20)% (10+20+30)%, etc. This is useful when one is also scaling the tiles to keep the tile spacing constant. (See the _Scale Tab_ section for an example.)
*   _Exclude tile_: The tile width or height is excluded in the calculation of tile spacing. This is useful when using the _Rotation_ option to put tiles on a circle. In this case, it is a shortcut for specifying a −100% shift.

Question: What is the symmetry of closely packed hexagons? The answer is P1 as can be seen below. One can use this fact to trivially generate the board for the game [Hex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29) invented independently by the mathematicians Piet Hein and John Nash.

Scale Tab
---------

The _Scale_ tab allows one to increase or decrease the size of the tiles depending on the row and column position. The following options are available to scale tiles:

*   _Scale X_, _Scale Y_: Scales each tile in terms of percentage. A random factor can be added.
*   _Exponent_: Scale each tile with an exponential factor. The nominal scaling S becomes S_exponent_.
*   _Base_: Used to create a logarithmic spiral along with _Rotation_. The nominal scaling S becomes _base_S-1 unless _base_ is one in which case scaling remains unchanged. Use a value less than 1 for a converging spiral and a value greater than 1 for a diverging spiral. A true logarithmic spiral would use a base of _e_ = 2.718 (or 1/_e_ = 0.368). See the [_Tile Tricks_] section for examples.
*   _Alternate_: Alternate scaling up and scaling down tiles.
*   _Cumulate_: Scaling is cumulative.

*   _Alternate_: The rotation alternates between being added and subtracted.
*   _Cumulate_: Rotation is cumulative.

Color Tab
---------

The _Color_ tab allows one to change the _Color_ of each tile depending on the row and column position. The color change is specified in percent for each of the three components of a color specified with the _[HSL](#Attributes-Color-HSL "HSL")_ standard (see [the section called “HSL”](#Attributes-Color-HSL "HSL")). The _Hue_ repeats itself after a change of 100%. The full scale for _Saturation_ and _Lightness_ components are each 100%. The changes in the three parameters can be specified to _Alternate_ between a positive and negative change. A _Randomizer_ factor can also be specified.

Two key points: First, the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and/or _[Stroke paint]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ must be specified as _Unset_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/paint-unknown.png)) (see [the section called “Fill and Stroke Paint”]( "Fill and Stroke Paint")). Second, an _Initial color_ must be specified by using the _Initial color of tiled clones_ dialog accessible by clicking on the color button next to the _Initial Color_ label.

Note that it is meaningless to have only a shift in _Hue_ with a starting color of black or white. This is like trying to walk east from the North Pole.

Trace
-----

The _Trace_ tab allows one to set the color, size, and transparency of the tiles by the color or transparency of the objects (including bitmaps) that are placed under the location of the tiling. To enable this feature, the _Trace the drawing under the tiles_ box must be checked.

The _Trace_ tab has three sections. At the top is a section for specifying what property of the underlying drawing should be used for input. Options include the color, one of the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ components, or one of the _[HSL](#Attributes-Color-HSL "HSL")_ components. There is also the option to use the _Opacity_, which is the sum of the opacities (_[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_) of all objects under the tile.

In the middle of the tab is a section to modify the input value. One can specify a _[Gamma](#gamma "gamma")_\[[15](#ftn.idm140578968128000)\] correction or add a randomization factor to the input. One can also invert the input.

The bottom section is for specifying what should be affected by the input. Options include _Presence_ (the probability that a given tile will be drawn), color, size, and opacity. The color will only be changed for regions of the base tile that have _Unset_ fill.

![Tiling dialog - Color tab.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Tile_Trace.png)

The following figures show the effect of some of the possible combinations of input and output options. All the figures use the first rainbow figure as the input drawing. The rainbow is a _radial gradient_ with multiple stops. The inside of the rainbow is defined as a white gradient stop with zero _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_. The last outside stop is defined with a red color and with zero _Alpha_. For most figures, a star inside an unfilled rectangle is used as the base tile. The star has been given an _Unset_ fill when color is selected in the output.

Tricks
------

It is possible to exploit the _Tiling_ dialog to produce a number of useful effects. The most interesting is placing tiles along an arc or spiral.

To put a tile along an arc use the P1 symmetry with one row of tiles. Check the _Exclude tile_ box. The _[Rotation center](#RotationCenter "Rotation Center")_ is used as the center of rotation.

![Tiles on an arc.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TILES/Tile_OnArc.png)

The base tile is drawn on the left, showing the _[Rotation center](#RotationCenter "Rotation Center")_ of the tile. On the right is after a P1 tiling with a per column shift removed by checking the _Exclude tile_ box and with a rotation of 60%.

The next figure shows how 12 stars can be put in a circle. This would have been an alternative way of placing the stars in the European Union flag if the stars did not need to be placed with one of their points straight up.

![Tiles on an arc 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TILES/Tile_OnArc2.png)

Twelve stars in a circle.

This trick can also place objects along a spiral by specifying that the tile should get larger with each column. One can put the stars on a logarithmic spiral so that the stars don't run into each after several loops.

![Tiles on an arc 3.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TILES/Tile_OnArc3.png)

Stars on a logarithmic spiral. The tile size is increased by 2.5% with _Base_ set to 2.7. Each tile is rotated 20 .

Stars on a logarithmic spiral. The tile size is increased by 2.5% with _Base_ set to 2.7. Each tile is rotated 20 . The per column shift has been set to 60% (with the _Exclude tile_ box checked).

![A P1 symmetry tiling with a rotation 4.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TILES/Tile_PineCone.png)

A “P1 symmetry” tiling. 8 rows, 21 columns. Rotation of −11.5  per row and 20.6  per column, _Scale_ of 39.3% per row and 24.2% per column with a _Base_ of 2.7 for both _x_ and _y_. The pattern matches that for a pine cone with 8 rows in one direction and 13 in the other. For the mathematicians: note that 13 times the per column scaling is equal to 8 times the per row scaling and that 13 times the per column rotation minus 8 times the per row rotation is equal to 360 . This is due to the constraint that the 14th star in the first row is the same as the 9th star in the first column.

Inkscape has the ability to convert bitmap images into paths via _tracing_. Inkscape uses routines from [Potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net), with the generous permission of the author, Peter Selinger. Optionally, [SIOX] can be used as a preprocessor to help separate a foreground from a background.

Tracing an image is not an easy thing to do. Potrace works well for some types of artwork (black-and-white line drawing) and not so well for others (scans from screened color prints). The paths that are created can have thousands of nodes depending on the complexity of the image and may tax the power of your CPU. Using the _Suppress speckles_ option can reduce the number of nodes generated by the scan. After the scan, you can use the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-simplify.png)Simplify (****Ctrl**+**L****) command to reduce the number of nodes (but at a cost in resolution). In the latter case, careful tuning of the _Simplification threshold_ under the _Misc_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog may be necessary to obtain optimal results.

The result of tracing depends heavily on the quality of the input images. Filtering input scans using [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) (e.g., Gaussian blur) or [mkbitmap](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/) may improve your results.

To trace a bitmap, call up the _Trace Bitmap_ dialog (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/bitmap-trace.png)Trace Bitmap... (****Shift**+**Alt**+**B****)). The dialog has three tabs. The first is to select the tracing mode and the second has a list of options.

![Trace Bitmap dialog, mode tab.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_TraceBitmap_Mode.png)

![Trace Bitmap dialog, options tab.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_TraceBitmap_Options.png)

The _Mode_ tab is divided into a number of parts. On the left are two sections: one for _Single_ scans, where one _[Path]( "Chapter 7. Paths")_ is created, and one for _Multiple_ scans, where several _Paths_ are created. On the right is a _Preview_ window, which can give you a quick idea of what the final scans will look like. A check box at the top right toggles on and off _SIOX foreground selection_ (see below).

A number of scanning strategies are available. Each is discussed in a following section. The sections show the results of tracing a black-and-white figure and a color figure. The input figures (from the August 1919 edition of _Vanity Fair_) are shown below. The scans have been passed through the Gimp Gaussian Blur filter to remove the effects of the printing screens.

### Brightness Cutoff

Output depends on the _brightness_ of the pixels in the bitmap. Brightness is defined as the sum of the red, green, and blue values for a pixel (or the grayscale value for black-and-white drawings). One path is created containing all regions that are darker than the _Threshold_ setting. This works well for black-and-white line art.

![Brightness.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TRACE/VFMT/Bright_456.png)

Brightness. From left to right, the _Threshold_ is 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6.

### Edge Detection

Output depends on differences in _brightness_ between adjacent pixels. A path is created between areas with changes that exceed the _Threshold_ setting.

![Edge.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TRACE/VFMT/Edge_159.png)

Edge detection. From left to right, the _Threshold_ is 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9.

### Color Quantization

Output depends on changes in _color_ between adjacent pixels. The _Number of Colors_ gives the number of different colors that were used in looking for edges. Only one path is created; what is inside and outside of the path is based on whether the index of the color is even or odd.

Multiple Scans
--------------

The bitmap is scanned multiple times, each time with a different setting. One path is created for each scan. The paths are stored in a group. The scanning criteria can be _Brightness steps_, _Colors_, or _Grays_. _Grays_ uses the _Color_ scanning criteria but assigns the resulting paths a grayscale rather than a color. The _Scans_ entry box applies to all three scanning criteria. Three options, described in the [Options](#Trace-Multi-Options "Options") section below, apply to all _Multiple Scans_.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

### Brightness Steps

The bitmap is scanned one more time than the specified number (Bug?). The values at which the scans are performed is nontrivial. The lowest (darkest) scan is always done at a brightness threshold of 0.2, the next scan is at a threshold of (0.2 + (0.9 − 0.2)/n). The output level of the darkest region is 0.2 and the lightest is 0.9. Other regions fall at evenly spaced positions in between. If the _Remove background_ box is checked, the 90% region is removed.

A black-and-white bitmap is created for each color, which is then sent to Potrace for tracing.

### Options

Three extra options are available with _Multiple scans_.

**Smooth. ** Selecting the _Smooth_ option causes a _Gaussian Blur_ to be applied to the **input** bitmap before tracing. This has the effect of smoothing out the difference between adjacent pixels and can be very useful, for example, with scans of screened prints. Too much filtering can lead to loss of detail. The preceding tracings were made without smoothing as the input scan had already been filtered with a _Gaussian_ blur in Gimp.

**Stack scans. ** The _Stack scans_ option determines how the paths are defined. With the _Stack scans_ box unchecked, the paths produced do not overlap; with the box checked, each path includes the area of the paths above it in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_. The advantage of unstacked paths is that they are easier to divide into sub-paths, while the advantage of stacked paths is that there are no “holes” between the coverage of the paths. The differences between the two situations is depicted below.

![Multiple scans, stacked.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TRACE/VFMT/Multi_B4_Stack.png)

![Multiple scans, unstacked.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TRACE/VFMT/Multi_B4_UnStack.png)

The four paths from a multiple scan with the _Stacked_ box unchecked.

**Remove background. ** The lowest path in _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_ is defined as the _background_. Normally, this path has the lightest color. When the _Stack scans_ option is chosen, the background path corresponds to a rectangle the size of the scanned image. Checking the _Remove background_ box prior to scanning suppresses this path.

Common Options
--------------

This section covers options common to all scanning criteria that are found on the _Options_ tab. Two of the options reduce file size while the third produces smoother paths. These are all options that are part of Potrace. Their usefulness will vary depending on the source bitmap.

**Suppress speckles. ** Turning on this option removes all paths with a size less than the specified amount. See the [_NP Logo_]( "The Northern Pacific Railway Logo—A Tracing Example") tutorial for an example of its use.

**Smooth corners. ** This option produces rounded corners at nodes. The smaller the value, the sharper the corner. A value of 0 is equivalent to no smoothing (i.e., corner nodes connected by straight lines). As the value approaches 1, the number of nodes decreases with the percentage of smooth nodes increasing. The exact behavior is hard to predict.

**Optimize paths. ** This option controls merging _[Bezier](#Paths-Bezier "The Bezier (Pen) Tool")_ curves in a scan together, thereby reducing the number of nodes. The _Tolerance_ value controls the allowed error in the resulting curve from the merging. The higher the tolerance, the more likely two _Bezier_ curves can be merged into one. As _Bezier_ curves are required for the merging, the _Smooth corners_ option must be used (with a non-zero value).

![Tracing Options.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TRACE/Trace_Options.png)

The red circles are bitmap images and are traced using the _Brightness cutoff_ method. From left to right: _Smooth corners_ and _Optimize paths_ not used: 42 corner nodes; _Smooth corners_ used with a _Threshold_ of 1.00: 24 smooth nodes and one corner node; _Smooth corners_ used with a _Threshold_ of 1.00, _Optimize paths_ used with a _Tolerance_ of 0.20: 4 smooth nodes with 1 corner node.

SIOX
----

Simple Interactive Object Extraction or [SIOX](http://www.siox.org/) allows one to separate an object from the background in a bitmap image. It acts as a preselection routine for normal tracing. At the moment, only a background region can be specified. In the future, a foreground region will also be definable.

The performance of SIOX depends greatly on the characteristics of the bitmap image. Colored bitmaps where the object is clearly distinguished in color from the background work best.

To use SIOX, check the _SIOX foreground selection_ box in the _[Trace Bitmap]( "Chapter 20. Tracing Bitmaps")_ dialog. The label is a bit misleading as the next step is to select a region that includes the entire object of interest and excludes most of the background. The SIOX algorithm uses the excluded region to characterize the background.

Create a closed path around the object you wish to extract. Give the path a fill if it doesn't already have one. Select both the bitmap image and the path and then trace as usual.

![SIOX tracing.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/TRACE/NESTOR/Nestor.png)

An example of using SIOX. Left, original bitmap image. Middle, image with background exclusion region added. Right, result of tracing. One can see that the background rejection is not perfect as there are similar colors in the background and foreground (e.g., reddish hair on chest).

_Updated for v0.48._

_Connectors_ are lines that “connect” objects, useful for drawing organization charts or flow diagrams. Connectors remain connected even if the objects they connect are moved. Individual objects can be given an _avoid_ property that causes connectors to be routed dynamically around them.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

There is a bug in v0.48 that causes the connectors to be drawn wrong. Nudging a connected object up and down may cause the connectors to be rerouted correctly.

Creating Connectors
-------------------

Connectors are created by the _Connector Tool_. To create a connector, select the tool by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/draw-connector.png) icon (**Ctrl**+**F2** or **o**) in the _[Tool Box](#toolbox)_. Then click-drag the mouse from one point on the canvas to another. When the pointer is over an object, a _Connection_ handle is shown in the center of the object. Beginning or ending the click-drag on one of these handles will attach the connector to the corresponding object. Alternatively, one can begin a connector by clicking on an empty point on the canvas or on a _Connection_ handle and end the connector by a second click. Connectors are drawn so they begin on the edge of the attached object.

By default, connectors will not attach to text objects. This facilitates connections between boxes that frame text. You can change this option under the _Connector_ entry of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog.

Modifying Connectors
--------------------

Connectors can be modified several ways. The connectors can be connected or disconnected from objects, the connector line style can be changed, and the routing of the connectors can be changed.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

### Connecting and Disconnecting

A connector can be disconnected from an object by dragging an end point away from the object. To do so, first select the connector by clicking on it. Two handles should appear at each end. Drag one of the handles away. The handle will then be fixed to the background. To reconnect a handle (or to move a handle from one object to another), drag the handle to the connection handle that will appear at the center of the object when the cursor is above the object.

### Line Style

All the normal line (path) styles can be applied to a connector, including adding arrows or using a dashed line. To change the line style, use the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-fill-and-stroke.png)Fill and Stroke... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**F****)).

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Cap Style

Changing the _[Cap style](#Attributes-Stroke-Cap "Cap Style")_ to _Square Cap_ may improve the look of a connection to a stroked object.

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

### Routing

Connectors are automatically rerouted when objects are changed or connectors are added or modified. There are a number of parameters that can be set to control the automatic routing of connectors. These are all accessible from the _[Connector Tool]( "Chapter 21. Connectors")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_:

*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/connector-ignore.png): Clicking on this icon while an object is selected marks the object to permit connectors to cross the object when routed.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/connector-avoid.png): Clicking on this icon while an object is selected marks the object to prohibit connectors to cross the object when routed.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/connector-orthogonal.png): _New in v0.48:_ This icon toggles on/off routing connectors with only horizontal and vertical lines. Clicking it when a connector is selected will toggle the connector to the other mode.
    
*   **Curvature: ** This parameter controls the amount of curvature between two straight sections of a connector.
    
*   **Spacing: ** This parameter controls the amount of spacing around an object that a connector will not pass through.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/distribute-graph.png): Clicking on this icon will automatically rearrange connectors and connected objects in a “nice” arrangement. The placement is based on the [Kamada-Kawai](http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/kamada_kawai_spring_layout.html) algorithm that treats the connectors as springs so that the distance between the _connector_ handles are evenly spaced. Only selected objects and connectors will be changed (use **Ctrl**+**A** to select all objects and connectors). The following parameters/options control this layout. Your mileage may vary.
    
*   **Length: ** This parameter controls the “ideal” length of the connectors when automatically rearranging objects and connectors.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/distribute-graph-directed.png): This icon toggles on and off the option that connectors with end _[Markers](#Attributes-Stroke-Markers "Markers")_ (e.g. arrows) should point downwards.
    
*    ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/distribute-remove-overlaps.png): This icon toggles on and off the requirement that objects cannot overlap when moved.

Inkscape can be enhanced by _Extensions_. These are scripts or programs that can be run from inside Inkscape. Most _Extensions_ require external programs, usually written in Perl or Python.

Some of the included _Extensions_ might be of marginal use to the average user. However, much can be learned by examining the code in order to write your own scripts. Look in the `share/inkscape/extensions` directory for the code.

A few _Extensions_ are built into Inkscape; they are located in the source directory `src/extension/internal`. Often, an _Extension_ can be used to quickly prototype a feature that may be included natively in a future version of Inkscape. _Extensions_ are also a good way to add a feature that may have limited use by the general Inkscape community and thus not warrant the long-term commitment of adding the feature to the main code base.

If an extension doesn't work, it may be that you are missing some external dependency. You can check if this is the case by looking at the log file `extensions-errors.log` in your Inkscape preferences directory (Linux: `.con﻿fig/ inkscape`, Windows: `Documents and Settings\ USER\ Application Data\ Inkscape`).

_Extensions_ can be run live, that is, the script code can be run automatically in the background, responding immediately to changes in parameters. This can both be good (see results of parameter changes immediately) or bad (updating before a parameter is fully modified). Each _Extension_ dialog has a button to toggle on and off this _Live Preview_.

It is possible to assign keyboard shortcuts to extensions. See [the section called “Custom Keyboard Shortcuts”](#Customize-Files-Shortcuts "Custom Keyboard Shortcuts") in [Chapter 24, _Customization_]( "Chapter 24. Customization").

Extensions are grouped under several broad categories:

*   [Arrange]: Reorder objects.
    
*   [Color]: Modify the colors of an object or a _[Group]_ of objects.
    
*   [Generate from Path]( "Generate from Path"): Utilize a path object to create a new object.
    
*   [Images]: Extract or embed images in an Inkscape file.
    
*   [JessyInk]( "JessyInk (Presentations)"): Prepare a presentation viewable in web browsers.
    
*   [Modify Path]( "Modify Path"): Modify an existing path.
    
*   [Raster]: Manipulate the colors in a _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_.
    
*   [Render]: Create a new object.
    
*   [Text]: Manipulate text.
    
*   [Visualize Path]( "Visualize Path"): Extract information about a path.
    
*   _Updated in v0.48._ [Web]: Add JavaScript parameters or slice a drawing into bitmaps.
    

Two entries under the _Extensions_ menu allow you quick access to the previously used extension. The first, Extensions → Previous Extension, will run the extension with the same parameters. The second, Extensions → Previous Extension Settings... , will pop up the parameters dialog.

### Restack

This extension changes the _[z-order](#z-order "z-order")_ of objects based on their position on the canvas. A variety of parameters control how the restacking is done. The _Restack Direction_ is set by a drop-down menu in the _Restack_ dialog. Options include: _Left to Right_, _Bottom to Top_, _Right to Left_, _Top to Bottom_, _Radial Outward_, _Radial Inward_, and _Arbitrary Angle:_. In the last case the angle is given in the _Angle_ entry box where the angle is defined counterclockwise with zero corresponding to left to right. The last two parameters control which point of an object's _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ is used in the restacking process.

Color
-----

This set of extensions manipulates the colors of an object or _[Group]_ of objects. The extensions are implemented through a set of Python scripts (located in the directory `share/inkscape/extensions`). The use of Python scripts is a temporary measure until the capability is incorporated natively into Inkscape. The color mapping is calculated in the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ color space except for the extensions that modify _[HSL](#Attributes-Color-HSL "HSL")_ values, which are calculated in _HSL_ color space.

If no objects are selected, the color change will be applied to the entire drawing. An object's _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and any _[Gradient](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ are also changed.

### Black and White

_New in v0.48._

Converts an image to black and white. The extension first calculates brightness (luma) using the [YUV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV) color space (for NTSC and PAL standard definition television) and then applies a threshold of 50%.

### Brighter

Brighten the color of an object or _[Group]_ of objects. This extension has the property of making dark colors more intense but washing out light colors. The effect is subtle so multiple applications may be required.

### Desaturate

Desaturate the color of an object or _[Group]_ of objects. This sets the values of R, G, and B to the average of the maximum of R, G, and B; and the minimum of R, G, and B. For example, R would be set to (max( R, G, B ) + min( R, G, B ))/2.

### Grayscale

Change the color to a gray using the formula for Luminance used by the NTSC and PAL television standards. This sets the color to a _[lightness](#hsl "hue, saturation, lightness")_ (Y) defined by: Y = 0.229   R + 0.587;   G + 0.114   B. See the Wikipedia entry for [YUV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV) for further information.

### Less Hue

Decrease the hue (see [the section called “HSL”](#Attributes-Color-HSL "HSL")) of a color. The hue is decreased by 5% (of the full hue range) or equivalently, a rotation of 18  around the color circle. This, for example, means that a pure red picks up a touch of blue in the _[RGB](#Attributes-Color-RGB "RGB")_ color space.

### Extrude

Connects nodes in two paths with lines or with polygons. In the case of lines, it simply draws a line between each corresponding node in the two paths (i.e., a line between the first node of one path and the first node of the other path, etc.). If one path has more nodes than the other, the extra nodes are not used. All the lines are sub-paths of one path. In the case of polygons, a quadrilateral is drawn between corresponding adjacent pairs of points on the two lines. Each quadrilateral is a separate path. All the created paths are placed in a _[Group]_. In both cases, the original paths are not changed.

See the _[Motion](#Extensions-Motion "Motion")_ for a similar effect utilizing only a single path.

### Inset/Outset Halo

This extension produces a blurred image of the selected object(s). It works by making multiple copies of the object(s) and insetting or offsetting the path of each copy by a different small amount. The opacity of each copy is set to a small value based on the number of copies made. The copies are embedded in a group that is left above the original object(s).

Why would you want to use this extension when Inkscape now supports filters? Well, filter support in web browsers is still in its infancy. Your _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ drawings are more likely to be properly rendered using this extension. The look of the blur is also a bit different.

This extension only works on paths! Convert regular shapes and text to paths before using (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****)).

### Interpolate

Draws a series of lines that interpolate the space between two paths. The options include setting the number of _Interpolation Steps_ (in-between lines), an _Exponent_ factor that controls the spacing between interpolated paths (zero for even spacing), specifying if the original paths should be duplicated (_Duplicate Endpaths_), and specifying that the path style should also be interpolated. Objects need to be converted to paths prior to invoking the extension.

![Interpolation example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Interpolate2.png)

An interpolation between the red and blue lines, with the _Interpolate Style_ box checked.

The beginning of the path of one object is matched to the beginning of the other path. This can lead to unexpected effects. The starting point of a path can be found by selecting the path with the _Node Tool_ and then using the **Tab** key. If no node is already selected, the first node in the path will be selected.

![Interpolation example 3.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Interpolate3.png)

An interpolation between the blue square and a red circle, with the _Interpolate Style_ box checked. Left: the start of the two paths (indicated by the crosses) are not in the same relative positions. Right: the circle has been rotated 135 degrees so the start of the two paths are in the same relative positions.

The interpolation extension can also be used to simulate gradients of different symmetries. When calling the extension, the smaller path should be selected first.

![Interpolation example 5.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Interpolate5.png)

From left to right: Interpolation between two squares in the same orientation; two squares, one rotated 90 degrees; two stars in the same orientation; a star and a circle. The starting paths are shown on top. In all cases, the number of Interpolation steps was set to 25. Note that the smaller path must be selected first.

### Motion

Simulates motion. Draws a copy of the selected object behind the original and then connects corresponding nodes with lines to form a group of closed paths. The direction and offset of the copied object can be specified. The new objects inherit the attributes of the original but can be edited as a group.

![Motion example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Motion.png)

Left: Original object. Right: Object with extrusion. (_Magnitude_ of 25, _Direction_ of 180.) The _Master opacity_ has been set to 0.5 for the new objects.

One can also use this extension to simulate perspective by reducing the size of the copy along with the associated nodes. The steps are:

*   Ungroup objects (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-ungroup.png)Ungroup (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**G****)).
*   Combine into one path (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-combine.png)Combine (****Ctrl**+**K****)).
*   Use _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ to select all nodes associated with copy in back.
*   Move nodes toward each other (**<**, etc.).

### Pattern Along Path (Extension)

This extension places a pattern along one or more target paths. The pattern can be a single object or a _[Group]_ of objects. See also [Chapter 8, _Live Path Effects (LPEs)_]( "Chapter 8. Live Path Effects (LPEs)") for an alternative way of putting patterns along paths.

![Pattern along Path example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Path0.png)

Copies of the single yellow star are placed along a path. The star is deformed to follow the path.

To put a pattern on a path:

1.  **Select the pattern: ** The pattern can be a single object or a _[Group]_. In some cases, you may have better results if you explicitly convert all objects (e.g., _[Shapes]( "Chapter 6. Geometric Shapes")_) in the pattern to paths.
    
2.  **Select the target path or paths: ** Called the _Skeleton_ path by the extension author.
    
3.  **Call the extension: ** A dialog will open up where various parameters can be selected. After the extension is applied there will be a new path for each object in the pattern. For example, the stars on the line in the above figure are formed by one path.
    

The _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of the pattern is used for placing the pattern along the path, with the _bounding box_ of one pattern copy touching the _bounding box_ of the next copy (if no additional spacing is specified).

When the extension is called up, the following dialog is shown:

![Pattern along Path extension dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Path_Dialog.png)

The _Pattern along Path extension_ dialog. The dialog is described below.

This dialog has many options that can be set (see figures that follow for examples of use):

*   **Copies of the pattern: ** You can choose to have a _Single_ copy of the pattern placed on the path or multiple copies _Repeated_ along the path. The pattern can be _stretched_ so that the left edge of the first pattern copy lines up with the start of the _Skeleton_ path and the right edge of the last pattern copy lines up with the end of the _Skeleton_ path.
    
*   **Deformation type: ** Two options are available:
    
    *   **Snake: ** The pattern is rotated and deformed to follow the path such that all points with the same horizontal (_x_) position in the pattern will be on the same normal (perpendicular line) to the path, and all points with the same vertical (_y_) position in the pattern will be placed the same distance from the path. If the _Pattern is vertical_ box is checked, then the pattern is rotated 90 degrees first.
        
    *   **Ribbon: ** The pattern is deformed only in either the vertical or horizontal direction to conform to the path. The direction of the deformation is controlled by the _Pattern is vertical_ check box described below.
        
    
*   **Space between copies: ** You can add (or subtract) space between copies of the pattern. The unit is pixel.
    
*   **Normal offset: ** The _normal offset_ moves the pattern perpendicular relative to the path. Positive values move the pattern to the left relative to the direction of the path.
    
*   **Tangential offset: ** The _tangential offset_ moves the pattern in the direction of the tangent line to the path.
    
*   **Pattern is vertical: ** Checking this box rotates the orientation of the pattern by 90 degrees.
    
*   **Duplicate the pattern before deformation: ** With this box checked, the original pattern is left in place. Otherwise, it disappears.
    

![Pattern on Path example 1.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Path1.png)

Left: Snake deformation, right: Ribbon deformation. From top to bottom: Copies of the pattern: Single; Single, stretched; Repeated; Repeated, stretched.

![Pattern on Path example 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Path2.png)

Left: Snake deformation, right: Ribbon deformation. All with spacing of 10 px. From top to bottom: Spacing only, Normal offset of 5 px, Tangential offset of 10 px, Pattern is vertical.

The _Pattern along Path_ is a very useful extension but it does have a few quirks. One is that if the pattern is moved before use, the results may be less than ideal. Another is that different parts of the pattern can be distorted in different ways as seen in figures that follow.

![Pattern along Path example 6.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Path3.png)

The pattern at the upper left was put on the red path. Note how the distortion of the black outline is different from the blue squares. A solution in this case is to use the _Add nodes_ extension to increase the number of nodes in the path of the black square.

The following example shows a pattern placed on both straight and curved paths. If the radius of curvature is too small, the pattern may be grossly distorted.

![Pattern on Path example 4.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Path4.png)

The pattern at the top of the figure was applied to a straight line and to a curved line (shown in red).

A pattern can be used to create a fancy border as shown below. Care must be taken that the pattern lines up at the corners. This can be done by making the distance between the corner nodes multiples of the pattern width or by breaking the path into disconnected pieces at the corners (use the _Break Path at Selected Nodes_ (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-break.png)) option in the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ _[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_) and using the _Repeated, stretched_ option.

![Pattern along Path example 5a.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Path5a.png)

Borders produced with the _Pattern along Path_ extension. In both cases, the pattern in the center was put on a rectangle that was converted to a path. On the left, the rectangle side lengths were chosen to be multiples of the pattern width. On the right, the sides were disconnected by using the _Break Path at Selected Nodes_ (  ![Pattern along Path example 5a.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-break.png)) option in the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ on each corner node and the _Repeated, stretched_ option was chosen. This ensured that the pattern would line up at the corners properly.

![Pattern along Path example 5b.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Path5b.png)

From left to right: A single path with a _corner point_. The lengths of the sides are not multiples of the pattern width; thus, the pattern does not line up at the corner. The path converted to a compound path with two sections by using the _Break Path at Selected Nodes_ (  ![Pattern along Path example 5b.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-break.png)) option in the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_ on the _corner point_ node. Using the _Repeated, stretched_ option, the pattern width is adjusted so that it lines up at the corner. A close up of corner showing a discontinuity due to the pattern pieces not being connected. A close up of the corner after the two nodes at the corner are connected using the _Join Selected End Nodes_ (  ![Pattern along Path example 5b.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-join.png)) option in the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.

Going one step further, a pattern can be applied to a circle. In the following figure, the pattern on the right was applied to a circle (of larger diameter than the solid yellow circle). The resulting path was filled with a radial gradient.

![Pattern along Path example 6.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Path6.png)

A sun produced by putting a pattern on a circle. The flame path shown on the right was used as the pattern. A small space was added between pattern copies by setting _Space between copies_ to 10. (The yellow circle is an independent object.)

One use of the _Single, stretched_ option is to put text on a path. The text must be converted to a path first (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****)).

![Pattern along Path example 7.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Path7.png)

The text was placed along the path using the _Single, stretched_ and the _Ribbon_ options. The text was converted to a path first.

Another use of the _Single, stretched_ option is to create flourishes. (As of v0.47, this is better done by applying the “teardrop” as a custom shape with the _[Bezier Tool](#Paths-Bezier "The Bezier (Pen) Tool")_. One would not need to add the extra nodes.) The steps are:

*   Draw a small circle, convert to a path (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/object-to-path.png)Object to Path (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**C****)).
*   Create a “teardrop”: Convert one node to a corner node and move to right. Adjust node handles to flatten lines.
*   Add nodes with _[Add Nodes](#Extensions-AddNodes "Add Nodes")_ extension.
*   Draw curves with _[Bezier Tool](#Paths-Bezier "The Bezier (Pen) Tool")_ or _[Spiral Tool]_. Use _Pattern along Path_ to put a teardrop along curves.
*   Create multiple curved teardrop paths and combine (Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-union.png)Union (****Ctrl**+**+****)) to form the flourish.

![Pattern along Path example 8.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Path8a.png)

From top to bottom: Circle converted to path. Path with one node moved and handles adjusted. Path with extra nodes added. Teardrop path put on blue curve path. Ditto.

![Pattern along Path example 8a.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Path8b.png)

Top: Four “teardrop” paths are in position to be combined. Bottom: The final flourish after combining the paths.

### Scatter

This extension places a pattern along one or more target paths. It is almost identical to the _Pattern along Path_ extension except that the pattern is not deformed.

![Scatter example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Scatter.png)

Copies of the single yellow star are placed along a path. The star is not deformed as it is stamped along the path.

Most of the options are the same as for the _Pattern along Path_ extension. Those that are different are:

*   **Follow path orientation: ** The pattern is rotated and to follow the path such that all points with the same horizontal (_x_) position in the pattern will be on the same normal to the path, and all points with the same vertical (_y_) position in the pattern will be placed the same distance from the path. If the _Pattern is vertical_ box is checked, then the pattern is rotated 90 degrees first.
    
*   **Stretch spaces to fit skeleton length: ** Space is added between pattern copies so they fill evenly the skeleton path.
    
*   **Original pattern will be: ** _Moved_: Original pattern is copied, then deleted. _Copied_: Original pattern is copied and remains in place. _Cloned_: Original pattern is cloned, If the original pattern is modified, all patterns along the path will also be modified.

### Voronoi

_New in v0.48._

Draws [Voronoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) diagrams. The line segments are derived by distributing sites (points) semi-randomly in an area and then constructing line segments where each point on the segment is equal distance to the two closest sites forming cells around each site.

To use this extension, select a path or object and then call up the extension. There are two settings:

*   **Average size of cell (px): ** The average cell size (height and width).
    
*   **Size of Border (px): ** A positive number greater than the _Average size of cell_ results in a pattern that can be tiled smoothly. A negative number removes sites near the edge resulting in larger cells near the border.
    

After applying this extension, you will have a _[Pattern](#Attributes-Patterns "Patterns")_ that is applied to the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ of the object that was selected. The _Pattern_ can be shifted, scaled, and rotated like any other _Pattern_. It can also be applied to other objects through the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ tab of the _[Fill and Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ dialog.

JessyInk (Presentations)
------------------------

_New in v0.48._

The _JessyInk_ package of extensions allows one to use Inkscape to produce a sophisticated web-based presentation, complete with master slides, automatic page numbering, transitions between slides and within slides, and page zooming. _JessyInk_ works by embedding [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") into your _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. The [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") then manipulates Inkscape _[Layers]_ to run the presentation. Perhaps the best way to see what _JessyInk_ can do is to run the demonstration that can be found in the _Featured downloads_ section on the JessyInk Home Page.

To use _JessyInk_ you first need to add the _JessyInk_ [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") code to your _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. This is done by calling up the _Install/Update..._ dialog and clicking on the _Apply_ button. The code can be removed by using the _Uninstall/remove_ dialog.

Once the code is installed, each _[Layer]_ becomes a slide in the presentation. The order of the _[Layers]_ in the drawing corresponds to the order of the slides in the presentation. One slide can be designated as the _Master slide_ which will be displayed as background to all the other slides.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Tip

Keep the _[Layer]_ dialog open while working. Slides can be easily added or moved around in order with the dialog. It helps to give the slides meaningful names.

Keep a web browser open while working. Not only can you easily check your work but you can get an overview of your presentation by using the _Index_ mode (toggled on/off by **Ctrl**+**i**).

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

### Master Slide

To create a master slide, first create a layer with all the objects you wish to appear on all slides. Give the slide a name using the _[Layer]_ dialog (“Master Slide” is a good choice). Then call up the _Master Slide_ dialog via the _Master Slide..._ menu entry. Enter the slide name and click the _Apply_ button. It is a good idea to lock the slide by clicking on the ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/status/object-locked.png) icon in the _[Layers]_ dialog next to the slide name.

You can add a few special _Auto-texts_ to the _Master Slide_. The most useful is the _Slide number_ which will automatically display the correct slide number on each slide. You can also display the total number of slides (excluding the _Master Slide_ and the title (_[Layer]_) name of each slide.

To add _Auto-text_, put dummy text on the _Master Slide_ where you want the _Auto-text_ to be located. The _Auto-text_ will be displayed with the style of the dummy text. Select the dummy text and then on the _Auto-texts_ dialog select the desired type and hit the _Apply_ button. You will not see any change to the text in Inkscape but when viewing the presentation in a Web browser, the correct _Auto-text_ will be displayed.

![JessyInk Master Slide.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_JessyInk_MasterSlide.png)

An example of a JessyInk master slide showing a title that will be displayed on all pages as well as examples of _Auto text_. “Slide Title” will be replaced by the _[Layer]_ name of each slide. It is center justified. “#/#” is composed of three separate texts. The first '#' will be replaced by the page number. It is right justified so that page numbers 10 or greater will not overlap with the slash. The second '#' will be replaced by the total number of pages. It is left justified.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

### Transitions

Transitions between slides can be added with the _Transitions_ dialog. Each slide can have a transition before (_in_) and after (_out_) its display. A default transition type can be assigned to the _Master Slide_ which will then be used by all slides that don't have an explicit transition assigned to them.

There are three types of transitions: _appear_, where the slide appears instantly; _fade_, where the slide fades in or out; and _pop_ where the slide fades in or out and grows or shrinks. The transition time for _fade_ and _pop_ can be set in the dialog.

To set a transition effect, call up the _Transition_ dialog and the enter the _[Layer]_ name that you which the transition to apply to. Select the transition type and click the _Apply_ button. No visible change will be seen in Inkscape.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

Check whether the computer you plan on using for a presentation is powerful enough to handle the fancier transitions. They can eat up a lot of CPU, especially if using large _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_ images or _[Gradients](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_ and _[Filters]( "Chapter 17. Filter Effects—Custom")_.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

### Effects

Effects are similar to transitions, except they apply to things on the same slide. For example, you can have a series of bullet points that appear one at a time. The same types of effects as for transitions are available: _appear_, _fade_, and _pop_. The order in which different effects are applied during a presentation is determined by the _Order_ parameter. Effects with the same order number will appear at the same time.

To add an effect, select an object or a _[Group]_ and then call up the _Effects_ dialog. Select the type of effect and specify an _order_. Finally, click on the _Apply_ button. Again, no visible change will be seen in Inkscape.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Tip

Think carefully about using effects. Overuse may prove distracting and annoying to your audience. Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should.

### Views

Views are away to zoom in and out to part of a slide. Rotation is also possible. Views can be mixed with effects. The order is determined by the _Order_ parameter.

To set a view, add a _[Rectangle]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ to a slide. Removing the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ and adding a light color _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ allows viewing the rest of the slide easily. With the _[Rectangle]( "Rectangles and Squares")_ selected, call up the _View_ dialog, set the _Order_ parameter and click _Apply_.

### Presenting

Once the presentation is finished, it can be opened in any browser that supports _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_. The first slide will automatically be displayed. By default use the **Right Arrow** or **Page Down** keys to advance through the presentation. The **Left Arrow** and **Page Up** keys can be used to go in reverse. The **Down** and **Up** keys can be used to navigate without running effects.

There are a few special features available during presentations:

*   **Index Sheet: ** An _Index Sheet_ that shows miniatures of nine slides, with the active slide highlighted, can be called up with the **i** key. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the slides. Pressing the **i** again will return to the presentation at the entrance of the highlighted slide. This allows quick navigation through a presentation.

### Add Nodes

Adds nodes to a path, leaving the shape of the path unchanged. The nodes are added evenly spaced. The number of nodes is either specified or by setting a minimum specified spacing. Good for creating scissor lines.

Convert regular shapes to paths before applying.

![Add node example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_AddNode.png)

Example of using Add Node. Top: A Bezier curve defined by three nodes. Middle: Same curve after using _Add Node_. Bottom: Curve converted to cut line.

### Color Markers to Match Stroke

Automates changing the _[Markers](#Attributes-Stroke-Markers "Markers")_ to match the color of the _[Stroke]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_. The extension makes copies of a _Markers_ in the _[<defs>]_ section of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file with the appropriate color. This extension is a temporary work-around until the _SVG_ 1.2 standard is finalized. The new standard is expected to simplify matching _Marker_ color with _Stroke_ color.

### Edge 3D

Adds highlights and shadows to simulate 3D objects like buttons. The extension works by adding paths that are blurred via the _[Gaussian Blur](#Filters-GaussianBlur "Gaussian Blur")_ filter and then clipped. The paths have partial transparency, with white for highlights and black for shadows. The extension only works on paths so regular shapes need to be converted first. You may also need to add additional nodes.

Parameters:

*   _Illumination Angle_: Sets the angle from which light arrives.
*   _Shades_: Sets the number of different gray levels. The path is broken up into sections according to the relative angles of the nodes. A shading path is generated for each level. You must have a least as many nodes in the original path as shades.
*   _Only black and white_: If checked, only the lightest (white) and darkest (black) parts are generated.
*   _Stroke width_: Not used (fixed internally at 10).
*   _Blur stdDeviation_: Sets the blur radius for the _Gaussian Blur_ filter in pixel units.
*   _Blur width_, _Blur height_: Sets the width and height of the [Filter Effects Region](#Filters-EffectsRegion), the area where the blur is calculated. These parameters are not very useful (you cannot set the _x_ and _y_ terms). Leave both set at 2.0.

![Edge 3D example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Edge3D.png)

Example of using Edge 3D. Both square and circle were converted to paths. The _[Add Node](#Extensions-AddNodes "Add Nodes")_ extension was used to add nodes to the circle. The number of _Shades_ is 2 for the square and 4 for the circle.

### Envelope

Distorts a path so that the path's original _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ is mapped to the edges of a quadrilateral. To use the extension, select the path to transform first, then add the quadrilateral path to the selection. Regular shape objects must be converted to a path before transformation.

![Envelop example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Envelope.png)

Left: Original path. Right: Path after mapping _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ to quadrilateral.

The extension works on a single path. The beginning point of the quadrilateral path will determine the orientation of the transformed image. If the image is inverted (like looking through a mirror), reverse the direction of the quadrilateral path with the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-reverse.png)Reverse (****Shift**+**R****) command.

This extension could be used to produce a pseudo-perspective extension. For real perspective, use the _[Perspective](#Extensions-Perspective "Perspective")_ extension.

### Flatten Bezier

This extension converts selected _[Bezier](#Paths-Bezier "The Bezier (Pen) Tool")_ curves to an approximation composed of straight-line paths. The number of line segments used is determined by the _Flatness_ parameter. The smaller the _Flatness_, the more line segments are used.

![Flatten Bezier example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_FlattenBezier.png)

Example of using Flatten Bezier. Top: A Bezier curve defined by three nodes. Middle: After using extension with Flatness of 10. Bottom: After using extension with Flatness of 2.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

### Fractalize

This extension turns a straight-line segment into a crooked segment. It works by finding the midpoint of the line segment, adding a node at that point, and then moving the node a random distance perpendicular to the original path direction. This division routine is called recursively depending on the setting of the _Subdivisions_ entry in the dialog, doubling the number of resulting segments for each increase by one. The _Smoothness_ of the path can also be specified. The magnitude of the perpendicular displacement is a random function with the limits determined by _ (Segment length)/(1 + Smoothness)_.

The extension will also work on a curved path by turning the path into a series of line segments between the path's nodes.

![Fractalize example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Fractalize.png)

Example of using Fractalize. From top to bottom, the _Subdivision_ parameter was increased from 1 to 5. The _Smoothness_ parameter was set to 10.

### Interpolate Attribute in a Group

This extension takes the objects in a _[Group]_ or a selection and assigns a value to some attribute of each object, interpolating between two extremes to determine the value. Note that the order of the objects in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file determines the order in which the interpolated attributes are assigned. Options include interpolating color, width, height, scale, and position.

![Interpolate Attribute In A Group example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_InterpolateAttributeInAGroup.png)

Example of using the Interpolate Attribute In A Group extension to interpolate color. There are two groups of five squares. The following parameter values were used: _Attribute to Interpolate_: _Fill_, _Where to apply?_: _Style_, _Start Value_: _#ff0000_, _End Value_: _#000000_, _Unit_: _Color_. The difference between the top row and bottom row is the order in which the squares are included in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file.

![Interpolate Attribute In A Group example 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_InterpolateAttributeInAGroup2.png)

Example of using the Interpolate Attribute In A Group extension to interpolate width and scale. There are two groups of five squares. The following parameter values were used: Top: _Attribute to Interpolate_: _Width_, _Start Value_: _10_, _End Value_: _40_, _Unit_: _No Unit_. Bottom _Attribute to Interpolate_: _Scale_, _Start Value_: _0.5_, _End Value_: _1.5_, _Unit_: _No Unit_. In the last case, the _x_ and _y_ positions are scaled as a side effect.

### Jitter Nodes

Randomly shift nodes and/or node handles. The _Maximum displacement_ parameter controls the magnitude of the randomization. When the _Use normal distribution_ box is not checked, the magnitude of displacements will be uniformly distributed between zero and the _Maximum displacement_ value (in pixels). When the box is checked, the magnitudes of the displacements will have a _Normal_ (a.k.a. Gaussian or Bell curve) distribution with a standard deviation of 0.5 times the _Maximum displacement_ value. The Normal distribution option may produce more natural-looking variations in a path. In both cases, the direction of the displacement will be random.

![Jitter nodes example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_JitterNodes.png)

Top: Array of stars created with the _[Create Tiled Clones]( "Chapter 19. Tiling")_ dialog. Bottom: Same array after applying the _Jitter nodes_ extension. Note that the stars must be converted to paths before the extension is applied.

### Perspective

Distorts a path (or a _[Group]_ of paths) so that the path's original _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ is mapped to the edges of a quadrilateral and a perspective extension is applied to the path. To use the extension, select the path to transform first, then select the quadrilateral. Regular shapes and text must be converted to a path before transformation. This extension requires the [_Numpy_](http://numpy.scipy.org/) (Numerical Python) package.

The beginning point of the quadrilateral path will determine the orientation of the transformed image; in most cases, the quadrilateral path should be started from the lower-left corner and proceed in a clockwise direction. The **Tab** key will cycle through the nodes in order when the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ is in use. If no node is selected, then the starting node will be highlighted on the first use of the **Tab** key. To change the starting node, break the path at the desired start node (v0.47) or one node before (v0.48) (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-break.png)) and then rejoin (  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/node-join.png)). To reverse a path, use the Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-reverse.png)Reverse (****Shift**+**R****) command.

![Perspective example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Perspective.png)

Left: Original path. Middle: Target quadrilateral. The nodes have been numbered to show the normal order in which they should be drawn. Right: Path after mapping _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ to quadrilateral.

![Perspective example 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Perspective2.png)

Mapping text to the sides of a block with perspective. The text must be converted to a path. In order to center the text, the text has been grouped with a rectangle (also converted to a path).

### Pixelsnap

_New in v0.48._

Adjusts paths and rectangles to the pixel grid so that when exported as a bitmap, the lines are sharp. Filled objects are adjusted so that their edges are aligned with pixel boundaries. Paths are first adjusted to have an integer pixel width, and then adjusted so the stroke edges align with the boundaries.

![Pixelsnap example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Pixelsnap.png)

Left: A rectangle and a path, misaligned with the pixel grid. Right: The same rectangle and path after applying the Pixelsnap extension. Both rectangles and paths are 20 pixels wide by 20 pixels high.

### Rubber Stretch

Distorts a path as if the path was stretched vertically or the path was squeezed horizontally. The amount of the distortion is controlled by the _Strength_ and _Curve_ parameters. Adding extra nodes may produce a better result.

![Rubber stretch example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_RubberStretch.png)

From left to right: Input path (with extra nodes added). After applying the extension with parameters values for _Strength_ and _Curve_ of 50%, 0%; 0%, 50%; and 25%, 25%, respectively.

### Straighten Segments

Reduces the curvatures of path segments. The amount of straightening can be specified. A _Behavior_ value of 1 moves the node handles toward the nodes, a value of 2 moves the node handles to a point one-third of the distance between the node and the neighboring node. There is little visual difference between these two options.

![Segment straightener example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Straighten.png)

From top to bottom, a path with the _Straighten Segment_ extension applied 0, 1, 2, and 3 times.

### Whirl

This extension twists an object around a point, like what might happen if you dropped things in whirling water (except the farther away from the center, the greater the displacement for this extension). The amount of “whirling” is an input parameter. Objects must be converted to paths before applying the extension.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Tip

The center of view is used for the center of the whirl. To whirl around the center of an object, select the object and then use View → Zoom → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/zoom-fit-selection.png)Selection (****3****) to center the view on the object.

![Whirl example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Whirl.png)

From left to right, top to bottom: Whirl of 0, 1, 10, and 25 units. In each case, the center of the whirl is the center of each array of small squares.

Raster
------

This group of extensions manipulates the colors of a _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_. They are handy if you need to make a quick change to a _bitmap_ and don't need the power of a full-blown _bitmap_ editor like Gimp. The extensions all depend on the [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) library. After an extension has been applied, the original bitmap, either externally referenced or internal, will be replaced by a modified internal _bitmap_.

Note that these extensions only work on a _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_. Some of the extensions can be duplicated by using _[Filters]( "Chapter 17. Filter Effects—Custom")_ which also work on all objects and don't permanently change the _bitmap_ file.

### 3D Polyhedrons

This extension generates 3D Polyhedrons. Selecting this extension pops up a dialog with three tabs. The first tab, _Model file_, controls the type of polyhedron that is specified in the _Object_ drop-down menu. If _Load From file_ is selected, the description in the file specified in the _Filename:_ entry box is used. In the _Object Type_ tab you can specify if the source file describes the object with edges or faces.

![3D Polyhedron example 1.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_3DPolyhedron1.png)

Examples of a few of the available shapes. Top row: Cube, Truncated Cube, Snub Cube. Bottom row: Tetrahedron, Truncated Tetrahedron, Dodecahedron. In all cases, the view was set to a 30  rotation around the _x_\-axis followed by a 30  rotation around the _y_\-axis. The style was set to show faces.

The second tab, _View_, allows you to rotate the polyhedron. Up to six rotations are allowed (for the mathematicians: why six when any unique rotation can be specified by only three orthogonal rotations?).

![3D Polyhedron example 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_3DPolyhedron2.png)

Example of rotating a cube. Top row: No rotations. 30  rotation around _x_\-axis, 30  rotation around _y_\-axis. Bottom 30  rotation around _x_\-axis followed by 30  rotation around _y_\-axis, 30  rotation around _y_\-axis followed by 30  rotation around _x_\-axis, 30  rotation around _x_\-axis followed by 30  rotation around _y_\-axis followed by 30  rotation around _z_\-axis,

The third tab, _Style_, allows you to set all kinds of style parameters, including the _[Fill]( "Chapter 10. Attributes")_ color and _[opacity](#opacity "opacity")_. One can also specify if the faces of the polyhedron should be shaded to simulate light striking the object. One can specify the direction from which the light comes. One can specify if the nodes, edges, or faces should be drawn. And one can specify if the “hidden” faces should be drawn (useful if the faces are not fully opaque).

In the pop-up window, enter the _x_ and _y_ ranges. Checking the _Multiply x-range by 2π_ box changes the _x_\-axis to represent units of 2π, useful for plotting periodic functions. You can either have the routine calculate the first derivative of the function numerically or supply the first derivative yourself.

The function is plotted in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ coordinate system, which has the _y_\-axis upside down. The extension inserts a minus sign automatically to correct for this.

All Python math functions are allowed (as long as they return a single value), including Python random number functions. The _Help Tab_ has a list of some of the available functions.

![Function example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Function.png)

From top to bottom: −sin(_x_) with four periods. sin(_x_) with eight periods. sin(_x_)/(_x_ + 0.000001) with four periods; the first point has been deleted as the first derivative estimate is off. _x_ - floor(_x_) with one period. The gray boxes show the location and size of the original rectangles.

When the _Use polar coordinates_ option is selected, the _x_\-range is set to −1 at the left of the rectangle and +1 at the right side. The _x_ values entered in the extension's dialog are used for the angle _domain_ (in radians). The _Isotropic scaling_ parameter is ignored. _Calculate first derivative numerically_ must also be selected.

![Function example with Polar coordinates.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Function_Polar.png)

From left to right, all with _Multiply x-range by 2\*pi_ selected and _y_ range from −1.0 to 1.0: exp(−0.185\*_x_), logarithmic spiral, found often in nature, _x_ range from -5 to 0. sin(5\*_x_) with range from 0 to 1. sin(4.0/5.0\*x), range from 0 to 5. 1+0.2\*sin(3\*_x_)\*sin(100.0/7.0\*_x_), _x_ range from 0 to 7. The gray boxes show the location and size of the original rectangles.

Note that depending on the version, Python may return an integer if you divide two integers: thus, 4/5 = 0, while 4.0/5.0 = 0.8.

### Gear

Draw a realistic mechanical [gear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear). Three parameters must be given: the _Number of teeth_, the _Circular pitch_ (the tangential distance between successive teeth), and the _Pressure angle_. Common values for _Pressure angle_ are: 14.5, 20, and 25 degrees. The radius of the “Pitch Circle” is equal to N   P/2π, where “N” is the number of teeth and “P” is the Circular Pitch.

The gear is created around the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ origin and then placed inside a _[Group]_. The _Group_ is then translated so that the center of the gear is at the center of the visible canvas. This makes animating the gear easier as the rotation is then independent of the displacement. An animated clock using these gears can be found on the book's [website](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/).

![Gear example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Gear.png)

A gear with 24 teeth. The Pitch Circle is shown in blue. The _Circular pitch_ is the distance along the Pitch Circle between the two dotted lines. “R” is the radius of the Pitch Circle.

### Guides Creator

This extension creates _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_ based on the _[Page](#page)_ size. One can choose between three _Preset_ options. The first option, _Custom..._, allows one to create evenly spaced _Guide Lines_ with the spacing defined by the _Vertical guide each_ and _Horizontal guide each_ menus. The next _Preset_ option, _Golden Ratio_, places _Guide Lines_ so that the ratios horizontally or vertically from the _Guide Lines_ to the edges of the page are in proportion to the [_Golden Ratio_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) (approximately 1 to 1.62). The last _Preset_ option, _Rule-of-third_, divides the _[Page](#page)_ horizontally and vertically into three equal parts. This is equivalent to using the _Custom..._ option with a value of _1/3_.

Enabling the _Start from edges_ option will result in _Guide Lines_ also being created along the _[Page](#page)_ edges.

![Guides Creator example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_GuidesCreator.png)

### LaTeX Formula

This extension turns a _[LaTeX](#latex "LaTeX")_ string into a path. The string is typed into a dialog box. The extension requires that Ghostscript, _LaTeX_, and Pstoedit to be installed and in the execution path. Pstoedit must include the GNU libplot _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ driver or the shareware _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ plug-in, available for Windows at the [Pstoedit](http://www.pstoedit.com/) website. The resulting formula is rendered as a path.

### Perfect-Bound Cover Template

This extension produces a template for a _Perfect-Bound Cover_ as found in _Print On Demand_ services. The template sets the document to the correct size and creates guides for the front cover, back cover, and spine of the book, including the specified bleed. The dialog allows for specifying a variety of parameters including the number of pages in the book and the thickness of each page. The extension is biased toward English measurements.

### Spirograph

Draw a [Spirograph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph); that is, an epitrochoid or hypotrochoid curve. Several parameters need to be given: “R”, the _Ring Radius_; “r”, the _Gear Radius_; and “d”, the _Pen Radius_. In addition, one must choose if the _Gear_ travels _Inside_ or _Outside_ the _Ring_. One can also set the _Rotation_ angle (the angle of the starting point relative to the center) and the _Quality_ (roughly, the number of nodes per loop).

![Spirograph example 1.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Spirograph_1.png)

A Spirograph drawing (Epitrochoid). R = 48, r = 36, d = 30.

![Spirograph example 2.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Spirograph_2.png)

A Spirograph drawing (Hypotrochoid). R = 120, r = 36, d = 30.

The ratio of “r” to “R” determines the structure of the curve. Take, for example, an “r” of 36 and an “R” of 48. The ratio reduced to its simplest form is 3/4. This indicates that the _Gear_ will make a total of four “loops” as it circles the _Ring_ three times. Simple ratios make simple curves. If you use an _Even-odd_ _[fill rule](#Attributes-Fill-Rule "Fill Rule")_, the center of the figure will be unfilled if the denominator is even.

Unlike the case with a real _Spirograph_ that utilizes plastic gears, it is possible to specify values of “r” and “R” that don't form a [_rational number_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_numbers) ratio. In this case, the curve never closes on itself and is of infinite length. To avoid such infinities, the extension limits the number of nodes to 1000. If the numerator or denominator of the ratio in the simplest form is a large integer, the _Spirograph_ may run out of nodes. In this case, decreasing the _Quality_ may help.

![Spirograph example 3.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Spirograph_3.png)

Spirographs (Epitrochoids). R = 48 for all. From left to right, top to bottom: r = 24, 32, 36, 40, 42, and 44; giving ratios of r/R of 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8, and 11/12, respectively. In all cases d = r − 6.

Also, unlike a “real” Spirograph, the Spirograph extension allows “d” to be greater than “r”. This results in small loops along the _Ring_.

![Spirograph example 4.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/EFFECTS/Effects_Spirograph_4.png)

Spirographs with d < r (left) and d > r (right).

Text
----

This group of extensions manipulates text. One extension creates a visual representation of Braille text. Another extension, Lorem Ipsum, creates nonsense text. This is useful for mock layouts of text. A third extension does text substitution. Then there is a group of extensions that manipulate case. These are very similar and are treated together.

This extension creates an accurate visual representation of Braille text useful for illustrations. Braille glyphs are substituted for the Latin characters. Note: you must have a font that has _[Unicode](#unicode "Unicode")_ Braille glyphs installed on your system (e.g. Deja Vu Sans). Windows users may need to explicitly select that font.

### Split Text

_New in v0.48._

Normally when text is typed into Inkscape, the text is stored in one _<text>_ object with individual lines or parts with different attributes stored in descendant _<tspan>s_. This extension splits a text object into lines, words, or individual letters, putting each line, word, or letter in its own _<text>_. This may make it easier to manipulate the parts.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Note

The use of this extension is normally not recommended. By splitting text into separate parts, the semantics of the text is lost. For example, it can no longer be selected as one unit in a web browser or indexed by search engines. _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ has been designed to allow text to be manipulated (e.g. individual letters or words having different styles) without losing the semantic value. It is better to rely on these _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ features than to break apart text. This is especially true now that the layout of text can be directly adjusted with the _[Text Tool]( "Chapter 9. Text")_\-_[Tool Controls](#toolcontrols)_.

A dialog allows many options to be set, including _Measurement Type_ (added in v0.48), _Font size_, _Offset_ (the distance the text is moved away from the path), _Precision_ (number of decimal places shown), _Scale Factor_, and _Length Unit_. In calculating the area, open paths are closed and area is added using an even-odd fill rule. (The area of a donut is the area of the outer circle minus the area of the inner circle if the inner sub-path is in the opposite direction of the outer sub-path; otherwise it is the sum of the two areas.)

(It is also an example of how to access the path data in an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file for writing your own extension.) The original path is turned into a path with no stroke but with dot markers. The dots are then numbered.

The size of the numbers and the size of the dot markers can be specified.

This category of extensions is useful for preparing _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ drawings for use on the Web. There are two submenus. The first is for adding _[JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript")_ controls that enable events on one object to change other objects. The second is for cutting an image into multiple parts for use on web pages with the help of _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_.

This submenu has two entries. The first allows events linked to one object (mouse over, clicking on, etc.) to control the attributes of another object. The second allows events linked to one object to transmit that object's attributes to another. These extensions embed [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") into the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. The [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") comes from the _InkWeb_ package. To function, the code requires a [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript")\-enabled browser (native support in Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, and Internet Explorer 9, support via plug-in for older versions of Internet Explorer).

#### Set Attributes

This extension creates the JavaScript so that an action (clicking on, mouse passing over, etc.) with one object changes the attributes of another object. The list of attributes to change is entered, separated by spaces, in the _Attribute to set_ entry box (e.g., fill stroke stroke-width). The action that will cause the change is set in the _When the set must be done?_ drop-down menu. The list of new values is entered, separated by spaces, in the _Value to set_ entry box. The list of values must match the _Attributes to set_ line (e.g., green black 2px). The next option specifies if this action should come before, after, or replace any previously defined actions. The final option determines, in the case where more than two objects are selected, if the first selected object controls all the other selected objects or if the last selected object is controlled by actions on all the other selected objects.

### Web Slicer

_New in v0.48._

This extension facilitates slicing a drawing into rectangular bitmaps for use in Web pages. It will optionally export _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ and _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ code for use with the bitmaps.

There are two steps in using this extension. First, the _Create a slicer rectangle_ dialog is used to define a set of named rectangles for the areas that are to be exported. Each rectangle can specify a different target format (_[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_, _[JPEG](#jpeg "Joint Photographic Experts Group")_, or _[GIF](#gif "Graphics Interchange Format")_) and optionally, a background color. The rectangles are stored in a separate _[Layer]_ named _Web Slicer_. After defining the rectangles, the rectangle regions are exported using the _Export layout pieces and HTML+CSS code_ dialog. A third dialog can be used to add attributes in the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

#### Create a rectangle dialog

The dialog consists of a number of entry boxes for specifying export rectangles. Note that the placement of the rectangle is not defined in this dialog. After clicking the _Apply_ button, a partially opaque rectangle will be created. You move and resize this rectangle to cover the area that should be exported.

*   **Name: ** Give a name to the export rectangle. The dialog can be used repeatedly with different names to define multiple export regions.
    
*   **Format: ** Specify the bitmap format. Different regions can have different formats.
    
*   **DPI: ** Resolution of bitmap.
    
*   **Force dimension: ** Specify the exact size of the bitmap (in pixels). If specified, the _DPI_ setting is overridden.
    
*   **Background color: ** Background color for region. This will not be displayed by Inkscape.
    

Three tabs allow additional parameters to be specified. Note that the _HTML_ tab specifies attributes that apply to the export rectangle.

#### Export layout pieces and HTML+CSS code dialog

This dialog allows you to specify where the output files should be stored and if _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ and _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ code should be produced. Note that the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ and _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ code is not intended to be the final product but instead allows you to quickly check the output and to generate code that can be pasted into other files. Clicking the _Apply_ button does the actual export.

#### Set a layout group dialog

This dialog allows you to set attributes that apply to the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ and _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ that apply to the group of bitmaps exported. At least one of the _Slicer_ rectangles must be selected in order to set these attributes.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Note

All of the attributes applied to the rectangles and _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ export are stored in <svg:desc> tags. These tags are not easy to edit via the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog. It may be easier to edit the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file in a text editor.

**The origins of _HTML5_**

The original plan of the W3C was that _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ would be phased out for _[XHTML](#xhtml "eXtensible HyperText Markup Language")_. While similar at first glance, _HTML_ and _XHTML_ differ in significant ways. _XHTML_, based on _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ (as is _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_), is more strict, every tag must be matched by a closing tag or be self-closing, it is case sensitive, it requires the use of _[Name Spaces](#name_spaces "name spaces")_. The advantages of this strictness includes: simpler parsers, the ability to “round-trip” _XHTML_ to and from different data formats using style sheets, the ability to add items from different specifications (e.g. _SVG_) or custom data structures, and most importantly, the greater likelihood that different browsers would render the content the same since non-compliant _XHTML_ files won't render at all. (In contrast, non-compliant _HTML_ will usually render, but each browser vendor handles the invalid content in different ways leading to non-consistent results.)

So with all the advantages of _XHTML_, what happened? Well, a certain browser vendor with a large market share did not get onboard. Instead they were content to let their terribly non-compliant browser stagnate, and when they did get the motivation to update it, they again ignored the _XHTML_ standard. Today, even with its own browser vendor urging its death, Internet Explorer 6 won't go away as too many intranet applications rely on the non-standard behavior.

With _XHTML_'s adoption blocked, a group of browser vendors got together to extend the _HTML_ 4 standard. The result of this work forms the basis of _[HTML5](#html5 "HyperText Markup Language, Version 5")_. Seeing the writing on the wall, the W3C joined the effort. While _HTML5_ is a great advance forward, much work has had to be done to crowbar in support for _SVG_ (and _[MathML](#mathml "MathML")_). And much work has had to be done (and is still being done) to define how browsers deal with non-compliant _HTML_ so that all browsers will render content the same.

_Updated for v0.48 and _HTML5_._

_[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ really comes into its own on the Web. The small compact file structure (when compressed and stripped of unneeded items) makes for quick downloads, yet its vector nature results in excellent rendering at any scale. But this is only the beginning. _SVG_ plays nicely with other web technologies: _SVG_ files can be embedded into web pages, they can contain hypertext links, and they can be can be scripted and animated. And now with _[HTML5](#html5 "HyperText Markup Language, Version 5")_, _SVG_ will be everywhere.

This chapter introduces _SVG_ use for the Web and covers the Inkscape features that help with this use. Inkscape has mostly been developed as a tool for artists and not for web graphics but it is still possible with a little work and knowledge to use Inkscape to create web graphics.

It is not the purpose of this book to cover web design. Only a minimal introduction to animation and scripting is presented. It only touches briefly on some of the tricks that may be needed to get _SVG_ files to work on all browsers. It is assumed that the reader has a working knowledge of _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_. The following sites are good references (although some of the information is a bit dated) for using _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ on the web: [SVG Primer](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/IG/resources/svgprimer.html) and [Carto:Net](http://www.carto.net/svg/samples/). For fun demonstations of the power of _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ go to the [SVG Wow](http://svg-wow.org/) site.

Support for _SVG_ has improved rapidly in Web browsers. Current versions of Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Chrome include almost complete support (Firefox doesn't handle _SVG_ fonts and Safari 5 doesn't handle filters). Internet Explorer 9 will offer almost full _SVG_ support (missing _SVG_ fonts, _[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_ animation, and filters). Options for users of older Internet Explorer browsers are discussed later.

The upcoming _[HTML5](#html5 "HyperText Markup Language, Version 5")_ (Hypertext Markup Language, version 5) specification allows “inline _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_”. _HTML5_ defines two different syntaxes: _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ and _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_. All major Web browsers will support _HTML_ syntax in the very near future. All major browsers except Internet Explorer (prior to version 9) already support inline _SVG_ with _XML_ syntax as well as in _[XHTML](#xhtml "eXtensible HyperText Markup Language")_ proper. The major difference between the _HTML_ and _XML_ syntaxes are that _HTML_ does not always require tags to be closed while _XML_ does, _HTML_ is not case sensitive while _XML_ is, and _[Name Spaces](#name_spaces "name spaces")_ are not allowed in _HTML_ (except for the _XHTML_, _[XLink](#xlink "XLink")_, _[MathML](#mathml "MathML")_, and _SVG_ _Name Spaces_ in special cases) while they are required in _XML_. Using closing tags and _Name Spaces_ is good practice so it is recommended that you write to the _XHTML_ syntax. You also need not strip Inkscape _SVG_ of the various items declared in Inkscape and other _Name Spaces_.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

SVG Is Case Sensitive

_[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ being based on _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ is case sensitive. For example, _viewbox_ is not the same as _viewBox_ (the latter is the correct attribute name). This may trip up people coming from an _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ background. Work is being done to determine how to handle case sensitivity in _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ markup.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Validate Your SVG and HTML

Validating your _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ and _[HTML5](#html5 "HyperText Markup Language, Version 5")_ ensures that it will be rendered as intended, especially if you create content by hand. The W3C offers an on-line validator service.

For an up-to-date list of which browsers support what, take a look at the [When can I use...](http://caniuse.com) website. Chrome is frequently updated (every six weeks!), Firefox, Opera, Safari less so, and, well you probably already know about Internet Explorer.

The sections in this chapter build on each other. The first section covers getting an _SVG_ to display on a web page (including options for older browsers). The second section covers how an _SVG_ is fitted into a web page. The third covers adding hyperlinks. The fourth section introduces the use of style sheets. The fifth section introduces animation. And a final section covers some features of Inkscape to help produce _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_s for the web.

A web page displaying the examples discussed here is available at the [book's website](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/). Several web pages for testing browser support of _SVG_ can also be found there.

Simple SVG Display
------------------

There are many different ways to display _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files in a web page. The simplest way is just to link to an _SVG_ file with the <a> tag. Web browsers that support _SVG_ will display the drawing by itself. To include _SVG_ content as part of a web page one can use one of the following options:

*   [<object>](#Web-Use-Object "The <object> Tag") tag.
*   [<embed>](#Web-Use-Embed "The <embed> Tag") tag.
*   [<iframe>](#Web-Use-Iframe "The <iframe> Tag") tag.
*   [<img>](#Web-Use-Img "The <img> Tag") tag.
*   [Inline _SVG_](#Web-Use-Inline "Inline SVG").
*   [_CSS_ background](#Web-Use-CSSBackground "CSS Background").

Each option will be treated in turn. A final section covers a few alternatives for [supporting _SVG_ on older browsers](#Web-Use-Old "Supporting Older Browsers").

### The <object> Tag

The <object> tag is the primary way to include an external _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. The main advantage of using this tag is that there is a natural mechanism for displaying a fallback in case the _SVG_ is not rendered. The tag requires defining a _data_ attribute which is the location of the _SVG_ file, normally a relative path. Defining the _type_ attribute is highly recommended as it allows browsers to avoid downloading content they do not support. For _SVG_ the type is "image/svg+xml". If the _SVG_ is not rendered, the browser will try to render the content between the opening <object> and closing </object> tags. A _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ version of the _SVG_ would normally be a good choice to put here.

![Simple square example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/WEB/web_square.png)

A simple _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ embedded via an <object> tag.

<!DOCTYPE html>     ➊
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">     ➋
  <head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8"/>     ➌

    <object type="image/svg+xml" data="web\_square.svg">     ➍
      <img src="web\_square.png" alt="Blue Square"/>     ➎
    </object>

  </body>
</html>
   

➊ _HTML_ declaration. With _HTML5_ no “dtd” is required.

➋ _HTML_ _Name Space_ declaration. Using the _XML_ syntax is specified here.

➌ The character encoding of the file, normally `UTF-8` for modern files.

➍ Inclusion of _SVG_ file via the object tag. The "image/svg+xml" is the _[MIME](#mime "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions")_ type of the included file.

➎ A _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ file to be displayed in case the browser fails to render the _SVG_.

There are a couple of known problems with using the <object> tag with Chrome 6 and Safari 5 (which share the same rendering engine). The first is that _SVG_s are displayed with a non-transparent background. The second is that the _SVG_s are often not scaled properly and are displayed with scroll bars. The transparency problem has already been fixed in Chrome 7. The scaling problem will likely also be fixed soon.

### The <embed> Tag

While the <embed> tag was never part of any _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ or _[XHTML](#xhtml "eXtensible HyperText Markup Language")_ specification, it is widely supported and used. For this reason it has been included in the _HTML5_ specification. It is intended for including content that needs an external plug-in to work. The Adobe plug-in requires the use of the <embed> tag and supporting this tag is the only real reason for its use with _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_. There is no fallback mechanism if the _SVG_ content is not displayed. Note that Chrome 8 and Safari 5 may require _width_ and _height_ attributes to avoid scroll bars. Safari 5 also incorrectly displays _SVG_s with non-transparent backgrounds.

Here is an example of using the <embed> tag. Only the _src_ attribute is required.

<embed src="web\_square.svg"/>

### The <iframe> Tag

The <iframe> tag, deprecated in _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ 4 and _[XHTML](#xhtml "eXtensible HyperText Markup Language")_, has resurfaced in _[HTML5](#html5 "HyperText Markup Language, Version 5")_ with the purpose of “sandboxing” content that might pose a security risk. There is no fallback if the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ content cannot be displayed. A _frame_ will be drawn around the _SVG_. It can be removed by setting the attribute _frameborder_ to 0 (note that this is not valid _HTML5_). The size of the frame can be set using the _width_ and _height_ attributes. If the size of the frame is too small to contain the _SVG_, scroll bars will be used. Safari 5 incorrectly displays _SVG_s with non-transparent backgrounds.

Here is an example of using the <iframe> tag. Only the _src_ attribute is required. Note that a separate closing tag is required and that _XHTML_ does not allow anything between the opening and closing tags.

<iframe src="web\_square.svg"></iframe>

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

### The <img> Tag

The <img> tag is used to embed images. Two attributes are required: the _src_ and the _alt_ attributes. The latter serves to describe the image in case the image cannot be rendered or viewed (i.e., to someone who is blind).

Here is an example of using the <iframe> tag. Note that the tag is self-closing.

<img src="web\_square.svg" alt="Blue Square"/>
   

There are two reasons not to use the <img> tag with _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_s. The first is that there is no fallback mechanism if the browser cannot render the image. The second is an _SVG_ rendered this way is not allowed to run any scripts or have any interaction (e.g. links). One advantage of using this tag is that Safari 5 will handle transparency properly. Another is that it can be used inside an _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ `<a>` object where the other tags will cause the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ to “swallow” mouse clicks.

### Inline SVG

_[HTML5](#html5 "HyperText Markup Language, Version 5")_ brings with it the possibility to use _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ by directly including the _SVG_ in the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ file. One could already do this in _[XHTML](#xhtml "eXtensible HyperText Markup Language")_ by using _[Name Spaces](#name_spaces "name spaces")_. There are a few things to note:

*   To include _SVG_ using _HTML_ syntax you must use a browser with an _HTML5_ parser. So far only Firefox 4 and Internet Explorer 9 have _HTML5_ parsers. Note that _Name Spaces_ are not allowed with _HTML_ syntax (except the _XHTML_, _[XLink](#xlink "XLink")_, _[MathML](#mathml "MathML")_, and _SVG_ _Name Spaces_). Any Inkscape, Sodipodi, or other _Name Space_ declarations need to be removed.
*   All the major web browsers except Internet Explorer already support _SVG_ with _XML_ syntax (as well as in _XHTML_).
*   An _HTML5_ file normally ends with `.html` when using _HTML_ syntax and `.xhtml` or `.xml`; when using _XML_ syntax.

Here is an example of inlining _SVG_. The file uses _XHTML_ syntax but will also work for _HTML5_. Note that the two _Name Space_ declarations are optional with _HTML5_ syntax. The _SVG_ has been stripped of all unnecessary parts such as items in the Inkscape _Name Space_.

<!DOCTYPE html>     ➊
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">     ➋
  <head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8"/>     ➌
    <title>SVG Inlined</title>

  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>An SVG rectangle inlined</h1>

➊ _HTML_ declaration. (No “dtd” is required.)

➋ _XHTML_ _Name Space_ declaration. Required for _XHTML_, optional for _HTML5_. (Note: the name space declaration is identical for both _HTML5_ and _XHTML_.)

➌ The character encoding of the file, normally “UFF-8” for modern files. Not absolutely required but highly recommended.

➍ Start of _SVG_.

➎ Required for _XHTML_, optional for _HTML5_.

### CSS Background

It is possible to use an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ as a _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ background. One problem is to provide a fallback, necessary for Firefox 3.6 and older as well as Internet Explorer 8 and older. You could display both a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ and an _SVG_ on top. If the _SVG_ has a transparent background, though, the _PNG_ can leak through (a problem at least with Opera when the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ is zoomed). Also, Internet Explorer won't fallback properly. A solution is to use two `background-image` lines; Internet Explorer won't recognize the `none` in the second line, resorting to using the first.

body {
  background-image: url('background.png');
  background-image: none, url('background.svg'), url('background.png');
  background-size: 100% 100%;
}

### Supporting Older Browsers

The first step in supporting older browsers is to decide which browsers and which versions of those browsers you need to support. We can divide browsers into two classes: Internet Explorer and everybody else. Internet Explorer prior to version 9 does not natively support _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ nor does it support _[XHTML](#xhtml "eXtensible HyperText Markup Language")_. All current or reasonably recent versions of all other major browsers do support _SVG_ and _XHTML_ although they may not support all of the _SVG_ standard (most noticeably is the lack of filter support in Safari 5). So the main question is how to support _SVG_ in Internet Explorer? This issue is not unlikely to disappear soon as Internet Explorer users are less likely to upgrade than users of other browsers and in some cases they can't upgrade since they use Windows XP which will not run Internet Explorer 9, or they are using web applications that rely on non-standard features of Internet Explorer 6.

At the moment, the best way to include _SVG_ content in a web page is to use the <object> tag with a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ fallback. This is a simple method that will automatically take care of support for older versions of Internet Explorer. If you need to use a pure _SVG_ solution, then you need to rely on plug-ins to support Internet Explorer. There are a number of plug-ins that can be used:

*   The [Adobe plug-in](http://www.adobe.com/svg/main.html). This plug-in is no longer supported but can still be downloaded. (Adobe lost interest in _SVG_ after buying Flash.) It offers fairly complete _SVG_ support but it may be difficult to get the plug-in to work. It requires the use of the <embed> tag.
*   The [Google Chrome Frame](http://www.google.com/chromeframe) plug-in. This plug-in replaces the renderer in Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8 with the renderer used in Chrome. The plug-in is triggered by including the line: `<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="chrome=1">` in the <head> section of the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ file. If Google Frame is installed, the page will be rendered by the plug-in, otherwise it will be rendered by the normal Internet Explorer renderer. This is a fairly unintrusive way of including the use of a plug-in.
*   The [svgweb](http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/)  [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") library uses the Flash plug-in to render _SVG_ content. Since most users of Internet Explorer already have Flash installed this is a viable way to support _SVG_. It can also be used to support _SVG_ _[SMIL](#smil "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language")_ animation and _SVG_ fonts in browsers that don't support those parts of the _SVG_ standard. The modifications to the _HTML_ file are more invasive than that to use Chrome Frame.

Inlined _SVG_ is currently supported by all major browsers except Internet Explorer (before version 9) using _XML_ syntax in _HTML5_ and in _XHTML_ proper. Internet Explorer supports neither so a fallback solution for Internet Explorer must serve _HTML_ to Internet Explorer while serving _XHTML_ files to everyone else. Inlined _SVG_ in _HTML5_ using _HTML_ syntax requires browsers to have _HTML5_ parsers which at the moment only Firefox 4 and Internet Explorer 9 have. The [SVG Boilerplate](http://svgboilerplate.com/) project is developing ways to use _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ in older browsers, including inlined _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ in _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_.

And finally, if you are producing vector graphic content programatically, you can look into other means of delivering graphics to older Internet Explorer browsers such as using [Rapha l](http://raphaeljs.com/) which uses [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") to generate either _SVG_ or _[VML](#vml "Vector Markup Language")_ depending on the browser.

Positioning SVG
---------------

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Positioning and Sizing Subject to Change

This section is based on current browser behaviour and the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ specification. There is active discussion on changing the specification by the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standards group.

Now that you know how to get _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ to display in an _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ file, the next question is how does it get placed? The process is a bit convoluted and the results across browsers are not always the same. There are two steps. The first is to determine the _viewport_ or area allocated to the _SVG_ by the web page, the second is to determine how the _SVG_ fits into the viewport. For this discussion we will assume the _SVG_ is being inserted via the <object> tag.

Determining the area of the page that is allocated for the _SVG_ is a multistep process:

*   If the <object> tag has the _width_ or _height_ attribute defined in absolute units or in percent, this is the size of the viewport (if only one of _width_ or _height_ is defined, the other defaults to the same value).
*   If the <object> does not have fixed _width_ and _height_, then if the _SVG_ has fixed _width_ and/or _height_, the _SVG_ values determine the size of the viewport. The _SVG_ _width_ and _height_ attributes are set in the Inkscape _Document Properties_ dialog.
*   If the viewport is still not determined, then if the _SVG_ _width_ and _height_ are 100%, the viewport fills up the space available to the <object> tag. The meaning of percentage values less than 100% is unclear (browser differ). In Inkscape, you can only set the _SVG_ _width_ and _height_ to 100% by using the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog. The _viewBox_ (see below) attribute must be set first.

_SVG_ Width and Height

Think of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ _width_ and _height_ attributes as recommendations to the renderer about the size of the viewport if the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ doesn't define the size. They are _not(!)_ always the width and height of the drawing.

Now that the viewport is defined, how the _SVG_ is fitted inside that viewport must be determined. Again this is a several step process:

*   If the _SVG_ _viewBox_ attribute is defined, then the _viewBox_ (see below on how to set in Inkscape) is mapped to the viewport according to the value of the _SVG_ _preserveAspectRatio_ attribute. The default value of this attribute is _xMidYMid meet_ which means that the center of the viewBox is at the center of the viewport and that the SVG is scaled uniformly so that one pair of sides (top/bottom or left/right) of the viewBox coincide with the viewport while the other pair of sides is inside the viewport. See the figure below for the meaning of other possible values.
*   If there is no _viewBox_ attribute defined, then the _SVG_ is mapped so that the upper-left corner of the viewport corresponds to the (0, 0) coordinate of the _SVG_ (normally the upper-left corner). The _SVG_ is scaled so that one user unit (pixel) corresponds to one screen pixel. Scroll bars may be shown if the _SVG_ (as defined by the _width_ and _height_ attributes) is larger than the viewport.

![Viewport.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/WEB/Web_Viewport.png)

> This figure shows how an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file is placed in an _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ page using the <object> tag. The _SVG_ is nominally 150 px wide and 100 px tall. It contains a black rectangle with the same dimensions as the nominal size and with a 10 px wide stroke. A circle is placed in the center of the rectangle. A dashed rectangle surrounds the black rectangle. It is outside the nominal _SVG_ area. The inside of the gray rectangle marks the viewport (created by setting the _padding_ attribute of the <object> to 10 px).
> 
> From left to right: <object> _width_ and _height_ attributes set to 120, _SVG_ _width_ set to 150, _height_ set to 100, _viewBox_ undefined. <object> _width_ and _height_ attributes set to 120, _SVG_ _width_ and _height_ undefined (defaults to 100%), _viewBox_ set to 0, 0 150, 100. <object> _width_ and _height_ attributes not set, either _SVG_ _width_ set to 150, _height_ set to 100, or _viewBox_ set to 0, 0 150, 100.

![Aspect.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/WEB/Web_Aspect.png)

> This figure shows how an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file is placed depending on the _preserveAspectRatio_ attribute. One possible value, not shown, is _none_ in which case the _SVG_ is stretched to fit the viewport. The other possible values take the form: `xAYB C`, where A and B can have the values _Min_, _Mid_, or _Max_; and C can have the value _meet_ or _slice_. The values A and B determine which part of the viewport and _viewBox_ are aligned while the value of C determines if the image is scaled so that two edges of the _viewBox_ coincide with the viewport while the other two are inside (_meet_) or if two edges of the _viewBox_ coincide with the viewport while the other two are outside (_slice_).
> 
> The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ shown is the same as in the previous figure. From left to right: Top row: _xMinYMin meet_, _xMidYMin meet_, _xMaxYMin meet_. Bottom row: _xMinYMin slice_, _xMinYMid slice_, _xMinYMax slice_. Note, not all possible combinations are shown.

**To set the _viewBox_ attribute in Inkscape: ** Open the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog and select the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ root element (<svg:svg...>). In an Inkscape created file, the _width_ and _height_ attributes will have been defined while the _viewBox_ will not have been defined. If you open an _SVG_ file created by another application the _viewBox_ may be defined instead of or in addition to _width_ and _height_. If the _viewBox_ attribute is already defined, select it from the window on the right. You can then change the values. If it is not defined, click on the text entry box near the bottom of the window, in the same line as the _Set_ button. Type in “viewBox”. Then in the box below, type in four numbers separated by spaces, the _x_ and _y_ values of the upper-left corner (normally 0 and 0) and the _width_ and _height_. The values are in user units (pixels). Click on the _Set_ button or use **Ctrl**+**Enter** to register your values. Once the _viewBox_ is defined, you can modify the _width_ and _height_ attributes including deleting them or changing them to 100%. Modifying the _Width_ and _Height_ in the _Document Properties_ dialog will now modify the _viewBox_ if _width_ and _height_ attributes are not defined in fixed units, otherwise it will modify the _width_ and _height_ attributes as well as proportionally modify the _viewBox_ attribute.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Clipping by Viewport

An _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ is clipped by the viewport and not by the _viewBox_ or the _SVG_ _width_ and _height_ attributes. This means that objects outside the Inkscape “page” may be displayed in the _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ page under some circumstances.

Adding Links
------------

A link connects _resources_. In the traditional _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ framework, these resources would be things like web pages and images that have _[URL](#url "Universal Resource Locator")_s. The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ specification uses _[XLinks](#xlink "XLink")_, which are more powerful but also more complicated than the original _HTML_ links. We'll cover only the most simple use of _XLinks_ here and refer you to the _XLink_ specification from the [_W3C_](http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/) consortium for more details.

To add a link to an object, **Right-Mouse Click** on the object. Select _Add link_ from the pop-up menu. Although nothing will seem to have happened, this will put an <svg:a> wrapper around the object (viewable with the Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-xml-editor.png)XML Editor... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**X****) dialog).

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Note

The link wrapper <svg:a> acts as a group. To edit a wrapped object, you must double-click on the object to enter the wrapper. It is also possible to create a wrapper within a wrapper by accident. Pay attention to the _[Notification Region](#notification)_ or use the Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-xml-editor.png)XML Editor... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**X****) dialog to keep track of what level you are at.

The attributes of an object's links can be modified through the _Link attributes_ dialog that can be opened by selecting the _Link Properties_ entry from the menu that pops up from a second **Right-Mouse Click** on the object (this time, you are clicking on the wrapper).

![Link Dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_LinkAttributes.png)

The _Link attributes_ dialog.

To link an object to another web page, only the _Href_ attribute must be supplied. An example reference is "http://www.w3.org/" (without the quotes) which is a link to the [World Wide Web consortium](http://www.w3.org/).

![Linked square example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/WEB/web_square_link.png)

A simple _SVG_ with link.

The following listing shows an _SVG_ file with a link from the blue square. It can be directly displayed in a web browser or included via the <object> tag in an _HTML_ or _[XHTML](#xhtml "eXtensible HyperText Markup Language")_ file.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>

➊ The _[XLink](#xlink "XLink")_ name space declaration.

➋ Start of _XLink_ object with target of _XLink_.

➌ Source object of _XLink_.

Although the _Link attributes_ dialog contains many entries, only a few are of great use. A couple have only one allowed value.

Href

The location of the referenced object. Clicking on the object will go to the specified link.

Target

If there are multiple targets (frames) in the referenced object, this attribute specifies which to use.

Type

Specifies the type of link. Only the _simple_ link can be used in _SVG_.

Role

Specifies the role the resource is intended to have. Must be a valid _[URL](#url "Universal Resource Locator")_.

Arcrole

Further specifies the role the resource is intended to have. Must be a valid _[URL](#url "Universal Resource Locator")_.

Title

A human-readable description of the resource. Must be a character string. Browsers may show this as a _[tool tip](#tooltip "tool tip")_ when the mouse is over the object. (It is recommended to use the attribute _title_ instead.)

Show

Specifies how the resource linked to should be displayed. Valid values are: _new_ (open a new browser window), _replace_ (replace current browser content), and _embed_ (replace the content of the object). It appears that Firefox's behavior for _replace_ follows that expected for _embed_.

Actuate

Specifies if the resource linked to should be traversed immediately. Valid values are: 'onRequest' (require input, e.g., a mouse click, loading target resource).

Using Style Sheets
------------------

_[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ drawings can use _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ (Cascading Style Sheets) to control the presentation of the drawing objects. Support for style sheets is in its infancy in Inkscape. One can, however, do a few simple useful things. At the moment, Inkscape can handle only an internal style sheet. External style sheets cannot be used.

In the following example, a _CSS_ is used to change the opacity of the blue square whenever the mouse cursor passes over it (when the drawing is displayed in an _SVG_\-enabled browser).

![Styled square example.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/WEB/web_square_style.png)

A simple _SVG_ styled with _CSS_.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<svg
   xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
   xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
   version="1.1"
   width="150"
   height="150">
  <style type="text/css">     ➊
   rect:hover {fill-opacity:1.0}     ➋
  </style>
  <a xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/"
     style="fill-opacity:0.75">     ➌
    <rect
     width="90"
     height="90"
     x="30"
     y="30"
     style="fill:#0000ff;stroke:#000000"/>     ➍
  </a>
</svg>
  

➊ Style sheet start.

➋ Rectangle's hover (i.e., when the mouse cursor is above the rectangle) declaration.

➌ Rectangle's default opacity.

➍ Rectangle's style. Note that “fill-opacity” is not defined here. This allows the attribute to be overridden.

The style attribute can either be added through a text editor or with a bit of difficulty through the Inkscape _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-xml-editor.png)XML Editor... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**X****)) dialog. The _fill-opacity_ attribute must be moved from the rectangle and put into a wrapper of the rectangle (in this case the <a> tag).

Steps to add a _style sheet_ via the _XML Editor_ dialog:

1.  Open the _XMLEdit_ dialog.
    
2.  Select the top-level entry <svg:svg>.
    
3.  Click on _New element node_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/xml-element-new.png) icon.
    
4.  Enter “svg:style” into entry box; click _Create_ button.
    
5.  Drag new node above first <svg:g> (layer1).
    
6.  Select <svg:style> node.
    
7.  Enter “type” into _Attribute_ entry line (middle of dialog).
    
8.  Enter “text/css” into _Value_ entry area (bottom of dialog).
    
9.  Click _Set_ button.
    
10.  Click on _New text node_ ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/xml-text-new.png) icon.
    
11.  Enter: “rect:hover {fill-opacity:1.0;}” on right, with a carriage return before and after (which suppresses the quotes).
    
12.  Click on triangle to open <svg:g id="layer1"> node.
    
13.  Click on triangle to open <svg:a> node.
    
14.  Select rectangle, select style attribute, select “fill-opacity:0.75;” and cut (**Ctrl**+**X**).
    
15.  Select <svg:a> node, add “style” to _Attribute_ entry line, paste (**Ctrl**+**V**) "fill-opacity:0.75" into the _Value_ entry area.
    
16.  Save, but do NOT save as a plain _SVG_ file as this removes the “hover” attribute from the _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ style node. (Bug)

Adding JavaScript
-----------------

_[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ drawings can use [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") ([ECMAScript](#ecmascript "ECMAScript")) to do complex manipulation of the objects in the drawing. In this example, the style sheet of the last example is replaced by simple [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") calls. The _Object Properties_ dialog (Object → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/places/dialog-object-properties.png)Object Properties... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**O****)) can be used to add the calls.

To modify the previous example to use JavaScript, first remove the _style_ section (use the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog). Next, open the _Object Properties_ dialog. Select the square (make sure the square is selected and not the <a> wrapper, you can do this by first double-clicking the square and then clicking on it again). Then click on the triangle next to _Interactivity_ in the _Object Properties_ dialog to expose the JavaScript options. Add the following to _onmouseover_: **`setAttribute('fill-opacity','1.0')`** and the following to _onmouseout_: **`setAttribute('fill-opacity','0.75')`**. That's it! Do not save as _Plain SVG_ as the JavaScript commands will be (erroneously) stripped out. You can save it as _Optimized SVG_.

![Object Properties dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_ObjectProperties.png)

The _Object Properties_ dialog showing the [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") additions (as well as the _title_ and _desc_ attribute additions).

While the _Object Properties_ dialog is open we can fill the _title_ and _desc_ attributes. These attributes can be specified for any object in an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ document, including _[Groups]_. The _title_ attribute is intended to be used for a _[tool tip](#tooltip "tool tip")_. This is only implemented in some _SVG_ browsers like Opera. (Firefox 3.5 will put in the window title area the first _title_ found in the document). The _desc_ (Description) attribute is used to store a description of the object. It is not normally intended for display. One final touch is to change the _Id_ to a more descriptive name. You must click on the _Set_ button for changes to these attributes to take effect.

Simple Animation
----------------

The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ standard provides support for animating drawings both internally through animation elements and externally through scripts. This section will demonstrate a simple animation using [_ECMAscript_](http://www.ecma-international.org/) (a standard that JavaScript and JScript are dialects of). Although there are plans for supporting animation in Inkscape, at the moment there is no support. Adding animation requires editing the _SVG_ file with a text editor. Note that Inkscape added some limited support for scripts in v0.47 through the [_Set Attributes_ and _Transmit Attributes_] extensions.

In the following _SVG_ drawing, the blue square oscillates back and forth (in a supporting _SVG_ viewer). The square still changes opacity when the mouse is over it and it still contains a hypertext link.

Inkscape for the Web
--------------------

To be quite honest, making Inkscape convenient for creating _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_s for the web has been more of an afterthought. Having said that, many of the great _SVG_ examples on the web have started life as Inkscape drawings, as evidenced by tell-tail fingerprints left in the source. This section focuses on ways to prepare Inkscape _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_s for the web.

A number of items have already been covered in this chapter. This section covers cleaning up the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ source.

**Vacuuming. ** As a drawing is created, items like _[Gradients](#Attributes-Gradients "Gradients")_, _[Patterns](#Attributes-Patterns "Patterns")_, _[Markers](#Attributes-Stroke-Markers "Markers")_, and _[Filters]( "Chapter 17. Filter Effects—Custom")_ are stored in the <defs> section of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. If you later delete an object with, for example, a _Gradient_, the _Gradient_ is not deleted. The File →  ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/document-cleanup.png)Vacuum Defs command will remove unused items.

**Save as Plain _SVG_. ** Inkscape stores a lot of information in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file in the Sodipodi and Inkscape _[Name Spaces](#name_spaces "name spaces")_. The information is useful for editing the file with Inkscape but is not needed for display. It can be removed by choosing the _Plain SVG_ option in the drop-down menu in the _[Save As](#File-Export-Other "Exporting Other File Types")_ dialog. Note, that this may remove things you want to keep, like scripts.

**Save as Optimized _SVG_. ** Choosing _Optimized SVG_ in the drop-down menu in the _[Save As](#File-Export-Other "Exporting Other File Types")_ dialog will pop-up a dialog that allows you to customize the saved _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. This works by passing the file through the _Scour_ script. Here are the various options:

*   **Simplify colors. ** Convert all colors to #rrggbb format (or #rgb format if possible). Inkscape already uses this format by default, but if you import a file with say `fill="lightgoldenrodyellow"`, converting the color to `"#fafad2"` could save a few bytes.
    
*   **Style to xml. ** Converts _style_ attributes to _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ attributes, e.g. `style="fill:#ff0000"` to `fill="#ff0000"`. Some people argue that using _XML_ attributes is better practice. It will probably result in slightly larger files. If you plan on using _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ to style objects, don't enable this option. It, may, however be useful if you plan on using your drawing on a mobile phone as the _style_ attribute is not supported in the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ Tiny specification. Inkscape always uses _style_ attributes.
    
*   **Group collapsing. ** Removes _[Groups]_ if they don't have attributes or a <title> or <desc> children. Inkscape created files will not have these unless you have used the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_ dialog or the _Object Properties_ dialog to specifically add them.
    
*   **Enable id stripping. ** Removes `id` attributes. Inkscape assigns an id to all objects (e.g. `id="rect3045"`). These attributes are useful when an object is referenced by another (e.g. an object is cloned using the <use> tag) or in referring to an object in [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript"). Most `id`s are not referenced and can be removed.
    
*   **Embed rasters. ** Embeds externally referenced _[bitmap](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics")_ images such as _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_s.
    
*   **Keep editor data. ** Prevents removal of items in the Inkscape or Sodipodi _[Name Spaces](#name_spaces "name spaces")_ that are useful for editing with Inkscape (e.g., _[Grids](#Snapping-Grid "Grid")_ and _[Guide Lines](#Snapping-Guide "Guides")_).
    
*   **Enable viewboxing. ** If a _viewBox_ attribute is not present, creates one using the _width_ and _height_ attributes, and then sets both _width_ and _height_ attributes to 100%. This is useful if you wish your _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file to automatically scale to use all available space on a web page.
    
*   **Strip xml prolog. ** Removes _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ prolog (i.e., <?xml version="1.0"?>).
    
*   **Set precision. ** Sets numerical precision on all coordinates and attributes. Drawings meant for the web rarely need precision greater than three or four decimal places. You can also set the default numerical precision used by Inkscape in the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog in the _SVG output_ section (_Numerical precision_).
    
*   **Indent. ** Sets the indentation for each _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ opening (or closing tag). Options are _Space_, _Tab_, and _None_. In all cases, each tag with attributes is placed on one line.
    

**Use clones. ** If you include the same object multiple times in a drawing, you can reduce the file size by using _[Clones]_ (Edit → Clone → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-clone.png)Create Clone (****Alt**+**D****)), rather than duplicating the object (Edit → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/edit-duplicate.png)Duplicate (****Ctrl**+**D****)). The former inserts a reference to the original object while the latter copies the object. References usually take up less file space than copies.

**Simplify the drawing. ** Keep in mind how your drawing is going to be viewed. Check that you don't have hidden objects, objects outside the drawing area, or objects that are too small to see. You can use the outline mode (View → DisplayMode → Outline) to help check for such objects. Check that the _[Paths]( "Chapter 7. Paths")_ don't have too much detail. (A good example of this is that Wikipedia maps often have orders of magnitude more nodes than necessary at typical viewing scales.) Careful use of Path → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_PNG/actions/path-simplify.png)Simplify (****Ctrl**+**L****) can remove unnecessary nodes.

Inkscape is quite customizable. The easiest way to make customizations is through the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. More extensive customizations can be made by modifying files in or adding files to the Inkscape preferences directories. The directory for changes shared by all users is `share/inkscape`. The directory for personal changes is `~/.con﻿fig/inkscape/` on Linux or `%userprofile%\Application Data\Inkscape\` on Windows.

Inkscape Preferences Dialog
---------------------------

Inkscape is most easily customizable through the _Inkscape Preferences_ dialog (File → ![icon](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/ICONS_STOCK_PNG/categories/gtk-preferences.png)Inkscape Preferences... (****Shift**+**Ctrl**+**P****)).

![Inkscape Preferences dialog.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/DIALOGS/Dialog_Inkscape_Pref.png)

_Inkscape Preferences_ dialog.

There are too many options in the dialog to cover here. It is worthwhile to scan through the options under each entry. The most important options have already been mentioned in the text. They include: Setting the _Rotation snap angle_ and other scaling parameters under the _Step_ entry; determining if transformations should be _Optimized_ or _Preserved_ under the _Transforms_ entry; and setting the _Default export resolution_ under the _Misc_ entry.

All the preferences are stored in the file `preferences.xml` located on Linux at `~/.config/inkscape/` and on Windows at `%userprofile%\Application Data\Inkscape\`. There are quite a few preferences, some undocumented, that are accessible _only_ by hand-editing this file. See the next section for some of these.

Inkscape Configuration Files
----------------------------

Inkscape can be fully customized through the configuration files, usually located in the `share/inkscape` directory (`/usr/share/inkscape` in Linux).

### Preferences

The user file `preferences.xml` contains all the preferences that are accessible from the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog, as well as quite a few that are not. The file is located on Linux at `~/.config/ inkscape/` and on Windows at `%userprofile%\ Application Data\ Inkscape\`. This section gives information on a few of the latter.

#### Alternative Alt Key

Some window managers use **Alt**+**Left Mouse Drag** and **Alt**+**Left Mouse Click** for their own purposes, thereby preventing Inkscape from receiving the mouse input. In the group id="mapalt" section you can select an alternative “Alt” key. A numerical value of 1 selects the default “Alt” key. The numbers 2 through 5 select alternative keys. You can see which keys they correspond to by running the `xkeycaps` program available from [www.jwz.org](http://www.jwz.org/xkeycaps/).

Alternatively, you can switch the window manager to use another key (such as the “Windows” or “Command” key instead of the **Alt** key. See the [FAQ](http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ).

#### Outline Mode Colors

You can specify the colors used in the _[Outline Mode](#View-Misc-OutlineMode "Outline Mode")_ in the group id="wireframecolors" section. Colors are specified in decimal form (converted from a _[rgba](#rgba "red-green-blue-alpha")_ _[hexadecimal](#hexadecimal "hexadecimal number")_ value to base ten).

onlight

Default: 255 (#000000ff or black). Color used when stroke crosses a light background.

ondark

Default: 4294967295 (#ffffffff or white). Color used when stroke crosses a dark background.

images

Default: 4278190335 (#ff0000ff or red). Color used to outline images.

clips

Default: 16711935 (#00ff00ff or green). Color used for clip paths.

masks

Default: 65535 (#0000ffff or blue). Color used for masks.

You can force Inkscape to start up in _Outline Mode_ by changing the value of _outline_ in the group _id="startmode"_ to 1.

#### SVG Output

A number of preferences control the way content is written to the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files. They can be found in the group id="svgoutput" section. Most can also be found in the _SVG output_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog.

usenamedcolors

Default: 0. If '0', colors are written as three-digit _[hexadecimal](#hexadecimal "hexadecimal number")_ numbers where possible or as six-digit _[hexadecimal](#hexadecimal "hexadecimal number")_ numbers if not. If non-zero, colors are written when possible with _SVG_ [_color keyword names_](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html#ColorKeywords) such as _blue_ or _black_. Use of _keyword names_ can cause problems with some _Extensions_.

numericalprecision

Default: 8. This is the number of significant digits written out for a number. Lowering the number will save a small amount of space at a cost of precision.

minimumexponent

Default: -8. Any number smaller than 10 raised to this value (10\-8) is written out as 0.

indent

Default: 2. Number of spaces used for indenting between nested levels of _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ tags. A value of '0' disables indentation.

inlineattrs

Default: 0. If '0', attributes are separated by newlines; otherwise, attributes are placed on the same line as their tags.

### Custom Templates

New drawing templates can be added by adding new files to the directory `share/inkscape/templates` (for system-wide use) or to the `templates` subdirectory in your Inkscape preferences directory. The `templates` directory is listed under the _Places_ part of the _[Save As](#File-Export-Other "Exporting Other File Types")_ dialog. You can directly save any _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file to this directory. Saving the file as `default.svg` will replace your current default template.

![[Tip]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/tip.png)

Tip

Objects, gradients, patterns, and so forth, can be added to an empty Inkscape _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file and then saved and placed in the templates directory. When that file is selected in the list of templates, you will have access to all the objects, gradients, and patterns you previously defined.

### Custom Swatches or Palettes

You can add custom _Swatches_ (_Palettes_) to Inkscape by adding the appropriate files under the `share/inkscape/palettes` directory. The file format follows the Gimp palettes file format so palettes can be shared between the two programs.

The file format is very simple, as the following example five-color palette file shows.

GIMP Palette          ➊
Name: MyPalette       ➋
#                     ➌
  0   0   0 Black     ➍
255   0   0 Red
  0 255   0 Green
  0   0 255 Blue
255 255 255 White
   

➊ Declaration of the type of file.

➋ Name of palette. Shown in list of palettes.

➌ Comment.

➍ List of colors. There is one color per line. Each color is defined as three numbers representing the values of red, green, and blue followed by a name (shown when the cursor hovers over the swatch). The range of values is 0–255, where 255 means that the corresponding color is fully turned on. The above palette consists of the colors black, red, green, blue, and white.

### Custom Markers

It is possible to add custom markers to Inkscape by editing the file containing the marker definitions `share/inkscape/markers/markers.svg`. Here is the definition needed to add a “diamond node” marker. It differs from the diamond markers included with Inkscape in that the center of the diamond is gray and the orientation doesn't depend on the slope of the lines.

    <marker style="overflow:visible;"                    ➊
       id="DiamondNode"                                  ➋
       refX="0.0"                                        ➌
       refY="0.0"
       orient="0.0"                                      ➍
       inkscape:stockid="DiamondNode">                   ➎
      <path                                              ➏
         transform="scale(0.8) rotate(180)"
         style="fill-rule:evenodd;stroke:#000000;fill:#BFBFBF;
                stroke-width:0.5pt;marker-start:none;"
         d="M 0.0,2.5 L 2.5,0.0 L 0.0,-2.5 L -2.5,0.0 L 0.0,2.5 z "
         id="path1234"
         sodipodi:nodetypes="ccccc" />
    <marker>                                             ➐

   
➊ Start of marker definition. (The “overflow:visible” declaration indicates that the marker should not be clipped if it extends outside a clipping box.)

➋ Name of marker.

➌ Offset of marker origin from node position.

➍ Orientation of marker. If a numerical value, the orientation of the marker with respect to the screen coordinates. If “auto”, then it is aligned with the direction of the path at the node (or the average of the directions of the path in and path out if a corner node).

➎ Inkscape id of marker.

➏ The definition of the path of the marker. See the file format for _[Paths]_ in the appendix for more details.

➐ End of marker definition.


For more details, see the [Markers section](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#Markers) of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ specification.

### Custom Keyboard Shortcuts

You can change the keyboard shortcuts used by Inkscape by editing or replacing the file `share/keys/defaults.xml`.

There are a number of alternative shortcuts available. To use them, simply rename the file to `defaults.xml`.

*   ACD Systems Canvas: `acd-canvas.xml`.
    
*   CorelDRAW: `corel-draw-x4.xml`.
    
*   Freehand: `macromedia-freehand-mx.xml`.
    
*   Illustrator: `adobe-illustrator-cs2.xml`.
    
*   Xara: `xara.xml`.
    
*   Zoner Draw: `zoner-draw.xml`.
    
*   Right-handed illustration (for use in drawing on a tablet with a stylus held by the right hand; most commonly keyboard shortcuts are accessible with the left hand): `right-handed-illustration.xml`.
    

You can also add shortcuts to a `keys/defaults.xml` in your Inkscape preferences directory. These will override any shortcuts defined in the system-wide `defaults.xml` file. See the comments in the default file for more details.

One particularly handy shortcut customization is to bind often-used _[Extensions]( "Chapter 22. Extensions")_ to keys. Here is an example of binding the **/** key to the [Add Nodes](#Extensions-AddNodes "Add Nodes") extension:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<keys name="My Customization">
 <bind key="slash" action="org.ekips.filter.addnodes" display="true"/>
</keys>

Chapter 25. Using the Command Line
----------------------------------

**Table of Contents**

*   [General Command Line Options]
*   [Export Command Line Options]
    *   [Format Options](#CommandLine-Export-Format)
    *   [Export Region Options](#CommandLine-Export-Region)
    *   [Export Property Options](#CommandLine-Export-Property)
*   [Query Command Line Options]

Inkscape has the ability to batch process _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files without opening up the Graphics User Interface (_[GUI](#gui "Graphics User Interface")_). The available options can be divided into a few categories: general commands, exporting commands (including printing), and query commands. Inkscape will also open PDF files from the command line. The first page in the PDF is imported.

Most Inkscape commands are attached to verbs. Any verb can be called from the command line with the `--verb` argument, allowing complex processing to take place. However, it is not possible to set parameters. A list of all verbs can be obtained using `--verb-list`. It does not appear possible to suppress the _[GUI](#gui "Graphics User Interface")_ when using the `--verb` argument.

Here is a simple example of opening a file, selecting an object, flipping it, and then saving the file. The _[Star]( "Regular Polygons and Stars")_ has an _id_ of “MyStar”.

**`inkscape --select=MyStar --verb ObjectFlipVertically --verb FileSave --verb FileClose MyStar.svg`**

![Normal star.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/COMMANDLINE/MyStar.png)

The file before running the above command.

![A flipped star.](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/COMMANDLINE/MyStar_Flipped.png)

The file after running the above command.

Most options have two forms: a short form preceded by one dash and a long form proceeded by two dashes. Some options take parameters that can (usually) be attached to the option with an = sign (e.g., `--export-png=my.png`) or separated by a space (e.g., `--export-png my.png`).

Inkscape has a _shell_ mode, entered by calling Inkscape from the command line with the `--shell` option. There are no new capabilities using this command; it is simply to allow one to execute multiple independent commands without restarting Inkscape each time. Here is an example of exporting the `MyStar.svg` to a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_:

  
`$` **`inkscape --shell`**  
`Inkscape 0.48 interactive shell mode. Type 'quit' to quit.`  
`>`**`MyStar.svg --export-png=MyStar.png`**  
`Background RRGGBBAA: ffffff00`  
`Area 0:0:150:150 exported to 150 x 150 pixels (90 dpi)`  
`Bitmap saved as: MyStar.png`  
`>`**`quit`**

Export Command Line Options
---------------------------

Inkscape can be used to convert _SVG_ files to another form. Right now, the command line can be used to generate Portable Network Graphic (_[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_), PostScript (_PS_), Encapsulated PostScript (_EPS_), Portable Document Files (_PDF_), Enhanced Metafile Files (_EMF_\-Windows only), and plain _SVG_ files. More options are available from within Inkscape using the _[Save As](#File-Export-Other "Exporting Other File Types")_ or _[Export Bitmap](#File-Export-PNG "Exporting PNG (Portable Network Graphic) Files")_ dialogs.

The export options can be divided into three classes: those that specify the output format, those that specify the region to export, and those that specify properties such as background color in the exported image.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

### Format Options

The output filename must be given (except for the `--print` option).

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

Transparency is not supported in exports to _PS_ and _EPS_ files.

`-e`, `--export-png`

Export a _PNG_ file.

`-P`, `--export-ps`

Export a _PS_ file.

`-E`, `--export-eps`

Export an _EPS_ file.

`-A`, `--export-pdf`

Export a _PDF_ file.

`-l`, `--export-plain-svg`

Export a plain _SVG_ file. A plain _SVG_ has all the Inkscape\-specific information and the _RFD_ metadata removed. A program that displays _SVG_ files should ignore all such information according to the _SVG_ specification, so this option should not in principle be necessary.

`-p`, `--print`

Outputs _PS_ data that can be used as input to another program via a pipe (|) or dumped into a file via >. The parameters to this option must be quoted properly.

For example, on Linux to send the output to a file, use:

**`inkscape --print '> test.ps' test.svg`**

`-M`, `--export-emf`

Outputs an _EMF_ (Enhanced Metafile) file. Only available on Windows.

### Export Region Options

At the moment, these options only affect bitmap export except the `--export-bbox-page`, which applies to _EPS_ exports.

![[Note]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/note.png)

Note

Most PostScript display programs will only display what is inside the rectangle defined by the PostScript _BoundingBox_ parameter (if it is set). _EPS_ files must contain a _BoundingBox_. It is optional for _PS_ files. By default, Inkscape sets the _BoundingBox_ to the page area for _PS_ files and to the drawing _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ for _EPS_ files (both at 72 dpi).

`-a`, `--export-area`

Specifies the rectangular region that should be exported. Requires the coordinates of the lower-left corner and the upper-right corner in the format: x0:y0:x1:y1. (The lower-left corner of the drawing has coordinates of 0,0.) The units are in _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ user units.

Example: to export the left half of a 200 by 100 pixel drawing to a _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_:

**`inkscape --export-area=0:0:100:100   --export-png=test.png test.svg`**

`-C`, `--export-area-page`

The area exported will correspond to the area defined by the page.

`-D`, `--export-area-drawing`

The area exported will correspond to the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of all objects in a drawing, including any that are not on the page. This is the default for EPS export. Note that `--export-area-page` overides `--export-area-drawing`.

`--export-area-snap`

The area exported will be increased outward to the nearest integer value. This option has two effects: (1) If you have aligned all your objects to a pixel grid (to reduce anti-aliasing effects) but the export area _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ is not aligned to the grid, it will ensure that the exported pixmap will be aligned to the same grid. (2) It will ensure that the edges of the drawing will not be clipped.

`-i`, `--export-id`

The area exported will be defined by the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ of the named object. The exported drawing will include the parts of any other objects that fall within this bounding box. The name of a given object can be found by selecting the object from within Inkscape and looking at the _[XML Editor]( "Chapter 18. XML Editor")_. (Of course, if you do this, you may as well export using the _[Export Bitmap](#File-Export-PNG "Exporting PNG (Portable Network Graphic) Files")_ dialog.)

`-j`, `--export-id-only`

Only the specified object is exported. Must be used with the `--export-id` option. See above. Can be used with `--export-area-canvas` and `--export-area-page`.

![[Warning]](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/images/admons/warning.png)

Warning

This section not yet updated for Inkscape v0.92.

### Export Property Options

The first few options are for bitmap exports, while the last few are for _PS_ and _EPS_ export.

`-d`, `--export-dpi`

**Bitmap Export.** An exported bitmap will be scaled by the ratio of the given number to the SVG user unit. The default value is 90, which matches the internal scale used by Inkscape; that is, a value of 90 means that one Inkscape pixel corresponds to one exported pixel. A value of 72 means that one Inkscape _point_ corresponds to one exported pixel. (See [the section called “Inkscape Coordinates”]( "Inkscape Coordinates").) This option overrides the `--export-use-hints` option.

**Vector Export.** This option sets the resolution for rasterizing filters. The default values is 90 _[dpi](#dpi "dots per inch")_.

`-w`, `--export-width`

An exported bitmap will be scaled so that the width is equal to the specified number of pixels. Overrides `--export-dpi`.

`-h`, `--export-height`

An exported bitmap will be scaled so that the height is equal to the specified number of pixels. Overrides `--export-dpi`.

`-b`, `--export-background`

Use the specified color for the background of bitmap export. Any _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_\-supported color string may be used (e.g., #ffc0cb, rgb(255, 192, 203), or “pink”). See [SVG color keywords](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html) for a list of defined colors. If this option is not used, the color specified by the “pagecolor” attribute in the section “sodipodi:namedview” of the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file will be used (if it is defined).

`-y`, `--export-background-opacity`

Use the specified value for the background transparency or opacity. Either a number between 0.0 and 1.0 or an integer from 0 to 255 can be used, where the smaller number in both cases corresponds to full transparency and the larger number corresponds to full opacity. Note: 1 is interpreted as full transparency.

`-t`, `--export-use-hints`

If you have previously saved an object to a bitmap image from within Inkscape (and saved the file afterward), you can use this option to export the object to a bitmap file with the same name and resolution. Must be used with the `--export-id` option.

`-T`, `--export-text-to-path`

The text objects should be converted to paths prior to export to a _PS_ or _EPS_ export. Then ensures that the text will be rendered properly regardless of which fonts are installed on a computer that displays or a printer that prints the resulting file.

Query Command Line Options
--------------------------

The _query_ options allow you to determine position and size information for any object in an _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ file. The key here is knowing the _ID_ (name) of the object for which you desire the information. The _ID_ name must be given. The exported numbers use the _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ coordinate system.

Here is an example of finding the _x_ position of the _zoom-in_ icon in the default icon file on a Linux system:

Appendix A. Inkview
-------------------

Inkview is a standalone display program for displaying _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files. It can be used to run a slide-show. It is normally shipped with Inkscape.

Inkview can most easily be used from the command line.

Usage: **inkview** `FILE`

where FILE is one or more filenames of _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files (.svg), compressed (gzipped) _SVG_ files (.svgz), or _SVG_ archive (.sxw, .jar). The archive option has not been tested by the author.

*   **Right-arrow**: Show next slide.
    
*   **Left-arrow**: Show previous slide.
    
*   **Up-arrow**: Go to first slide.
    
*   **Down-arrow**: Go to last slide.
    
*   **Esc** or **q**: Quit.
    
*   **F11**: Toggle between full screen and window modes.
    
*   **Enter**: Pop-up window with control buttons (First, Previous, Next, Last).

➊ Start of _Path_ object.

➋ Path style. (The line has been truncated.)

➌ Path commands. The possible path commands are given in the following list. An uppercase letter indicates that the coordinate(s) given are to be interpreted as absolute coordinates; a lowercase letter indicates they are to be interpreted relative to the last point. Parameters are given inside parentheses. Commands may be omitted in some circumstances. For example, "M 20 20 40 40" is to be interpreted as "M 20 20 L 40 40".

For more details, see the [_SVG specification_](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html).

M, m

_Move to (x, y)_. Move to a given point.

Z, z

_Close path_. Draw a straight line between last point and first point in path. The lines at the first point will be joined using the current _Join_ style.

L, l

_Line to (x, y)_. Draws a line from last point to new point.

H, h

_Horizontal line to (x)_. Draws a line from last point to the point given by the new _x_ coordinate (_y_ coordinate is unchanged).

V, v

_Vertical line to (y)_. Draws a line from last point to the point given by the new _y_ coordinate (_x_ coordinate is unchanged).

C, c

_Curve to (x1, y1, x2, y2, x, y)_. Draws a _[Bezier]( "Bezier Curves")_ curve from last point to the point given by the new _x_ and _y_ coordinates. _x1_ and _y1_ are coordinates of handle for old node; _x2_ and _y2_ are coordinates of handle for new node.

S, s

_Smooth curve to (x2, y2, x, y)_. Draws a _Bezier_ curve from last point to the point given by the new _x_ and _y_ coordinates. The coordinates of the handle for the old node, _x1_ and _y1_, are calculated assuming the old node is symmetric. _x2_ and _y2_ are coordinates of handle for new node.

Q, q

_Quadratic curve to (x1, y1, x, y)_. Draws a _Quadratic Bezier_ curve from last point to the point given by the new _x_ and _y_ coordinates. _x1_ and _y1_ are the coordinates of both the old and new node handles.

T, t

_Symmetric Quadratic curve to (x, y)_. Draws a _Quadratic Bezier_ curve from last point to the point given by the new _x_ and _y_ coordinates. The coordinates of the old and new handles are the same and are calculated assuming the old node is symmetric.

A, a

_Elliptical Arc (rx, ry, x-axis-rotation, large-arc-flag sweep-flag, x, y)_. Draws an _elliptical arc_ from the last point to the point given by _x_ and _y_. See the [_SVG specification_](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html) for more details.

http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/Glossary.html
========================================================

Glossary
--------

alpha

The transparency of an object (or pixel). If an object with a non-maximal value of _Alpha_ is placed over another object, the second object will be visible under the first. In Inkscape, a value of _Alpha_ of 255 means the object is completely opaque, while a value of 0 means it is fully transparent (not visible).

Animated Portable Network Graphic (APNG)

An open standard for animated [bitmap graphics](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics"), the animated parallel of the _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ standard and an alternative to _[MNG](#mng "Multiple-Image Network Graphic")_. There is support for this format in Firefox 3 and Opera 9.5 but the _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ group has rejected this extension to the standard.

Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)

An open standard for adding semantic content to web content. This is important for accessibility to those with disabilities. See: the [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) specification.

baseline

For text, the line on which most characters (i.e., “x”) rest. Some characters such as “p” extend significantly below the baseline. Other characters such as “O” usually extend a small amount below the baseline so that they optically appear to rest on the baseline. Inkscape can align text to a common baseline. Inkscape also uses the word to describe the point at which vertical text is aligned horizontally. The baseline is indicated by a small square when text is selected.

bitmap graphics

The description of a drawing using pixels (in contrast to vectors). Also refered to as “raster” graphics.

See Also [vector graphics](#vectorgraphics).

bounding box

The smallest rectangular box with sides parallel to the _x_ and _y_ axis that completely encloses an object. Note: In Inkscape, the _[bounding box](#boundingbox "bounding box")_ is calculated assuming a round stroke _[Join](#Attributes-Stroke-Join "Join Style")_ and _[Cap](#Attributes-Stroke-Cap "Cap Style")_ style if the stroke is visible and the _Visual bounding box_ option is selected in the _Tools_ section of the _[Inkscape Preferences]( "Inkscape Preferences Dialog")_ dialog. If the _Geometric bounding box_ option is selected, only the nodes are considered in the calculation.

bump map

A [bitmap graphics](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics") used to define the contour of a surface so that a lighting effect can be applied. The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ specification uses the _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ channel for this purpose in several of the _[Filter]( "Chapter 17. Filter Effects—Custom")_ primitives. See: [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_mapping).

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

A way of controlling the layout and style of graphics objects (including text) through the use of external files. This allows the separation of content from presentation. It allows documents to be easily adapted for a variety of rendering methods such as printing and web display.

Computer-Aided Design (CAD)

Use of a computer for techinical design of objects. See: [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design).

Cyan Magenta Yellow Key (Black) (CMYK)

A method for describing a color by the amount of cyan, magenta, and yellow needed to generate the color. This subtractive color model (where light is absorbed) is most often used in printing. As a good black is difficult to obtain using a mixture of these colors, a fourth ink, the _Key_ or black, is also used. See: [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK).

dots per inch (dpi)

The number of pixels per inch when printing or displaying a digitized image. Inkscape has a default resolution for exporting bitmaps of 90 dpi.

ECMAScript

A standardized language typically used to manipulate elements in an _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ page. See [Wikipedia entry](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript). [JavaScript](#javascript "JavaScript") is an implemenation of the ECMAScript standard as is JScript used in Internet Explorer.

See Also [JavaScript](#javascript).

gamma

A correction factor to account for nonlinearity in a display device. More technically, the numerical value of the exponent of the power-law correction.

Gaussian distribution

Also called [_Normal distribution_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), a mathematical function that describes a distribution found often in statistics (e.g., the distribution of scores on a test). The relevance for Inkscape comes from the use of the distribution in the _[Gaussian Blur](#Filters-GaussianBlur "Gaussian Blur")_ filter. The key point is that the color of a pixel is determined by the colors of nearby pixels in the source, weighting the nearest pixels more.

ghostscript

An open-source [PostScript](#postscript "PostScript") interpreter. See: [Ghostscript Home Page](http://www.ghostscript.com).

Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)

A patented standard for compressing [bitmap graphics](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics") supported by most web browsers. The open _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ standard is technically superior and should be the format of choice for lossless compressed bitmaps.

Graphics User Interface (GUI)

The interface a computer program presents to the user.

hexadecimal number

A way of representing a number using base 16 rather than the normal base 10. Very commonly used with computers. The base 10 numbers 0–9 are augmented by the letters a through f (which may or may not be capitalized) representing the numbers 10–15. For example, 31 in base 10 is written as 1F in hexadecimal (1 times 16 plus 15 is 31).

hue, saturation, lightness (HSL)

A method for describing a color using hue, saturation, and lightness. See: [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_color_space).

HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

The original markup language for web pages. The current version is HTML 4.01. _[HTML5](#html5 "HyperText Markup Language, Version 5")_ will include inlined _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ as part of the standard. See: [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html).

HyperText Markup Language, Version 5 (HTML5)

The upcoming HTML standard. See: [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5).

Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)

A standard for lossy compression of [bitmap graphics](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics") supported by most web browsers. More suitable for photographs than line art.

JavaScript

A language typically used to manipulate elements in an _[HTML](#html "HyperText Markup Language")_ page. See [Wikipedia entry](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). JavaScript is an implemenation of the [ECMAScript](#ecmascript "ECMAScript") standard.

See Also [ECMAScript](#ecmascript).

kerning

The process of adjusting the space between letters in text to improve the appearance of the text. A classic example is that the “A” and “v” in “Aviary” should slightly overlap.

LaTeX

A system for producing high-quality documents commonly used in mathematics and physics documents. LaTeX is built on top of TeX. See: [LaTeX home page](http://www.latex-project.org/).

Linear Red Green Blue Color Space (linearRGB)

A color space where the output intensity of a color is linearly proportional to the input value.

See Also [Standard Red Green Blue Color Space](#srgb).

MathML

Mathematical Markup Language. An _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ based language for marking up mathematical notation. Permitted, along with _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_, in _[HTML5](#html5 "HyperText Markup Language, Version 5")_ documents.

Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)

An Internet standard originally developed for electronic mail that assigns to each type of document content a unique name so that clients (programs) can interpret the data correctly.

Multiple-Image Network Graphic (MNG)

An open standard for animated [bitmap graphics](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics"), the animated parallel of the _[PNG](#png "Portable Network Graphic")_ standard. Unfortunately, there is little support for this format in web browsers.

name spaces

The use of tags to define a region in a file where certain definitions are applicable. For example, an _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ file can contain both _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ and _[XHTML](#xhtml "eXtensible HyperText Markup Language")_. Name spaces keep the two from conflicting with each other.

opacity

The property of an object that determines the visibility of an underlying object. Opposite of _[transparency](#transparency "transparency")_.

See Also [alpha](#alpha), [transparency](#transparency).

PDF

Portable Document Format. A “printing” language created by Adobe that supersedes PostScript. See: [Adobe PDF site](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/pdf/index_reference.html).

pixel

Short for picture element. The smallest part of a digitized image that includes all the color information for a region. Computer screen resolutions are typically described as having some number of pixels per inch. The pixel (px) is the default user unit for _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_. Inkscape has a default resolution for exporting bitmaps of 90 pixels/inch (ppi). _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ viewers typically have a default resolution of either 72 or 90 ppi.

point

A unit derived from the days when printers used letters carved in metal blocks for printing. Various points have been defined. Inkscape uses the computer point, which is 1/72 of an inch or 0.35277 mm.

Portable Network Graphic (PNG)

An open standard for compressing [bitmap graphics](#bitmapgraphics "bitmap graphics") supported by most web browsers.

PostScript

A printing language created by Adobe. The language can be used to describe a document in a device-independent way. See: [Adobe PostScript site](http://www.adobe.com/products/postscript/index.html).

px

See [pixel](#pixel).

red-green-blue (RGB)

A method for describing a color using the amount of each primary color present. See [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_space).

red-green-blue-alpha (RGBA)

The addition of _[Alpha](#alpha "alpha")_ (transparency) as a fourth component to a _[RGB](#rgb "red-green-blue")_ specified color.

rubber band

The box drawn when click-dragging the mouse with the _[Select Tool]( "Selecting Objects")_ or the _[Node Tool](#Paths-Editing-Node "Using the Node Tool")_ active. The objects or nodes within the box will be selected. The drag must begin over an area without an object or with the **Shift** key held down.

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

An XML standard for describing a drawing using vector graphics. See: [W3C SVG page](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/).

Standard Red Green Blue Color Space (sRGB)

A very common standard created by HP and Microsoft for defining color use on monitors and printers. See [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB). The basic property of this color space is that the output intensity for a color (e.g., red) is (roughly) exponentially dependent on the specified input value. All _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ colors are defined using this standard. In _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_, color interpolation is by default done in the sRGB space except for filters, which is by default done in the linearRGB color space.

See Also [Linear Red Green Blue Color Space](#linearrgb).

Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL)

A language for authoring interactive audiovisual presentations. See [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronized_Multimedia_Integration_Language). _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ can uses SMIL for animation (in addition to JavaScript).

Tag Image File Format (TIFF)

A file format for storing high-quality images such as photographs or line drawings.

tool tip

A short dialog shown while the mouse cursor is above some part of window. A typical use is to describe the function of an icon.

transformation matrix

A 3   3 matrix that describes how an object is to be transformed. The upper-left 2   2 sub-matrix controls scaling, rotating, and skewing. While the upper-right 1   2 sub-matrix controls translations, the bottom row is not modifiable.

An advantage of using transformation matrices is that cumulative transformations can be described by simply multiplying the matrices that describe each individual transformation. Inkscape stores an object's transformation internally as a transformation matrix (which can be seen and modified with the _XML Editor_).

In non-matrix form, we have the transformation: _x'_ = A_x_ + C_y_ + E and _y'_ = B_x_ + D_y_ + F where (_x'_, _y'_) is the new coordinate of a point at (_x_, _y_).

With the above set of equations, it is easy to see that E is magnitude of a translation in the _x_ direction and F is magnitude of a translation in the _y_ direction. For scaling, A and D are the scale factors for the _x_ and _y_ directions, respectively. For a pure rotation, A = D = sin(theta) and B = −C = cos(theta) where theta is the angle of the desired rotation. For skewing, C and B control skewing parallel to the _x_ and _y_ axes, respectively.

A _transformation matrix_ is always defined with respect to some point. The internal representation is with respect to the internal coordinate system origin (upper-left corner of “page”).

transparency

The property of an object that determines the visibility of an underlying object.

See Also [alpha](#alpha), [opacity](#opacity).

Vector Markup Language (VML)

An _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ based language for describing vector graphics. See [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Markup_Language). VML is supported by Internet Explorer but is deprecated.

Unicode

A standard for encoding characters for all the world's living languages as well as many historic ones. The character mapping for Unicode can be found at the [Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/charts) organization's web pages.

UniConvertor

An open-source program for parsing various vector graphics files. See: [Uniconvertor Home Page](https://sk1project.net/modules.php?name=Products&product=uniconvertor).

Universal Resource Locator (URL)

The address of a web page, graphic, etc., on the WWW.

user unit

The length corresponding to the value _one_ after accounting for any transformations. _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ follows _[CSS](#css "Cascading Style Sheets")_ and defines that "1px" (one pixel) is equal to one user unit. It is important to note that a _CSS_ pixel is _not_ the same as a screen pixel.

vector graphics

The description of a drawing using vectors (in contrast to bitmaps).

See Also [bitmap graphics](#bitmapgraphics).

eXperimental Computing Facility (XCF)

The native format for Gimp. The acronym comes from the name of the student group at the University of California, Berkeley, that gave birth to Gimp.

eXtensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML)

An _[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ markup language for web pages. See: [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhtml).

eXtensible Markup Language (XML)

The underlying format for _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ files. See: [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml).

XLink

_[XML](#xml "eXtensible Markup Language")_ Linking Language. A language for creating sophisticated links between documents. Similar to the simpler _[URL](#url "Universal Resource Locator")_. The _[SVG](#svg "Scalable Vector Graphics")_ specification uses “simple” _Xlinks_.

z-order

The order in which objects are drawn when they overlap each other. Objects drawn on top are higher up in z-order. Unless explicitly changed, the most recent object created is on top.
