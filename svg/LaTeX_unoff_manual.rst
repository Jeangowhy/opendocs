            :name: Overview-of-LaTeX
            :class: chapter

         LaTeX is a system for typesetting documents. It was originally
         created by Leslie Lamport in 1984, but has been maintained by a
         group of volunteers for many years now
         (https://latex-project.org). It is widely used, particularly
         but not exclusively for mathematical and technical documents.

         A LaTeX user writes an input file containing text to be typeset
         along with interspersed commands. The default encoding for the
         text is UTF-8 (as of 2018). The commands specify, for example,
         how the text should be formatted.

         LaTeX is implemented as a set of related so-called âmacrosâ
         which use DonaldÂ E. Knuthâs TeX typesetting program or one of
         its derivatives, collectively known as âenginesâ. Thus, the
         user produces output, typically PDF, by giving the input file
         to a TeX engine. (The following sections describe all this in
         more detail.)

         The term LaTeX is also sometimes used to mean the language in
         which the input document is marked up, that is, to mean the set
         of commands available to a LaTeX user.

         The name LaTeX is short for âLamport TeXâ. It is pronounced
         LAH-teck or LAY-teck, or sometimes LAY-tecks. Inside a
         document, produce the logo with ``\LaTeX``. Where use of the
         logo is not sensible, such as in plain text, write it as
         â\ ``LaTeX``\ â.

               :class: section

            LaTeX files have a simple global structure, with a standard
            beginning and ending. This is a small example.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \documentclass{article}
                  \begin{document}
                  Hello, \LaTeX\ world.
                  \end{document}

            Every LaTeX document has a ``\begin{document}`` line and an
            ``\end{document}`` line.

            Here, the â\ ``article``\ â is the *document class*. It is
            implemented in a file ``article.cls``. You can use any
            document class on your system. A few document classes are
            defined by LaTeX itself, and vast array of others are widely
            available. See `Document classes <#Document-classes>`__.

            You can include other LaTeX commands between the
            ``\documentclass`` and the ``\begin{document}`` commands.
            This area is called the *preamble*.

            The ``\begin{document}``, ``\end{document}`` pair defines an
            *environment*; the â\ ``document``\ â environment (and no
            others) is required in all LaTeX documents (see
            ```document`` <#document>`__). LaTeX make available to you
            many environments that are documented here (see
            `Environments <#Environments>`__). Many more are available
            to you from external packages, most importantly those
            available at CTAN (see `CTAN: The Comprehensive TeX Archive
            Network <#CTAN>`__).

            The following sections discuss how to produce PDF or other
            output from a LaTeX input file.

               :name: Output-files-1
               :class: section

            LaTeX produces a main output file and at least two auxiliary
            files. The main output fileâs name ends in either ``.dvi``
            or ``.pdf``.

            ``.dvi`` `Â¶ <#index-_002edvi-file>`__

               If LaTeX is invoked with the system command ``latex``
               then it produces a DeVice Independent file, with
               extension ``.dvi``. You can view this file with a command
               such as ``xdvi``, or convert it to a PostScript ``.ps``
               file with ``dvips`` or to a Portable Document Format
               ``.pdf`` file with ``dvipdfmx``. The contents of the file
               can be dumped in human-readable form with ``dvitype``. A
               vast array of other DVI utility programs are available
               (https://mirror.ctan.org/dviware).

            ``.pdf`` `Â¶ <#index-_002epdf-file>`__

               If LaTeX is invoked via the system command ``pdflatex``,
               among other commands (see `TeX
               engines <#TeX-engines>`__), then the main output is a
               Portable Document Format (PDF) file. Typically this is a
               self-contained file, with all fonts and images included.

            LaTeX always produces at least two additional files.

            ``.log`` `Â¶ <#index-transcript-file>`__

               This transcript file contains summary information such as
               a list of loaded packages. It also includes diagnostic
               messages and perhaps additional information for any
               errors.

            ``.aux`` `Â¶ <#index-auxiliary-file>`__

               Auxiliary information is used by LaTeX for things such as
               cross references. For example, the first time that LaTeX
               finds a forward referenceâa cross reference to something
               that has not yet appeared in the sourceâit will appear in
               the output as a doubled question mark ``??``. When the
               referred-to spot does eventually appear in the source
               then LaTeX writes its location information to this
               ``.aux`` file. On the next invocation, LaTeX reads the
               location information from this file and uses it to
               resolve the reference, replacing the double question mark
               with the remembered location.

            LaTeX may produce yet more files, characterized by the
            filename ending. These include a ``.lof`` file that is used
            to make a list of figures, a ``.lot`` file used to make a
            list of tables, and a ``.toc`` file used to make a table of
            contents (see `Table of contents, list of figures, list of
            tables <#Table-of-contents-etc_002e>`__). A particular class
            may create others; the list is open-ended.

               :name: TeX-engines-1
               :class: section

            LaTeX is a large set of commands that is executed by a TeX
            program (see `Overview of LaTeX <#Overview>`__). Such a set
            of commands is called a *format*, and is embodied in a
            binary ``.fmt`` file, which can be read much more quickly
            than the corresponding TeX source.

            This section gives a terse overview of the TeX programs that
            are commonly available (see also `Command line
            interface <#Command-line-interface>`__).

            ``latex`` `Â¶ <#index-latex>`__
            ``pdflatex`` `Â¶ <#index-pdflatex>`__

               In TeX Live (https://tug.org/texlive), if LaTeX is
               invoked via either the system command ``latex`` or
               ``pdflatex``, then the pdfTeX engine is run
               (https://ctan.org/pkg/pdftex). When invoked as ``latex``,
               the main output is a ``.dvi`` file; as ``pdflatex``, the
               main output is a ``.pdf`` file.

               pdfTeX incorporates the e-TeX extensions to Knuthâs
               original program (https://ctan.org/pkg/etex), including
               additional programming features and bi-directional
               typesetting, and has plenty of extensions of its own.
               e-TeX is available on its own as the system command
               ``etex``, but this is plain TeX (and produces ``.dvi``).

               In other TeX distributions, ``latex`` may invoke e-TeX
               rather than pdfTeX. In any case, the e-TeX extensions can
               be assumed to be available in LaTeX.

               If LaTeX is invoked via the system command ``lualatex``,
               the LuaTeX engine is run (https://ctan.org/pkg/luatex).
               This program allows code written in the scripting
               language Lua (http://luatex.org) to interact with TeXâs
               typesetting. LuaTeX handles UTF-8 Unicode input natively,
               can handle OpenType and TrueType fonts, and produces a
               ``.pdf`` file by default. There is also ``dvilualatex``
               to produce a ``.dvi`` file.

            ``xelatex`` `Â¶ <#index-xelatex>`__

               If LaTeX is invoked with the system command ``xelatex``,
               the XeTeX engine is run (https://tug.org/xetex). Like
               LuaTeX, XeTeX natively supports UTF-8 Unicode and
               TrueType and OpenType fonts, though the implementation is
               completely different, mainly using external libraries
               instead of internal code. XeTeX produces a ``.pdf`` file
               as output; it does not support DVI output.

               Internally, XeTeX creates an ``.xdv`` file, a variant of
               DVI, and translates that to PDF using the
               (``x``)\ ``dvipdfmx`` program, but this process is
               automatic. The ``.xdv`` file is only useful for
               debugging.

            ``platex`` `Â¶ <#index-platex>`__
            ``uplatex`` `Â¶ <#index-uplatex>`__
               These commands provide significant additional support for
               Japanese and other languages; the ``u`` variant supports
               Unicode. See https://ctan.org/pkg/ptex and
               https://ctan.org/pkg/uptex.

            As of 2019, there is a companion ``-dev`` command and format
            for all of the above:

            ``dvilualatex-dev`` `Â¶ <#index-dvilualatex_002ddev>`__
            ``latex-dev`` `Â¶ <#index-latex_002ddev>`__
            ``lualatex-dev`` `Â¶ <#index-lualatex_002ddev>`__
            ``pdflatex-dev`` `Â¶ <#index-pdflatex_002ddev>`__
            ``platex-dev`` `Â¶ <#index-platex_002ddev>`__
            ``uplatex-dev`` `Â¶ <#index-uplatex_002ddev>`__
            ``xelatex-dev`` `Â¶ <#index-xelatex_002ddev>`__

               These are candidates for an upcoming LaTeX release. The
               main purpose is to find and address compatibility
               problems before an official release.

               These ``-dev`` formats make it easy for anyone to help
               test documents and code: you can run, say,
               ``pdflatex-dev`` instead of ``pdflatex``, without
               changing anything else in your environment. Indeed, it is
               easiest and most helpful to always run the ``-dev``
               versions instead of bothering to switch back and forth.
               During quiet times after a release, the commands will be
               equivalent.

               These are not daily snapshots or untested development
               code. They undergo the same extensive regression testing
               by the LaTeX team before being released.

               :name: LaTeX-command-syntax-1
               :class: section

            In the LaTeX input file, a command name starts with a
            backslash character, ``\``. The name itself then consists of
            either (a)Â a string of letters or (b)Â a single non-letter.

            LaTeX commands names are case sensitive so that
            ``\pagebreak`` differs from ``\Pagebreak`` (the latter is
            not a standard command). Most command names are lowercase,
            but in any event you must enter all commands in the same
            case as they are defined.

            A command may be followed by zero, one, or more arguments.
            These arguments may be either required or optional. Required
            arguments are contained in curly braces, ``{...}``. Optional
            arguments are contained in square brackets, ``[...]``.
            Generally, but not universally, if the command accepts an
            optional argument, it comes first, before any required
            arguments.

            Inside of an optional argument, to use the character close
            square bracketÂ (``]``) hide it inside curly braces, as
            inÂ ``\item[closing bracket {]}]``. Similarly, if an optional
            argument comes last, with no required argument after it,
            then to make the first character of the following text be an
            open square bracket, hide it inside curly braces.

            LaTeX has the convention that some commands have a ``*``
            form that is related to the form without a ``*``, such as
            ``\chapter`` and ``\chapter*``. The exact difference in
            behavior varies from command to command.

            This manual describes all accepted options and ``*``-forms
            for the commands it covers (barring unintentional omissions,
            a.k.a. bugs).

            As of the 2020-10-01 release of LaTeX, the ``expl3`` and
            ``xparse`` packages are part of the LaTeX2e format. They
            provide a completely different underlying programming
            language syntax. We wonât try to cover them in this
            document; see the related package documentation and other
            LaTeX manuals.

                    ...
                  \end{environment-name}

            An *environment* is an area of LaTeX source, inside of which
            there is a distinct behavior. For instance, for poetry in
            LaTeX put the lines between ``\begin{verse}`` and
            ``\end{verse}``.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{verse}
                    There once was a man from Nantucket \\
                    ...
                  \end{verse}

            See `Environments <#Environments>`__, for a list of
            environments. Particularly notable is that every LaTeX
            document must have a ``document`` environment, a
            ``\begin{document} ... \end{document}`` pair.

            The ``environment-name`` at the beginning must exactly match
            that at the end. This includes the case where
            ``environment-name`` ends in a starÂ (``*``); both the
            ``\begin`` and ``\end`` texts must include the star.

            Environments may have arguments, including optional
            arguments. This example produces a table. The first argument
            is optional (and causes the table to be aligned on its top
            row) while the second argument is required (it specifies the
            formatting of columns).

               :class: section

            The ``\DocumentMetadata`` command was added to LaTeX in
            2022. It enables so-called âtaggingâ of the PDF output,
            aiding accessibility of the PDF.

            It is unlike nearly any other command in LaTeX in that it
            must occur before the ``\documentclass`` command that starts
            a LaTeX document proper (see
            `\\documentclass <#g_t_005cdocumentclass>`__). Therefore it
            must be called with ``\RequirePackage`` rather than
            ``\usepackage`` (see
            `\\RequirePackage <#g_t_005cRequirePackage>`__).

            This support is still in development, so we will not try to
            list all the possible settings. Please see the
            ``documentmetadata-support-doc`` document, part of the
            ``latex-lab`` package (https://ctan.org/pkg/latex-lab). Here
            is a simple example which enables most tagging currently
            implemented:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \DocumentMetadata{testphase={phase-III,firstaid}}
                  \documentclass{article}
                  ...

            As you can see from the key name ``testphase``, this is all
            still in an experimental phase. But the LaTeX developers
            strongly encourage users to give it a try and report
            problems.

            The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network, CTAN, is the TeX and
            LaTeX communityâs repository of free material. It is a set
            of Internet sites around the world that offer material
            related to LaTeX for download. Visit CTAN on the web at
            https://ctan.org.

            This material is organized into packages, discrete bundles
            that typically offer some coherent functionality and are
            maintained by one person or a small number of people. For
            instance, many publishers have a package that allows authors
            to format papers to that publisherâs specifications.

            In addition to the massive holdings, the ``ctan.org`` web
            site offers features such as search by name or by
            functionality.

            CTAN is not a single host, but instead is a set of hosts,
            one of which is the so-called âmasterâ. The master host
            actively manages the material, for instance, by accepting
            uploads of new or updated packages. For many years, it has
            been hosted by the German TeX group, DANTE e.V.

            Other sites around the world help out by mirroring, that is,
            automatically syncing their collections with the master site
            and then in turn making their copies publicly available.
            This gives users close to their location better access and
            relieves the load on the master site. The list of mirrors is
            at https://ctan.org/mirrors.

            Full-length books, including chapters and possibly including

         ``slides``
            For slide presentationsârarely used nowadays. The ``beamer``

            LaTeX automatically passes options specified for
            ``\documentclass`` on to any other loaded classes that can
            handle them.

            Here is the list of the standard class options.

            All of the standard classes except ``slides`` accept the
            following options for selecting the typeface size; the
            default is ``10pt``:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  10pt  11pt  12pt

            All of the standard classes accept these options for
            selecting the paper size (dimensions are listed height by
            width):

            ``a4paper``
               210 by 297mm (about 8.25 by 11.75Â inches)

            ``a5paper``
               148 by 210mm (about 5.8 by 8.3Â inches)

            ``b5paper``
               176 by 250mm (about 6.9 by 9.8Â inches)

            ``executivepaper``
               7.25 by 10.5Â inches

            ``legalpaper``
               8.5 by 14Â inches

            ``letterpaper``
               8.5 by 11Â inches (the default)

            When using one of the engines pdfLaTeX, LuaLaTeX, or XeLaTeX
            (see `TeX engines <#TeX-engines>`__), options other than
            ``letterpaper`` set the print area but you must also set the
            physical paper size. Usually, the ``geometry`` package is
            the best way to do that; it provides flexible ways of
            setting the print area and physical page size. Otherwise,
            setting the paper size is engine-dependent. For example,
            with pdfLaTeX, you could include
            ``\pdfpagewidth=\paperwidth`` and
            ``\pdfpageheight=\paperheight`` in the preamble.

            Miscellaneous other options:

            ``draft`` `Â¶ <#index-black-boxes_002c-omitting>`__
            ``final``
               Mark (``draft``) or do not mark (``final``) overfull
               boxes with a black box in the margin; default is
               ``final``.

            ``fleqn`` `Â¶ <#index-flush-left-equations>`__

               Put displayed formulas flush left; default is centered.

            ``landscape`` `Â¶ <#index-landscape-orientation>`__
               Selects landscape format; default is portrait.

            ``leqno`` `Â¶ <#index-left_002dhand-equation-numbers>`__

               Put equation numbers on the left side of equations;
               default is the right side.

            ``openbib`` `Â¶ <#index-bibliography-format_002c-open>`__
               Use âopenâ bibliography format.

            ``titlepage`` `Â¶ <#index-title-page_002c-separate-or-run_002din>`__
            ``notitlepage``
               Specifies whether there is a separate page for the title
               information and for the abstract also, if there is one.
               The default for the ``report`` class is ``titlepage``,
               for the other classes it is ``notitlepage``.

            The following options are not available with the ``slides``
            class.

            ``onecolumn``
            ``twocolumn``
               Typeset in one or two columns; default is ``onecolumn``.

            ``oneside`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cevensidemargin>`__
            ``twoside``
               Selects one- or two-sided layout; default is ``oneside``,
               except that in the ``book`` class the default is
               ``twoside``.

               For one-sided printing, the text is centered on the page.
               For two-sided printing, the ``\evensidemargin``
               (``\oddsidemargin``) parameter determines the distance on
               even (odd) numbered pages between the left side of the
               page and the textâs left margin, with ``\oddsidemargin``
               being 40% of the difference between ``\paperwidth`` and
               ``\textwidth``, and ``\evensidemargin`` is the remainder.

            ``openright``
            ``openany``
               Determines if a chapter should start on a right-hand
               page; default is ``openright`` for ``book``, and
               ``openany`` for ``report``.

            The ``slides`` class offers the option ``clock`` for
            printing the time at the bottom of each note.

            You can create new document classes and new packages. For
            instance, if your memos must satisfy some local
            requirements, such as a standard header for each page, then
            you could create a new class ``smcmemo.cls`` and begin your
            documents with ``\documentclass{smcmemo}``.

            What separates a package from a document class is that the
            commands in a package are useful across classes while those
            in a document class are specific to that class. Thus, a
            command to set page headers is for a package while a command
            to make the page headers be
            ``Memo from the SMC Math Department`` is for a class.

            Inside of a class or package definition you can use the
            at-sign ``@`` as a character in command names without having
            to surround the code containing that command with
            ``\makeatletter`` and ``\makeatother`` (see
            ```\makeatletter`` &
            ``\makeatother`` <#g_t_005cmakeatletter-_0026-_005cmakeatother>`__).
            This allows you to create commands that users will not
            accidentally redefine.

            It is also highly desirable to prefix class- or
            package-specific commands with your package name or similar
            string, to prevent your definitions from clashing with those
            from other packages. For instance, the class ``smcmemo``
            might have commands ``\smc@tolist``, ``\smc@fromlist``, etc.

               A class file or package file typically has four parts.

               #. In the *identification part*, the file says that it is
                  a LaTeX package or class and describes itself, using
                  the ``\NeedsTeXFormat`` and ``\ProvidesClass`` or
                  ``\ProvidesPackage`` commands.
               #. The *preliminary declarations part* declares some
                  commands and can also load other files. Usually these
                  commands will be those needed for the code used in the
                  next part. For example, an ``smcmemo`` class might be
                  called with an option to read in a file with a list of
                  people for the to-head, as
                  ``\documentclass[mathto]{smcmemo}``, and therefore
                  needs to define a command
                  ``\newcommand{\setto}[1]{\def\@tolist{#1}}`` used in
                  that file.
               #. In the *handle options part* the class or package
                  declares and processes its options. Class options
                  allow a user to start their document as
                  ``\documentclass[``\ ``option list``\ ``]{``\ ``class name``\ ``}``,
                  to modify the behavior of the class. An example is
                  when you declare ``\documentclass[11pt]{article}`` to
                  set the default document font size.
               #. Finally, in the *more declarations part* the class or
                  package usually does most of its work: declaring new
                  variables, commands and fonts, and loading other
                  files.

               Here is a starting class file, which should be saved as
               ``stub.cls`` where LaTeX can find it, for example in the
               same directory as the ``.tex`` file.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}

                     \DeclareOption*{\PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{article}}
                     \ProcessOptions\relax
                     \LoadClass{article}

               It identifies itself, handles the class options via the
               default of passing them all to the ``article`` class, and
               then loads the ``article`` class to provide the basis for
               this classâs code.

         LaTeX comes with powerful font capacities. For one thing, its
         New Font Selection Scheme allows you to work easily with the
         font families in your document (for instance, seeÂ `Font
         styles <#Font-styles>`__). And, LaTeX documents can use most
         fonts that are available today, including versions of Times
         Roman, Helvetica, Courier, etc. (Note, though, that many fonts
         do not have support for mathematics.)

         The first typeface in the TeX world was the Computer Modern
         family, developed by Donald Knuth. It is the default for LaTeX
         documents and is still the most widely used. But changing to
         another font often only involves a few commands. For instance,
         putting the following in your preamble gives you a
         Palatino-like font, which is handsome and more readable online
         than many other fonts, while still allowing you to typeset
         mathematics. (This example is from Michael Sharpe,
         https://math.ucsd.edu/~msharpe/RcntFnts.pdf.)

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               \usepackage[osf]{newpxtext} % osf for text, not math
               \usepackage{cabin} % sans serif
               \usepackage[varqu,varl]{inconsolata} % sans serif typewriter
               \usepackage[bigdelims,vvarbb]{newpxmath} % bb from STIX
               \usepackage[cal=boondoxo]{mathalfa} % mathcal

         In addition, the ``xelatex`` or ``lualatex`` engines allow you
         to use any fonts on your system that are in OpenType or
         TrueType format (see `TeX engines <#TeX-engines>`__).

         The LaTeX Font Catalogue (https://tug.org/FontCatalogue) shows
         font sample graphics and copy-and-pasteable source to use many
         fonts, including many with support for mathematics. It aims to
         cover all Latin alphabet free fonts available for easy use with
         LaTeX.

         More information is also available from the TeX Users Group, at

               :name: fontenc-package-1

            Synopsis:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \usepackage[font_encoding]{fontenc}

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \usepackage[font_encoding1, font_encoding2, ...]{fontenc}

            Specify the font encodings. A font encoding is a mapping of
            the character codes to the font glyphs that are used to
            typeset your output.

            This package only applies if you use the ``pdflatex`` engine
            (see `TeX engines <#TeX-engines>`__). If you use the
            ``xelatex`` or ``lualatex`` engine then instead use the
            ``fontspec`` package.

            TeXâs original font family, Computer Modern, has a limited
            character set. For instance, to make common accented
            characters you must use ``\accent`` (see
            ```\accent`` <#g_t_005caccent>`__) but this disables
            hyphenation. TeX users have agreed on a number of standards
            to access the larger sets of characters provided by modern
            fonts. If you are using ``pdflatex`` then put this in the
            preamble

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

            gives you support for the most widespread European
            languages, including French, German, Italian, Polish, and
            others. In particular, if you have words with accented
            letters then LaTeX will hyphenate them and your output can
            be copied and pasted. (The optional second line allows you
            to directly enter accented characters into your source
            file.)

            If you are using an encoding such as ``T1`` and the
            characters appear blurry or do not magnify well then your
            fonts may be bitmapped, sometimes called raster or TypeÂ 3.
            You want vector fonts. Use a package such as ``lmodern`` or
            ``cm-super`` to get a font that extends LaTeXâs default
            using vector fonts.

            For each ``font_encoding`` given as an option but not
            already declared, this package loads the encoding definition
            files, named ``font_encoding``\ ``enc.def``. It also sets
            ``\encodingdefault`` to be the last encoding in the option
            list.

            These are the common values for ``font_encoding``.

            ``OT1``
               The original encoding for TeX. Limited to mostly English
               characters.

            ``OMS, OML``
               Math symbols and math letters encoding.

            ``T1``
               TeX text extended. Sometimes called the Cork encoding for
               the Users Group meeting where it was developed. Gives
               access to most European accented characters. The most
               common option for this package.

            ``TS1``
               Text Companion encoding.

            LaTeXâs default is to load ``OML``, ``T1``, ``OT1``, and
            then ``OMS``, and set the default to ``OT1``.

            Even if you do not use accented letters, you may need to
            specify a font encoding if your font requires it.

            If you use ``T1``Â encoded fonts other than the default
            Computer Modern family then you may need to load the package
            that selects your fonts before loading ``fontenc``, to
            prevent the system from loading any ``T1``Â encoded fonts
            from the default.

            The LaTeX team reserve encoding names starting with:
            â\ ``T``\ â for the standard text encodings with 256

            This package provides a number of commands, detailed below.
            Many of them are encoding-specific, so if you have defined a
            command that works for one encoding but the current encoding
            is different then the command is not in effect.

               Declare the font encoding ``encoding``. It also saves the
               value of ``encoding`` in ``\LastDeclaredEncoding`` (see
               ```\LastDeclaredEncoding`` <#g_t_005cLastDeclaredEncoding>`__).

               The file ``t1enc.def`` contains this line (followed by
               many others).

               The ``text-settings`` are the commands that LaTeX will
               run every time it switches from one encoding to another
               with the ``\selectfont`` and ``\fontencoding`` commands.
               The ``math-settings`` are the commands that LaTeX will
               use whenever the font is accessed as a math alphabet.

               LaTeX ignores any space characters inside
               ``text-settings`` and ``math-settings``, to prevent
               unintended spaces in the output.

               If you invent an encoding you should pick a two or three
               letter name starting with â\ ``L``\ â for
               â\ ``local``\ â, or â\ ``E``\ â for
               â\ ``experimental``\ â.

               Note that output encoding files may be read several times
               by LaTeX so using, e.g., ``\newcommand`` may cause an
               error. In addition, such files should contain
               ``\ProvidesFile`` line (see `Class and package
               commands <#Class-and-package-commands>`__).

               Note also that you should use the ``\...Default``
               commands only in a package, not in the encoding
               definition files, since those files should only contain
               declarations specific to that encoding.

               represented in ASCII asÂ 65. (This holds unless there is a

               If there is an encoding-specific accent command

               ``\DeclareTextAccent`` for that encoding then this
               command will pick up the slack, by saying to use it as
               described for ``encoding``.

               For example, to make the encoding ``OT1`` be the default
               encoding for the accent ``\"``, declare this.

               .. container:: example

                     \DeclareTextAccentDefault{\"}{OT1}

               If you issue a ``\"`` when the current encoding does not
               have a definition for that accent then LaTeX will use the
               definition from ``OT1``

               That is, this command is equivalent to this call (see
               ```\UseTextSymbol`` &
               ``\UseTextAccent`` <#g_t_005cUseTextSymbol-_0026-_005cUseTextAccent>`__).

               Note that ``\DeclareTextAccentDefault`` works for any
               one-argument ``fontenc`` command, not just the accent
               command.

                     \ProvideTextCommand{\cmd}{encoding}[nargs][optargdefault]{defn}

               Define the command ``\``\ ``cmd``, which will be specific
               to one encoding. The command name ``cmd`` must be
               preceded by a backslash, ``\``. These commands can only
               appear in the preamble. Redefining \\\ ``cmd`` does not
               cause an error. The defined command will be robust even
               if the code in ``defn`` is fragile (see
               ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

               For example, the file ``t1enc.def`` contains this line.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \DeclareTextCommand{\textperthousand}{T1}{\%\char 24 }

               With that, you can express parts per thousand.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}  % in preamble
                       ...
                     Legal limit is \( 0.8 \)\textperthousand.

               If you change the font encoding to ``OT1`` then you get
               an error like
               â\ ``LaTeX Error: Command \textperthousand unavailable in encoding OT1``\ â.

               The ``\ProvideTextCommand`` variant does the same, except
               that it does nothing if ``\``\ ``cmd`` is already
               defined. The ``\DeclareTextSymbol`` command is faster
               than this one for simple slot-to-glyph association (see
               ```\DeclareTextSymbol`` <#g_t_005cDeclareTextSymbol>`__)

               The optional ``nargs`` and ``optargdefault`` arguments
               play the same role here as in ``\newcommand`` (see
               ```\newcommand`` &
               ``\renewcommand`` <#g_t_005cnewcommand-_0026-_005crenewcommand>`__).
               Briefly, ``nargs`` is an integer from 0 to 9 specifying
               the number of arguments that the defined command
               ``\``\ ``cmd`` takes. This number includes any optional
               argument. Omitting this argument is the same as
               specifying 0, meaning that ``\``\ ``cmd`` will have no
               arguments. And, if ``optargdefault`` is present then the
               first argument of ``\``\ ``cmd`` is optional, with
               default value ``optargdefault`` (which may be the empty
               string). If ``optargdefault`` is not present then
               ``\``\ ``cmd`` does not take an optional argument.

               Give a default definition for ``\``\ ``cmd``, for when
               that command is not defined in the encoding currently in
               force. This default should only use encodings known to be
               available.

               This makes ``\copyright`` available.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \DeclareTextCommandDefault{\copyright}{\textcircled{c}}

               It uses only an encoding (OMS) that is always available.

               The ``\DeclareTextCommandDefault`` should not occur in
               the encoding definition files since those files should
               declare only commands for use when you select that
               encoding. It should instead be in a package.

               As with the related non-default commands, the
               ``\ProvideTextCommandDefault`` has exactly the same
               behavior as ``\DeclareTextCommandDefault`` except that it
               does nothing if ``\``\ ``cmd`` is already defined (see

               So, packages can use it to provide fallbacks that other
               packages can improve upon.

               Access an accented glyph directly, that is, without
               having to put an accent over a separate character.

               This line from ``t1enc.def`` means that ``\^o`` will
               cause LaTeX to typeset lowercaseÂ â\ ``o``\ â by taking
               the character directly from slot 224 in the font.

               See ```fontenc`` package <#fontenc-package>`__, for a
               list of common encodings. The ``simple_object`` should be
               a single character or a single command. The ``slot``
               argument is usually a positive integer represented in
               decimal (although octal or hexadecimal are possible).
               Normally \\\ ``cmd`` has already been declared for this
               encoding, either with ``\DeclareTextAccent`` or with a
               one-argument ``\DeclareTextCommand``. In ``t1enc.def``,
               the above line follows the
               ``\DeclareTextAccent{\^}{T1}{2}`` command.

               If ``\``\ ``cmd`` has already been defined then
               ``\DeclareTextSymbol`` does not give an error but it does
               log the redefinition in the transcript file.

               symbol as described for ``encoding``.

               For example, to declare that if the current encoding has
               no meaning for ``\textdollar`` then use the one from

               Use a symbol or accent not from the current encoding.

               In general, to use a ``fontenc`` command in an encoding
               where it is not defined, and if the command has no
               arguments, then you can use it like this:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \UseTextSymbol{OT1}{\ss}

               which is equivalent to this (note the outer braces form a
               group, so LaTeX reverts back to the prior encoding after
               the ``\ss``):

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     {\fontencoding{OT1}\selectfont\ss}

               Similarly, to use a ``fontenc`` command in an encoding
               where it is not defined, and if the command has one
               argument, you can use it like this:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \UseTextAccent{OT1}{\'}{a}

               which is equivalent to this (again note the outer braces
               forming a group):

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     {fontencoding{OT1}\selectfont\'{\fontencoding{enc_in_use}\selectfont a}}

               Here, ``enc_in_use`` is the encoding in force before this
               sequence of commands, so that â\ ``a``\ â is typeset
               using the current encoding and only the accent is taken
               from ``OT1``.

               :name: Font-styles-1
               :class: section

            The following type style commands are supported by LaTeX.

            In the table below the listed commands, the ``\text...``
            commands, are used with an argument as in
            ``\textit{``\ ``text``\ ``}``. This is the preferred form.
            But shown after it in parenthesis is the corresponding
            *declaration form*, which is often useful. This form takes
            no arguments, as in ``{\itshape``\ ``text``\ ``}``. The
            scope of the declaration form lasts until the next type
            style command or the end of the current group. In addition,
            each has an environment form such as
            ``\begin{itshape}...\end{itshape}``, which weâll describe
            further at the end of the section.

            These commands, in any of the three forms, are cumulative;
            for instance you can get bold sans serif by saying either of
            ``\sffamily\bfseries`` or ``\bfseries\sffamily``.

            One advantage of these commands is that they automatically
            insert italic corrections if needed (see
            ```\/`` <#g_t_005c_002f>`__). Specifically, they insert the
            italic correction unless the following character is in the
            list ``\nocorrlist``, which by default consists of period
            and comma. To suppress the automatic insertion of italic
            correction, use ``\nocorr`` at the start or end of the
            command argument, such as ``\textit{\nocorr text}`` or
            ``\textsc{text \nocorr}``.

            ``\textrm (\rmfamily)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextrm>`__
               Roman.

            ``\textit (\itshape)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextit>`__
               Italics.

            ``\textmd (\mdseries)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextmd>`__
               Medium weight (default).

            ``\textbf (\bfseries)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextbf>`__
               Boldface.

            ``\textup (\upshape)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextup>`__
               Upright (default).

            ``\textsl (\slshape)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextsl>`__
               Slanted.

            ``\textsf (\sffamily)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextsf>`__
               Sans serif.

            ``\textsc (\scshape)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextsc>`__
               Small caps.

               Typewriter.

            ``\textnormal (\normalfont)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextnormal>`__
               Main document font.

            Although it also changes fonts, the
            ``\emph{``\ ``text``\ ``}`` command is semantic, for
            ``text`` to be emphasized, and should not be used as a
            substitute for ``\textit``. For example,
            ``\emph{``\ ``start text``\ ``\emph{``\ ``middle text``\ ``}``\ ``end text``\ ``}``
            will result in the ``start text`` and ``end text`` in
            italics, but ``middle text`` will be in roman.

            LaTeX also provides the following commands, which
            unconditionally switch to the given style, that is, are
            *not* cumulative. They are used as declarations:
            ``{\``\ ``cmd``\ ``...}`` instead of
            ``\``\ ``cmd``\ ``{...}``.

            (The unconditional commands below are an older version of
            font switching. The earlier commands are an improvement in
            most circumstances. But sometimes an unconditional font
            switch is what is needed.)

               Small caps.

            ``\sf`` `Â¶ <#index-_005csf>`__
               Sans serif.

            ``\sl`` `Â¶ <#index-_005csl>`__

               Slanted (oblique).

            ``\tt`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctt>`__

               Typewriter (monospace, fixed-width).

            The ``\em`` command is the unconditional version of
            ``\emph``.

            The following commands are for use in math mode. They are
            not cumulative, so ``\mathbf{\mathit{``\ ``symbol``\ ``}}``
            does not create a boldface and italic ``symbol``; instead,
            it will just be in italics. This is because typically math
            symbols need consistent typographic treatment, regardless of
            the surrounding environment.

            ``\mathrm`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmathrm>`__
               Roman, for use in math mode.

            ``\mathbf`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmathbf>`__
               Boldface, for use in math mode.

            ``\mathsf`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmathsf>`__
               Sans serif, for use in math mode.

            ``\mathtt`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmathtt>`__
               Typewriter, for use in math mode.

            ``\mathit``
            ``(\mit)``
               Italics, for use in math mode.

            ``\mathnormal`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmathnormal>`__
               For use in math mode, e.g., inside another type style
               declaration.

            ``\mathcal`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmathcal>`__
               Calligraphic letters, for use in math mode.

            In addition, the command ``\mathversion{bold}`` can be used
            for switching to bold letters and symbols in formulas.
            ``\mathversion{normal}`` restores the default.

            Finally, the command ``\oldstylenums{``\ ``numerals``\ ``}``
            will typeset so-called âold-styleâ numerals, which have
            differing heights and depths (and sometimes widths) from the
            standard âliningâ numerals, which all have the same height
            as uppercase letters. LaTeXâs default fonts support this,
            and will respect ``\textbf`` (but not other styles; there
            are no italic old-style numerals in Computer Modern). Many
            other fonts have old-style numerals also; sometimes package
            options are provided to make them the default. FAQ entry:

            The commands are listed here in declaration (not
            environment) form, since that is how they are typically
            used. For example.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{quotation} \small
                    The Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao.
                  \end{quotation}

            Here, the scope of the ``\small`` lasts until the end of the
            ``quotation`` environment. It would also end at the next
            type style command or the end of the current group, so you
            could enclose it in curly braces
            ``{\small This text is typeset in the small font.}``.

            Trying to use these commands in math, as with
            ``$\small mv^2/2$``, results in
            â\ ``LaTeX Font Warning: Command \small invalid in math mode``\ â,
            and the font size doesnât change. To work with a too-large
            formula, often the best option is to use the ``displaymath``
            environment (see `Math formulas <#Math-formulas>`__), or one
            of the environments from the ``amsmath`` package. For inline
            mathematics, such as in a table of formulas, an alternative
            is something like ``{\small $mv^2/2$}``. (Sometimes
            ``\scriptsize`` and ``\scriptstyle`` are confused. Both
            change the font size, but the latter also changes a number
            of other aspects of how mathematics is typeset. See `Math
            styles <#Math-styles>`__.)

            An *environment form* of each of these commands is also
            defined; for instance, ``\begin{tiny}...\end{tiny}``.
            However, in practice this form can easily lead to unwanted
            spaces at the beginning and/or end of the environment
            without careful consideration, so itâs generally less
            error-prone to stick to the declaration form.

            (Aside: Technically, due to the way LaTeX defines ``\begin``
            and ``\end``, nearly every command that does not take an
            argument technically has an environment form. But in almost
            all cases, it would only cause confusion to use it. The
            reason for mentioning the environment form of the font size
            declarations specifically is that this particular use is not
            rare.)

            There are a large number of valid encodings. The most common

            most widespread European languages (German, French, Italian,
            Polish and others), which allows TeX to hyphenate words
            containing accented letters. For more, see

            medium width, unless both weight and width are ``m``, in
            which case use just one (â\ ``m``\ â).

            ``\fontshape{``\ ``shape``\ ``}``
            `Â¶ <#index-_005cfontshape>`__
            Select font shape. Valid shapes are:

            .. list-table::

               - 

                  - ``n``
                  - Upright (normal)
               - 

                  - ``it``
                  - Italic
               - 

                  - ``sl``
                  - Slanted (oblique)
               - 

                  - ``sc``
                  - Small caps
               - 

                  - ``ui``

               - 

                  - ``ol``
                  - Outline

            The two last shapes are not available for most font
            families, and small caps are often missing as well.

            ``\fontsize{``\ ``size``\ ``}{``\ ``skip``\ ``}``
            `Â¶ <#index-_005cfontsize>`__
            Set the font size and the line spacing. The unit of both
            parameters defaults to points (``pt``). The line spacing is
            the nominal vertical space between lines, baseline to
            baseline. It is stored in the parameter ``\baselineskip``.
            The default ``\baselineskip`` for the Computer Modern
            typeface is 1.2 times the ``\fontsize``. Changing
            ``\baselineskip`` directly is inadvisable since its value is
            reset every time a size change happens; instead use
            ``\baselinestretch``. (see ```\baselineskip`` &
            ``\baselinestretch`` <#g_t_005cbaselineskip-_0026-_005cbaselinestretch>`__).

            ``\linespread{``\ ``factor``\ ``}``
            `Â¶ <#index-_005clinespread>`__
            Equivalent to
            ``\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{``\ ``factor``\ ``}``, and
            therefore must be followed by ``\selectfont`` to have any
            effect. Best specified in the preamble. See
            ```\baselineskip`` &
            ``\baselinestretch`` <#g_t_005cbaselineskip-_0026-_005cbaselinestretch>`__,
            for using ``setspace`` package instead.

            ``\selectfont`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cselectfont>`__
            | The effects of the font commands described above do not
              happen until ``\selectfont`` is called, as in
              ``\fontfamily{``\ ``familyname``\ ``}\selectfont``. It is
              often useful to put this in a macro:
            | ``\newcommand*{\myfont}{\fontfamily{``\ ``familyname``\ ``}\selectfont}``
            | (see ```\newcommand`` &
              ``\renewcommand`` <#g_t_005cnewcommand-_0026-_005crenewcommand>`__).

            ``\usefont{``\ ``enc``\ ``}{``\ ``family``\ ``}{``\ ``series``\ ``}{``\ ``shape``\ ``}``
            `Â¶ <#index-_005cusefont>`__
            The same as invoking ``\fontencoding``, ``\fontfamily``,
            ``\fontseries`` and ``\fontshape`` with the given
            parameters, followed by ``\selectfont``. For example:

                  \twocolumn
                  \twocolumn[prelim one column text]

            Start a new page and produce two-column output. If the
            document is given the class option ``twocolumn`` then this
            is the default (see `Document class
            options <#Document-class-options>`__). This command is
            fragile (see ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            If the optional ``prelim one column text`` argument is
            present, it is typeset in one-column mode before the
            two-column typesetting starts.

            These parameters control typesetting in two-column output:

            ``\columnsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ccolumnsep>`__
               The distance between columns. The default is 35pt. Change
               it with a command such as
               ``\setlength{\columnsep}{40pt}``. You must change it
               before the two column mode starts; in the preamble is a
               good place.

            ``\columnseprule`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ccolumnseprule>`__
               The width of the rule between columns. The default is
               0pt, meaning that there is no rule. Otherwise, the rule
               appears halfway between the two columns. Change it with a
               command such as ``\setlength{\columnseprule}{0.4pt}``,
               before the two-column mode starts.

            ``\columnwidth`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ccolumnwidth>`__
               The width of a single column. In one-column mode this is
               equal to ``\textwidth``. In two-column mode by default
               LaTeX sets the width of each of the two columns,
               ``\columnwidth``, to be half of ``\textwidth`` minus
               ``\columnsep``.

            In a two-column document, the starred environments
            ``table*`` and ``figure*`` are two columns wide, whereas the
            unstarred environments ``table`` and ``figure`` take up only
            one column (see ```figure`` <#figure>`__ and see
            ```table`` <#table>`__). LaTeX places starred floats at the
            top of a page. The following parameters control float
            behavior of two-column output.

            ``\dbltopfraction`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cdbltopfraction>`__
            The maximum fraction at the top of a two-column page that
            may be occupied by two-column wide floats. The default is
            0.7, meaning that the height of a ``table*`` or ``figure*``
            environment must not exceed ``0.7\textheight``. If the
            height of your starred float environment exceeds this then
            you can take one of the following actions to prevent it from
            floating all the way to the back of the document:

            -  Use the ``[tp]`` location specifier to tell LaTeX to try
               to put the bulky float on a page by itself, as well as at
               the top of a page.
            -  Use the ``[t!]`` location specifier to override the
               effect of ``\dbltopfraction`` for this particular float.
            -  Increase the value of ``\dbltopfraction`` to a suitably
               large number, to avoid going to float pages so soon.

            You can redefine it, as with
            ``\renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{0.9}``.

            ``\dblfloatpagefraction``
            `Â¶ <#index-_005cdblfloatpagefraction>`__
            For a float page of two-column wide floats, this is the
            minimum fraction that must be occupied by floats, limiting
            the amount of blank space. LaTeXâs default is ``0.5``.
            Change it with ``\renewcommand``.

            ``\dblfloatsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cdblfloatsep>`__
            On a float page of two-column wide floats, this length is
            the distance between floats, at both the top and bottom of
            the page. The default is ``12pt plus2pt minus2pt`` for a
            document set at ``10pt`` or ``11pt``, and
            ``14pt plus2pt minus4pt`` for a document set at ``12pt``.

            ``\dbltextfloatsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cdbltextfloatsep>`__
            This length is the distance between a multi-column float at
            the top or bottom of a page and the main text. The default
            is ``20pt plus2pt minus4pt``.

            ``\dbltopnumber`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cdbltopnumber>`__
            On a float page of two-column wide floats, this counter
            gives the maximum number of floats allowed at the top of the
            page. The LaTeX default is ``2``.

            This example uses ``\twocolumn``\ âs optional argument of to
            create a title that spans the two-column article:

               :class: section

            Make all pages in the document after this declaration have
            the same height, by stretching the vertical space where
            necessary to fill out the page. This is most often used when
            making two-sided documents since the differences in facing
            pages can be glaring.

            If TeX cannot satisfactorily stretch the vertical space in a
            page then you get a message like
            â\ ``Underfull \vbox (badness 10000) has occurred while \output is active``\ â.
            If you get that, one option is to change to
            ``\raggedbottom`` (see
            ```\raggedbottom`` <#g_t_005craggedbottom>`__).
            Alternatively, you can adjust the ``textheight`` to make
            compatible pages, or you can add some vertical stretch glue
            between lines or between paragraphs, as in
            ``\setlength{\parskip}{0ex plus0.1ex}``. Your last option is
            to, in a final editing stage, adjust the height of
            individual pages (see
            ```\enlargethispage`` <#g_t_005cenlargethispage>`__).

            The ``\flushbottom`` state is the default only if you select
            the ``twocolumn`` document class option (see `Document class
            options <#Document-class-options>`__), and for indexes made

            Make all later pages the natural height of the material on
            that page; no rubber vertical lengths will be stretched.
            Thus, in a two-sided document the facing pages may be
            different heights. This command can go at any point in the
            document body. See

               at 10pt then it is â\ ``0.25in``\ â, and at 11pt or 12pt
               it is â\ ``0.275in``\ â.

            ``\footskip`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cfootskip>`__

               Distance from the baseline of the last line of text to
               the baseline of the page footer. The default in the
               ``article`` and ``report`` classes is â\ ``30pt``\ â. In
               the ``book`` class the default is: when the type size is
               10pt the default is â\ ``0.35in``\ â, while at 11pt it is
               â\ ``0.38in``\ â, and at 12pt it is â\ ``30pt``\ â.

            ``\linewidth`` `Â¶ <#index-_005clinewidth>`__

               Width of the current line, decreased for each nested
               ``list`` (see ```list`` <#list>`__). That is, the nominal
               value for ``\linewidth`` is to equal ``\textwidth`` but
               for each nested list the ``\linewidth`` is decreased by
               the sum of that listâs ``\leftmargin`` and
               ``\rightmargin`` (see ```itemize`` <#itemize>`__).

            ``\marginparpush`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmarginparpush>`__
            ``\marginsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmarginsep>`__
            ``\marginparwidth`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmarginparwidth>`__

               The minimum vertical space between two marginal notes,
               the horizontal space between the text body and the
               marginal notes, and the horizontal width of the notes.

               Normally marginal notes appear on the outside of the
               page, but the declaration ``\reversemarginpar`` changes
               that (and ``\normalmarginpar`` changes it back).

               The defaults for ``\marginparpush`` in both ``book`` and
               ``article`` classes are: â\ ``7pt``\ â if the document is
               set at 12pt, and â\ ``5pt``\ â if the document is set at
               11pt or 10pt.

               For ``\marginsep``, in ``article`` class the default is
               â\ ``10pt``\ â except if the document is set at 10pt and
               in two-column mode where the default is â\ ``11pt``\ â.

               For ``\marginsep`` in ``book`` class the default is
               â\ ``10pt``\ â in two-column mode and â\ ``7pt``\ â in
               one-column mode.

               For ``\marginparwidth`` in both ``book`` and ``article``
               classes, in two-column mode the default is 60% of
               ``\paperwidth â \textwidth``, while in one-column mode it
               is 50% of that distance.

            ``\oddsidemargin`` `Â¶ <#index-_005coddsidemargin-1>`__
            ``\evensidemargin`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cevensidemargin-1>`__

               The ``\oddsidemargin`` length is the extra distance
               between the left side of the page and the textâs left
               margin, on odd-numbered pages when the document class
               option ``twoside`` is chosen and on all pages when
               ``oneside`` is in effect. When ``twoside`` is in effect,
               on even-numbered pages the extra distance on the left is
               ``\evensidemargin``.

               LaTeXâs default is that ``\oddsidemargin`` is 40% of the
               difference between ``\paperwidth`` and ``\textwidth``,
               and ``\evensidemargin`` is the remainder.

            ``\paperheight`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cpaperheight>`__

               The height of the paper, as distinct from the height of
               the print area. Normally set with a document class
               option, as in ``\documentclass[a4paper]{article}`` (see
               `Document class options <#Document-class-options>`__).

            ``\paperwidth`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cpaperwidth>`__

               The width of the paper, as distinct from the width of the
               print area. Normally set with a document class option, as
               in ``\documentclass[a4paper]{article}`` (see `Document
               class options <#Document-class-options>`__).

            ``\textheight`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextheight>`__

               The normal vertical height of the page body. If the
               document is set at a nominal type size of 10pt then for
               an ``article`` or ``report`` the default is
               â\ ``43\baselineskip``\ â, while for a ``book`` it is
               â\ ``41\baselineskip``\ â. At a type size of 11pt the
               default is â\ ``38\baselineskip``\ â for all document
               classes. At 12pt it is â\ ``36\baselineskip``\ â for all
               classes.

            ``\textwidth`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextwidth>`__

               The full horizontal width of the entire page body. For an
               ``article`` or ``report`` document, the default is
               â\ ``345pt``\ â when the chosen type size is 10pt, the
               default is â\ ``360pt``\ â at 11pt, and it is
               â\ ``390pt``\ â at 12pt. For a ``book`` document, the
               default is â\ ``4.5in``\ â at a type size of 10pt, and
               â\ ``5in``\ â at 11pt or 12pt.

               In multi-column output, ``\textwidth`` remains the width
               of the entire page body, while ``\columnwidth`` is the
               width of one column (see
               ```\twocolumn`` <#g_t_005ctwocolumn>`__).

               In lists (see ```list`` <#list>`__), ``\textwidth``
               remains the width of the entire page body (and
               ``\columnwidth`` the width of the entire column), while
               ``\linewidth`` may decrease for nested lists.

               Inside a minipage (see ```minipage`` <#minipage>`__) or
               ``\parbox`` (see ```\parbox`` <#g_t_005cparbox>`__), all
               the width-related parameters are set to the specified
               width, and revert to their normal values at the end of
               the ``minipage`` or ``\parbox``.

            ``\hsize`` `Â¶ <#index-_005chsize>`__

               This entry is included for completeness: ``\hsize`` is
               the TeX primitive parameter used when text is broken into
               lines. It should not be used in normal LaTeX documents.

            ``\topmargin`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctopmargin>`__

               Space between the top of the TeX page (one inch from the
               top of the paper, by default) and the top of the header.
               The value is computed based on many other parameters:
               ``\paperheight â 2in â \headheight â \headsep â \textheight â \footskip``,
               and then divided by two.

            ``\topskip`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctopskip>`__

               Minimum distance between the top of the page body and the
               baseline of the first line of text. For the standard
               classes, the default is the same as the font size, e.g.,
               â\ ``10pt``\ â at a type size of 10pt.

               :name: g_t_005cbaselineskip-_0026-_005cbaselinestretch-1
               :class: section

            The ``\baselineskip`` is a rubber length (see
            `Lengths <#Lengths>`__). It gives the *leading*, the normal
            distance between lines in a paragraph, from baseline to
            baseline.

            Ordinarily document authors do not directly change
            ``\baselineskip`` while writing. Instead, it is set by the
            low level font selection command ``\fontsize`` (see `low
            level font commands
            fontsize <#low-level-font-commands-fontsize>`__). The
            ``\baselineskip``\ âs value is reset every time a font
            change happens and so any direct change to ``\baselineskip``
            would vanish the next time there was a font switch. For how
            to influence line spacing, see the discussion of
            ``\baselinestretch`` below.

            Usually, a fontâs size and baseline skip is assigned by the
            font designer. These numbers are nominal in the sense that
            if, for instance, a fontâs style file has the command
            ``\fontsize{10pt}{12pt}`` then that does not mean that the
            characters in the font are 10pt tall; for instance,
            parentheses and accented capitals may be taller. Nor does it
            mean that if the lines are spaced less than 12pt apart then
            they risk touching. Rather these numbers are typographic
            judgements. (Often, the ``\baselineskip`` is about twenty
            percent larger than the font size.)

            The ``\baselineskip`` is not a property of each line but of
            the entire paragraph. As a result, large text in the middle
            of a paragraph, such as a single ``{\Huge Q}``, will be
            squashed into its line. TeX will make sure it doesnât scrape
            up against the line above but wonât change the
            ``\baselineskip`` for that one line to make extra room
            above. For the fix, use a ``\strut`` (see
            ```\strut`` <#g_t_005cstrut>`__).

            The value of ``\baselineskip`` that TeX uses for the
            paragraph is the value in effect at the blank line or
            command that ends the paragraph unit. So if a document
            contains this paragraph then its lines will be scrunched
            together, compared to lines in surrounding paragraphs.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  Many people see a page break between text and a displayed equation as 
                  bad style, so in effect the display is part of the paragraph.
                  Because this display is in footnotesize, the entire paragraph has the
                  baseline spacing matching that size.
                  {\footnotesize $$a+b = c$$}

            The process for making paragraphs is that when a new line is
            added, if the depth of the previous line plus the height of
            the new line is less than ``\baselineskip`` then TeX inserts
            vertical glue to make up the difference. There are two fine
            points. The first is that if the lines would be too close
            together, closer than ``\lineskiplimit``, then TeX instead
            uses ``\lineskip`` as the interline glue. The second is that
            TeX doesnât actually use the depth of the previous line.
            Instead it uses ``\prevdepth``, which usually contains that
            depth. But at the beginning of the paragraph (or any
            vertical list) or just after a rule, ``\prevdepth`` has the
            value -1000pt and this special value tells TeX not to insert
            any interline glue at the paragraph start.

            In the standard classes ``\lineskiplimit`` is 0pt and
            ``\lineskip`` is 1pt. By the prior paragraph then, the
            distance between lines can approach zero but if it becomes
            zero (or less than zero) then the lines jump to 1pt apart.

            Sometimes authors must, for editing purposes, put the
            document in double space or one-and-a-half space. The right
            way to influence the interline distance is via
            ``\baselinestretch``. It scales ``\baselineskip``, and has a
            default value of 1.0. It is a command, not a length, and
            does not take effect until a font change happens, so set the
            scale factor like this:
            ``\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.5}\selectfont``.

            The most straightforward way to change the line spacing for
            an entire document is to put
            ``\linespread{``\ ``factor``\ ``}`` in the preamble. For
            double spacing, take ``factor`` to be 1.6 and for
            one-and-a-half spacing use 1.3. These numbers are rough: for
            instance, since the ``\baselineskip`` is about 1.2 times the
            font size, multiplying by 1.6 gives a baseline skip to font
            size ratio of about 2. (The ``\linespread`` command is
            defined as
            ``\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{``\ ``factor``\ ``}`` so
            it also wonât take effect until a font setting happens. But
            that always takes place at the start of a document, so there
            you donât need to follow it with ``\selectfont``.)

            A simpler approach is the ``setspace`` package. The basic
            example:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \usepackage{setspace}
                  \doublespacing  % or \onehalfspacing for 1.5

            In the preamble these will start the document off with that
            sizing. But you can also use these declarations in the
            document body to change the spacing from that point forward,
            and consequently there is ``\singlespacing`` to return the
            spacing to normal. In the document body, a better practice
            than using the declarations is to use environments, such as
            ``\begin{doublespace} ... \end{doublespace}``. The package
            also has commands to do arbitrary spacing:
            ``\setstretch{``\ ``factor``\ ``}`` and
            ``\begin{spacing}{``\ ``factor``\ ``} ... \end{spacing}``.
            This package also keeps the line spacing single-spaced in
            places where that is typically desirable, such as footnotes
            and figure captions. See the package documentation.

            .. rubric:: 5.7 Floats
               :name: Floats-1
               :class: section

            Some typographic elements, such as figures and tables,
            cannot be broken across pages. They must be typeset outside
            of the normal flow of text, for instance floating to the top
            of a later page.

            LaTeX can have a number of different classes of floating
            material. The default is the two classes, ``figure`` (see
            ```figure`` <#figure>`__) and ``table`` (see
            ```table`` <#table>`__), but you can create a new class with
            the package ``float``.

            Within any one float class LaTeX always respects the order,
            so that the first figure in a document source must be
            typeset before the second figure. However, LaTeX may mix the
            classes, so it can happen that while the first table appears
            in the source before the first figure, it appears in the
            output after it.

            The placement of floats is subject to parameters, given
            below, that limit the number of floats that can appear at
            the top of a page, and the bottom, etc. If so many floats
            are queued that the limits prevent them all from fitting on
            a page then LaTeX places what it can and defers the rest to
            the next page. In this way, floats may end up being typeset
            far from their place in the source. In particular, a float
            that is big may migrate to the end of the document. In which
            event, because all floats in a class must appear in
            sequential order, every following float in that class also
            appears at the end.

            In addition to changing the parameters, for each float you
            can tweak where the float placement algorithm tries to place
            it by using its ``placement`` argument. The possible values
            are a sequence of the letters below. The default for both
            ``figure`` and ``table``, in both ``article`` and ``book``
            classes, is ``tbp``.

            ``t``
               (Top)âat the top of a text page.

            ``b``
               (Bottom)âat the bottom of a text page. (However, ``b`` is
               not allowed for full-width floats (``figure*``) with
               double-column output. To ameliorate this, use the
               ``stfloats`` or ``dblfloatfix`` package, but see the
               discussion at caveats in the FAQ:
               https://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-2colfloat.

            ``h``
               (Here)âat the position in the text where the ``figure``
               environment appears. However, ``h`` is not allowed by
               itself; ``t`` is automatically added.

               To absolutely force a float to appear âhereâ, you can
               ``\usepackage{float}`` and use the ``H`` specifier which
               it defines. For further discussion, see the FAQ entry at
               https://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-figurehere.

            ``p`` `Â¶ <#index-float-page>`__
               (Page of floats)âon a separate *float page*, which is a
               page containing no text, only floats.

            ``!``
               Used in addition to one of the above; for this float
               only, LaTeX ignores the restrictions on both the number
               of floats that can appear and the relative amounts of
               float and non-float text on the page. The ``!`` specifier
               does *not* mean âput the float hereâ; see above.

            Note: the order in which letters appear in the ``placement``
            argument does not change the order in which LaTeX tries to
            place the float; for instance, ``btp`` has the same effect
            as ``tbp``. All that ``placement`` does is that if a letter
            is not present then the algorithm does not try that
            location. Thus, LaTeXâs default of ``tbp`` is to try every
            location except placing the float where it occurs in the
            source.

            To prevent LaTeX from moving floats to the end of the
            document or a chapter you can use a ``\clearpage`` command
            to start a new page and insert all pending floats. If a
            pagebreak is undesirable then you can use the ``afterpage``
            package and issue ``\afterpage{\clearpage}``. This will wait
            until the current page is finished and then flush all
            outstanding floats.

            LaTeX can typeset a float before where it appears in the
            source (although on the same output page) if there is a
            ``t`` specifier in the ``placement`` parameter. If this is
            not desired, and deleting the ``t`` is not acceptable as it
            keeps the float from being placed at the top of the next
            page, then you can prevent it by either using the
            ``flafter`` package or using the command
            ``\suppressfloats[t]``, which causes floats for the top
            position on this page to moved to the next page.

            Parameters relating to fractions of pages occupied by float
            and non-float text (change them with
            ``\renewcommand{``\ ``parameter``\ ``}{``\ ``decimal between 0 and 1``\ ``}``):

            ``\bottomfraction`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cbottomfraction>`__

               The maximum fraction of the page allowed to be occupied
               by floats at the bottom; default â\ ``.3``\ â.

            ``\floatpagefraction`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cfloatpagefraction>`__

               The minimum fraction of a float page that must be
               occupied by floats; default â\ ``.5``\ â.

            ``\textfraction`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextfraction>`__

               Minimum fraction of a page that must be text; if floats
               take up too much space to preserve this much text, floats
               will be moved to a different page. The default is
               â\ ``.2``\ â.

            ``\topfraction`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctopfraction>`__

               Maximum fraction at the top of a page that may be
               occupied before floats; default â\ ``.7``\ â.

            Parameters relating to vertical space around floats (change
            them with a command of the form
            ``\setlength{``\ ``parameter``\ ``}{``\ ``length expression``\ ``}``):

            ``\floatsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cfloatsep>`__

               Space between floats at the top or bottom of a page;
               default â\ ``12pt plus2pt minus2pt``\ â.

            ``\intextsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cintextsep>`__

               Space above and below a float in the middle of the main
               text; default â\ ``12pt plus2pt minus2pt``\ â for 10
               point and 11 point documents, and
               â\ ``14pt plus4pt minus4pt``\ â for 12 point documents.

            ``\textfloatsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextfloatsep>`__

               Space between the last (first) float at the top (bottom)
               of a page; default â\ ``20pt plus2pt minus4pt``\ â.

            Counters relating to the number of floats on a page (change
            them with a command of the form
            ``\setcounter{``\ ``ctrname``\ ``}{``\ ``natural number``\ ``}``):

            ``bottomnumber`` `Â¶ <#index-bottomnumber>`__

               Maximum number of floats that can appear at the bottom of
               a text page; default 1.

            ``dbltopnumber`` `Â¶ <#index-dbltopnumber>`__

               Maximum number of full-sized floats that can appear at
               the top of a two-column page; default 2.

            ``topnumber`` `Â¶ <#index-topnumber>`__

               Maximum number of floats that can appear at the top of a
               text page; default 2.

            ``totalnumber`` `Â¶ <#index-totalnumber>`__

               Maximum number of floats that can appear on a text page;
               default 3.

            The principal TeXÂ FAQ entry relating to floats
            https://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-floats contains suggestions for
            relaxing LaTeXâs default parameters to reduce the problem of
            floats being pushed to the end. A full explanation of the
            float placement algorithm is in Frank Mittelbachâs article
            âHow to influence the position of float environments like
            figure and table in LaTeX?â
            (https://www.latex-project.org/publications/2014-FMi-TUB-tb111mitt-float-placement.pdf).

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \caption[short-caption-text]{caption-text}

               Make a caption for a floating environment, such as a
               ``figure`` or ``table`` environment (see
               ```figure`` <#figure>`__ or ```table`` <#table>`__).

               In this example, LaTeX places a caption below the
               vertical blank space that is left by the author for the
               later inclusion of a picture.

               .. container:: example

                       \caption{Alonzo Cushing, Battery A, 4th US Artillery.}
                       \label{fig:CushingPic}
                     \end{figure}

               The ``\caption`` command will label the ``caption-text``
               with something like â\ ``FigureÂ 1:``\ â for an article or
               â\ ``FigureÂ 1.1:``\ â for a book. The text is centered if
               it is shorter than the text width, or set as an
               unindented paragraph if it takes more than one line.

               In addition to placing the ``caption-text`` in the
               output, the ``\caption`` command also saves that
               information for use in a list of figures or list of
               tables (see `Table of contents, list of figures, list of
               tables <#Table-of-contents-etc_002e>`__).

               Here the ``\caption`` command uses the optional
               ``short-caption-text``, so that the shorter text appears
               in the list of tables, rather than the longer
               ``caption-text``.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{table}

                       \begin{tabular}{|*{3}{c}|}

                         The \textit{Lo Shu} magic square, which is unique among
                         squares of order three up to rotation and reflection.}
                       \label{tab:LoShu}
                     \end{table}

               LaTeX will label the ``caption-text`` with something like
               â\ ``TableÂ 1:``\ â for an article or â\ ``TableÂ 1.1:``\ â
               for a book.

               The caption can appear at the top of the ``figure`` or
               ``table``. For instance, that would happen in the prior
               example by putting the ``\caption`` between the
               ``\centering`` and the ``\begin{tabular}``.

               Different floating environments are numbered separately,
               by default. It is ``\caption`` that updates the counter,
               and so any ``\label`` must come after the ``\caption``.
               The counter for the ``figure`` environment is named
               ``figure``, and similarly the counter for the ``table``
               environment is ``table``.

               The text that will be put in the list of figures or list
               of tables is moving argument. If you get the LaTeX error
               â\ ``! Argument of \@caption has an extra }``\ â then you
               must put ``\protect`` in front of any fragile commands.
               See ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__.

               The ``caption`` package has many options to adjust how
               the caption appears, for example changing the font size,
               making the caption be hanging text rather than set as a
               paragraph, or making the caption always set as a
               paragraph rather than centered when it is short.

         Structure your text into divisions: parts, chapters, sections,
         etc. All sectioning commands have the same form, one of:

               sectioning-command{title}

         ``\subsection{Motivation}``.

         available in all of LaTeXâs standard document classes ``book``,
         ``report``, andÂ ``article``, except that ``\chapter`` is not

               - ``\subparagraph``
               - 5

         All these commands have a ``*``-form that prints ``title`` as
         usual but does not number it and does not make an entry in the
         table of contents. An example of using this is for an appendix
         in an ``article``. The input ``\appendix\section{Appendix}``
         gives the output â\ ``A Appendix``\ â (see
         ```\appendix`` <#g_t_005cappendix>`__). You can lose the
         numberingÂ â\ ``A``\ â by instead entering
         ``\section*{Appendix}`` (articles often omit a table of
         contents and have simple page headers so the other differences
         from the ``\section`` command may not matter).

         The section title ``title`` provides the heading in the main
         text, but it may also appear in the table of contents and in
         the running head or foot (see `Page styles <#Page-styles>`__).
         You may not want the same text in these places as in the main
         text. All of these commands have an optional argument
         ``toc-title`` for these other places.

         The level number in the table above determines which sectional
         units are numbered, and which appear in the table of contents.
         If the sectioning commandâs ``level`` is less than or equal to
         the value of the counter ``secnumdepth`` then the titles for
         this sectioning command will be numbered (see
         `Sectioning/secnumdepth <#Sectioning_002fsecnumdepth>`__). And,
         if ``level`` is less than or equal to the value of the counter
         ``tocdepth`` then the table of contents will have an entry for
         this sectioning unit (see
         `Sectioning/tocdepth <#Sectioning_002ftocdepth>`__).

         LaTeX expects that before you have a ``\subsection`` you will
         have a ``\section`` and, in a ``book`` class document, that
         before a ``\section`` you will have a ``\chapter``. Otherwise
         you can get something like a subsection numbered
         â\ ``3.0.1``\ â.

         | LaTeX lets you change the appearance of the sectional units.
           As a simple example, you can change the section numbering to
           uppercase letters with this (in the preamble):
         | ``\renewcommand\thesection{\Alph{section}}`` . (See
           ```\alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol``: Printing
           counters <#g_t_005calph-_005cAlph-_005carabic-_005croman-_005cRoman-_005cfnsymbol>`__.)
           CTAN has many packages that make this adjustment easier,
           notably ``titlesec``.

         Two counters relate to the appearance of headings made by
         sectioning commands.

         ``secnumdepth`` `Â¶ <#index-secnumdepth>`__

            Controls which sectioning unit are numbered. Setting the
            counter with ``\setcounter{secnumdepth}{``\ ``level``\ ``}``
            will suppress numbering of sectioning at any depth greater
            than ``level`` (see
            ```\setcounter`` <#g_t_005csetcounter>`__). See the above
            table for the level numbers. For instance, if the
            ``secnumdepth`` is 1 in an ``article`` then a
            ``\section{Introduction}`` command will produce output like
            â\ ``1 Introduction``\ â while ``\subsection{Discussion}``
            will produce output like â\ ``Discussion``\ â, without the
            number. LaTeXâs default ``secnumdepth`` isÂ 3 in ``article``
            class and Â 2 in the ``book`` and ``report`` classes.

         ``tocdepth`` `Â¶ <#index-tocdepth>`__

            Controls which sectioning units are listed in the table of
            contents. The setting
            ``\setcounter{tocdepth}{``\ ``level``\ ``}`` makes the
            sectioning units at ``level`` be the smallest ones listed
            (see ```\setcounter`` <#g_t_005csetcounter>`__). See the
            above table for the level numbers. For instance, if
            ``tocdepth`` isÂ 1 then the table of contents will list
            sections but not subsections. LaTeXâs default ``tocdepth``

            Start a document part. The standard LaTeX classes ``book``,
            ``report``, and ``article``, all have this command.

            This produces a document part, in a book.

                  \chapter{ANCESTRY--BIRTH--BOYHOOD.}
                  My family is American, and has been for generations,
                  in all its branches, direct and collateral.

            In each standard class the ``\part`` command outputs a part
            number such as â\ ``Part I``\ â, alone on its line, in
            boldface, and in large type. Then LaTeX outputs ``title``,
            also alone on its line, in bold and in even larger type. In
            class ``book``, the LaTeX default puts each part alone on
            its own page. If the book is two-sided then LaTeX will skip
            a page if needed to have the new part on an odd-numbered
            page. In ``report`` it is again alone on a page, but LaTeX
            wonât force it onto an odd-numbered page. In an ``article``
            LaTeX does not put it on a fresh page, but instead outputs
            the part number and part title onto the main document page.

            The ``*``Â form shows ``title`` but it does not show the part
            number, does not increment the ``part`` counter, and
            produces no table of contents entry.

            The optional argument ``toc-title`` will appear as the part
            title in the table of contents (see `Table of contents, list
            of figures, list of tables <#Table-of-contents-etc_002e>`__)
            and in running headers (see `Page styles <#Page-styles>`__).
            If it is not present then ``title`` will be there. This
            example puts a line break in ``title`` but omits the break
            in the table of contents.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \part[Up from the bottom; my life]{Up from the bottom\\ my life}

            For determining which sectional units are numbered and which
            appear in the table of contents, the level number of a part
            isÂ -1 (see
            `Sectioning/secnumdepth <#Sectioning_002fsecnumdepth>`__,
            and `Sectioning/tocdepth <#Sectioning_002ftocdepth>`__).

            In the class ``article``, if a paragraph immediately follows
            the part title then it is not indented. To get an indent you
            can use the package ``indentfirst``.

            One package to change the behavior of ``\part`` is
            ``titlesec``. See its documentation on CTAN.

                  \chapter[toc-title]{title}

            Start a chapter. The standard LaTeX classes ``book`` and
            ``report`` have this command but ``article`` does not.

            This produces a chapter.

                  \chapter{Loomings}
                  Call me Ishmael.
                  Some years ago---never mind how long precisely---having little or no
                  money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I
                  thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
                  the world.

            The LaTeX default starts each chapter on a fresh page, an
            odd-numbered page if the document is two-sided. It produces
            a chapter number such as â\ ``Chapter 1``\ â in large
            boldface type (the size is ``\huge``). It then puts
            ``title`` on a fresh line, in boldface type that is still
            larger (size ``\Huge``). It also increments the ``chapter``
            counter, adds an entry to the table of contents (see `Table
            of contents, list of figures, list of
            tables <#Table-of-contents-etc_002e>`__), and sets the
            running header information (see `Page
            styles <#Page-styles>`__).

            The ``*``Â form shows ``title`` on a fresh line, in boldface.
            But it does not show the chapter number, does not increment
            the ``chapter`` counter, produces no table of contents
            entry, and does not affect the running header. (If you use
            the page style ``headings`` in a two-sided document then the
            header will be from the prior chapter.) This example
            illustrates.

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \chapter*{Preamble}

            The optional argument ``toc-title`` will appear as the
            chapter title in the table of contents (see `Table of
            contents, list of figures, list of
            tables <#Table-of-contents-etc_002e>`__) and in running
            headers (see `Page styles <#Page-styles>`__). If it is not
            present then ``title`` will be there. This shows the full
            name in the chapter title,

                  \chapter[Weyl]{Hermann Klaus Hugo (Peter) Weyl (1885--1955)}

            but only â\ ``Weyl``\ â on the contents page. This puts a
            line break in the title but that doesnât work well with
            running headers so it omits the break in the contents

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \chapter[Given it all; my story]{Given it all\\ my story}

            For determining which sectional units are numbered and which
            appear in the table of contents, the level number of a
            chapter isÂ 0 (see
            `Sectioning/secnumdepth <#Sectioning_002fsecnumdepth>`__ and
            see `Sectioning/tocdepth <#Sectioning_002ftocdepth>`__).

            The paragraph that follows the chapter title is not
            indented, as is a standard typographical practice. To get an
            indent use the package ``indentfirst``.

            You can change what is shown for the chapter number. To
            change it to something like â\ ``Lecture 1``\ â, put in the
            preamble either ``\renewcommand{\chaptername}{Lecture}`` or
            this (see ```\makeatletter`` &
            ``\makeatother`` <#g_t_005cmakeatletter-_0026-_005cmakeatother>`__).

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \makeatletter
                  \renewcommand{\@chapapp}{Lecture}
                  \makeatother

            To make this change because of the primary language for the
            document, see the package ``babel``.

            In a two-sided document LaTeX puts a chapter on odd-numbered
            page, if necessary leaving an even-numbered page that is
            blank except for any running headers. To make that page
            completely blank, seeÂ ```\clearpage`` &
            ``\cleardoublepage`` <#g_t_005cclearpage-_0026-_005ccleardoublepage>`__.

            To change the behavior of the ``\chapter`` command, you can
            copy its definition from the LaTeX format file and make
            adjustments. But there are also many packages on CTAN that
            address this. One is ``titlesec``. See its documentation,
            but the example below gives a sense of what it can do.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \usepackage{titlesec}   % in preamble
                  \titleformat{\chapter}
                    {\Huge\bfseries}  % format of title
                    {}                % label, such as 1.2 for a subsection
                    {0pt}             % length of separation between label and title
                    {}                % before-code hook

            This omits the chapter number â\ ``Chapter 1``\ â from the
            page but unlike ``\chapter*`` it keeps the chapter in the
            table of contents and the running headers.

            Start a section. The standard LaTeX classes ``article``,
            ``book``, and ``report`` all have this command.

                  In this Part we tend to be more interested in the function,
                  in the input-output behavior,
                  than in the details of implementing that behavior.

                  \section{Turing machines}
                  Despite this desire to downplay implementation,
                  we follow the approach of A~Turing that the
                  first step toward defining the set of computable functions
                  is to reflect on the details of what mechanisms can do.

            For the standard LaTeX classes ``book`` and ``report`` the
            default output is like â\ ``1.2``\ ``title``\ â (for
            chapterÂ 1, sectionÂ 2), alone on its line and flush left, in
            boldface and a larger type (the type size is ``\Large``).
            The same holds in ``article`` except that there are no
            chapters in that class so it looks like
            â\ ``2``\ ``title``\ â.

            The ``*``Â form shows ``title``. But it does not show the
            section number, does not increment the ``section`` counter,
            produces no table of contents entry, and does not affect the
            running header. (If you use the page style ``headings`` in a
            two-sided document then the header will be from the prior
            section.)

            The optional argument ``toc-title`` will appear as the
            section title in the table of contents (see `Table of
            contents, list of figures, list of
            tables <#Table-of-contents-etc_002e>`__) and in running
            headers (see `Page styles <#Page-styles>`__). If it is not
            present then ``title`` will be there. This shows the full
            name in the title of the section:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \section[Elizabeth~II]{Elizabeth the Second,
                    by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom,
                    Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen,
                    Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.}

            but only â\ ``Elizabeth II``\ â on the contents page and in
            the headers. This has a line break in ``title`` but that
            does not work with headers so it is omitted from the
            contents and headers.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \section[Truth is, I cheated; my life story]{Truth is,
                    I cheated\\my life story}

            For determining which sectional units are numbered and which
            appear in the table of contents, the level number of a
            section isÂ 1 (see
            `Sectioning/secnumdepth <#Sectioning_002fsecnumdepth>`__ and
            see `Sectioning/tocdepth <#Sectioning_002ftocdepth>`__).

            The paragraph that follows the section title is not
            indented, as is a standard typographical practice. One way
            to get an indent is to use the package ``indentfirst``.

            In general, to change the behavior of the ``\section``
            command, there are a number of options. One is the
            ``\@startsection`` command (see ```\@startsection``:
            Typesetting sectional unit
            headings <#g_t_005c_0040startsection>`__). There are also
            many packages on CTAN that address this, including
            ``titlesec``. See the documentation but the example below
            gives a sense of what they can do.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \usepackage{titlesec}   % in preamble
                  \titleformat{\section}
                    {\normalfont\Large\bfseries}  % format of title
                    {\makebox[1pc][r]{\thesection\hspace{1pc}}} % label
                    {0pt}                   % length of separation between label and title
                    {}                      % before-code hook
                  \titlespacing*{\section}
                    {-1pc}{18pt}{10pt}[10pc]

            That puts the section number in the margin.

                  therefore some functions have no associated machine.

                  \subsection{Cardinality} We will begin with two paradoxes that
                  dramatize the challenge to our intuition posed by comparing the sizes of
                  infinite sets.

            For the standard LaTeX classes ``book`` and ``report`` the
            default output is like â\ ``1.2.3``\ ``title``\ â (for
            chapterÂ 1, sectionÂ 2, subsectionÂ 3), alone on its line and
            flush left, in boldface and a larger type (the type size is
            ``\large``). The same holds in ``article`` except that there
            are no chapters in that class so it looks like
            â\ ``2.3``\ ``title``\ â.

            The ``*``Â form shows ``title``. But it does not show the
            subsection number, does not increment the ``subsection``
            counter, and produces no table of contents entry.

            The optional argument ``toc-title`` will appear as the
            subsection title in the table of contents (see `Table of
            contents, list of figures, list of
            tables <#Table-of-contents-etc_002e>`__). If it is not
            present then ``title`` will be there. This shows the full
            text in the title of the subsection:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \subsection[$\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ paper]{\textit{The Origin of
                    Chemical Elements} by R.A.~Alpher, H.~Bethe, and G.~Gamow}

            but only â\ ``Î±,Î²,Î³ paper``\ â on the contents page.

            For determining which sectional units are numbered and which
            appear in the table of contents, the level number of a
            subsection isÂ 2 (see
            `Sectioning/secnumdepth <#Sectioning_002fsecnumdepth>`__ and
            see `Sectioning/tocdepth <#Sectioning_002ftocdepth>`__).

            The paragraph that follows the subsection title is not
            indented, as is a standard typographical practice. One way
            to get an indent is to use the package ``indentfirst``.

            There are a number of ways to change the behavior of the
            ``\subsection`` command. One is the ``\@startsection``
            command (see ```\@startsection``: Typesetting sectional unit
            headings <#g_t_005c_0040startsection>`__). There are also
            many packages on CTAN that address this, including
            ``titlesec``. See the documentation but the example below
            gives a sense of what they can do.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \usepackage{titlesec}   % in preamble
                  \titleformat{\subsection}[runin]
                    {\normalfont\normalsize\bfseries}  % format of the title
                    {\thesubsection}                   % label
                    {0.6em}                            % space between label and title
                    {}                                 % before-code hook

            That puts the subsection number and ``title`` in the first
            line of text.

                  \subparagraph[toc-title]{title}

            Start a subsubsection, paragraph, or subparagraph. The
            standard LaTeX classes ``article``, ``book``, and ``report``
            all have these commands, although they are not commonly
            used.

            This produces a subsubsection.

            .. container:: example

                  capable of withstanding the effects of load and stresses from 
                  consumer-grade gasoline engine piston rings.

            The default output of each of the three does not change over
            the standard LaTeX classes ``article``, ``book``, and
            ``report``. For ``\subsubsection`` the ``title`` is alone on
            its line, in boldface and normal size type. For
            ``\paragraph`` the ``title`` is inline with the text, not
            indented, in boldface and normal size type. For
            ``\subparagraph`` the ``title`` is inline with the text,
            with a paragraph indent, in boldface and normal size type
            (Because an ``article`` has no chapters its subsubsections
            are numbered and so it looks like
            â\ ``1.2.3``\ ``title``\ â, for sectionÂ 1, subsectionÂ 2, and
            subsubsectionÂ 3. The other two divisions are not numbered.)

            The ``*``Â form shows ``title``. But it does not increment
            the associated counter and produces no table of contents
            entry (and does not show the number for ``\subsubsection``).

            The optional argument ``toc-title`` will appear as the
            division title in the table of contents (see `Table of
            contents, list of figures, list of
            tables <#Table-of-contents-etc_002e>`__). If it is not
            present then ``title`` will be there.

            For determining which sectional units are numbered and which
            appear in the table of contents, the level number of a
            subsubsection isÂ 3, of a paragraph isÂ 4, and of a
            subparagraph isÂ 5 (see
            `Sectioning/secnumdepth <#Sectioning_002fsecnumdepth>`__ and
            see `Sectioning/tocdepth <#Sectioning_002ftocdepth>`__).

            The paragraph that follows the subsubsection title is not
            indented, as is a standard typographical practice. One way
            to get an indent is to use the package ``indentfirst``.

            There are a number of ways to change the behavior of the
            these commands. One is the ``\@startsection`` command (see
            ```\@startsection``: Typesetting sectional unit
            headings <#g_t_005c_0040startsection>`__). There are also
            many packages on CTAN that address this, including
            ``titlesec``. See the documentation on CTAN.

            This does not directly produce any output. But in a ``book``
            or ``report`` document it declares that subsequent
            ``\chapter`` commands start an appendix. In an article it
            does the same, for ``\section`` commands. It also resets the
            ``chapter`` and ``section`` counters toÂ 0 in a book or
            report, and in an article resets the ``section`` and
            ``subsection`` counters.

            the first two will generate output numbered
            â\ ``Chapter 1``\ â and â\ ``Chapter 2``\ â. After the
            ``\appendix`` the numbering will be â\ ``Appendix A``\ â and
            â\ ``Appendix B``\ â. See `Larger ``book``
            template <#Larger-book-template>`__, for another example.

            The ``appendix`` package adds the command ``\appendixpage``
            to put a separate â\ ``Appendices``\ â in the document body
            before the first appendix, and the command
            ``\addappheadtotoc`` to do the same in the table of
            contents. You can reset the name â\ ``Appendices``\ â with a

            Format a ``book`` class document differently according to
            which part of the document is being produced. All three
            commands are optional.

            Traditionally, a bookâs front matter contains such things as
            the title page, an abstract, a table of contents, a preface,
            a list of notations, a list of figures, and a list of
            tables. (Some of these front matter pages, such as the title
            page, are traditionally not numbered.) The back matter may
            contain such things as a glossary, notes, a bibliography,
            and an index.

            The ``\frontmatter`` command makes the pages numbered in
            lowercase roman, and makes chapters not numbered, although
            each chapterâs title appears in the table of contents; if
            you use other sectioning commands here, use the
            ``*``-version (see `Sectioning <#Sectioning>`__).

            The ``\mainmatter`` command changes the behavior back to the
            expected version, and resets the page number.

            The ``\backmatter`` command leaves the page numbering alone
            but switches the chapters back to being not numbered.

            See `Larger ``book`` template <#Larger-book-template>`__,
            for an example using these three commands.

            Used to help redefine the behavior of commands that start
            sectioning divisions such as ``\section`` or
            ``\subsection``.

            Note that the ``titlesec`` package makes manipulation of
            sectioning easier. Further, while most requirements for
            sectioning commands can be satisfied with
            ``\@startsection``, some cannot. For instance, in the
            standard LaTeX ``book`` and ``report`` classes the commands
            ``\chapter`` and ``\report`` are not constructed in this
            way. To make such a command you may want to use the
            ``\secdef`` command.

            Technically, ``\@startsection`` has the form

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \@startsection{name}
                    {level}
                    {indent}
                    {beforeskip}
                    {afterskip}
                    {style}*[toctitle]{title}

            so that issuing

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \renewcommand{\section}{\@startsection{name}
                    {level}
                    {indent}
                    {beforeskip}
                    {afterskip}
                    {style}}

            redefines ``\section`` while keeping its standard calling
            form ``\section*[``\ ``toctitle``\ ``]{``\ ``title``\ ``}``
            (in which, for reminder, the starÂ ``*`` is optional). See
            `Sectioning <#Sectioning>`__. This implies that when you
            write a command like ``\renewcommand{\section}{...}``, the
            ``\@startsection{...}`` must come last in the definition.
            See the examples below.

            ``name``
               Name of the counter used to number the sectioning header.
               This counter must be defined separately. Most commonly
               this is either ``section``, ``subsection``, or
               ``paragraph``. Although in those cases the counter name
               is the same as the sectioning command itself, you donât
               have to use the same name.

               Then ``\the``\ ``name`` displays the title number and
               ``\``\ ``name``\ ``mark`` is for the page headers. See
               the third example below.

            ``level``
               An integer giving the depth of the sectioning command.
               See `Sectioning <#Sectioning>`__, for the list of
               standard level numbers.

               If ``level`` is less than or equal to the value of the
               counter ``secnumdepth`` then titles for this sectioning
               command will be numbered (see
               `Sectioning/secnumdepth <#Sectioning_002fsecnumdepth>`__).
               For instance, if ``secnumdepth`` is 1 in an ``article``
               then the command ``\section{Introduction}`` will produce
               output like â1 Introductionâ while
               ``\subsection{Discussion}`` will produce output like
               âDiscussionâ, without the number prefix.

               If ``level`` is less than or equal to the value of the
               counter ``tocdepth`` then the table of contents will have
               an entry for this sectioning unit (see
               `Sectioning/tocdepth <#Sectioning_002ftocdepth>`__). For
               instance, in an ``article``, if ``tocdepth`` is 1 then
               the table of contents will list sections but not
               subsections.

            ``indent``
               A length giving the indentation of all of the title lines
               with respect to the left margin. To have the title flush
               with the margin use ``0pt``. A negative indentation such
               as ``-\parindent`` will move the title into the left
               margin.

            ``beforeskip``
               The absolute value of this length is the amount of
               vertical space that is inserted before this sectioning
               unitâs title. This space will be discarded if the
               sectioning unit happens to start at the beginning of a
               page. If this number is negative then the first paragraph
               following the header is not indented, if it is
               non-negative then the first paragraph is indented. (Note
               that the negative of ``1pt plus 2pt minus 3pt`` is
               ``-1pt plus -2pt minus -3pt``.)

               For example, if ``beforeskip`` is
               ``-3.5ex plus -1ex minus -0.2ex`` then to start the new
               sectioning unit, LaTeX will add about 3.5 times the
               height of a letter x in vertical space, and the first
               paragraph in the section will not be indented. Using a
               rubber length, with ``plus`` and ``minus``, is good
               practice here since it gives LaTeX more flexibility in
               making up the page (see `Lengths <#Lengths>`__).

               The full accounting of the vertical space between the
               baseline of the line prior to this sectioning unitâs
               header and the baseline of the header is that it is the
               sum of the ``\parskip`` of the text font, the
               ``\baselineskip`` of the title font, and the absolute
               value of the ``beforeskip``. This space is typically
               rubber so it may stretch or shrink. (If the sectioning
               unit starts on a fresh page so that the vertical space is
               discarded then the baseline of the header text will be
               where LaTeX would put the baseline of the first text line
               on that page.)

            ``afterskip``
               This is a length. If ``afterskip`` is non-negative then
               this is the vertical space inserted after the sectioning
               unitâs title header. If it is negative then the title
               header becomes a run-in header, so that it becomes part
               of the next paragraph. In this case the absolute value of
               the length gives the horizontal space between the end of
               the title and the beginning of the following paragraph.
               (Note that the negative of ``1pt plus 2pt minus 3pt`` is
               ``-1pt plus -2pt minus -3pt``.)

               As with ``beforeskip``, using a rubber length, with
               ``plus`` and ``minus`` components, is good practice here
               since it gives LaTeX more flexibility in putting together
               the page.

               If ``afterskip`` is non-negative then the full accounting
               of the vertical space between the baseline of the
               sectioning unitâs header and the baseline of the first
               line of the following paragraph is that it is the sum of
               the ``\parskip`` of the title font, the ``\baselineskip``
               of the text font, and the value of ``after``. That space
               is typically rubber so it may stretch or shrink. (Note
               that because the sign of ``afterskip`` changes the
               sectioning unit headerâs from standalone to run-in, you
               cannot use a negative ``afterskip`` to cancel part of the
               ``\parskip``.)

            ``style``
               Controls the styling of the title. See the examples
               below. Typical commands to use here are ``\centering``,
               ``\raggedright``, ``\normalfont``, ``\hrule``, or
               ``\newpage``. The last command in ``style`` may be one
               that takes one argument, such as ``\MakeUppercase`` or
               ``\fbox`` that takes one argument. The section title will
               be supplied as the argument to this command. For
               instance, setting ``style`` to
               ``\bfseries\MakeUppercase`` would produce titles that are
               bold and uppercase.

            These are LaTeXâs defaults for the first three sectioning
            units that are defined with ``\@startsection``, for the
            ``article``, ``book``, and ``report`` classes.

            -  For ``section``: ``level`` is 1, ``indent`` is 0pt,
               ``beforeskip`` is ``-3.5ex plus -1ex minus -0.2ex``,
               ``afterskip`` is ``2.3ex plus 0.2ex``, and ``style`` is
               ``\normalfont\Large\bfseries``.

            -  For ``subsection``: ``level`` is 2, ``indent`` is 0pt,
               ``beforeskip`` is
               ``-3.25ex plus -1ex minus``\ ``-0.2ex``, ``afterskip`` is
               ``1.5ex plus 0.2ex``, and ``style`` is
               ``\normalfont\large\bfseries``.

            -  

               .. container:: raggedright

                  For ``subsubsection``: ``level`` is 3, ``indent`` is
                  0pt, ``beforeskip`` is
                  ``-3.25ex plus -1ex minus -0.2ex``, ``afterskip`` is
                  ``1.5ex plus 0.2ex``, and ``style`` is
                  ``\normalfont\normalsize\bfseries``.

            Some examples follow. These go either in a package or class
            file or in the preamble of a LaTeX document. If you put them
            in the preamble they must go between a ``\makeatletter``
            command and a ``\makeatother``. (Probably the error message
            :literal:`You can't use \`\\spacefactor' in vertical mode.`
            means that you forgot this.) See ```\makeatletter`` &
            ``\makeatother`` <#g_t_005cmakeatletter-_0026-_005cmakeatother>`__.

            This will put section titles in large boldface type,
            centered. It says ``\renewcommand`` because LaTeXâs standard
            classes have already defined a ``\section``. For the same
            reason it does not define a ``section`` counter, or the
            commands ``\thesection`` and ``\l@section``.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                      {\centering\normalfont\Large\bfseries}% style
                    }

            This will put ``subsection`` titles in small caps type,
            inline with the paragraph.

            The prior examples redefined existing sectional unit title

         We often want something like â\ ``See Theorem~31``\ â. But
         by-hand typing the 31 is poor practice. Instead you should
         write a *label* such as ``\label{eq:GreensThm}`` and then
         *reference* it, as with ``See equation~\ref{eq:GreensThm}``.
         LaTeX will automatically work out the number, put it into the
         output, and will change that number later if needed.

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               We will see this with Theorem~\ref{th:GreensThm}. % forward reference
               ...
               \begin{theorem} \label{th:GreensThm}
                 ...
               \end{theorem}
               ...
               See Theorem~\ref{th:GreensThm} on page~\pageref{th:GreensThm}.

         LaTeX tracks cross reference information in a file having the
         extension ``.aux`` and with the same base name as the file
         containing the ``\label``. So if ``\label`` is in
         ``calculus.tex`` then the information is in ``calculus.aux``.
         LaTeX puts the information in that file every time it runs
         across a ``\label``.

         The behavior described in the prior paragraph results in a
         quirk that happens when your document has a *forward
         reference*, a ``\ref`` that appears before the associated
         ``\label``. If this is the first time that you are compiling
         the document then you will get
         â\ ``LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross references right``\ â
         and in the output the forward reference will appear as two
         question marksÂ â\ ``??``\ â, in boldface. A similar thing
         happens if you change some things so the references changes;
         you get the same warning and the output contains the old
         reference information. In both cases, resolve this by compiling
         the document a second time.

         The ``cleveref`` package enhances LaTeXâs cross referencing
         features. You can arrange that if you enter
         ``\begin{thm}\label{th:Nerode}...\end{thm}`` then
         ``\cref{th:Nerode}`` will output â\ ``Theorem 3.21``\ â,
         without you having to enter the âTheorem.â

                  \label{key}

            Assign a reference number to ``key``. In ordinary text
            ``\label{``\ ``key``\ ``}`` assigns to ``key`` the number of
            the current sectional unit. Inside an environment with
            numbering, such as a ``table`` or ``theorem`` environment,
            ``\label{``\ ``key``\ ``}`` assigns to ``key`` the number of
            that environment. Retrieve the assigned number with the
            ``\ref{``\ ``key``\ ``}`` command (see
            ```\ref`` <#g_t_005cref>`__).

            A key name can consist of any sequence of letters, digits,
            or common punctuation characters. Upper and lowercase
            letters are distinguished, as usual.

            A common convention is to use labels consisting of a prefix
            and a suffix separated by a colon or period. Thus,
            ``\label{fig:Post}`` is a label for a figure with a portrait
            of Emil Post. This helps to avoid accidentally creating two
            labels with the same name, and makes your source more
            readable. Some commonly-used prefixes:

            ``ch``
               for chapters

            ``sec``
            ``subsec``
               for lower-level sectioning commands

            ``fig``
               for figures

            ``tab``
               for tables

            ``eq``
               for equations

            In the auxiliary file the reference information is kept as
            the text of a command of the form
            ``\newlabel{``\ ``label``\ ``}{{``\ ``currentlabel``\ ``}{``\ ``pagenumber``\ ``}}``.
            Here ``currentlabel`` is the current value of the macro
            ``\@currentlabel`` that is usually updated whenever you call
            ``\refstepcounter{``\ ``counter``\ ``}``.

            Below, the key ``sec:test`` will get the number of the
            current section and the key ``fig:test`` will get the number
            of the figure. (Incidentally, put labels after captions in
            figures and tables.)

            footnote, figure, â¦, of the corresponding ``\label`` command
            (see ```\label`` <#g_t_005clabel>`__). It does not produce
            any text, such as the word âSectionâ or âFigureâ, just the
            bare number itself.

            If there is no ``\label{``\ ``key``\ ``}`` then you get
            something like

            In this example the ``\ref{popular}`` produces â\ ``2``\ â.
            Note that it is a forward reference since it comes before
            ``\label{popular}`` so this document would have to be

            Make cross references to the external document
            ``document-basename``\ ``.tex``.

            Here is an example. If ``lectures.tex`` has this in the
            preamble

            .. container:: example

            then it can use cross reference labels from the other three
            documents. Suppose that ``exercises.tex`` has an enumerated
            list containing this,

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \item \label{exer:EulersThm} What if every vertex has odd degree?

            and ``hints.tex`` has an enumerated list with this,

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \item \label{exer:EulersThm} Distinguish the case of two vertices.

            and ``answers.tex`` has an enumerated list with this,

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \item \label{ans:EulersThm} There is no Euler path, except if there
                    are exactly two vertices.

            After compiling the exercises, hints, and answers documents,
            entering this in the body of ``lectures.tex`` will result in
            the lectures getting the reference numbers used in the other
            documents.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  See Exercise~\ref{exer:EulersThm}, with Hint~\ref{H-exer:EulersThm}.
                  The solution is Answer~\ref{ans:EulersThm}.

            The prefix ``H-`` for the reference from the hints file is
            needed because the label in the hints file is the same as
            the label in the exercises file. Without that prefix, both
            references would get the number from the later file.

            Note: if the document uses the ``hyperref`` package then in
            place of ``xr``, put ``\usepackage{xr-hyper}`` before the
            ``\usepackage{hyperref}``. Also, if any of the multiple
            documents uses ``hyperref`` then they all must use it.

            :class: chapter

         LaTeX provides many environments for delimiting certain
         behavior. An environment begins with ``\begin`` and ends with
         ``\end``, like this:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               \begin{environment-name}
                 ...
               \end{environment-name}

         The ``environment-name`` at the beginning must exactly match
         that at the end. For instance, the input
         ``\begin{table*}...\end{table}`` will cause an error like:
         â\ ``! LaTeX Error: \begin{table*} on input line 5 ended by \end{table}.``\ â

         Environments are executed within a group.

            environment is only defined in the ``article`` and
            ``report`` document classes (see `Document

            Using the example below in the ``article`` class produces a
            displayed paragraph. Document class option ``titlepage``
            causes the abstract to be on a separate page (see `Document

            Produce a mathematical array. This environment can only be
            used in math mode (see `Modes <#Modes>`__), and normally
            appears within a displayed mathematics environment such as
            ``equation`` (see ```equation`` <#equation>`__). Inside of
            each row the column entries are separated by an ampersand,
            (``&``). Rows are terminated with double-backslashes (see
            ```\\`` <#g_t_005c_005c>`__).

            This example shows a three by three array.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{equation*}

                        x-a  &-b  &-c  \\
                        -d   &x-e &-f  \\
                        -g   &-h  &x-i
                      \end{array}
                   \right|
                  \end{equation*}

            The required argument ``cols`` describes the number of
            columns, their alignment, and the formatting of the
            intercolumn regions. For instance,
            ``\begin{array}{rcl}...\end{array}`` gives three columns:
            the first flush right, the second centered, and the third
            flush left. See ```tabular`` <#tabular>`__ for the complete
            description of ``cols`` and of the other common features of
            the two environments, including the optional ``pos``
            argument.

            There are two ways that ``array`` diverges from ``tabular``.
            The first is that ``array`` entries are typeset in math
            mode, in textstyle (see `Math styles <#Math-styles>`__)
            except if the ``cols`` definition specifies the column with
            ``p{...}``, which causes the entry to be typeset in text
            mode. The second is that, instead of ``tabular``\ âs
            parameter ``\tabcolsep``, LaTeXâs intercolumn space in an
            ``array`` is governed by ``\arraycolsep``, which gives half
            the width between columns. The default for this is
            â\ ``5pt``\ â so that between two columns comes 10pt of
            space.

            To obtain arrays with braces the standard is to use the
            ``amsmath`` package. It comes with environments ``pmatrix``
            for an array surrounded by parenthesesÂ ``(...)``,
            ``bmatrix`` for an array surrounded by square
            bracketsÂ ``[...]``, ``Bmatrix`` for an array surrounded by
            curly bracesÂ ``{...}``, ``vmatrix`` for an array surrounded
            by vertical barsÂ ``|...|``, and ``Vmatrix`` for an array
            surrounded by double vertical barsÂ ``||...||``, along with a
            number of other array constructs.

            The next example uses the ``amsmath`` package.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \usepackage{amsmath}  % in preamble

                  \begin{equation}    
                    \begin{vmatrix}{cc}  % array with vert lines
                      a  &b \\
                      c  &d       
                    \end{vmatrix}=ad-bc
                  \end{equation}

            There are many packages concerning arrays. The ``array``
            package has many useful extensions, including more column
            types. The ``dcolumn`` package adds a column type to center
            on a decimal point. For both see the documentation on CTAN.

            fit on a line then LaTeX will insert line breaks that avoid
            hyphenation and avoid stretching or shrinking any interword
            space.

            This environment inserts space above and below the text
            body. See ```\centering`` <#g_t_005ccentering>`__ to avoid
            such space, for example inside a ``figure`` environment.

            This example produces three centered lines. There is extra
            vertical space between the last two lines.

            In this example, depending on the pageâs line width, LaTeX
            may choose a line break for the part before the double
            backslash. If so, it will center each of the two lines and
            if not it will center the single line. Then LaTeX will break
            at the double backslash, and will center the ending.

            A double backslash after the final line is optional. If
            present it doesnât add any vertical space.

               Center the material in its scope. It is most often used
               inside an environment such as ``figure``, or in a
               ``parbox``.

               This exampleâs ``\centering`` declaration causes the
               graphic to be horizontally centered.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{figure}
                       \centering
                       \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ctan_lion.png}
                       \caption{CTAN Lion}  \label{fig:CTANLion}
                     \end{figure}

               The scope of this ``\centering`` ends with the
               ``\end{figure}``.

               Unlike the ``center`` environment, the ``\centering``
               command does not add vertical space above and below the
               text. Thatâs its advantage in the above example; there is
               not an excess of space.

               It also does not start a new paragraph; it simply changes
               how LaTeX formats paragraph units. If
               ``ww {\centering xx \\ yy} zz`` is surrounded by blank
               lines then LaTeX will create a paragraph whose first line
               â\ ``ww xx``\ â is centered and whose second line, not
               centered, contains â\ ``yy zz``\ â. Usually what is
               desired is for the scope of the declaration to contain a
               blank line or the ``\end`` command of an environment such
               as ``figure`` or ``table`` that ends the paragraph unit.
               Thus, if ``{\centering xx \\ yy\par} zz`` is surrounded
               by blank lines then it makes a new paragraph with two
               centered lines â\ ``xx``\ â and â\ ``yy``\ â, followed by
               a new paragraph with â\ ``zz``\ â that is formatted as
               usual.

                     ...
                  \end{description}

            Environment to make a list of labeled items. Each itemâs
            ``label`` is typeset in bold and is flush left, so that long
            labels continue into the first line of the item text. There
            must be at least one item; having none causes the LaTeX
            error â\ ``Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item``\ â.

            This example shows the environment used for a sequence of
            definitions.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{description}
                    \item[lama] A priest.
                    \item[llama] A beast.
                  \end{description}

            The labels â\ ``lama``\ â and â\ ``llama``\ â are output in
            boldface, with the left edge on the left margin.

            Start list items with the ``\item`` command (see ```\item``:
            An entry in a list <#g_t_005citem>`__). Use the optional
            labels, as in ``\item[Main point]``, because there is no
            sensible default. Following the ``\item`` is optional text,
            which may contain multiple paragraphs.

            Since the labels are in bold style, if the label text calls
            for a font change given in argument style (see `Font
            styles <#Font-styles>`__) then it will come out bold. For
            instance, if the label text calls for typewriter with
            ``\item[\texttt{label text}]`` then it will appear in bold
            typewriter, if that is available. The simplest way around
            this, in this example to get non-bold typewriter, is to use
            declarative style: ``\item[{\tt label text}]``. Similarly,
            get the standard roman font with
            ``\item[{\rm label text}]``.

            For other major LaTeX labelled list environments, see
            ```itemize`` <#itemize>`__ and
            ```enumerate`` <#enumerate>`__. Unlike those environments,
            nesting ``description`` environments does not change the
            default label; it is boldface and flush left at all levels.

            For information about list layout parameters, including the
            default values, and for information about customizing list
            layout, see ```list`` <#list>`__. The package ``enumitem``
            is useful for customizing lists.

            This example changes the description labels to small caps.

                  \begin{displaymath}
                    mathematical text
                  \end{displaymath}

            Environment to typeset the ``mathematical text`` on its own
            line, in display style and centered. To make the text be
            flush-left use the global option ``fleqn``; see `Document
            class options <#Document-class-options>`__.

            In the ``displaymath`` environment no equation number is
            added to the math text. One way to get an equation number is
            to use the ``equation`` environment (see
            ```equation`` <#equation>`__).

            LaTeX will not break the ``math text`` across lines.

            Note that the ``amsmath`` package has significantly more
            extensive displayed equation facilities. For example, there
            are a number of ways in that package for having math text
            broken across lines.

            The construct ``\[``\ ``math``\ ``\]`` is a synonym for the
            environment
            ``\begin{displaymath}``\ ``math``\ ``\end{displaymath}`` but
            the latter is easier to work with in the source; for
            instance, searching for a square bracket may get false
            positives but the word ``displaymath`` will likely be
            unique.

            The construct ``$$``\ ``math``\ ``$$`` from PlainÂ TeX is
            sometimes used as a synonym for LaTeXâs ``displaymath``. It
            is not a synonym, and is not officially supported in LaTeX
            at all; ``$$`` doesnât support the ``fleqn`` option (see
            `Document class options <#Document-class-options>`__), has
            different vertical spacing, and doesnât perform consistency
            checks.

            The output from this example is centered and alone on its
            line.

                  \end{displaymath}

            Also, the integral sign is larger than the inline version
            ``\( \int_1^2 x^2\,dx=7/3 \)`` produces.

            brackets, as in ``\item[Interstitial label]``, then the next
            item will continue the interrupted sequence (see ```\item``:
            An entry in a list <#g_t_005citem>`__). That is, you will
            get labels like â\ ``1.``\ â, then
            â\ ``Interstitial label``\ â, then â\ ``2.``\ â. Following
            the ``\item`` is optional text, which may contain multiple
            paragraphs.

            Enumerations may be nested within other ``enumerate``
            environments, or within any paragraph-making environment
            such as ``itemize`` (see ```itemize`` <#itemize>`__), up to
            four levels deep. This gives LaTeXâs default for the format
            at each nesting level, where 1 is the top level, the
            outermost level.

            #. arabic number followed by a period: â\ ``1.``\ â,
               â\ ``2.``\ â,Â â¦
            #. lowercase letter inside parentheses: â\ ``(a)``\ â,
               â\ ``(b)``\ âÂ â¦
            #. lowercase roman numeral followed by a period:
               â\ ``i.``\ â, â\ ``ii.``\ â,Â â¦
            #. uppercase letter followed by a period: â\ ``A.``\ â,
               â\ ``B.``\ â,Â â¦

            The ``enumerate`` environment uses the counters ``\enumi``
            through ``\enumiv`` (see `Counters <#Counters>`__).

            For other major LaTeX labeled list environments, see
            ```description`` <#description>`__ and
            ```itemize`` <#itemize>`__. For information about list
            layout parameters, including the default values, and for
            information about customizing list layout, see
            ```list`` <#list>`__. The package ``enumitem`` is useful for
            customizing lists.

            To change the format of the label use ``\renewcommand`` (see
            ```\newcommand`` &
            ``\renewcommand`` <#g_t_005cnewcommand-_0026-_005crenewcommand>`__)
            on the commands ``\labelenumi`` through ``\labelenumiv``.
            For instance, this first level list will be labelled with
            uppercase letters, in boldface, and without a trailing
            period.

            The ``eqnarray`` environment is obsolete. It has
            infelicities, including spacing that is inconsistent with
            other mathematics elements. (See âAvoid eqnarray!â by Lars
            Madsen https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb33-1/tb103madsen.pdf). New
            documents should include the ``amsmath`` package and use the
            displayed mathematics environments provided there, such as
            the ``align`` environment. We include a description only for
            completeness and for working with old documents.

            Synopsis:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{eqnarray} 
                    first formula left  &first formula middle  &first formula right \\
                    ...
                  \end{eqnarray}

            or

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{eqnarray*} 
                    first formula left  &first formula middle  &first formula right \\
                    ...
                  \end{eqnarray*}

            Display a sequence of equations or inequalities. The left
            and right sides are typeset in display mode, while the
            middle is typeset in text mode.

            It is similar to a three-column ``array`` environment, with
            items within a row separated by an ampersandÂ (``&``), and
            with rows separated by double backslashÂ  ``\\``). The
            starred form of line break (``\\*``) can also be used to
            separate equations, and will disallow a page break there
            (see ```\\`` <#g_t_005c_005c>`__).

            The unstarred form ``eqnarray`` places an equation number on
            every line (using the ``equation`` counter), unless that
            line contains a ``\nonumber`` command. The starred form
            ``eqnarray*`` omits equation numbering, while otherwise
            being the same.

            The command ``\lefteqn`` is used for splitting long formulas
            across lines. It typesets its argument in display style
            flush left in a box of zero width.

            This example shows three lines. The first two lines make an
            inequality, while the third line has not entry on the left
            side.

            The same as a ``displaymath`` environment (see
            ```displaymath`` <#displaymath>`__) except that LaTeX puts
            an equation number flush to the right margin. The equation
            number is generated using the ``equation`` counter.

            You should have no blank lines between ``\begin{equation}``
            and ``\end{equation}``, or LaTeX will tell you that there is
            a missing dollar sign.

            The package ``amsmath`` package has extensive displayed
            equation facilities. New documents should include this
            package.

            Figures are for material that is not part of the normal
            text. An example is material that you cannot have split
            between two pages, such as a graphic. Because of this, LaTeX
            does not typeset figures in sequence with normal text but
            instead âfloatsâ them to a convenient place, such as the top
            of a following page (see `Floats <#Floats>`__).

            The ``figure body`` can consist of imported graphics (see
            `Graphics <#Graphics>`__), or text, LaTeX commands, etc. It
            is typeset in a ``parbox`` of width ``\textwidth``.

            The possible values of ``placement`` are ``h`` for
            â\ ``here``\ â, ``t`` for â\ ``top``\ â, ``b`` for
            â\ ``bottom``\ â, and ``p`` for
            â\ ``on a separate page of floats``\ â. For the effect of
            these options on the float placement algorithm, see
            `Floats <#Floats>`__.

            The starred form ``figure*`` is used when a document is in
            double-column mode (see
            ```\twocolumn`` <#g_t_005ctwocolumn>`__). It produces a
            figure that spans both columns, at the top of the page. To
            add the possibility of placing at a page bottom see the
            discussion of ``placement`` ``b`` in `Floats <#Floats>`__.

            The label is optional; it is used for cross references (see
            `Cross references <#Cross-references>`__). The optional
            ``\caption`` command specifies caption text for the figure
            (see ```\caption`` <#g_t_005ccaption>`__). By default it is
            numbered. If ``loftitle`` is present, it is used in the list
            of figures instead of ``title`` (see `Table of contents,
            list of figures, list of
            tables <#Table-of-contents-etc_002e>`__).

            This example makes a figure out of a graphic. LaTeX will
            place that graphic and its caption at the top of a page or,
            if it is pushed to the end of the document, on a page of
            floats.

            Create a file named ``filename`` in the current directory
            (or the output directory, if specified; see `output
            directory <#output-directory>`__) and write ``text`` to it.
            By default, an existing file is not overwritten.

            The unstarred version of the environment ``filecontents``
            prefixes the content of the created file with a header of
            TeX comments; see the example below. The starred version
            ``filecontents*`` does not include the header.

            The possible options are:

            ``force`` `Â¶ <#index-force-option-for-filecontents>`__
            ``overwrite``
               Overwrite an existing file.

            ``noheader`` `Â¶ <#index-noheader-option-for-filecontents>`__
               Omit the header. Equivalent to using ``filecontents*``.

            ``nosearch`` `Â¶ <#index-nosearch-option-for-filecontents>`__
               Only check the current directory (and the output
               directory, if specified) for an existing file, not the
               entire search path.

            These options were added in a 2019 release of LaTeX.

            This environment can be used anywhere in the preamble,
            although it often appears before the ``\documentclass``
            command. It is commonly used to create a ``.bib`` or other
            such data file from the main document source, to make the
            source file self-contained. Similarly, it can be used to
            create a custom style or class file, again making the source
            self-contained.

            An environment that creates a paragraph whose lines are
            flush to the left-hand margin, and ragged right. If you have
            lines that are too long then LaTeX will linebreak them in a
            way that avoids hyphenation and stretching or shrinking
            interword spaces. To force a new line use a double
            backslash, ``\\``. For the declaration form
            seeÂ ```\raggedright`` <#g_t_005craggedright>`__.

               A declaration which causes lines to be flush to the left
               margin and ragged right. It can be used inside an
               ``environment`` such as ``quote`` or in a ``parbox``. For
               the environment form seeÂ ```flushleft`` <#flushleft>`__.

               Unlike the ``flushleft`` environment, the
               ``\raggedright`` command does not start a new paragraph;
               it only changes how LaTeX formats paragraph units. To
               affect a paragraph unitâs format, the scope of the
               declaration must contain the blank line or ``\end``
               command that ends the paragraph unit.

               Here ``\raggedright`` in each second column keeps LaTeX
               from doing awkward typesetting to fit the text into the
               narrow column. Note that ``\raggedright`` is inside the
               curly braces ``{...}`` to delimit its effect.

            An environment that creates a paragraph whose lines are
            flush to the right-hand margin and ragged left. If you have
            lines that are too long to fit the margins then LaTeX will
            linebreak them in a way that avoids hyphenation and
            stretching or shrinking inter-word spaces. To force a new
            line use a double backslash, ``\\``. For the declaration
            form seeÂ ```\raggedleft`` <#g_t_005craggedleft>`__.

            With the default localeâwithout loading e.g. ``babel``
            package with another language than USenglishâas a top-level
            list each label would come out as a bullet, â¢. The format of
            the labeling depends on the nesting level; see below.

            Start list items with the ``\item`` command (see ```\item``:
            An entry in a list <#g_t_005citem>`__). If you give
            ``\item`` an optional argument by following it with square
            brackets, as in ``\item[``\ ``Optional label``\ ``]``, then
            by default ``Optional label`` will appear in bold and be
            flush right, so it could extend into the left margin. For
            labels that are flush left see the
            ```description`` <#description>`__ environment. Following
            the ``\item`` is the text of the item, which may be empty or
            contain multiple paragraphs.

            Unordered lists can be nested within one another, up to four
            levels deep. They can also be nested within other
            paragraph-making environments, such as ``enumerate`` (see
            ```enumerate`` <#enumerate>`__).

            The ``itemize`` environment uses the commands
            ``\labelitemi`` through ``\labelitemiv`` to produce the
            default label (note the convention of lowercase roman
            numerals at the end of the command names that signify the
            nesting level). These are the default marks at each level.

            #. â¢ (bullet, from ``\textbullet``)
            #. **--** (bold en-dash, from
               ``\normalfont\bfseries\textendash``)
            #. \* (asterisk, from ``\textasteriskcentered``)
            #. . (vertically centered dot, rendered here as a period,
               from ``\textperiodcentered``)

            Change the labels with ``\renewcommand``. For instance, this
            makes the first level use diamonds.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\diamond$}

            The distance between the left margin of the enclosing
            environment and the left margin of the ``itemize`` list is
            determined by the parameters ``\leftmargini`` through
            ``\leftmarginvi``. (This also uses the convention of using
            lowercase roman numerals a the end of the command name to
            denote the nesting level.) The defaults are: ``2.5em`` in
            level 1 (``2em`` in two-column mode), ``2.2em`` in level 2,
            ``1.87em`` in level 3, and ``1.7em`` in level 4, with
            smaller values for more deeply nested levels.

            For other major LaTeX labeled list environments, see
            ```description`` <#description>`__ and
            ```enumerate`` <#enumerate>`__. The ``itemize``,
            ``enumerate`` and ``description`` environment use the same
            list layout parameters. For a description, including the
            default values, and for information about customizing list
            layout, see ```list`` <#list>`__. The package ``enumitem``
            is useful for customizing lists.

            This example greatly reduces the margin space for outermost
            itemized lists.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \setlength{\leftmargini}{1.25em} % default 2.5em

            Especially for lists with short items, it may be desirable
            to elide space between items. Here is an example defining an
            ``itemize*`` environment with no extra spacing between
            items, or between paragraphs within a single item
            (``\parskip`` is not list-specific, see ```\parindent`` &
            ``\parskip`` <#g_t_005cparindent-_0026-_005cparskip>`__):

                  \end{list}

            An environment for constructing lists.

            Note that this environment does not typically appear in the
            document body. Most lists created by LaTeX authors are the
            ones that come standard: the ``description``, ``enumerate``,
            and ``itemize`` environments (see
            ```description`` <#description>`__,
            ```enumerate`` <#enumerate>`__, and
            ```itemize`` <#itemize>`__).

            Instead, the ``list`` environment is most often used in
            macros. For example, many standard LaTeX environments that
            do not immediately appear to be lists are in fact
            constructed using ``list``, including ``quotation``,
            ``quote``, and ``center`` (see ```quotation`` &
            ``quote`` <#quotation-_0026-quote>`__, see
            ```center`` <#center>`__).

            This uses the ``list`` environment to define a new custom
            environment.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                       {Item~\Roman{namedlistcounter}.} % labeling 
                       {\usecounter{namedlistcounter}   % set counter
                        \setlength{\leftmargin}{3.5em}} % set spacing 
                    }
                    {\end{list}}

                  \begin{named}
                    \item Shows as ``Item~I.''
                    \item[Special label.] Shows as ``Special label.''
                    \item Shows as ``Item~II.''
                  \end{named}

            The mandatory first argument ``labeling`` specifies the
            default labeling of list items. It can contain text and
            LaTeX commands, as above where it contains both
            â\ ``Item``\ â and â\ ``\Roman{â¦}``\ â. LaTeX forms the
            label by putting the ``labeling`` argument in a box of width
            ``\labelwidth``. If the label is wider than that, the
            additional material extends to the right. When making an
            instance of a ``list`` you can override the default labeling
            by giving ``\item`` an optional argument by including square
            braces and the text, as in the above
            ``\item[Special label.]``; see ```\item``: An entry in a
            list <#g_t_005citem>`__.

            The mandatory second argument ``spacing`` has a list of
            commands. This list can be empty. A command that can go in
            here is ``\usecounter{``\ ``countername``\ ``}`` (see
            ```\usecounter`` <#g_t_005cusecounter>`__). Use this to tell
            LaTeX to number the items using the given counter. The
            counter will be reset to zero each time LaTeX enters the
            environment, and the counter is incremented by one each time
            LaTeX encounters an ``\item`` that does not have an optional
            argument.

            Another command that can go in ``spacing`` is
            ``\makelabel``, which constructs the label box. By default
            it puts the contents flush right. Its only argument is the
            label, which it typesets in LR mode (see
            `Modes <#Modes>`__). One example of changing its definition
            is that to the above ``named`` example, before the
            definition of the environment add
            ``\newcommand{\namedmakelabel}[1]{\textsc{#1}}``, and
            between the ``\setlength`` command and the parenthesis that
            closes the ``spacing`` argument also add
            ``\let\makelabel\namedmakelabel``. Then the labels will be
            typeset in small caps. Similarly, changing the second code
            line to ``\let\makelabel\fbox`` puts the labels inside a
            framed box. Another example of the ``\makelabel`` command is
            below, in the definition of the ``redlabel`` environment.

            Also often in ``spacing`` are commands to redefine the
            spacing for the list. Below are the spacing parameters with
            their default values. (Default values for derived
            environments such as ``itemize`` can be different than the
            values shown here.) See also the figure that follows the
            list. Each is a length (see `Lengths <#Lengths>`__). The
            vertical spaces are normally rubber lengths, with ``plus``
            and ``minus`` components, to give TeX flexibility in setting
            the page. Change each with a command such as
            ``\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt plus1pt minus1pt}``. For some
            effects these lengths should be zero or negative.

            ``\itemindent`` `Â¶ <#index-_005citemindent>`__
               Extra horizontal space indentation, beyond
               ``leftmargin``, of the first line each item. Its default
               value is ``0pt``.

            ``\itemsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005citemsep>`__
               Vertical space between items, beyond the ``\parsep``. The
               defaults for the first three levels in LaTeXâs
               â\ ``article``\ â, â\ ``book``\ â, and â\ ``report``\ â
               classes at 10 point size are: ``4pt plus2pt minus1pt``,
               ``\parsep`` (that is, ``2pt plus1pt minus1pt``), and
               ``\topsep`` (that is, ``2pt plus1pt minus1pt``). The
               defaults at 11 point are: ``4.5pt plus2pt minus1pt``,
               ``\parsep`` (that is, ``2pt plus1pt minus1pt``), and
               ``\topsep`` (that is, ``2pt plus1pt minus1pt``). The
               defaults at 12 point are: ``5pt plus2.5pt minus1pt``,
               ``\parsep`` (that is, ``2.5pt plus1pt minus1pt``), and
               ``\topsep`` (that is, ``2.5pt plus1pt minus1pt``).

            ``\labelsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005clabelsep>`__
               Horizontal space between the label and text of an item.
               The default for LaTeXâs â\ ``article``\ â,
               â\ ``book``\ â, and â\ ``report``\ â classes is
               ``0.5em``.

            ``\labelwidth`` `Â¶ <#index-_005clabelwidth>`__
               Horizontal width. The box containing the label is
               nominally this wide. If ``\makelabel`` returns text that
               is wider than this then the first line of the item will
               be indented to make room for this extra material. If
               ``\makelabel`` returns text of width less than or equal
               to ``\labelwidth`` then LaTeXâs default is that the label
               is typeset flush right in a box of this width.

               The left edge of the label box is
               ``\leftmargin``\ +\ ``\itemindent``-``\labelsep``-``\labelwidth``
               from the left margin of the enclosing environment.

               The default for LaTeXâs â\ ``article``\ â,
               â\ ``book``\ â, and â\ ``report``\ â classes at the top
               level is ``\leftmargini``-``\labelsep``, (which is
               ``2em`` in one column mode and ``1.5em`` in two column
               mode). At the second level it is
               ``\leftmarginii``-``\labelsep``, and at the third level
               it is ``\leftmarginiii``-``\labelsep``. These definitions
               make the labelâs left edge coincide with the left margin
               of the enclosing environment.

            ``\leftmargin`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cleftmargin-1>`__
               Horizontal space between the left margin of the enclosing
               environment (or the left margin of the page if this is a
               top-level list), and the left margin of this list. It
               must be non-negative.

               In the standard LaTeX document classes, a top-level list
               has this set to the value of ``\leftmargini``, while a
               list that is nested inside a top-level list has this
               margin set to ``\leftmarginii``. More deeply nested lists
               get the values of ``\leftmarginiii`` through
               ``\leftmarginvi``. (Nesting greater than level five
               generates the error message â\ ``Too deeply nested``\ â.)

               The defaults for the first three levels in LaTeXâs
               â\ ``article``\ â, â\ ``book``\ â, and â\ ``report``\ â
               classes are: ``\leftmargini`` is ``2.5em`` (in two column
               mode, ``2em``), ``\leftmarginii`` is ``2.2em``, and
               ``\leftmarginiii`` is ``1.87em``.

            ``\listparindent`` `Â¶ <#index-_005clistparindent>`__
               Horizontal space of additional line indentation, beyond
               ``\leftmargin``, for second and subsequent paragraphs
               within a list item. A negative value makes this an
               âoutdentâ. Its default value is ``0pt``.

            ``\parsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cparsep>`__
               Vertical space between paragraphs within an item. The
               defaults for the first three levels in LaTeXâs
               â\ ``article``\ â, â\ ``book``\ â, and â\ ``report``\ â
               classes at 10 point size are: ``4pt plus2pt minus1pt``,
               ``2pt plus1pt minus1pt``, and ``0pt``. The defaults at 11
               point size are: ``4.5pt plus2pt minus1pt``,
               ``2pt plus1pt minus1pt``, and ``0pt``. The defaults at 12
               point size are: ``5pt plus2.5pt minus1pt``,
               ``2.5pt plus1pt minus1pt``, and ``0pt``.

            ``\partopsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cpartopsep>`__
               Vertical space added, beyond
               ``\topsep``\ +\ ``\parskip``, to the top and bottom of
               the entire environment if the list instance is preceded
               by a blank line. (A blank line in the LaTeX source before
               the list changes spacing at both the top and bottom of
               the list; whether the line following the list is blank
               does not matter.)

               The defaults for the first three levels in LaTeXâs
               â\ ``article``\ â, â\ ``book``\ â, and â\ ``report``\ â
               classes at 10 point size are: ``2pt plus1 minus1pt``,
               ``2pt plus1pt minus1pt``, and ``1pt plus0pt minus1pt``.
               The defaults at 11 point are: ``3pt plus1pt minus1pt``,
               ``3pt plus1pt minus1pt``, and ``1pt plus0pt minus1pt``).
               The defaults at 12 point are: ``3pt plus2pt minus3pt``,
               ``3pt plus2pt minus2pt``, and ``1pt plus0pt minus1pt``.

            ``\rightmargin`` `Â¶ <#index-_005crightmargin>`__
               Horizontal space between the right margin of the list and
               the right margin of the enclosing environment. Its
               default value is ``0pt``. It must be non-negative.

            ``\topsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctopsep>`__
               Vertical space added to both the top and bottom of the
               list, in addition to ``\parskip`` (see ```\parindent`` &
               ``\parskip`` <#g_t_005cparindent-_0026-_005cparskip>`__).
               The defaults for the first three levels in LaTeXâs

            The lengths shown are listed below. The key relationship is
            that the right edge of the bracket for ``h1`` equals the
            right edge of the bracket for ``h4``, so that the left edge
            of the label box is at
            ``h3``\ +\ ``h4``-(``h0``\ +\ ``h1``).

            ``v0``
               *``\topsep`` + ``\parskip``* if the list environment does

            ``v3``
               Same as ``v0``. (This space is affected by whether a
               blank line appears in the source above the environment;
               whether a blank line appears in the source below the
               environment does not matter.)

            The listâs left and right margins, shown above as ``h3`` and
            ``h5``, are with respect to the ones provided by the
            surrounding environment, or with respect to the page margins
            for a top-level list. The line width used for typesetting
            the list items is ``\linewidth`` (see `Page layout
            parameters <#Page-layout-parameters>`__). For instance, set
            the listâs left margin to be one quarter of the distance
            between the left and right margins of the enclosing
            environment with
            ``\setlength{\leftmargin}{0.25\linewidth}``.

            Page breaking in a list structure is controlled by the three
            parameters below. For each, the LaTeX default is
            ``-\@lowpenalty``, that is, ``-51``. Because it is negative,
            it somewhat encourages a page break at each spot. Change it
            with, e.g., ``\@beginparpenalty=9999``; a value of 10000
            prohibits a page break.

            ``\@beginparpenalty`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_0040beginparpenalty>`__
               The page breaking penalty for breaking before the list
               (default ``-51``).

            ``\@itempenalty`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_0040itempenalty>`__
               The page breaking penalty for breaking before a list item
               (default ``-51``).

            ``\@endparpenalty`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_0040endparpenalty>`__
               The page breaking penalty for breaking after a list
               (default ``-51``).

            The package ``enumitem`` is useful for customizing lists.

            This example has the labels in red. They are numbered, and
            the left edge of the label lines up with the left edge of
            the item text. See
            ```\usecounter`` <#g_t_005cusecounter>`__.

                     \item[optional-label] text of item

               An entry in a list. The entries are prefixed by a label,
               whose default depends on the list type.

               Because the optional label is surrounded by square
               brackets â\ ``[...]``\ â, if you have an item whose text
               starts with [, you have to hide the bracket inside curly
               braces, as in: ``\item {[} is an open square bracket``;
               otherwise, LaTeX will think it marks the start of an
               optional label.

               Similarly, if the item does have the optional label and
               you need a close square bracket inside that label, you
               must hide it in the same way:
               ``\item[Close square bracket, {]}]``. See `LaTeX command
               syntax <#LaTeX-command-syntax>`__.

               In this example the enumerate list has two items that use
               the default label and one that uses the optional label.

                     \end{enumerate}

               The first item is labelled â\ ``1.``\ â, the second item
               is labelled â\ ``sometimes``\ â, and the third item is
               labelled â\ ``2.``\ â. Because of the optional label in
               the second item, the third item is not
               labelledÂ â\ ``3.``\ â.

               A restricted version of the list environment, in which
               margins are not indented and an ``\item`` without an
               optional argument produces no text. It is most often used
               in macros, to define an environment where the ``\item``
               command is part of the environmentâs definition. For
               instance, the ``center`` environment is defined
               essentially like this:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \newenvironment{center}
                       {\begin{trivlist}\centering\item\relax}
                       {\end{trivlist}}

               Using ``trivlist`` in this way allows the macro to
               inherit some common code: combining vertical space of two
               adjacent environments; detecting whether the text
               following the environment should be considered a new
               paragraph or a continuation of the previous one;
               adjusting the left and right margins for possible nested
               list environments.

               Specifically, ``trivlist`` uses the current values of the
               list parameters (see ```list`` <#list>`__), except that
               ``\parsep`` is set to the value of ``\parskip``, and
               ``\leftmargin``, ``\labelwidth``, and ``\itemindent`` are
               set to zero.

               This example outputs the items as two paragraphs, except
               that (by default) they have no paragraph indent and are
               vertically separated.

                     \item She has a bluff bow, lovely lines.

            Put ``contents`` into a box that is ``width`` wide. This is
            like a small version of a page; it can contain its own
            footnotes, itemized lists, etc. (There are some
            restrictions, including that it cannot have floats.) This
            box will not be broken across pages. So ``minipage`` is
            similar to ``\parbox`` (see
            ```\parbox`` <#g_t_005cparbox>`__) but here you can have
            paragraphs.

            This example will be 3Â inches wide, and has two paragraphs.

            .. container:: example

                  \begin{minipage}{3in}
                    Stephen Kleene was a founder of the Theory of Computation.

                    He was a student of Church, wrote three influential texts,
                    was President of the Association for Symbolic Logic,
                    and won the National Medal of Science.
                  \end{minipage}

            See below for a discussion of the paragraph indent inside a
            ``minipage``.

            The required argument ``width`` is a rigid length (see
            `Lengths <#Lengths>`__). It gives the width of the box into
            which ``contents`` are typeset.

            There are three optional arguments, ``position``,
            ``height``, and ``inner-pos``. You need not include all
            three. For example, get the default ``position`` and set the
            ``height`` with
            ``\begin{minipage}[c][2.54cm]{\columnwidth}``\ ``contents``\ ``\end{minipage}``.
            (Get the natural height with an empty argument, ``[]``.)

            The optional argument ``position`` governs how the
            ``minipage`` vertically aligns with the surrounding
            material.

            ``c``
               (synonym ``m``) Default. Positions the ``minipage`` so
               its vertical center lines up with the center of the
               adjacent text line.

            ``t`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cvtop-plain-TeX>`__
               Align the baseline of the top line in the ``minipage``
               with the baseline of the surrounding text (plain TeXâs
               ``\vtop``).

            ``b`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cvbox-_0028plain-TeX_0029>`__
               Align the baseline of the bottom line in the ``minipage``
               with the baseline of the surrounding text (plain TeXâs
               ``\vbox``).

            To see the effects of these, contrast running this

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ---\begin{minipage}[c]{0.25in}
                    first\\ second\\ third
                  \end{minipage}

            with the results of changing ``c`` to ``b`` orÂ ``t``.

            The optional argument ``height`` is a rigid length (see
            `Lengths <#Lengths>`__). It sets the height of the
            ``minipage``. You can enter any value larger than, or equal
            to, or smaller than the ``minipage``\ âs natural height and
            LaTeX will not give an error or warning. You can also set it
            to a height of zero or a negative value.

            The final optional argument ``inner-pos`` controls the
            placement of ``contents`` inside the box. These are the
            possible values are (the default is the value of
            ``position``).

            ``t``
               Place ``contents`` at the top of the box.

            ``c``
               Place it in the vertical center.

            ``b``
               Place it at the box bottom.

            ``s``
               Stretch ``contents`` out vertically; it must contain
               vertically stretchable space.

            The ``inner-pos`` argument makes sense when the ``height``
            option is set to a value larger than the ``minipage``\ âs
            natural height. To see the effect of the options, run this
            example with the various choices in place of ``b``.

                  Text after  

            By default paragraphs are not indented in a ``minipage``.
            Change that with a command such as
            ``\setlength{\parindent}{1pc}`` at the start of
            ``contents``.

            Footnotes in a ``minipage`` environment are handled in a way
            that is particularly useful for putting footnotes in figures
            or tables. A ``\footnote`` or ``\footnotetext`` command puts
            the footnote at the bottom of the minipage instead of at the
            bottom of the page, and it uses the ``\mpfootnote`` counter
            instead of the ordinary ``footnote`` counter (see
            `Counters <#Counters>`__).

            This puts the footnote at the bottom of the table, not the
            bottom of the page.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{center}           % center the minipage on the line

                    \begin{center}         % center the table inside the minipage
                      \begin{tabular}{ll}

                    \end{center}  
                  \end{minipage}
                  \end{center}

            If you nest minipages then there is an oddness when using
            footnotes. Footnotes appear at the bottom of the text ended
            by the next ``\end{minipage}`` which may not be their
            logical place.

            This puts a table containing data side by side with a map
            graphic. They are vertically centered.

            An environment to create simple pictures containing lines,
            arrows, boxes, circles, and text. This environment is not
            obsolete, but new documents typically use much more powerful
            graphics creation systems, such as TikZ, PSTricks, MetaPost,
            or Asymptote. None of these are covered in this document;
            see CTAN.

            To start, hereâs an example showing the parallelogram law
            for adding vectors.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \setlength{\unitlength}{1cm}
                  \begin{picture}(6,6)      % picture box will be 6cm wide by 6cm tall
                    \put(0,0){\vector(2,1){4}}  % for every 2 over this vector goes 1 up
                      \put(2,1){\makebox(0,0)[l]{\ first leg}}
                    \put(4,2){\vector(1,2){2}}
                      \put(5,4){\makebox(0,0)[l]{\ second leg}}  
                    \put(0,0){\vector(1,1){6}}
                      \put(3,3){\makebox(0,0)[r]{sum\ }}  
                  \end{picture}

            The ``picture`` environment has one required argument, a
            pair of positive real numbers (``width``,\ ``height``).
            Multiply these by the value ``\unitlength`` to get the
            nominal size of the output, i.e. the space that LaTeX
            reserves on the output page. This nominal size need not be
            how large the picture really is; LaTeX will draw things from
            the picture outside the pictureâs box.

            This environment also has an optional argument
            (``xoffset``,\ ``yoffset``). It is used to shift the origin.
            Unlike most optional arguments, this one is not contained in
            square brackets. As with the required argument, it consists
            of a pair of two real numbers, but these may also be
            negative or null. Multiply these by ``\unitlength`` to get
            the coordinates of the point at the lower-left corner of the
            picture.

            For example, if ``\unitlength`` has been set to ``1mm``, the
            command

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{picture}(100,200)(10,20)

            produces a box of width 100 millimeters and height 200
            millimeters. The pictureâs origin is the point (10mm,20mm)
            and so the lower-left corner is there, and the upper-right
            corner is at (110mm,220mm). When you first draw a picture
            you typically omit the optional argument, leaving the origin
            at the lower-left corner. If you then want to modify your
            picture by shifting everything, you can just add the
            appropriate optional argument.

            Each ``picture command`` tells LaTeX where to put something
            by providing its position. A *position* is a pair such as
            ``(2.4,-5)`` giving the x- and y-coordinates. A *coordinate*
            is a not a length, it is a real number (it may have a
            decimal point or a minus sign). It specifies a length in
            multiples of the unit length ``\unitlength``, so if
            ``\unitlength`` has been set to ``1cm``, then the coordinate
            ``2.54`` specifies a length of 2.54 centimeters.

            LaTeXâs default for ``\unitlength`` is ``1pt``. It is a
            rigid length (see `Lengths <#Lengths>`__). Change it with
            the ``\setlength`` command (see
            ```\setlength`` <#g_t_005csetlength>`__). Make this change
            only outside of a ``picture`` environment.

            The ``picture`` environment supports using standard
            arithmetic expressions as well as numbers.

            Coordinates are given with respect to an origin, which is by
            default at the lower-left corner of the picture. Note that
            when a position appears as an argument, as with
            ``\put(1,2){...}``, it is not enclosed in braces since the
            parentheses serve to delimit the argument. Also, unlike in
            some computer graphics systems, larger y-coordinates are
            further up the page, for example, *y = 1* is *above* *y =
            0*.

            There are four ways to put things in a picture: ``\put``,
            ``\multiput``, ``\qbezier``, and ``\graphpaper``. The most
            often used is ``\put``. This

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \put(11.3,-0.3){...}

            places the object with its reference point at coordinates
            *(11.3,-0.3)*. The reference points for various objects will
            be described below. The ``\put`` command creates an *LR box*
            (see `Modes <#Modes>`__). Anything that can go in an
            ``\mbox`` (see ```\mbox`` &
            ``\makebox`` <#g_t_005cmbox-_0026-_005cmakebox>`__) can go
            in the text argument of the ``\put`` command. The reference
            point will be the lower left corner of the box. In this
            picture

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \setlength{\unitlength}{1cm}
                  ...\begin{picture}(1,1)
                    \put(0,0){\line(1,0){1}}
                    \put(0,0){\line(1,1){1}}
                  \end{picture}

            the three dots are just slightly left of the point of the
            angle formed by the two lines. (Also, ``\line(1,1){1}`` does
            not call for a line of length one; rather the line has a
            change in the x coordinate of 1.)

            The ``\multiput``, ``qbezier``, and ``graphpaper`` commands
            are described below.

            You can also use this environment to place arbitrary
            material at an exact location. For example:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \usepackage{color,graphicx}  % in preamble
                    ...
                  \begin{center}
                  \setlength{\unitlength}{\textwidth} 
                  \begin{picture}(1,1)      % leave space, \textwidth wide and tall
                    \put(0,0){\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{desertedisland.jpg}}
                    \put(0.25,0.35){\textcolor{red}{X Treasure here}}
                  \end{picture}
                  \end{center}

            The redÂ X will be precisely a quarter of the ``\textwidth``
            from the left margin, and ``0.35\textwidth`` up from the
            bottom of the picture. Another example of this usage is to
            put similar code in the page header to get repeat material
            on each of a documentâs pages.

               ``(``\ ``x3``\ ``,``\ ``y3``\ ``)``. That is, the curve
               runs from ``(x1,y1)`` to ``(x3,y3)``, is quadratic, and
               is such that the tangent line at ``(x1,y1)`` passes
               through ``(x2,y2)``, as does the tangent line at
               ``(x3,y3)``.

               The optional argument ``num`` gives the number of
               calculated intermediate points. The default is to draw a
               smooth curve whose maximum number of points is
               ``\qbeziermax`` (change this value with
               ``\renewcommand``).

               This draws a rectangle with a wavy top, using

                     \line(x_run,y_rise){travel}

               Draw a line. It slopes such that it vertically rises
               ``y_rise`` for every horizontal ``x_run``. The ``travel``
               is the total horizontal changeâit is not the length of
               the vector, it is the change in *x*. In the special case
               of vertical lines, where (``x_run``,\ ``y_rise``)=(0,1),
               the ``travel`` gives the change in *y*.

               This draws a line starting at coordinates (1,3).

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \put(1,3){\line(2,5){4}}

               For every over 2, this line will go up 5. Because
               ``travel`` specifies that this goes over 4, it must go
               upÂ 10. Thus its endpoint is *(1,3)+(4,10)=(5,13)*. In
               particular, note that *``travel``\ =4* is not the length
               of the line, it is the change in *x*.

               The arguments ``x_run`` and ``y_rise`` are integers that
               can be positive, negative, or zero. (If both are 0 then
               LaTeX treats the second as 1.) With
               ``\put(``\ ``x_init``\ ``,``\ ``y_init``\ ``){\line(``\ ``x_run``\ ``,``\ ``y_rise``\ ``){``\ ``travel``\ ``}}``,
               if ``x_run`` is negative then the lineâs ending point has
               a first coordinate that is less than ``x_init``. If
               ``y_rise`` is negative then the lineâs ending point has a
               second coordinate that is less than ``y_init``.

               If ``travel`` is negative then you get
               ``LaTeX Error: Bad \line or \vector argument.``

               Standard LaTeX can only draw lines with a limited range
               of slopes because these lines are made by putting
               together line segments from pre-made fonts. The two
               numbers ``x_run`` and ``y_rise`` must have integer values
               from â6 throughÂ 6. Also, they must be relatively prime,
               so that ``(x_run,y_rise)`` can be (2,1) but not (4,2) (if
               you choose the latter then instead of lines you get
               sequences of arrowheads; the solution is to switch to the
               former). To get lines of arbitrary slope and plenty of
               other shapes in a system like ``picture``, see the
               package ``pict2e`` (https://ctan.org/pkg/pict2e). Another
               solution is to use a full-featured graphics system such
               as TikZ, PSTricks, MetaPost, or Asymptote.

               Produce a rectangle with rounded corners, hereinafter
               referred to as an *oval*. The optional argument
               ``portion`` allows you to produce only half or a quarter
               of the oval. For half an oval take ``portion`` to be one
               of these.

               Produce only one quarter of the oval by setting
               ``portion`` to ``tr``, ``br``, ``bl``, or ``tl``.

               This draws the top half of an oval that is 3 wide and 7
               tall.

               center of the top half.

               These shapes are not ellipses. They are rectangles whose
               corners are made with quarter circles. These circles have
               a maximum radius of 20pt (see
               ```\circle`` <#g_t_005ccircle>`__ for the sizes). Thus
               large ovals are just frames with a small amount of corner
               rounding.

               Produce a vertical stack of objects.

               This labels the *y* axis by writing the word
               â\ *``y``*\ â above the word â\ ``axis``\ â.

                     \end{picture}

               For a short stack, the reference point is the lower left
               of the stack. In the above example the ``\makebox`` (see
               ```\mbox`` &
               ``\makebox`` <#g_t_005cmbox-_0026-_005cmakebox>`__) puts
               the stack flush right in a zero width box so in total the
               short stack sits slightly to the left of the *y*Â axis.

               The valid positions are:

               ``r``
                  Make objects flush right

               ``l``
                  Make objects flush left

               ``c``
                  Center objects (default)

               Separate objects into lines with ``\\``. These stacks are
               short in that, unlike in a ``tabular`` or ``array``
               environment, here the rows are not spaced out to be of
               even baseline skips. Thus, in ``\shortstack{X\\o\\o\\X}``
               the first and last rows are taller than the middle two,
               and therefore the baseline skip between the two middle
               rows is smaller than that between the third and last row.
               You can adjust row heights and depths either by putting
               in the usual interline spacing with
               ``\shortstack{X\\ \strut o\\o\\X}`` (see
               ```\strut`` <#g_t_005cstrut>`__), or explicitly, via an
               zero-width box
               ``\shortstack{X \\ \rule{0pt}{12pt} o\\o\\X}`` or by
               using ``\\``\ âs optional argument
               ``\shortstack{X\\[2pt] o\\o\\X}``.

               The ``\shortstack`` command is also available outside the
               ``picture`` environment.

               is: it vertically rises ``y_rise`` for every horizontal
               ``x_run``. The ``travel`` is the total horizontal
               changeâit is not the length of the vector, it is the
               change in *x*. In the special case of vertical vectors,

               For elaboration on ``x_run`` and ``y_rise`` see

               the two you choose must be relatively prime. Thus,

               is not (if you use the latter then you get a sequence of

               Make a box to hold ``text``. This command fits with the
               ``picture`` environment, although you can use it outside
               of there, because ``rec-width`` and ``rec-height`` are
               numbers specifying distances in terms of the
               ``\unitlength`` (see ```picture`` <#picture>`__). This
               command is similar to the normal ``\makebox`` command
               (see ```\mbox`` &

               This command is fragile (see

                     \framebox(rec-width,rec-height)[position]{text}

               This is the same as ```\makebox``
               (picture) <#g_t_005cmakebox-_0028picture_0029>`__ except
               that it puts a frame around the outside of the box that
               it creates. The reference point is the bottom left corner
               of the frame. This command fits with the ``picture``
               environment, although you can use it outside of there,
               because lengths are numbers specifying the distance in
               terms of the ``\unitlength`` (see
               ```picture`` <#picture>`__). This command is fragile (see
               ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

               This example creates a frame 2.5Â inches by 3Â inches and
               puts the text in the center.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \setlength{\unitlength}{1in}
                     \framebox(2.5,3){test text}

               The required arguments are that the rectangle has overall
               width ``rect-width`` units and height ``rect-height``
               units.

               The optional argument ``position`` specifies the position
               of ``text``; see ```\makebox``
               (picture) <#g_t_005cmakebox-_0028picture_0029>`__ for the
               values that it can take.

               The rule has thickness ``\fboxrule`` and there is a blank
               space ``\fboxsep`` between the frame and the contents of
               the box.

               For this command, you must specify the ``width`` and
               ``height``. If you want to just put a frame around some
               contents whose dimension is determined in some other way
               then either use ``\fbox`` (see ```\fbox`` &
               ``\framebox`` <#g_t_005cfbox-_0026-_005cframebox>`__) or
               ``\frame`` (see ```\frame`` <#g_t_005cframe>`__).

                     \dashbox{dash-len}(rect-width,rect-height)[position]{text}

               Create a dashed rectangle around ``text``. This command
               fits with the ``picture`` environment, although you can
               use it outside of there, because lengths are numbers
               specifying the distance in terms of the ``\unitlength``
               (see ```picture`` <#picture>`__).

               The required arguments are: dashes are ``dash-len`` units
               long, with the same length gap, and the rectangle has
               overall width ``rect-width`` units and height
               ``rect-height`` units.

               The optional argument ``position`` specifies the position
               of ``text``; see ```\makebox``
               (picture) <#g_t_005cmakebox-_0028picture_0029>`__ for the
               values that it can take.

               This shows that you can use non-integer value for
               ``dash-len``.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \put(0,0){\dashbox{0.1}(5,0.5){My hovercraft is full of eels.}}

               Each dash will be ``0.1\unitlength`` long, the boxâs
               width is ``5\unitlength`` and its height is
               ``0.5\unitlength``.

               As in that example, a dashed box looks best when
               ``rect-width`` and ``rect-height`` are multiples of the
               ``dash-len``.

            both sides by ``\leftmargin`` and the text is
            right-justified.

            They differ in how they treat paragraphs. In the
            ``quotation`` environment, paragraphs are indented by 1.5em
            and the space between paragraphs is small, ``0pt plus 1pt``.
            In the ``quote`` environment, paragraphs are not indented
            and there is vertical space between paragraphs (it is the
            rubber length ``\parsep``).

                  row2col1 \> row2col2 ...  \\

            Align text in columns, by setting tab stops and tabbing to
            them much as was done on a typewriter. This is less often
            used than the environments ``tabular`` (see
            ```tabular`` <#tabular>`__) or ``array`` (see
            ```array`` <#array>`__) because in those the width of each
            column need not be constant and need not be known in
            advance.

            This example has a first line where the tab stops are set to
            explicit widths, ended by a ``\kill`` command (which is
            described below):

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{tabbing}
                  \hspace{1.2in}\=\hspace{1in}\=\kill
                  Ship                \>Guns             \>Year    \\ 
                  \textit{Sophie}     \>14               \>1800    \\
                  \textit{Polychrest} \>24               \>1803    \\
                  \textit{Lively}     \>38               \>1804    \\
                  \textit{Surprise}   \>28               \>1805    \\
                  \end{tabbing}

            Both the ``tabbing`` environment and the more widely-used
            ``tabular`` environment put text in columns. The most
            important distinction is that in ``tabular`` the width of
            columns is determined automatically by LaTeX, while in
            ``tabbing`` the user sets the tab stops. Another distinction
            is that ``tabular`` generates a box, but ``tabbing`` can be
            broken across pages. Finally, while ``tabular`` can be used
            in any mode, ``tabbing`` can be used only in paragraph mode
            and it always starts a new paragraph, without indentation.

            Moreover, as shown in the example above, there is no need to
            use the starred form of the ``\hspace`` command at the
            beginning of a tabbed row. The right margin of the
            ``tabbing`` environment is the end of line, so that the
            width of the environment is ``\linewidth``.

            The ``tabbing`` environment contains a sequence of *tabbed
            rows*. The first tabbed row begins immediately after
            ``\begin{tabbing}`` and each row ends with ``\\`` or
            ``\kill``. The last row may omit the ``\\`` and end with
            just ``\end{tabbing}``.

            At any point the ``tabbing`` environment has a *current tab
            stop pattern*, a sequence of *``n`` > 0* tab stops, numbered
            0, 1, etc. These create ``n`` corresponding columns. Tab
            stopÂ 0 is always the left margin, defined by the enclosing
            environment. Tab stop numberÂ ``i`` is set if it is assigned
            a horizontal position on the page. Tab stop numberÂ ``i`` can
            only be set if all the stops 0, â¦, *i-1* have already been
            set; normally later stops are to the right of earlier ones.

            By default any text typeset in a ``tabbing`` environment is
            typeset ragged right and left-aligned on the current tab
            stop. Typesetting is done in LR mode (see
            `Modes <#Modes>`__).

            The following commands can be used inside a ``tabbing``
            environment. They are all fragile (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            ``\\``\ ``(tabbing)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_005c-_0028tabbing_0029>`__
               End a tabbed line and typeset it.

            ``\=``\ ``(tabbing)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_003d-_0028tabbing_0029>`__
               Sets a tab stop at the current position.

            ``\>``\ ``(tabbing)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_003e-_0028tabbing_0029>`__
               Advances to the next tab stop.

            ``\<`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_003c>`__
               Put following text to the left of the local margin
               (without changing the margin). Can only be used at the
               start of the line.

            ``\+`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_002b>`__
               Moves the left margin of the next and all the following
               commands one tab stop to the right, beginning tabbed line
               if necessary.

            ``\-`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_002d>`__
               Moves the left margin of the next and all the following
               commands one tab stop to the left, beginning tabbed line
               if necessary.

            ``\'``\ ``(tabbing)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_0027-_0028tabbing_0029>`__
               Moves everything that you have typed so far in the
               current column, i.e., everything from the most recent
               ``\>``, ``\<``, ``\'``, ``\\``, or ``\kill`` command, to
               the previous column and aligned to the right, flush
               against the current columnâs tab stop.

            :literal:`\\\``\ ``(tabbing)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_0060-_0028tabbing_0029>`__
               Allows you to put text flush right against any tab stop,
               including tab stopÂ 0. However, it canât move text to the
               right of the last column because thereâs no tab stop
               there. The :literal:`\\\`` command moves all the text
               that follows it, up to the ``\\`` or ``\end{tabbing}``
               command that ends the line, to the right margin of the
               ``tabbing`` environment. There must be no ``\>`` or
               ``\'`` command between the :literal:`\\\`` and the ``\\``
               or ``\end{tabbing}`` command that ends the line.

            ``\a``\ ``(tabbing)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ca-_0028tabbing_0029>`__

               In a ``tabbing`` environment, the commands ``\=``, ``\'``
               and :literal:`\\\`` do not produce accents as usual (see
               `Accents <#Accents>`__). Instead, use the commands
               ``\a=``, ``\a'`` and :literal:`\\a\``.

            ``\kill`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ckill>`__
               Sets tab stops without producing text. Works just like
               ``\\`` except that it throws away the current line
               instead of producing output for it. Any ``\=``, ``\+`` or
               ``\-`` commands in that line remain in effect.

            ``\poptabs`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cpoptabs>`__
               Restores the tab stop positions saved by the last
               ``\pushtabs``.

            ``\pushtabs`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cpushtabs>`__
               Saves all current tab stop positions. Useful for
               temporarily changing tab stop positions in the middle of
               a ``tabbing`` environment.

            ``\tabbingsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctabbingsep>`__
               Distance of the text moved by ``\'`` to left of current
               tab stop.

            This example typesets a Pascal function:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{tabbing}
                  function \= fact(n : integer) : integer;\\
                           \> begin \= \+ \\
                                 \> if \= n > 1 then \+ \\
                                          fact := n * fact(n-1) \- \\
                                    else \+ \\
                                          fact := 1; \-\- \\
                              end;\\
                  \end{tabbing}

            The output looks like this.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  function fact(n : integer) : integer;
                           begin
                                 if n > 1 then
                                    fact := n * fact(n-1);
                                 else
                                    fact := 1;
                           end;

            This example is just for illustration of the environment. To
            actually typeset computer code in typewriter like this, a
            verbatim environment (see ```verbatim`` <#verbatim>`__)
            would normally be best. For pretty-printed code, there are
            quite a few packages, including ``algorithm2e``,
            ``fancyvrb``, ``listings``, and ``minted``.

            A class of floats (see `Floats <#Floats>`__). They cannot be
            split across pages and so they are not typeset in sequence
            with the normal text but instead are floated to a convenient
            place, such as the top of a following page.

            This example ``table`` environment contains a ``tabular``

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{table}

                  \end{table}

            but you can put many different kinds of content in a
            ``table``: the ``table body`` may contain text, LaTeX
            commands, graphics, etc. It is typeset in a ``parbox`` of
            width ``\textwidth``.

            For the possible values of ``placement`` and their effect on
            the float placement algorithm, see `Floats <#Floats>`__.

            The label is optional; it is used for cross references (see
            `Cross references <#Cross-references>`__). The ``\caption``
            command is also optional. It specifies caption text
            ``title`` for the table (see
            ```\caption`` <#g_t_005ccaption>`__). By default it is
            numbered. If its optional ``lottitle`` is present then that
            text is used in the list of tables instead of ``title`` (see
            `Table of contents, list of figures, list of
            tables <#Table-of-contents-etc_002e>`__).

            In this example the table and caption will float to the
            bottom of a page, unless it is pushed to a float page at the
            end.

            Produce a table, a box consisting of a sequence of
            horizontal rows. Each row consists of items that are aligned
            vertically in columns. This illustrates many of the
            features.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{tabular}{l|l}

                    Babe Ruth   &714
                  \end{tabular}

            The output will have two left-aligned columns with a
            vertical bar between them. This is specified in
            ``tabular``\ âs argument ``{l|l}``. Put the entries into
            different columns by separating them with an ampersand,
            ``&``. The end of each row is marked with a double
            backslash, ``\\``. Put a horizontal rule below a row, after
            a double backslash, with ``\hline``. After the last row the
            ``\\`` is optional, unless an ``\hline`` command follows to
            put a rule below the table.

            The required and optional arguments to ``tabular`` consist
            of:

            ``pos``
               Optional. Specifies the tableâs vertical position. The
               default is to align the table so its vertical center
               matches the baseline of the surrounding text. There are
               two other possible alignments: ``t`` aligns the table so
               its top row matches the baseline of the surrounding text,
               and ``b`` aligns on the bottom row.

               This only has an effect if there is other text. In the
               common case of a ``tabular`` alone in a ``center``
               environment this option makes no difference.

            ``cols``
               Required. Specifies the formatting of columns. It
               consists of a sequence of the following specifiers,
               corresponding to the types of column and intercolumn
               material.

               ``l``
                  A column of left-aligned items.

               ``r``
                  A column of right-aligned items.

               ``c``
                  A column of centered items.

               ``|``
                  A vertical line the full height and depth of the
                  environment.

               ``@{``\ ``text or space``\ ``}``
                  Insert ``text or space`` at this location in every
                  row. The ``text or space`` material is typeset in LR
                  mode. This text is fragile (see
                  ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

                  If between two column specifiers there is no
                  @-expression then LaTeXâs ``book``, ``article``, and
                  ``report`` classes will put on either side of each
                  column a space of width ``\tabcolsep``, which by
                  default is 6pt. That is, by default adjacent columns
                  are separated by 12pt (so ``\tabcolsep`` is
                  misleadingly named since it is only half of the
                  separation between tabular columns). In addition, a
                  space of ``\tabcolsep`` also comes before the first
                  column and after the final column, unless you put a
                  ``@{...}`` there.

                  If you override the default and use an @-expression
                  then LaTeX does not insert ``\tabcolsep`` so you must
                  insert any desired space yourself, as in
                  ``@{\hspace{1em}}``.

                  An empty expression ``@{}`` will eliminate the space.
                  In particular, sometimes you want to eliminate the
                  space before the first column or after the last one,
                  as in the example below where the tabular lines need
                  to lie on the left margin.

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        \begin{flushleft}
                          \begin{tabular}{@{}l}
                            ...
                          \end{tabular}
                        \end{flushleft}

                  The next example shows text, a decimal point between
                  the columns, arranged so the numbers in the table are
                  aligned on it.

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        \begin{tabular}{r@{$.$}l}
                          $3$ &$14$  \\
                          $9$ &$80665$
                        \end{tabular}

                  An ``\extracolsep{``\ ``wd``\ ``}`` command in an
                  @-expression causes an extra space of width ``wd`` to
                  appear to the left of all subsequent columns, until
                  countermanded by another ``\extracolsep``. Unlike
                  ordinary intercolumn space, this extra space is not
                  suppressed by an @-expression. An ``\extracolsep``
                  command can be used only in an @-expression in the
                  ``cols`` argument. Below, LaTeX inserts the right
                  amount of intercolumn space to make the entire table 4
                  inches wide.

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        \begin{tabular*}{4in}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}l}
                          Seven times down, eight times up \ldots 
                          &such is life!
                        \end{tabular*}

                  To insert commands that are automatically executed
                  before a given column, load the ``array`` package and
                  use the ``>{...}`` specifier.

               ``p{``\ ``wd``\ ``}``
                  Each item in the column is typeset in a parbox of
                  width ``wd``, as if it were the argument of a
                  ``\parbox[t]{wd}{...}`` command.

                  A line break double backslash ``\\`` may not appear in
                  the item, except inside an environment like
                  ``minipage``, ``array``, or ``tabular``, or inside an
                  explicit ``\parbox``, or in the scope of a
                  ``\centering``, ``\raggedright``, or ``\raggedleft``
                  declaration (when used in a ``p``-column element these
                  declarations must appear inside braces, as with
                  ``{\centering .. \\ ..}``). Otherwise LaTeX will
                  misinterpret the double backslash as ending the
                  tabular row. Instead, to get a line break in there use
                  ``\newline`` (see
                  ```\newline`` <#g_t_005cnewline>`__).

               ``*{``\ ``num``\ ``}{``\ ``cols``\ ``}``
                  Equivalent to ``num`` copies of ``cols``, where
                  ``num`` is a positive integer and ``cols`` is a list
                  of specifiers. Thus the specifier
                  ``\begin{tabular}{|*{3}{l|r}|}`` is equivalent to the
                  specifier ``\begin{tabular}{|l|rl|rl|r|}``. Note that
                  ``cols`` may contain another ``*``-expression.

            ``width``
               Required for ``tabular*``, not allowed for ``tabular``.
               Specifies the width of the ``tabular*`` environment. The
               space between columns should be rubber, as with
               ``@{\extracolsep{\fill}}``, to allow the table to stretch
               or shrink to make the specified width, or else you are
               likely to get the
               ``Underfull \hbox (badness 10000) in alignment ...``
               warning.

            Parameters that control formatting:

            ``\arrayrulewidth`` `Â¶ <#index-_005carrayrulewidth>`__
               A length that is the thickness of the rule created by
               ``|``, ``\hline``, and ``\vline`` in the ``tabular`` and
               ``array`` environments. The default is â\ ``.4pt``\ â.
               Change it as in ``\setlength{\arrayrulewidth}{0.8pt}``.

            ``\arraystretch`` `Â¶ <#index-_005carraystretch>`__
               A factor by which the spacing between rows in the
               ``tabular`` and ``array`` environments is multiplied. The
               default is â\ ``1``\ â, for no scaling. Change it as
               ``\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}``.

            ``\doublerulesep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cdoublerulesep>`__
               A length that is the distance between the vertical rules

            ``\tabcolsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctabcolsep>`__
               A length that is half of the space between columns. The

                     \multicolumn{numcols}{cols}{text}

               Make an ``array`` or ``tabular`` entry that spans several
               columns. The first argument ``numcols`` gives the number
               of columns to span. The second argument ``cols``
               specifies the formatting of the entry, with ``c`` for
               centered, ``l`` for flush left, or ``r`` for flush right.
               The third argument ``text`` gives the contents of that
               entry.

               In this example, in the first row, the second and third
               columns are spanned by the single heading â\ ``Name``\ â.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{tabular}{lccl} 
                       \textit{ID}       &\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Name}} &\textit{Age} \\
                       \hline  
                       978-0-393-03701-2 &O'Brian &Patrick                  &55           \\
                         ...
                     \end{tabular}

               What counts as a column is:Â the column format specifier
               for the ``array`` or ``tabular`` environment is broken
               into parts, where each part (except the first) begins
               with ``l``, ``c``, ``r``, orÂ ``p``. So from
               ``\begin{tabular}{|r|ccp{1.5in}|}`` the parts are
               ``|r|``, ``c``, ``c``, andÂ ``p{1.5in}|``.

               The ``cols`` argument overrides the ``array`` or
               ``tabular`` environmentâs intercolumn area default
               adjoining this multicolumn entry. To affect that area,
               this argument can contain vertical bars ``|`` indicating
               the placement of vertical rules, and ``@{...}``
               expressions. Thus if ``cols`` is â\ ``|c|``\ â then this
               multicolumn entry will be centered and a vertical rule
               will come in the intercolumn area before it and after it.
               This table details the exact behavior.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{tabular}{|cc|c|c|}
                       \multicolumn{1}{r}{w}       % entry one
                         &\multicolumn{1}{|r|}{x}  % entry two 
                         &\multicolumn{1}{|r}{y}   % entry three
                         &z                        % entry four
                     \end{tabular}

               Before the first entry the output will not have a
               vertical rule because the ``\multicolumn`` has the
               ``cols`` specifier â\ ``r``\ â with no initial vertical
               bar. Between entry one and entry two there will be a
               vertical rule; although the first ``cols`` does not have
               an ending vertical bar, the second ``cols`` does have a
               starting one. Between entry two and entry three there is
               a single vertical rule; despite that the ``cols`` in both
               of the surrounding ``multicolumn``\ âs call for a
               vertical rule, you only get one rule. Between entry three
               and entry four there is no vertical rule; the default
               calls for one but the ``cols`` in the entry three
               ``\multicolumn`` leaves it out, and that takes
               precedence. Finally, following entry four there is a
               vertical rule because of the default.

               The number of spanned columns ``numcols`` can be 1.
               Besides giving the ability to change the horizontal
               alignment, this also is useful to override for one row
               the ``tabular`` definitionâs default intercolumn area
               specification, including the placement of vertical rules.

               In the example below, in the ``tabular`` definition the
               first column is specified to default to left justified
               but in the first row the entry is centered with
               ``\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textsc{Period}}``. Also in the
               first row, the second and third columns are spanned by a
               single entry with ``\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textsc{Span}}``,
               overriding the specification to center those two columns
               on the page range en-dash.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{tabular}{l|r@{--}l} 
                       \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textsc{Period}}  
                         &\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textsc{Span}} \\ \hline
                       Baroque          &1600           &1760         \\
                       Classical        &1730           &1820         \\
                       Romantic         &1780           &1910         \\

                     \end{tabular}

               Although the ``tabular`` specification by default puts a
               vertical rule between the first and second columns, no
               such vertical rule appears in the first row here. Thatâs
               because there is no vertical bar in the ``cols`` part of
               the first rowâs first ``\multicolumn`` command.

               Draw a vertical line in a ``tabular`` or ``array``
               environment extending the full height and depth of an
               entryâs row. Can also be used in an @-expression,
               although its synonym vertical barÂ ``|`` is more common.
               This command is rarely used in the body of a table;
               typically a tableâs vertical lines are specified in
               ``tabular``\ âs ``cols`` argument and overridden as
               needed with ``\multicolumn`` (see
               ```tabular`` <#tabular>`__).

               The example below illustrates some pitfalls. In the first
               rowâs second entry the ``\hfill`` moves the ``\vline`` to
               the left edge of the cell. But that is different than
               putting it halfway between the two columns, so between
               the first and second columns there are two vertical
               rules, with the one from the ``{c|cc}`` specifier coming
               before the one produced by the ``\vline\hfill``. In
               contrast, the first rowâs third entry shows the usual way
               to put a vertical bar between two columns. In the second
               row, the ``ghi`` is the widest entry in its column so in
               the ``\vline\hfill`` the ``\hfill`` has no effect and the
               vertical line in that entry appears immediately next to
               the ``g``, with no whitespace.

               Draw a horizontal line the width of the enclosing
               ``tabular`` or ``array`` environment. Itâs most commonly
               used to draw a line at the top, bottom, and between the
               rows of a table.

               In this example the top of the table has two horizontal
               rules, one above the other, that span both columns. The
               bottom of the table has a single rule spanning both
               columns. Because of the ``\hline``, the ``tabular``
               second rowâs line ending double backslashÂ ``\\`` is
               required.

            Produce a bibliography or reference list. There are two ways
            to produce bibliographic lists. This environment is suitable

            list by hand. See `Using BibTeX <#Using-BibTeX>`__, for a

            This styles the first reference as â\ ``[1] Leslie ...``\ â,
            and so that ``... based on \cite{latexdps}`` produces the
            matching â\ ``... based on [1]``\ â. The second ``\cite``
            produces â\ ``[1, 2]``\ â. You must compile the document
            twice to resolve these references.

            The mandatory argument ``widest-label`` is text that, when
            typeset, is as wide as the widest item label produced by the
            ``\bibitem`` commands. The tradition is to use ``9`` for
            bibliographies with less than 10 references, ``99`` for ones
            with less than 100, etc.

            The bibliographic list is headed by a title such as
            â\ ``Bibliography``\ â. To change it there are two cases. In
            the ``book`` and ``report`` classes, where the top level
            sectioning is ``\chapter`` and the default title is
            â\ ``Bibliography``\ â, that title is in the macro
            ``\bibname``. For ``article``, where the classâs top level
            sectioning is ``\section`` and the default is
            â\ ``References``\ â, the title is in macro ``\refname``.
            Change it by redefining the command, as with
            ``\renewcommand{\refname}{Cited references}``, after
            ``\begin{document}``.

            Language support packages such as ``babel`` will
            automatically redefine ``\refname`` or ``\bibname`` to fit
            the selected language.

               Generate an entry labeled by default by a number
               generated using the ``enumi`` counter. The *citation key*
               ``cite_key`` can be any string of letters, numbers, and
               punctuation symbols (but not comma).

               See ```thebibliography`` <#thebibliography>`__, for an
               example.

               When provided, the optional ``label`` becomes the entry

                     \end{thebibliography}

               the first entry will be styled as
               â\ ``[Lamport 1993] Leslie ...``\ â (The amount of
               horizontal space that LaTeX leaves for the label depends
               on the ``widest-label`` argument of the
               ``thebibliography`` environment; see
               ```thebibliography`` <#thebibliography>`__.) Similarly,
               ``... based on \cite{latexdps}`` will produce
               â\ ``... based on [Lamport 1994]``\ â.

               If you mix ``\bibitem`` entries having a ``label`` with
               those that do not then LaTeX will number the unlabelled
               ones sequentially. In the example above the ``texbook``
               entry will appear as â\ ``[1] Donald ...``\ â, despite
               that it is the second entry.

               If you use the same ``cite_key`` twice then you get
               â\ ``LaTeX Warning: There were multiply-defined labels``\ â.

               Under the hood, LaTeX remembers the ``cite_key`` and
               ``label`` information because ``\bibitem`` writes it to
               the auxiliary file ``jobname``\ ``.aux`` (see
               `Jobname <#Jobname>`__). For instance, the above example
               causes the two ``\bibcite{latexdps}{Lamport, 1993}`` and
               ``\bibcite{texbook}{1}`` to appear in that file. The
               ``.aux`` file is read by the ``\begin{document}`` command
               and then the information is available for ``\cite``
               commands. This explains why you need to run LaTeX twice
               to resolve references: once to write it out and once to
               read it in.

               Because of this two-pass algorithm, when you add a
               ``\bibitem`` or change its ``cite_key`` you may get
               â\ ``LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right``\ â.
               Fix it by recompiling.

               Generate as output a citation to the references
               associated with ``keys``. The mandatory ``keys`` is a
               citation key, or a comma-separated list of citation keys
               (see ```\bibitem`` <#g_t_005cbibitem>`__).

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     The ultimate source is \cite{texbook}.

                       Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts, 1983.
                     \end{thebibliography}

               produces output like â\ ``... source is [1]``\ â. You can
               change the appearance of the citation and of the
               reference by using bibliography styles if you generate
               automatically the ``thebibliography`` environment. More
               information in `Using BibTeX <#Using-BibTeX>`__.

               The optional argument ``subcite`` is appended to the
               citation. For example,
               ``See 14.3 in \cite[p.~314]{texbook}`` might produce
               â\ ``See 14.3 in [1, p.Â 314]``\ â.

               In addition to what appears in the output, ``\cite``
               writes information to the auxiliary file
               ``jobname``\ ``.aux`` (see `Jobname <#Jobname>`__). For
               instance, ``\cite{latexdps}`` writes
               â\ ``\citation{latexdps}``\ â to that file. This
               information is used by BibTeX to include in your
               reference list only those works that you have actually
               cited; see ```\nocite`` <#g_t_005cnocite>`__ also.

               If ``keys`` is not in your bibliography information then
               you get
               â\ ``LaTeX Warning: There were undefined references``\ â,
               and in the output the citation shows as a boldface
               question mark between square brackets. There are two
               possible causes. If you have mistyped something, as in
               ``\cite{texbok}`` then you need to correct the spelling.
               On the other hand, if you have just added or modified the
               bibliographic information and so changed the ``.aux``
               file (see ```\bibitem`` <#g_t_005cbibitem>`__) then the
               fix may be to run LaTeX again.

                  :class: subsection

               As described in ``thebibliography`` (see
               ```thebibliography`` <#thebibliography>`__), a
               sophisticated approach to managing bibliographies is
               provided by the BibTeX program. This is only an
               introduction; see the full documentation on CTAN (see
               `CTAN: The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network <#CTAN>`__).

               With BibTeX, you donât use the ``thebibliography``
               environment directly (see
               ```thebibliography`` <#thebibliography>`__). Instead,
               include these lines:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \bibliographystyle{bibstyle}
                     \bibliography{bibfile1, bibfile2, ...}

               The ``bibstyle`` refers to a file ``bibstyle``\ ``.bst``,
               which defines how your citations will look. The standard
               ``bibstyle``\ âs distributed with BibTeX are:

               ``alpha``
                  Labels are formed from name of author and year of
                  publication. The bibliographic items are sorted
                  alphabetically.

               ``plain``
                  Labels are integers. Sort the bibliographic items
                  alphabetically.

               ``unsrt``
                  Like ``plain``, but entries are in order of citation.

               ``abbrv``
                  Like ``plain``, but more compact labels.

               Many, many other BibTeX style files exist, tailored to
               the demands of various publications. See the CTAN topic
               https://ctan.org/topic/bibtex-sty.

               The ``\bibliography`` command is what actually produces
               the bibliography. Its argument is a comma-separated list,
               referring to files named ``bibfile1``\ ``.bib``,
               ``bibfile2``\ ``.bib``, â¦ These contain your database in
               BibTeX format. This shows a typical couple of entries in
               that format.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                         title     = {Human Sexual Response},
                         year      = {1966},
                         publisher = {Bantam Books}
                     }

               Only the bibliographic entries referred to via ``\cite``
               and ``\nocite`` will be listed in the documentâs
               bibliography. Thus you can keep all your sources together
               in one file, or a small number of files, and rely on
               BibTeX to include in this document only those that you
               used.

               With BibTeX, the ``keys`` argument to ``\nocite`` can
               also be the single character â\ ``*``\ â. This means to
               implicitly cite all entries from all given
               bibliographies.

                  If you forget to use ``\bibliography`` or
                  ``\bibliographystyle`` in your document (or, less
                  likely, any ``\cite`` or ``\nocite`` command), BibTeX
                  will issue an error message. Because BibTeX can be
                  used with any program, not just LaTeX, the error
                  messages refer to the internal commands read by BibTeX
                  (from the ``.aux`` file), rather than the user-level
                  commands described above.

                  Here is a table showing internal commands mentioned in
                  the BibTeX errors, and the corresponding user-level
                  commands.

                  literal-text
                  \end{verbatim}

            A paragraph-making environment in which LaTeX produces as
            output exactly what you type as input. For instance inside
            ``literal-text`` the backslashÂ ``\`` character does not
            start commands, it produces a printed â\ ``\``\ â, and
            carriage returns and blanks are taken literally. The output
            appears in a monospaced typewriter-like font (``\tt``).

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{verbatim}
                  Symbol swearing: %&$#?!.
                  \end{verbatim}

            The only restriction on ``literal-text`` is that it cannot
            include the string ``\end{verbatim}``.

            You cannot use the verbatim environment in the argument to
            macros, for instance in the argument to a ``\section``. This
            is not the same as commands being fragile (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__), instead it just cannot
            work, as the ``verbatim`` environment changes the catcode
            regime before processing its contents, and restore it
            immediately afterward, nevertheless with a macro argument
            the content of the argument has already be converted to a
            token list along the catcode regime in effect when the macro
            was called. However, the ``cprotect`` package can help with
            this.

            One common use of verbatim input is to typeset computer
            code. There are packages that are an improvement the
            ``verbatim`` environment. For instance, one improvement is
            to allow the verbatim inclusion of external files, or parts
            of those files. Such packages include ``listings``, and
            ``minted``.

            A package that provides many more options for verbatim
            environments is ``fancyvrb``. Another is ``verbatimbox``.

            For a list of all the relevant packages, see CTAN (see
            `CTAN: The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network <#CTAN>`__).

                     \verb* char literal-text char

               Typeset ``literal-text`` as it is input, including
               special characters and spaces, using the typewriter
               (``\tt``) font.

               This example shows two different invocations of
               ``\verb``.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     This is \verb!literally! the biggest pumpkin ever.
                     And this is the best squash, \verb+literally!+

               The first ``\verb`` has its ``literal-text`` surrounded
               with exclamation point, ``!``. The second instead uses
               plus, ``+``, because the exclamation point is part of
               ``literal-text``.

               The single-character delimiter ``char`` surrounds
               ``literal-text``âit must be the same character before and
               after. No spaces come between ``\verb`` or ``\verb*`` and
               ``char``, or between ``char`` and ``literal-text``, or
               between ``literal-text`` and the second occurrence of
               ``char`` (the synopsis shows a space only to distinguish
               one component from the other). The delimiter must not
               appear in ``literal-text``. The ``literal-text`` cannot
               include a line break.

               The ``*``-form differs only in that spaces are printed
               with a visible space character.

               The output from this will include a visible space on both
               side of word â\ ``with``\ â:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     The command's first argument is \verb*!filename with extension! and ...

               For typesetting Internet addresses, urls, the package
               ``url`` is a better option than the ``\verb`` command,
               since it allows line breaks.

               For computer code there are many packages with advantages
               over ``\verb``. One is ``listings``, another is
               ``minted``.

               You cannot use ``\verb`` in the argument to a macro, for
               instance in the argument to a ``\section``. It is not a
               question of ``\verb`` being fragile (see
               ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__), instead it just
               cannot work, as the ``\verb`` command changes the catcode
               regime before reading its argument, and restore it
               immediately afterward, nevertheless with a macro argument
               the content of the argument has already be converted to a
               token list along the catcode regime in effect when the
               macro was called. However, the ``cprotect`` package can
               help with this.

         The first thing LaTeX does when processing ordinary text is to
         translate your input file into a sequence of glyphs and spaces.
         To produce a printed document, this sequence must be broken
         into lines (and these lines must be broken into pages).

         LaTeX usually does the line (and page) breaking in the text
         body for you but in some environments you manually force line
         breaks.

         A common workflow is to get a final version of the document
         content before taking a final pass through and considering line
         breaks (and page breaks). This differs from word processing,
         where you are formatting text as you input it. Putting these
         off until the end prevents a lot of fiddling with breaks that
         will change anyway.

            The starred form, ``\\*``, tells LaTeX not to start a new
            page between the two lines, by issuing a ``\nobreak``.

            Explicit line breaks in the main text body are unusual in
            LaTeX. In particular, donât start new paragraphs with
            ``\\``. Instead leave a blank line between the two
            paragraphs. And donât put in a sequence of ``\\``\ âs to
            make vertical space. Instead use
            ``\vspace{``\ ``length``\ ``}``, or
            ``\leavevmode\vspace{``\ ``length``\ ``}``, or
            ``\vspace*{``\ ``length``\ ``}`` if you want the space to
            not be thrown out at the top of a new page (see
            ```\vspace`` <#g_t_005cvspace>`__).

            The ``\\`` command is mostly used outside of the main flow
            of text such as in a ``tabular`` or ``array`` environment or
            in an equation environment.

            The ``\\`` command is a synonym for ``\newline`` (see
            ```\newline`` <#g_t_005cnewline>`__) under ordinary
            circumstances (an example of an exception is the ``p{...}``
            column in a ``tabular`` environment; see
            ```tabular`` <#tabular>`__).

            The ``\\`` command is a macro, and its definition changes by
            context so that its definition in normal text, a ``center``
            environment, a ``flushleft`` environment, and a ``tabular``
            are all different. In normal text when it forces a linebreak
            it is essentially a shorthand for ``\newline``. It does not
            end horizontal mode or end the paragraph, it just inserts
            some glue and penalties so that when the paragraph does end
            a linebreak will occur at that point, with the short line
            padded with white space.

            You get â\ ``LaTeX Error: There's no line here to end``\ â
            if you use ``\\`` to ask for a new line, rather than to end
            the current line. An example is if you have
            ``\begin{document}\\`` or, more likely, something like this.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{center}
                    \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
                    \\
                    In that vertical space put your mark.
                    \end{minipage}
                  \end{center}

            Fix it by replacing the double backslash with something like
            ``\vspace{\baselineskip}``.

            The ``\obeycr`` command makes a return in the input file
            (â\ ``^^M``\ â, internally) the same as ``\\``, followed by
            ``\relax``. So each new line in the input will also be a new
            line in the output. The ``\restorecr`` command restores
            normal line-breaking behavior.

            This is not the way to show verbatim text or computer code.
            Use ``verbatim`` (see ```verbatim`` <#verbatim>`__) instead.

            In ordinary text, this ends a line in a way that does not
            right-justify it, so the text before the end of line is not
            stretched. That is, in paragraph mode (see
            `Modes <#Modes>`__), the ``\newline`` command is equivalent
            to double-backslash (see ```\\`` <#g_t_005c_005c>`__). This
            command is fragile (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            However, the two commands are different inside a ``tabular``
            or ``array`` environment. In a column with a specifier
            producing a paragraph box such as typically ``p{...}``,
            ``\newline`` will insert a line end inside of the column;
            that is, it does not break the entire tabular row. To break
            the entire row use ``\\`` or its equivalent
            ``\tabularnewline``.

            This will print â\ ``Name:``\ â and â\ ``Address:``\ â as

               :class: section

            Tell LaTeX that it may hyphenate the word at that point.
            When you insert ``\-`` commands in a word, the word will
            only be hyphenated at those points and not at any of the
            other hyphenation points that LaTeX might otherwise have
            chosen. This command is robust (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            LaTeX is good at hyphenating and usually finds most of the
            correct hyphenation points, while almost never using an
            incorrect one. The ``\-`` command is for exceptional cases.

            For example, LaTeX does not ordinarily hyphenate words
            containing a hyphen. Below, the long and hyphenated word
            means LaTeX has to put in unacceptably large spaces to set
            the narrow column.

                                 the false notion that democracy means that
                                 `my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge'.
                  \end{tabular}

            Commenting out the third line and uncommenting the fourth
            makes a much better fit.

            The ``\-`` command only allows LaTeX to break there, it does
            not require that it break there. You can force a split with
            something like ``Hef-\linebreak feron``. Of course, if you
            later change the text then this forced break may look out of
            place, so this approach requires care.

            The ``\slash`` command produces a â\ ``/``\ â character and
            then a penalty of the same value as an explicit â\ ``-``\ â
            character (``\exhyphenpenalty``). This allows TeX to break a
            line at the â\ ``/``\ â, similar to a hyphen. Hyphenation is
            allowed in the word part preceding the â\ ``/``\ â, but not
            after. For example:

            If a line break occurs at the point where ``\discretionary``
            appears then TeX puts ``pre-break`` at the end of the
            current line and puts ``post-break`` at the start of the
            next line. If there is no line break here then TeX puts
            ``no-break``.

            In â\ ``difficult``\ â the three letters ``ffi`` form a
            ligature. But TeX can nonetheless break between the two

            Declarations to make TeX more picky or less picky about line
            breaking. Declaring ``\fussy`` usually avoids too much space
            between words, at the cost of an occasional overfull box.
            Conversely, ``\sloppy`` avoids overfull boxes while

            The default is ``\fussy``. Line breaking in a paragraph is

            force or prevent the break. But for instance,
            ``\nolinebreak[1]`` is a suggestion that another place may

         .. rubric:: 10 Page breaking
            :name: Page-breaking-1
            :class: chapter

         Ordinarily LaTeX automatically takes care of breaking output
         into pages with its usual aplomb. But if you are writing
         commands, or tweaking the final version of a document, then you
         may need to understand how to influence its actions.

         LaTeXâs algorithm for splitting a document into pages is more
         complex than just waiting until there is enough material to
         fill a page and outputting the result. Instead, LaTeX typesets
         more material than would fit on the page and then chooses a
         break that is optimal in some way (it has the smallest
         *badness*). An example of the advantage of this approach is
         that if the page has some vertical space that can be stretched
         or shrunk, such as with rubber lengths between paragraphs, then
         LaTeX can use that to avoid widow lines (where a new page
         starts with the last line of a paragraph; LaTeX can squeeze the
         extra line onto the first page) and orphans (where the first
         line of paragraph is at the end of a page; LaTeX can stretch
         the material of the first page so the extra line falls on the
         second page). Another example is where LaTeX uses available
         vertical shrinkage to fit on a page not just the header for a
         new section but also the first two lines of that section.

         But LaTeX does not optimize over the entire documentâs set of
         page breaks. So it can happen that the first page break is
         great but the second one is lousy; to break the current page
         LaTeX doesnât look as far ahead as the next page break. So
         occasionally you may want to influence page breaks while
         preparing a final version of a document.

         See `Layout <#Layout>`__, for more material that is relevant to
         page breaking.

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \cleardoublepage

            End the current page and output all of the pending floating
            figures and tables (see `Floats <#Floats>`__). If there are
            too many floats to fit on the page then LaTeX will put in
            extra pages containing only floats. In two-sided printing,
            ``\cleardoublepage`` also makes the next page of content a
            right-hand page, an odd-numbered page, if necessary
            inserting a blank page. The ``\clearpage`` command is robust
            while ``\cleardoublepage`` is fragile (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            LaTeXâs page breaks are optimized so ordinarily you only use
            this command in a document body to polish the final version,
            or inside commands.

            The ``\cleardoublepage`` command will put in a blank page,
            but it will have the running headers and footers. To get a
            really blank page, use this command.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \let\origdoublepage\cleardoublepage
                  \newcommand{\clearemptydoublepage}{%
                    \clearpage
                    {\pagestyle{empty}\origdoublepage}%
                  }

            If you want LaTeXâs standard ``\chapter`` command to do this
            then add the line
            ``\let\cleardoublepage\clearemptydoublepage``. (Of course
            this affects all uses of ``\cleardoublepage``, not just the
            one in ``\chapter``.)

            The command ``\newpage`` (see
            ```\newpage`` <#g_t_005cnewpage>`__) also ends the current
            page, but without clearing pending floats. And, if LaTeX is
            in two-column mode then ``\newpage`` ends the current column
            while ``\clearpage`` and ``\cleardoublepage`` end the
            current page.

            this command in a document body to polish the final version,

            While the commands ``\clearpage`` and ``\cleardoublepage``
            also end the current page, in addition they clear pending
            floats (see ```\clearpage`` &
            ``\cleardoublepage`` <#g_t_005cclearpage-_0026-_005ccleardoublepage>`__).
            And, if LaTeX is in two-column mode then ``\clearpage`` and
            ``\cleardoublepage`` end the current page, possibly leaving
            an empty column, while ``\newpage`` only ends the current
            column.

            In contrast with ``\pagebreak`` (see ```\pagebreak`` &
            ``\nopagebreak`` <#g_t_005cpagebreak-_0026-_005cnopagebreak>`__),
            the ``\newpage`` command will cause the new page to start
            right where requested. This

            makes a new page start after â\ ``continent``\ â, and the
            cut-off line is not right justified. In addition,
            ``\newpage`` does not vertically stretch out the page, as
            ``\pagebreak`` does.

            Enlarge the ``\textheight`` for the current page. The
            required argument ``size`` must be a rigid length (see
            `Lengths <#Lengths>`__). It may be positive or negative.
            This command is fragile (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            A common strategy is to wait until you have the final text
            of a document, and then pass through it tweaking line and
            page breaks. This command allows you some page size leeway.

            This will allow one extra line on the current page.

            is often used together with an explicit ``\pagebreak``.

            Encourage or discourage a page break. The optional

            request. The default is 4, so that without the optional
            argument these commands entirely force or prevent the break.
            But for instance ``\nopagebreak[1]`` suggests to LaTeX that

            does not give a page break at â\ ``continent``\ â, but
            instead at â\ ``nation``\ â, since that is where LaTeX
            breaks that line. In addition, with ``\pagebreak`` the
            vertical space on the page is stretched out where possible
            so that it extends to the normal bottom margin. This can
            look strange, and if ``\flushbottom`` is in effect this can
            cause you to get
            â\ ``Underfull \vbox (badness 10000) has occurred while \output is active``\ â.

         You can put multiple footnotes on a page. If the footnote text
         becomes too long then it will flow to the next page.

         You can also produce footnotes by combining the
         ``\footnotemark`` and the ``\footnotetext`` commands, which is
         useful in special circumstances.

         To make bibliographic references come out as footnotes you need
         to include a bibliographic style with that behavior (see `Using
         BibTeX <#Using-BibTeX>`__).

                  There are over a thousand footnotes in Gibbon's 
                  \textit{Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire}.\footnote{%
                    After reading an early version with endnotes David Hume complained, 
                    ``One is also plagued with his Notes, according to the present Method 
                    of printing the Book'' and suggested that they ``only to be printed 
                    at the Margin or the Bottom of the Page.''}

            The optional argument ``number`` allows you to specify the
            number of the footnote. If you use this then LaTeX does not
            increment the ``footnote`` counter.

            By default, LaTeX uses arabic numbers as footnote markers.
            Change this with something like
            ``\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\fnsymbol{footnote}}``, which
            uses a sequence of symbols (see
            ```\alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol``: Printing
            counters <#g_t_005calph-_005cAlph-_005carabic-_005croman-_005cRoman-_005cfnsymbol>`__).
            To make this change global put that in the preamble. If you
            make the change local then you may want to reset the counter
            with ``\setcounter{footnote}{0}``.

            LaTeX determines the spacing of footnotes with two
            parameters.

            ``\footnoterule`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cfootnoterule>`__
               Produces the rule separating the main text on a page from
               the pageâs footnotes. Default dimensions in the standard
               document classes (except ``slides``, where it does not
               appear) is: vertical thickness of ``0.4pt``, and
               horizontal size of ``0.4\columnwidth`` long. Change the
               rule with something like this.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \renewcommand{\footnoterule}{% Kerns avoid vertical space
                       \kern -3pt                         % This -3 is negative
                       \hrule width \textwidth height 1pt % of the sum of this 1

            ``\footnotesep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cfootnotesep>`__
               The height of the strut placed at the beginning of the
               footnote (see ```\strut`` <#g_t_005cstrut>`__). By
               default, this is set to the normal strut for
               ``\footnotesize`` fonts (see `Font
               sizes <#Font-sizes>`__), therefore there is no extra
               space between footnotes. This is â\ ``6.65pt``\ â for
               â\ ``10pt``\ â, â\ ``7.7pt``\ â for â\ ``11pt``\ â, and
               â\ ``8.4pt``\ â for â\ ``12pt``\ â. Change it as with
               ``\setlength{\footnotesep}{11pt}``.

            The ``\footnote`` command is fragile (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            LaTeXâs default puts many restrictions on where you can use
            a ``\footnote``; for instance, you cannot use it in an
            argument to a sectioning command such as ``\chapter`` (it
            can only be used in outer paragraph mode; see
            `Modes <#Modes>`__). There are some workarounds; see
            following sections.

            In a ``minipage`` environment the ``\footnote`` command uses
            the ``mpfootnote`` counter instead of the ``footnote``
            counter, so they are numbered independently. They are shown
            at the bottom of the environment, not at the bottom of the
            page. And by default they are shown alphabetically. See
            ```minipage`` <#minipage>`__ and `Footnotes in a
            table <#Footnotes-in-a-table>`__.

            Put the current footnote mark in the text. To specify
            associated text for the footnote
            seeÂ ```\footnotetext`` <#g_t_005cfootnotetext>`__. The
            optional argument ``number`` causes the command to use that
            number to determine the footnote mark. This command can be
            used in inner paragraph mode (see `Modes <#Modes>`__).

            If you use ``\footnotemark`` without the optional argument
            then it increments the ``footnote`` counter, but if you use
            the optional ``number`` then it does not. The next example
            produces several consecutive footnote markers referring to
            the same footnote.

            If there are intervening footnotes then you must remember
            the value of the number of the common mark. This example
            gives the same institutional affiliation to both the first
            and third authors (``\thanks`` is a version of
            ``\footnote``), by-hand giving the number of the footnote.

            of the table of contents, where it is not likely to be
            desired. The simplest way to have it not appear on the table

            Inside a ``tabular`` or ``array`` environment the

            mark in the table cell but the footnote text does not
            appear. The solution is to use a ``minipage`` environment as
            here (see ```minipage`` <#minipage>`__).

            Inside a ``minipage``, footnote marks are lowercase letters.
            Change that with something like
            ``\renewcommand{\thempfootnote}{\arabic{mpfootnote}}`` (see
            ```\alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol``: Printing

            The footnotes in the prior example appear at the bottom of
            the ``minipage``. To have them appear at the bottom of the
            main page, as part of the regular footnote sequence, use the
            ``\footnotemark`` and ``\footnotetext`` pair and make a new

            Particularly in the humanities, authors can have multiple
            classes of footnotes, including having footnotes of
            footnotes. The package ``bigfoot`` extends LaTeXâs default
            footnote mechanism in many ways, including allow these two,
            as in this example.

            Synopses, one of (three regular forms, three starred forms):

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\cmd}{defn}
                  \newcommand{\cmd}[nargs]{defn}
                  \newcommand{\cmd}[nargs][optargdefault]{defn}
                  \newcommand*{\cmd}{defn}
                  \newcommand*{\cmd}[nargs]{defn}
                  \newcommand*{\cmd}[nargs][optargdefault]{defn}

            or the same six possibilities with ``\renewcommand`` instead
            of ``\newcommand``:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \renewcommand{\cmd}{defn}
                  \renewcommand{\cmd}[nargs]{defn}
                  \renewcommand{\cmd}[nargs][optargdefault]{defn}
                  \renewcommand*{\cmd}{defn}
                  \renewcommand*{\cmd}[nargs]{defn}
                  \renewcommand*{\cmd}[nargs][optargdefault]{defn}

            Define or redefine a command (see also
            ``\DeclareRobustCommand`` in `Class and package
            commands <#Class-and-package-commands>`__).

            The starred form of these two forbids the arguments from
            containing multiple paragraphs of text (i.e., a ``\par``
            token; in plain TeX terms: the commands are not ``\long``).
            With the default form, arguments can be multiple paragraphs.

            These are the parameters (examples follow):

            ``cmd``
               Required; ``\``\ ``cmd`` is the command name. It must
               begin with a backslash, ``\``, and must not begin with
               the four character string ``\end``. For ``\newcommand``,
               it must not be already defined. For ``\renewcommand``,
               this name must already be defined.

            ``nargs``
               Optional; an integer from 0 to 9, specifying the number
               of arguments that the command takes, including any
               optional argument. Omitting this argument is the same as
               specifying 0, meaning that the command has no arguments.
               If you redefine a command, the new version can have a
               different number of arguments than the old version.

            ``optargdefault`` `Â¶ <#index-optional-arguments_002c-defining-and-using>`__
               Optional; if this argument is present then the first
               argument of ``\``\ ``cmd`` is optional, with default
               value ``optargdefault`` (which may be the empty string).
               If ``optargdefault`` is not present then ``\``\ ``cmd``
               does not take an optional argument.

               That is, if ``\``\ ``cmd`` is called with a following
               argument in square brackets, as in
               ``\``\ ``cmd``\ ``[``\ ``optval``\ ``]{...}...``, then
               within ``defn`` the parameterÂ ``#1`` is set to
               ``optval``. On the other hand, if ``\``\ ``cmd`` is
               called without following square brackets then within
               ``defn`` the parameter ``#1`` is set to
               ``optargdefault``. In either case, the required arguments
               start with ``#2``.

               Omitting ``[``\ ``optargdefault``\ ``]`` from the
               definition is entirely different from giving the square
               brackets with empty contents, as in ``[]``. The former
               says the command being defined takes no optional
               argument, so ``#1`` is the first required argument (if
               *``nargs`` â¥ 1*); the latter sets the optional argument
               ``#1`` to the empty string as the default, if no optional
               argument was given in the call.

               Similarly, omitting ``[``\ ``optval``\ ``]`` from a call
               is also entirely different from giving the square
               brackets with empty contents. The former sets ``#1`` to
               the value of ``optval`` (assuming the command was defined
               to take an optional argument); the latter sets ``#1`` to
               the empty string, just as with any other value.

               If a command is not defined to take an optional argument,
               but is called with an optional argument, the results are
               unpredictable: there may be a LaTeX error, there may be
               incorrect typeset output, or both.

            ``defn`` `Â¶ <#index-parameters_002c-substituting>`__
               Required; the text to be substituted for every occurrence
               of ``\``\ ``cmd``. The parameters ``#1``, ``#2``, â¦,
               ``#``\ ``nargs`` are replaced by the values supplied when
               the command is called (or by ``optargdefault`` in the
               case of an optional argument not specified in the call,
               as just explained).

            TeX ignores blanks in the source following a control word
            (see `Control sequence, control word and control
            symbol <#Control-sequences>`__), as in â\ ``\cmd``\ â. If
            you want a space there, one solution is to type ``{}`` after
            the command (â\ ``\cmd{}``\ â), and another solution is to
            use an explicit control space (â\ ``\cmd\``\ â).

            A simple example of defining a new command:
            ``\newcommand{\RS}{Robin Smith}`` results in ``\RS`` being
            replaced by the longer text. Redefining an existing command
            is similar: ``\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{{\small QED}}``.

            If you use ``\newcommand`` and the command name has already
            been used then you get something like
            â\ ``LaTeX Error: Command \fred already defined. Or name \end... illegal, see p.192 of the manual``\ â.
            Similarly, If you use ``\renewcommand`` and the command name
            has not been defined then you get something like
            â\ ``LaTeX Error: \hank undefined``\ â.

            Here the first definition creates a command with no
            arguments, and the second, a command with one required
            argument:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\student}{Ms~O'Leary}
                  \newcommand{\defref}[1]{Definition~\ref{#1}}

            Use the first as in
            ``I highly recommend \student{} to you``. The second has a
            variable argument, so that ``\defref{def:basis}`` expands to
            ``Definition~\ref{def:basis}``, which ultimately expands to
            something like â\ ``Definition~3.14``\ â.

            Similarly, but with two required arguments:
            ``\newcommand{\nbym}[2]{$#1 \times #2$}`` is invoked as
            ``\nbym{2}{k}``.

            This example has an optional argument.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\salutation}[1][Sir or Madam]{Dear #1:}

            Then ``\salutation`` gives â\ ``Dear Sir or Madam:``\ â
            while ``\salutation[John]`` gives â\ ``Dear John:``\ â. And
            ``\salutation[]`` gives â\ ``Dear :``\ â.

            This example has an optional argument and two required
            arguments.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\lawyers}[3][company]{#2, #3, and~#1}
                  I employ \lawyers[Howe]{Dewey}{Cheatem}.

            The output is â\ ``I employ Dewey, Cheatem, and Howe.``\ â.
            The optional argument, ``Howe``, is associated with ``#1``,
            while ``Dewey`` and ``Cheatem`` are associated with ``#2``
            andÂ ``#3``. Because of the optional argument,
            ``\lawyers{Dewey}{Cheatem}`` will give the output
            â\ ``I employ Dewey, Cheatem, and company.``\ â.

            The braces around ``defn`` do not define a group, that is,
            they do not delimit the scope of the result of expanding
            ``defn``. For example, with
            ``\newcommand{\shipname}[1]{\it #1}``, in this sentence,

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  The \shipname{Monitor} met the \shipname{Merrimac}.

            the words â\ ``met the``\ â, and the period, would
            incorrectly be in italics. The solution is to put another
            pair of braces inside the definition:
            ``\newcommand{\shipname}[1]{{\it #1}}``.

               When reading input TeX converts the stream of read
               characters into a sequence of *tokens*. When TeX sees a
               backslash ``\``, it will handle the following characters
               in a special way in order to make a *control sequence*
               token.

               The control sequences fall into two categories:

               -   *control word*, when the control sequence is gathered
                  from a ``\`` followed by at least one ASCII letter
                  (``A-Z`` and ``a-z``), followed by at least one
                  non-letter.
               -   *control symbol*, when the control sequence is
                  gathered from a ``\`` followed by one non-letter
                  character.

               The sequence of characters so found after the ``\`` is
               also called the *control sequence name*.

               Blanks after a control word are ignored and do not
               produce any whitespace in the output (see
               ```\newcommand`` &
               ``\renewcommand`` <#g_t_005cnewcommand-_0026-_005crenewcommand>`__
               and `Backslash-space,
               ``\`` <#g_t_005c_0028SPACE_0029>`__).

               Just as the ``\relax`` command does nothing, the
               following input will simply print â\ ``Hello!``\ â :

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     Hel\relax   
                        lo!

               This is because blanks after ``\relax``, including the
               newline, are ignored, and blanks at the beginning of a
               line are also ignored (see `Leading
               blanks <#Leading-blanks>`__).

            then this has the same effect as ``\newcommand``. If a
            command of this name already exists then this definition
            does nothing. This is particularly useful in a file that may
            be loaded more than once, such as a style file. See
            ```\newcommand`` &
            ``\renewcommand`` <#g_t_005cnewcommand-_0026-_005crenewcommand>`__,
            for the description of the arguments.

                  From \myaffiliation.

            outputs â\ ``From Saint Michael's College.``\ â. Unlike
            ``\newcommand``, the repeated use of ``\providecommand`` to
            (try to) define ``\myaffiliation`` does not give an error.

            Synopsis:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \makeatletter
                    ... definition of commands with @ in their name ..
                  \makeatother

            Use this pair when you redefine LaTeX commands that are
            named with an at-sign characterÂ â\ ``@``\ â. The
            ``\makeatletter`` declaration makes the at-sign character
            have the category code of a letter, codeÂ 11. The
            ``\makeatother`` declaration sets the category code of the
            at-sign to codeÂ 12, its default value.

            As TeX reads characters, it assigns each one a category
            code, or *catcode*. For instance, it assigns the backslash
            characterÂ â\ ``\``\ â the catcodeÂ 0. Command names consist
            of a categoryÂ 0 character, ordinarily backslash, followed by
            letters, categoryÂ 11 characters (except that a command name
            can also consist of a categoryÂ 0 character followed by a
            single non-letter symbol).

            LaTeXâs source code has the convention that some commands
            use ``@`` in their name. These commands are mainly intended
            for package or class writers. The convention prevents
            authors who are just using a package or class from
            accidentally replacing such a command with one of their own,
            because by default the at-sign has catcodeÂ 12.

            Use the pair ``\makeatletter`` and ``\makeatother`` inside a
            ``.tex`` file, typically in the preamble, when you are
            defining or redefining commands named with ``@``, by having
            them surround your definition. Donât use these inside
            ``.sty`` or ``.cls`` files since the ``\usepackage`` and
            ``\documentclass`` commands already arrange that the at-sign
            has the character code of a letter, catcodeÂ 11.

            For a comprehensive list of macros with an at-sign in their
            names see https://ctan.org/pkg/macros2e.

            In this example the class file has a command
            ``\thesis@universityname`` that the user wants to change.
            These three lines should go in the preamble, before the
            ``\begin{document}``.

            Synopsis:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\mycmd}{\@ifstar{\mycmd@star}{\mycmd@nostar}}
                  \newcommand{\mycmd@nostar}[nostar-num-args]{nostar-body} 
                  \newcommand{\mycmd@star}[star-num-args]{star-body}

            Many standard LaTeX environments or commands have a variant
            with the same name but ending with a star characterÂ ``*``,
            an asterisk. Examples are the ``table`` and ``table*``
            environments and the ``\section`` and ``\section*``
            commands.

            When defining environments, following this pattern is
            straightforward because ``\newenvironment`` and
            ``\renewenvironment`` allow the environment name to contain
            a star. So you just have to write
            ``\newenvironment{``\ ``myenv``\ ``}`` or
            ``\newenvironment{``\ ``myenv``\ ``*}`` and continue the
            definition as usual. For commands the situation is more
            complex as the star not being a letter cannot be part of the
            command name. As in the synopsis above, there will be a
            user-called command, given above as ``\mycmd``, which peeks
            ahead to see if it is followed by a star. For instance,
            LaTeX does not really have a ``\section*`` command; instead,
            the ``\section`` command peeks ahead. This command does not
            accept arguments but instead expands to one of two commands
            that do accept arguments. In the synopsis these two are
            ``\mycmd@nostar`` and ``\mycmd@star``. They could take the
            same number of arguments or a different number, or no
            arguments at all. As always, in a LaTeX document a command
            using an at-signÂ ``@`` in its name must be enclosed inside a
            ``\makeatletter ... \makeatother`` block (see
            ```\makeatletter`` &
            ``\makeatother`` <#g_t_005cmakeatletter-_0026-_005cmakeatother>`__).

            This example of ``\@ifstar`` defines the command ``\ciel``
            and a variant ``\ciel*``. Both have one required argument. A
            call to ``\ciel{blue}`` will return "not starry blue sky"
            while ``\ciel*{night}`` will return "starry night sky".

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \makeatletter
                  \newcommand*{\ciel@unstarred}[1]{not starry #1 sky}
                  \newcommand*{\ciel@starred}[1]{starry #1 sky}
                  \newcommand*{\ciel}{\@ifstar{\ciel@starred}{\ciel@unstarred}}
                  \makeatother

            In the next example, the starred variant takes a different
            number of arguments than the unstarred one. With this
            definition, Agent 007âs
            :literal:`\``My name is \\agentsecret*{Bond}, \\agentsecret{James}{Bond}.''`
            is equivalent to entering the commands
            :literal:`\``My name is \\textsc{Bond}, \\textit{James} textsc{Bond}.''`

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand*{\agentsecret@unstarred}[2]{\textit{#1} \textsc{#2}}
                  \newcommand*{\agentsecret@starred}[1]{\textsc{#1}}
                  \newcommand*{\agentsecret}{%
                    \@ifstar{\agentsecret@starred}{\agentsecret@unstarred}}

            After a command name, a star is handled similarly to an
            optional argument. (This differs from environment names in
            which the star is part of the name itself and as such could
            be in any position.) Thus, it is technically possible to put
            any number of spaces between the command and the star. Thus
            ``\agentsecret*{Bond}`` and ``\agentsecretÂ *{Bond}`` are
            equivalent. However, the standard practice is not to insert
            any such spaces.

            There are two alternative ways to accomplish the work of
            ``\@ifstar``. (1)Â The ``suffix`` package allows the
            construct
            ``\newcommand\mycommand{``\ ``unstarred-variant``\ ``}``
            followed by
            ``\WithSuffix\newcommand\mycommand*{``\ ``starred-variant``\ ``}``.
            (2)Â LaTeX provides the ``xparse`` package, which allows this
            code:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \NewDocumentCommand\foo{s}{\IfBooleanTF#1
                    {starred-variant}%
                    {unstarred-variant}% 
                    }

            Synopsis, one of:

                  \newcounter{countername}
                  \newcounter{countername}[supercounter]

            Globally defines a new counter named ``countername`` and
            initialize it to zero (see `Counters <#Counters>`__).

            The name ``countername`` must consist of letters only. It
            does not begin with a backslash. This name must not already
            be in use by another counter.

            When you use the optional argument
            ``[``\ ``supercounter``\ ``]`` then the counter
            ``countername`` will be reset to zero whenever
            ``supercounter`` is incremented. For example, ordinarily
            ``subsection`` is numbered within ``section`` so that any
            time you increment ``section``, either with ``\stepcounter``
            (see ```\stepcounter`` <#g_t_005cstepcounter>`__) or
            ``\refstepcounter`` (see
            ```\refstepcounter`` <#g_t_005crefstepcounter>`__), then
            LaTeX will reset ``subsection`` to zero.

            This example

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcounter{asuper}  \setcounter{asuper}{1}
                  \newcounter{asub}[asuper] \setcounter{asub}{3}   % Note `asuper'
                  The value of asuper is \arabic{asuper} and of asub is \arabic{asub}.
                  \stepcounter{asuper}
                  Now asuper is \arabic{asuper} while asub is \arabic{asub}.

            produces
            â\ ``The value of asuper is 1 and that of asub is 3``\ â and
            â\ ``Now asuper is 2 while asub is 0``\ â.

            If the counter already exists, for instance by entering
            ``asuper`` twice, then you get something like
            â\ ``LaTeX Error: Command \c@asuper already defined. Or name \end... illegal, see p.192 of the manual.``\ â.

            If you use the optional argument then the super counter must
            already exist. Entering ``\newcounter{jh}[lh]`` when ``lh``
            is not a defined counter will get you
            â\ ``LaTeX Error: No counter 'lh' defined.``\ â

            a backslash, ``\`` under normal circumstances. The new
            register holds rubber lengths such as ``72.27pt`` or
            ``1in plus.2in minus.1in`` (a LaTeX length register is what
            plain TeX calls a ``skip`` register). The initial value is

                  \renewenvironment*{env}[nargs][optargdefault]{begdef}{enddef}

            Define or redefine the environment ``env``, that is, create
            the construct
            ``\begin{``\ ``env``\ ``} ...``\ ``body``\ ``... \end{``\ ``env``\ ``}``.

            The starred form of these commands requires that the
            arguments not contain multiple paragraphs of text. However,
            the body of these environments can contain multiple
            paragraphs.

            ``env``
               Required; the environment name. It consists only of
               letters or the ``*`` character, and thus does not begin
               with backslash, ``\``. It must not begin with the string
               ``end``. For ``\newenvironment``, the name ``env`` must
               not be the name of an already existing environment, and
               also the command ``\``\ ``env`` must be undefined. For
               ``\renewenvironment``, ``env`` must be the name of an
               existing environment.

            ``nargs``
               Optional; an integer from 0 to 9 denoting the number of
               arguments of that the environment takes. When you use the
               environment these arguments appear after the ``\begin``,
               as in
               ``\begin{``\ ``env``\ ``}{``\ ``arg1``\ ``} ... {``\ ``argn``\ ``}``.
               Omitting this is equivalent to setting it to 0; the
               environment will have no arguments. When redefining an
               environment, the new version can have a different number
               of arguments than the old version.

            ``optargdefault``
               Optional; if this is present then the first argument of
               the defined environment is optional, with default value
               ``optargdefault`` (which may be the empty string). If
               this is not in the definition then the environment does
               not take an optional argument.

               That is, when ``optargdefault`` is present in the
               definition of the environment then you can start the
               environment with square brackets, as in
               ``\begin{``\ ``env``\ ``}[``\ ``optval``\ ``]{...} ... \end{``\ ``env``\ ``}``.
               In this case, within ``begdefn`` the parameter ``#1`` is
               set to the value of ``optval``. If you call
               ``\begin{``\ ``env``\ ``}`` without square brackets, then
               within ``begdefn`` the parameter ``#1`` is set to the
               value of the default ``optargdefault``. In either case,
               any required arguments start with ``#2``.

               Omitting ``[``\ ``myval``\ ``]`` in the call is different
               than having the square brackets with no contents, as in
               ``[]``. The former results in ``#1`` expanding to
               ``optargdefault``; the latter results in ``#1`` expanding
               to the empty string.

            ``begdef``
               Required; the text expanded at every occurrence of
               ``\begin{``\ ``env``\ ``}``. Within ``begdef``, the
               parameters ``#1``, ``#2``, ... ``#``\ ``nargs``, are
               replaced by the values that you supply when you call the
               environment; see the examples below.

            ``enddef``
               Required; the text expanded at every occurrence of
               ``\end{``\ ``env``\ ``}``. This may not contain any
               parameters, that is, you cannot use ``#1``, ``#2``, etc.,
               here (but see the final example below).

            All environments, that is to say the ``begdef`` code, the
            environment body, and the ``enddef`` code, are processed
            within a group. Thus, in the first example below, the effect
            of the ``\small`` is limited to the quote and does not
            extend to material following the environment.

            If you try to define an environment and the name has already
            been used then you get something like
            â\ ``LaTeX Error: Command \fred already defined. Or name \end... illegal, see p.192 of the manual``\ â.
            If you try to redefine an environment and the name has not
            yet been used then you get something like
            â\ ``LaTeX Error: Environment hank undefined.``\ â.

            This example gives an environment like LaTeXâs ``quotation``
            except that it will be set in smaller type.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newenvironment{smallquote}{%
                    \small\begin{quotation}
                  }{%
                    \end{quotation}
                  }

            This has an argument, which is set in boldface at the start
            of a paragraph.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newenvironment{point}[1]{%

                  }{%
                  }

            This one shows the use of a optional argument; it gives a
            quotation environment that cites the author.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newenvironment{citequote}[1][Shakespeare]{%
                    \begin{quotation}
                    \noindent\textit{#1}: 
                  }{%
                    \end{quotation}
                  }

            The authorâs name is optional, and defaults to
            â\ ``Shakespeare``\ â. In the document, use the environment
            like this.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{citequote}[Lincoln]
                    ...
                  \end{citequote}

            The final example shows how to save the value of an argument
            to use in ``enddef``, in this case in a box (see ```\sbox``
            & ``\savebox`` <#g_t_005csbox-_0026-_005csavebox>`__).

                    \sbox\quoteauthor{#1}%
                    \begin{quotation} 
                  }{%
                    \hspace{1em plus 1fill}---\usebox{\quoteauthor}
                    \end{quotation}
                  }

            Synopses:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newtheorem{name}{title}
                  \newtheorem{name}{title}[numbered_within]
                  \newtheorem{name}[numbered_like]{title}

            Define a new theorem-like environment. You can specify one
            of ``numbered_within`` and ``numbered_like``, or neither,
            but not both.

            The first form,
            ``\newtheorem{``\ ``name``\ ``}{``\ ``title``\ ``}``,
            creates an environment that will be labelled with ``title``;
            see the first example below.

            The second form,
            ``\newtheorem{``\ ``name``\ ``}{``\ ``title``\ ``}[``\ ``numbered_within``\ ``]``,
            creates an environment whose counter is subordinate to the
            existing counter ``numbered_within``, so this counter will
            be reset when ``numbered_within`` is reset. See the second
            example below.

            The third form
            ``\newtheorem{``\ ``name``\ ``}[``\ ``numbered_like``\ ``]{``\ ``title``\ ``}``,
            with optional argument between the two required arguments,
            creates an environment whose counter will share the
            previously defined counter ``numbered_like``. See the third
            example.

            This command creates a counter named ``name``. In addition,
            unless the optional argument ``numbered_like`` is used,
            inside of the theorem-like environment the current ``\ref``
            value will be that of ``\the``\ ``numbered_within`` (see
            ```\ref`` <#g_t_005cref>`__).

            This declaration is global. It is fragile (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            Arguments:

            ``name``
               The name of the environment. It is a string of letters.
               It must not begin with a backslash, ``\``. It must not be
               the name of an existing environment, and the command name
               ``\``\ ``name`` must not already be defined.

            ``title``
               The text to be printed at the beginning of the
               environment, before the number. For example,
               â\ ``Theorem``\ â.

            ``numbered_within``
               Optional; the name of an already defined counter, usually
               a sectional unit such as ``chapter`` or ``section``. When
               the ``numbered_within`` counter is reset then the
               ``name`` environmentâs counter will also be reset.

               If this optional argument is not used then the command
               ``\the``\ ``name`` is set to
               ``\arabic{``\ ``name``\ ``}``.

            ``numbered_like``
               Optional; the name of an already defined theorem-like
               environment. The new environment will be numbered in
               sequence with ``numbered_like``.

            Without any optional arguments the environments are numbered
            sequentially. The example below has a declaration in the
            preamble that results in â\ ``DefinitionÂ 1``\ â and
            â\ ``DefinitionÂ 2``\ â in the output.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newtheorem{defn}{Definition}

                  \section{...}
                  \begin{defn}

                    Second def
                  \end{defn}

            This example has the same document body as the prior one.
            But here ``\newtheorem``\ âs optional argument
            ``numbered_within`` is given as ``section``, so the output
            is like â\ ``DefinitionÂ 1.1``\ â and
            â\ ``DefinitionÂ 2.1``\ â.

            .. container:: example

                  \section{...}
                  \begin{defn}

                  \end{defn}

            In the next example there are two declarations in the
            preamble, the second of which calls for the new ``thm``
            environment to use the same counter as ``defn``. It gives
            â\ ``DefinitionÂ 1.1``\ â, followed by â\ ``TheoremÂ 2.1``\ â
            and â\ ``DefinitionÂ 2.2``\ â.

            This command is obsolete. This description is here only to
            help with old documents. New documents should define fonts
            in families through the New Font Selection Scheme which
            allows you to, for example, associate a boldface with a
            roman (see `Fonts <#Fonts>`__).

            Synopsis:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newfont{\cmd}{font description}

            Define a command ``\``\ ``cmd`` that will change the current
            font. The control sequence must not already be defined. It
            must begin with a backslash, ``\``.

            The ``font description`` consists of a ``fontname`` and an
            optional *at clause*. LaTeX will look on your system for a
            file named ``fontname``\ ``.tfm``. The at clause can have
            the form either ``at``\ ``dimen`` or ``scaled``\ ``factor``,
            where a ``factor`` of â\ ``1000``\ â means no scaling. For
            LaTeXâs purposes, all this does is scale all the character
            and other font dimensions relative to the fontâs design
            size, which is a value defined in the ``.tfm`` file.

            This defines two equivalent fonts and typesets a few
            characters in each.

            .. rubric:: 12.11 ``\protect``
               :name: g_t_005cprotect-1
               :class: section

            All LaTeX commands are either *fragile* or *robust*. A
            fragile command can break when it is used in the argument to
            certain other commands. Commands that contain data that
            LaTeX writes to an auxiliary file and re-reads later are
            fragile. This includes material that goes into a table of
            contents, list of figures, list of tables, etc. Fragile
            commands also include line breaks, any command that has an
            optional argument, and many more. To prevent such commands
            from breaking, one solution is to preceded them with the
            command ``\protect``.

            For example, when LaTeX runs the
            ``\section{``\ ``section name``\ ``}`` command it writes the
            ``section name`` text to the ``.aux`` auxiliary file, moving
            it there for use elsewhere in the document such as in the
            table of contents. Any argument that is internally expanded
            by LaTeX without typesetting it directly is referred to as a
            *moving argument*. A command is fragile if it can expand
            during this process into invalid TeX code. Some examples of
            moving arguments are those that appear in the
            ``\caption{...}`` command (see ```figure`` <#figure>`__), in
            the ``\thanks{...}`` command (see
            ```\maketitle`` <#g_t_005cmaketitle>`__), and in
            @-expressions in the ``tabular`` and ``array`` environments
            (see ```tabular`` <#tabular>`__).

            If you get strange errors from commands used in moving
            arguments, try preceding it with ``\protect``. Every fragile
            commands must be protected with their own ``\protect``.

            Although usually a ``\protect`` command doesnât hurt, length
            commands are robust and should not be preceded by a
            ``\protect`` command. Nor can a ``\protect`` command be used
            in the argument to ``\addtocounter`` or ``\setcounter``
            command.

            In this example the ``\caption`` command gives a mysterious
            error about an extra curly brace. Fix the problem by
            preceding each ``\raisebox`` command with ``\protect``.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{figure}
                    ...
                    \caption{Company headquarters of A\raisebox{1pt}{B}\raisebox{-1pt}{C}}
                  \end{figure}

            In the next example the ``\tableofcontents`` command gives
            an error because the ``\(..\)`` in the section title expands
            to illegal TeX in the ``.toc`` file. You can solve this by
            changing ``\(..\)`` to ``\protect\(..\protect\)``.

               :class: section

            Synopsis:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \ignorespaces

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \ignorespacesafterend

            Both commands cause LaTeX to ignore blanks (that is,
            characters of catcodeÂ 10 such as space or tabulation) after
            the end of the command up to the first box or non-blank
            character. The first is a primitive command of TeX, and the
            second is LaTeX-specific.

            The ``\ignorespaces`` is often used when defining commands
            via ``\newcommand``, or ``\newenvironment``, or ``\def``.
            The example below illustrates. It allows a user to show the
            points values for quiz questions in the margin but it is
            inconvenient because, as shown in the ``enumerate`` list,
            users must not put any space between the command and the
            question text.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\points}[1]{\makebox[0pt]{\makebox[10em][l]{#1~pts}}
                  \begin{enumerate} 
                    \item\points{10}no extra space output here
                    \item\points{15} extra space between the number and the `extra'
                  \end{enumerate} 

            The solution is to change to this.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\points}[1]{%
                    \makebox[0pt]{\makebox[10em][l]{#1~pts}}\ignorespaces}

            A second example shows blanks being removed from the front
            of text. The commands below allow a user to uniformly attach
            a title to names. But, as given, if a title accidentally
            starts with a space then ``\fullname`` will reproduce that.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\honorific}[1]{\def\honorific{#1}} % remember title
                  \newcommand{\fullname}[1]{\honorific~#1}       % put title before name

                  \begin{tabular}{|l|}
                  \honorific{Mr/Ms}  \fullname{Jones} \\  % no extra space here
                  \honorific{ Mr/Ms} \fullname{Jones}     % extra space before title
                  \end{tabular}

            To fix this, change to
            ``\newcommand{\fullname}[1]{\ignorespaces\honorific~#1}``.

            The ``\ignorespaces`` is also often used in a
            ``\newenvironment`` at the end of the ``begin`` clause, as
            in
            ``\begin{newenvironment}{``\ ``env name``\ ``}{... \ignorespaces}{...}``.

            To strip blanks off the end of an environment use
            ``\ignorespacesafterend``. An example is that this will show
            a much larger vertical space between the first and second
            environments than between the second and third.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newenvironment{eq}{\begin{equation}}{\end{equation}}
                  \begin{eq}
                  e=mc^2
                  \end{eq}
                  \begin{equation}
                  F=ma
                  \end{equation}
                  \begin{equation}
                  E=IR
                  \end{equation}

            Putting a comment characterÂ ``%`` immediately after the
            ``\end{eq}`` will make the vertical space disappear, but
            that is inconvenient. The solution is to change to
            ``\newenvironment{eq}{\begin{equation}}{\end{equation}\ignorespacesafterend}``.

               :name: xspace-package-1
               :class: section

            This is an add-on package, not part of core LaTeX. Synopsis:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \usepackage{xspace}
                    ...
                  \newcommand{...}{...\xspace}

            The ``\xspace`` macro, when used at the end of a command
            definition, adds a space unless the command is followed by
            certain punctuation characters.

            After a control sequence that is a control word (see
            `Control sequence, control word and control
            symbol <#Control-sequences>`__, as opposed to control
            symbols such as ``\$``), TeX gobbles blank characters. Thus,
            in the first sentence below, the output has
            â\ ``Vermont``\ â placed snugly against the period, without
            any intervening space, despite the space in the input.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\VT}{Vermont}
                  Our college is in \VT .
                  \VT{} summers are nice.

            But because of the gobbling, the second sentence needs the
            empty curly braces or else there would be no space
            separating â\ ``Vermont``\ â from â\ ``summers``\ â. (Many
            authors instead use a backslash-space ``\`` for this. See
            `Backslash-space, ``\`` <#g_t_005c_0028SPACE_0029>`__.)

            The ``xspace`` package provides ``\xspace``. It is for
            writing commands which are designed to be used mainly in
            text. It must be placed at the very end of the definition of
            these commands. It inserts a space after that command unless
            what immediately follows is in a list of exceptions. In this
            example, the empty braces are not needed.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\VT}{Vermont\xspace}
                  Our college is in \VT .
                  \VT summers are nice.

            The default exception list contains the characters
            ``,.'/?;:!~-)``, the open curly brace and the
            backslash-space command discussed above, and the commands
            ``\footnote`` or ``\footnotemark``. You can add to that list
            as with ``\xspaceaddexceptions{\myfni \myfnii}`` which adds
            ``\myfni`` andÂ ``\myfnii`` to the list; and you can remove
            from that list as with ``\xspaceremoveexception{!}``.

            A comment: many experts prefer not to use ``\xspace``.
            Putting it in a definition means that the command will
            usually get the spacing right. But it isnât easy to predict
            when to enter empty braces because ``\xspace`` will get it
            wrong, such as when it is followed by another command, and
            so ``\xspace`` can make editing material harder and more
            error-prone than instead of always inserting the empty
            braces.

               current definition of ``cmd`` is exactly as given by
               ``definition`` and is or is not *``\long``* as expected.
               A long command is a command that accepts ``\par`` within
               an argument.

               With the unstarred version of ``\CheckCommand``, ``cmd``
               is expected to be ``\long``; with the starred version,
               ``cmd`` must not be ``\long``

               ``\CheckCommand`` raises an error when the check fails.
               This allows you to check before you start redefining
               ``cmd`` yourself that no other package has already
               redefined this command.

               prompt. If the user then asks for help by typing ``h``,
               they see the ``help text``.

               The four ``Warning`` commands are similar except that
               they write ``warning-text`` on the screen with no error
               prompt. The four ``Info`` commands write ``info-text``
               only in the transcript file. The ``NoLine`` versions omit
               the number of the line generating the message, while the
               other versions do show that number.

               To format the messages, including the ``help-text``: use
               ``\protect`` to stop a command from expanding, get a line
               break with ``\MessageBreak``, and get a space with
               ``\space`` when a space character is ignore, most
               commonly after a command.

               LaTeX appends a period to the messages.

                     \DeclareOption{option}{code}
                     \DeclareOption*{option}{code}

               Define an option a user can include in their
               ``\documentclass`` command. For example, a class
               ``smcmemo`` could have an option ``logo`` allowing users
               to put the institutional logo on the first page. The
               document would start with
               ``\documentclass[logo]{smcmemo}``. To enable this, the
               class file must contain
               ``\DeclareOption{logo}{``\ ``code``\ ``}`` (and later,
               ``\ProcessOptions``).

               If you request an option that has not been declared, by
               default this will produce a warning like
               ``Unused global option(s): [badoption].`` This can be
               changed by using ``\DeclareOption*{``\ ``code``\ ``}``,
               which executes ``code`` for any unknown option.

               For example, many classes extend an existing class, using
               code such as ``\LoadClass{article}`` (see
               `\\LoadClass <#g_t_005cLoadClass>`__). In this case, it
               makes sense to pass any otherwise-unknown options to the
               underlying class, like this:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \DeclareOption*{%
                       \PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{article}%
                     }

               As another example, our class ``smcmemo`` might allow
               users to keep lists of memo recipients in external files,
               so the user could invoke
               ``\documentclass[math]{smcmemo}`` and it will read the
               file ``math.memo``. This code inputs the file if it
               exists, while if it doesnât, the option is passed to the
               ``article`` class:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \DeclareOption*{\InputIfFileExists{\CurrentOption.memo}
                       {}{%
                       \PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{article}}}

                     \DeclareRobustCommand{cmd}[num][default]{definition}
                     \DeclareRobustCommand* (same parameters

               ``\DeclareRobustCommand`` and its starred form are
               generally like ``\newcommand`` and ``\newcommand*`` (see
               ```\newcommand`` &
               ``\renewcommand`` <#g_t_005cnewcommand-_0026-_005crenewcommand>`__),
               with the addition that they define a so-called *robust*
               command, even if some code within the ``definition`` is
               fragile. (For a discussion of robust and fragile
               commands, see ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__.)

               Also unlike ``\newcommand``, these do not give an error
               if macro ``cmd`` already exists; instead, a log message
               is put into the transcript file if a command is
               redefined. Thus, ``\DeclareRobustCommand`` can be used to
               define new robust commands or to redefine existing
               commands, making them robust.

               The starred form, ``\DeclareRobustCommand*``, disallows
               the arguments from containing multiple paragraphs, just
               like the starred form of ``\newcommand`` and
               ``\renewcommand``. The meaning of the arguments is the
               same.

               Commands defined this way are a bit less efficient than
               those defined using ``\newcommand`` so unless the
               commandâs data is fragile and the command is used within
               a moving argument, use ``\newcommand``.

               Related to this, the ``etoolbox`` package offers three
               commands and their starred forms:
               ``\newrobustcmd``\ (``*``) ``\renewrobustcmd``\ (``*``),
               and ``\providerobustcmd``\ (``*``). They are similar to
               ``\newcommand``, ``\renewcommand``, and
               ``\providecommand`` and their own starred forms, but
               define a robust ``cmd``. They have two possible
               advantages compared to ``\DeclareRobustCommand``:

               #. They use the low-level e-TeX protection mechanism
                  rather than the higher-level LaTeX ``\protect``
                  mechanism, so they do not incur the slight loss of
                  performance mentioned above, and
               #. They make the same distinction between ``\newâ¦``,
                  ``\renewâ¦``, and ``\provideâ¦``, as the standard
                  commands. That is, they do not just write a log
                  message when you redefine ``cmd`` that already exists;
                  you need to use either ``\renewâ¦`` or ``\provideâ¦``,
                  or you get an error. This may or may not be a benefit.

                       {\typeout{!! img.pdf not found}

               will include the graphic ``img.pdf`` if it is found and
               otherwise give a warning.

               This command looks for the file in all search paths that
               LaTeX uses, not only in the current directory. To look
               only in the current directory do something like
               ``\IfFileExists{./``\ ``filename``\ ``}{``\ ``true-code``\ ``}{``\ ``false-code``\ ``}``.
               If you ask for a filename without a ``.tex`` extension
               then LaTeX will first look for the file by appending the
               ``.tex``; for more on how LaTeX handles file extensions
               see ```\input`` <#g_t_005cinput>`__.

               ``\InputIfFileExists`` is similar, but, as the name
               states, automatically ``\input``\ s ``filename`` if it
               exists. The ``true-code`` is executed just before the
               ``\input``; if the file doesnât exist, the ``false-code``
               is executed. An example:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \InputIfFileExists{mypkg.cfg}
                       {\PackageInfo{Loading mypkg.cfg for configuration information}}
                       {\PackageInfo{No mypkg.cfg found}}

               An example: ``\LoadClass[twoside]{article}``.

               The ``options-list``, if present, is a comma-separated
               list. The ``release-date`` is also optional. If present
               it must have the form ``YYYY/MM/DD``.

               If you request ``release-date`` and the date of the
               package installed on your system is earlier, then you get
               a warning on the screen and in the log like this:

                     Standard LaTeX document class' is available.

               The command version ``\LoadClassWithOptions`` uses the
               list of options for the current class. This means it
               ignores any options passed to it via
               ``\PassOptionsToClass``. This is a convenience command
               that lets you build classes on existing ones, such as the
               standard ``article`` class, without having to track which
               options were passed.

                     \PassOptionsToClass{options}{clsname}
                     \PassOptionsToPackage{option}{pkgname}

               Adds the options in the comma-separated list ``options``
               to the options used by any future ``\RequirePackage`` or
               ``\usepackage`` command for the class ``clsname`` or the
               package ``pkgname``, respectively.

               The reason for these commands is that although you may
               load a package any number of times with no options, if
               you can specify options only the first time you load the
               package. Loading a package with options more than once
               will get you an error like
               ``Option clash for package foo.``. LaTeX throws an error
               even if there is no conflict between the options.

               If your own code is bringing in a package twice then you
               can combine the calls; for example, replacing the two

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \RequirePackage[landscape]{geometry}
                     \RequirePackage[margins=1in]{geometry}

               with the single command

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \RequirePackage[landscape,margins=1in]{geometry}

               However, suppose you are loading ``firstpkg`` and inside
               that package it loads ``secondpkg``, and you need
               ``secondpkg`` to be loaded with option ``draft``. Then
               before load the first package you must tell LaTeX about
               the desired options for the second package, like this:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \PassOptionsToPackage{draft}{secondpkg}
                     \RequirePackage{firstpkg}

               If ``firstpkg.sty`` loads an option in conflict with what
               you want then you may have to alter its source, or yours.

               These commands are useful for general users as well as
               class and package writers. For instance, suppose a user
               wants to load the ``graphicx`` package with the option
               ``draft`` and also wants to use a class ``foo`` that
               loads the ``graphicx`` package, but without that option.
               The user could start their LaTeX file with
               ``\PassOptionsToPackage{draft}{graphicx} \documentclass{foo}``.

               Synopsis:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \ProcessOptions\@options
                     \ProcessOptions*\@options

               Execute the code for each option that the user has
               invoked. Invoke it in the class file as
               ``\ProcessOptions\relax`` (because of the existence of
               the starred version, described below).

               Options come in two types. *Local options* have been
               specified for this particular package in
               ``\usepackage[``\ ``options``\ ``]``,
               ``\RequirePackage[``\ ``options``\ ``]``, or the
               ``options`` argument of
               ``\PassOptionsToPackage{``\ ``options``\ ``}``. *Global
               options* are those given by the class user in
               ``\documentclass[``\ ``options``\ ``]``. If an option is
               specified both locally and globally then it is local.

               When ``\ProcessOptions`` is called for a package
               ``pkg.sty``, the following happens:

               #. For each option ``option`` so far declared with
                  ``\DeclareOption``, ``\ProcessOptions`` looks to see
                  if that option is either global or local for ``pkg``.
                  If so, then it executes the declared code. This is
                  done in the order in which these options were given in
                  ``pkg.sty``.
               #. For each remaining local option, it executes the
                  command ``\ds@``\ ``option`` if it has been defined
                  somewhere (other than by a ``\DeclareOption``);
                  otherwise, it executes the default option code given
                  in ``\DeclareOption*``. If no default option code has
                  been declared then it gives an error message. This is
                  done in the order in which these options were
                  specified.

               When ``\ProcessOptions`` is called for a class it works
               in the same way except that all options are local, and
               the default ``code`` for ``\DeclareOption*`` is
               ``\OptionNotUsed`` rather than an error.

               The starred version ``\ProcessOptions*`` executes the
               options in the order specified in the calling commands,
               rather than in the order of declaration in the class or
               package. For a package, this means that the global
               options are processed first.

               When you load a class or package, for example with
               ``\documentclass{smcmemo}`` or ``\usepackage{test}``,
               LaTeX inputs a file (``smcmemo.cls`` and ``test.sty``,
               respectively). If the name of the file does not match the
               class or package name declared in it then you get a
               warning. Thus, if you invoke ``\documentclass{smcmemo}``,
               and the file ``smcmemo.cls`` has the statement
               ``\ProvidesClass{foo}`` then you get a warning like
               :literal:`You have requested document class \`smcmemo', but the document class provides 'foo'.`
               This warning does not prevent LaTeX from processing the
               rest of the class file normally.

               If you include the optional argument then you must
               include a date, before any spaces, of the form
               ``YYYY/MM/DD``. The rest of the optional argument is
               free-form, although it traditionally identifies the
               class. It is written to the screen during compilation and
               to the log file. Thus, if your file ``smcmemo.cls``
               contains the line
               ``\ProvidesClass{smcmemo}[2008/06/01 v1.0 SMC memo class]``
               and your documentâs first line is
               ``\documentclass{smcmemo}`` then you will see
               ``Document Class: smcmemo 2008/06/01 v1.0 SMC memo class``.

               The date in the optional argument allows class and
               package users to ask to be warned if the version of the
               class or package is earlier than ``release date``. For
               instance, a user could enter
               ``\documentclass{smcmemo}[2018/10/12]`` or
               ``\usepackage{foo}[[2017/07/07]]`` to require a class or
               package with certain features by specifying that it must
               be released no earlier than the given date. Perhaps more
               importantly, the date serves as documentation of the last
               release. (In practice, package users rarely include a
               date, and class users almost never do.)

               | Load a package, like the command ``\usepackage`` (see
                 `Additional packages <#Additional-packages>`__). An
                 example:
               | ``\RequirePackage[landscape,margin=1in]{geometry}``

               The initial optional argument ``option-list``, if
               present, must be a comma-separated list. The trailing
               optional argument ``release-date``, if present, must have
               the form ``YYYY/MM/DD``. If the release date of the
               package as installed on your system is earlier than
               ``release-date`` then you get a warning like
               â\ :literal:`You have requested, on input line 9, version \`2017/07/03' of package jhtest, but only version \`2000/01/01' is available`\ â.

               The ``\RequirePackageWithOptions`` variant uses the list
               of options for the current class. This means it ignores
               any options passed to it via ``\PassOptionsToClass``.
               This is a convenience command to allow easily building
               classes on existing ones without having to track which
               options were passed.

               The difference between ``\usepackage`` and
               ``\RequirePackage`` is small. The ``\usepackage`` command
               is intended to be used in documents, while
               ``\RequirePackage`` is intended for package and class
               files. The most significant difference in practice is
               that ``\RequirePackage`` can be used in a document before
               the ``\documentclass`` command, while ``\usepackage``
               gives an error there. The most common need for this
               nowadays is for the ``\DocumentMetadata`` command (see
               ```\DocumentMetadata``: Producing tagged PDF
               output <#g_t_005cDocumentMetadata>`__).

               The LaTeX development team strongly recommends use of
               these and related commands over PlainÂ TeXâs ``\input``;
               see the Class Guide (https://ctan.org/pkg/clsguide).

            :name: Counters-1
            :class: chapter

         Everything LaTeX numbers for you has a counter associated with
         it. The name of the counter is often the same as the name of
         the environment or command associated with the number, except
         that the counterâs name has no backslashÂ ``\``. Thus,
         associated with the ``\chapter`` command is the ``chapter``
         counter that keeps track of the chapter number.

         Below is a list of the counters used in LaTeXâs standard
         document classes to control numbering.

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               subsection      equation        mpfootnote      enumiv
               subsubsection

         The ``mpfootnote`` counter is used by the ``\footnote`` command
         inside of a minipage (see ```minipage`` <#minipage>`__). The
         counters ``enumi`` through ``enumiv`` are used in the
         ``enumerate`` environment, for up to four levels of nesting
         (see ```enumerate`` <#enumerate>`__).

         Counters can have any integer value but they are typically
         positive.

         New counters are created with ``\newcounter``. See
         ```\newcounter``: Allocating a
         counter <#g_t_005cnewcounter>`__.

            Print the value of a counter, in a specified style. For
            instance, if the counter ``counter`` has the value 1 then a

            The ``\value`` command is not used for typesetting the value

            LaTeX defines the counter ``\day`` for the day of the month
            (nominally with value between 1 and 31), ``\month`` for the
            month of the year (nominally with value between 1 and 12),
            and ``\year`` for the year. When TeX starts up, they are set
            from the current values on the system. The related command
            ``\today`` produces a string representing the current day
            (see ```\today`` <#g_t_005ctoday>`__).

            They counters are not updated as the job progresses so in
            principle they could be incorrect by the end. In addition,
            TeX does no sanity check:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \day=-2 \month=13 \year=-4 \today

            gives no error or warning and results in the output
            â\ ``-2, -4``\ â (the bogus month value produces no output).

         .. rubric:: 14 Lengths
            :name: Lengths-1
            :class: chapter

         A *length* is a measure of distance. Many LaTeX commands take a
         length as an argument.

         Lengths come in two types. A *rigid length* such as ``10pt``
         does not contain a ``plus`` or ``minus`` component. (Plain TeX
         calls this a *dimen*.) A *rubber length* (what plain TeX calls
         a *skip* or *glue*) such as with ``1cm plus0.05cm minus0.01cm``
         can contain either or both of those components. In that rubber
         length, the ``1cm`` is the *natural length* while the other
         two, the ``plus`` and ``minus`` components, allow TeX to
         stretch or shrink the length to optimize placement.

         The illustrations below use these two commands.

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               % make a black bar 10pt tall and #1 wide
               \newcommand{\blackbar}[1]{\rule{#1}{10pt}}

               % Make a box around #2 that is #1 wide (excluding the border)
               \newcommand{\showhbox}[2]{%
                 \fboxsep=0pt\fbox{\hbox to #1{#2}}} 

         This next example uses those commands to show a black bar
         100Â points long between â\ ``ABC``\ â and â\ ``XYZ``\ â. This
         length is rigid.

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               ABC\showhbox{100pt}{\blackbar{100pt}}XYZ

         As for rubber lengths, shrinking is simpler one: with
         ``1cm minus 0.05cm``, the natural length is 1cm but TeX can
         shrink it down as far as 0.95cm. Beyond that, TeX refuses to
         shrink any more. Thus, below the first one works fine,
         producing a space of 98Â points between the two bars.

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               ABC\showhbox{300pt}{%
                 \blackbar{101pt}\hspace{100pt minus 2pt}\blackbar{101pt}}YYY

               ABC\showhbox{300pt}{%
                 \blackbar{105pt}\hspace{100pt minus 1pt}\blackbar{105pt}}YYY

         But the second one gets a warning like
         â\ ``Overfull \hbox (1.0pt too wide) detected at line 17``\ â.
         In the output the first â\ ``Y``\ â is overwritten by the end
         of the black bar, because the boxâs material is wider than the
         300pt allocated, as TeX has refused to shrink the total to less
         than 309Â points.

         Stretching is like shrinking except that if TeX is asked to
         stretch beyond the given amount, it will do it. Here the first
         line is fine, producing a space of 110Â points between the bars.

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               ABC\showhbox{300pt}{%
                 \blackbar{95pt}\hspace{100pt plus 10pt}\blackbar{95pt}}YYY

               ABC\showhbox{300pt}{%
                 \blackbar{95pt}\hspace{100pt plus 1pt}\blackbar{95pt}}YYY

         In the second line TeX needs a stretch of 10Â points and only
         1Â point was specified. TeX stretches the space to the required
         length but it gives you a warning like
         â\ ``Underfull \hbox (badness 10000) detected at line 22``\ â.
         (We wonât discuss badness.)

         You can put both stretch and shrink in the same length, as in
         ``1ex plus 0.05ex minus 0.02ex``.

         If TeX is setting two or more rubber lengths then it allocates
         the stretch or shrink in proportion.

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               ABC\showhbox{300pt}{%
                 \blackbar{100pt}%  left
                 \hspace{0pt plus 50pt}\blackbar{80pt}\hspace{0pt plus 10pt}%  middle
                 \blackbar{100pt}}YYY  % right

         The left and right bars take up 100Â points, so the middle needs
         another 100. The middle bar is 80Â points so the two
         ``\hspace``\ âs must stretch 20Â points. Because the two are
         ``plus 50pt`` and ``plus 10pt``, TeX gets 5/6 of the stretch
         from the first space and 1/6 from the second.

         The ``plus`` or ``minus`` component of a rubber length can
         contain a *fill* component, as in ``1in plus2fill``. This gives
         the length infinite stretchability or shrinkability so that TeX
         could set it to any distance. Here the two figures will be
         equally spaced across the page.

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
                 \hspace{0pt plus 1fill}\includegraphics{godel.png}%
                 \hspace{0pt plus 1fill}\includegraphics{einstein.png}%
                 \hspace{0pt plus 1fill}
               \end{minipage}

         TeX has three levels of infinity for glue components: ``fil``,
         ``fill``, and ``filll``. The later ones are more infinite than
         the earlier ones. Ordinarily document authors only use the
         middle one (see ```\hfill`` <#g_t_005chfill>`__ and see
         ```\vfill`` <#g_t_005cvfill>`__).

         Multiplying a rubber length by a number turns it into a rigid
         length, so that after ``\setlength{\ylength}{1in plus 0.2in}``
         and ``\setlength{\zlength}{3\ylength}`` then the value of
         ``\zlength`` is ``3in``.

            Three other units are defined according to the current font,
            rather than being an absolute dimension.

            ``ex`` `Â¶ <#index-ex-1>`__

               The x-height of the current font *ex*, traditionally the
               height of the lowercase letter x, is often used for
               vertical lengths.

            ``em`` `Â¶ <#index-em-1>`__

               Similarly *em*, traditionally the width of the capital
               letter M, is often used for horizontal lengths. This is
               also often the size of the current font, e.g., a nominal
               10pt font will have 1em = 10pt. LaTeX has several
               commands to produce horizontal spaces based on the em
               (see ```\enspace`` & ``\quad`` &
               ``\qquad`` <#g_t_005censpace-_0026-_005cquad-_0026-_005cqquad>`__).

            ``mu`` `Â¶ <#index-mu>`__

               Finally, in math mode, many definitions are expressed in
               terms of the math unit *mu*, defined by 1em = 18mu, where
               the em is taken from the current math symbols family. See
               `Spacing in math mode <#Spacing-in-math-mode>`__.

            Using these units can help make a definition work better
            across font changes. For example, a definition of the
            vertical space between list items given as
            ``\setlength{\itemsep}{1ex plus 0.05ex minus 0.01ex}`` is
            more likely to still be reasonable if the font is changed
            than a definition given in points.

            Any place where you may write an integer, or a TeX dimen, or
            TeX glue, or muglue, you can instead write an expression to
            compute that type of quantity.

            An example is that ``\the\dimexpr\linewidth-4pt\relax`` will
            produce as output the length that is four points less than
            width of a line (the only purpose of ``\the`` is to show the
            result in the document). Analogously,
            ``\romannumeral\numexpr6+3\relax`` will produce
            â\ ``ix``\ â, and ``\the\glueexpr 5pt plus 1pt * 2 \relax``
            will produce â\ ``10.0pt plus 2.0pt``\ â.

            A convenience here over doing calculations by allocating
            registers and then using ``\advance``, etc., is that the
            evaluation of expressions does not involve assignments and
            can therefore be performed in places where assignments are
            not allowed. The next example computes the width of the
            ``\parbox``.

                  achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with
                  all nations.  ---Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address, from the
                  memorial}
                  \end{center}

            The ``expression`` consists of one or more terms of the same
            type (integer, dimension, etc.) that are added or
            subtracted. A term that is a type of number, dimension,
            etc., consists of a factor of that type, optionally
            multiplied or divided by factors. A factor of a type is
            either a quantity of that type or a parenthesized
            subexpression. The expression produces a result of the given
            type, so that ``\numexpr`` produces an integer, ``\dimexpr``
            produces a dimension, etc.

            In the quotation example above, changing to
            ``\dimexpr\linewidth-3*\offset`` gives the error
            ``Illegal unit of measure (pt inserted)``. This is because
            for ``\dimexpr`` and ``\glueexpr``, the input consists of a
            dimension or glue value followed by an optional
            multiplication factor, and not the other way around. Thus
            ``\the\dimexpr 1pt*10\relax`` is valid and produces
            â\ ``10.0pt``\ â, but ``\the\dimexpr 10*1pt\relax`` gives
            the ``Illegal unit`` error.

            The expressions absorb tokens and carry out appropriate
            mathematics up to a ``\relax`` (which will be absorbed), or
            up to the first non-valid token. Thus, ``\the\numexpr2+3px``
            will print â\ ``5px``\ â, because LaTeX reads the
            ``\numexpr2+3``, which is made up of numbers, and then finds
            the letter ``p``, which cannot be part of a number. It
            therefore terminates the expression and produces the
            â\ ``5``\ â, followed by the regular text â\ ``px``\ â.

            This termination behavior is useful in comparisons. In
            ``\ifnum\numexpr\parindent*2 < 10pt Yes\else No\fi``, the
            less than sign terminates the expression and the result is
            â\ ``No``\ â (in a standard LaTeX article).

            Expressions may use the operators ``+``, ``-``, ``*`` and
            ``/`` along with parentheses for subexpressions, ``(...)``.
            In glue expressions the ``plus`` and ``minus`` parts do not
            need parentheses to be affected by a factor. So
            ``\the\glueexpr 5pt plus 1pt * 2 \relax`` results in
            â\ ``10pt plus 2pt``\ â.

            TeX will coerce other numerical types in the same way as it
            does when doing register assignment. Thus
            ``\the\numexpr\dimexpr 1pt\relax\relax`` will result in
            â\ ``65536``\ â, which is ``1pt`` converted to scaled points
            (see ```sp`` <#units-of-length-sp>`__, TeXâs internal unit)
            and then coerced into an integer. With a ``\glueexpr`` here,
            the stretch and shrink would be dropped. Going the other
            way, a ``\numexpr`` inside a ``\dimexpr`` or ``\glueexpr``
            will need appropriate units, as in
            ``\the\dimexpr\numexpr 1 + 2\relax pt\relax``, which
            produces â\ ``3.0pt``\ â.

            The details of the arithmetic: each factor is checked to be
            in the allowed range, numbers must be less than *2^{31}* in
            absolute value, and dimensions or glue components must be
            less than *2^{14}* points, or ``mu``, or ``fil``, etc. The
            arithmetic operations are performed individually, except for
            a scaling operation (a multiplication immediately followed
            by a division) which is done as one combined operation with
            a 64-bit product as intermediate value. The result of each
            operation is again checked to be in the allowed range.

            Finally, division and scaling take place with rounding
            (unlike TeXâs ``\divide``, which truncates). Thus
            ``\the\dimexpr 5pt*(3/2)\relax`` puts â\ ``10.0pt``\ â in
            the document, because it rounds ``3/2`` to ``2``, while
            ``\the\dimexpr 5pt*(4/3)\relax`` produces â\ ``5.0pt``\ â.

               It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
               of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

               However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
               first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
               of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
               of some one or other of their daughters.

               ``My dear Mr. Bennet,'' said his lady to him one day,
               ``have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?''

         A paragraph separator can be made of a sequence of at least one
         blank line, at least one of which is not terminated by a
         comment. A blank line is a line that is empty or made only of
         blank characters such as space or tab. Comments in source code
         are started with a ``%`` and span up to the end of line. In the
         following example the two columns are identical:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               \documentclass[twocolumn]{article}

               Second paragraph.
               \newpage
               First paragraph.
                     
                 % separator lines may contain blank characters.
                       
               Second paragraph.
               \end{document}

         Once LaTeX has gathered all of a paragraphâs contents it
         divides that content into lines in a way that is optimized over
         the entire paragraph (see `Line breaking <#Line-breaking>`__).

         There are places where a new paragraph is not permitted. Donât
         put a blank line in math mode (see `Modes <#Modes>`__); here
         the blank line before the ``\end{equation}``

         will get you the error â\ ``Missing $ inserted``\ â. Similarly,

                  \par

            End the current paragraph. The usual way to separate
            paragraphs is with a blank line but the ``\par`` command is
            entirely equivalent. This command is robust (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            This example uses ``\par`` rather than a blank line simply
            for readability.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\syllabusLegalese}{%
                    \whatCheatingIs\par\whatHappensWhenICatchYou}

            In LR mode the ``\par`` command does nothing and is ignored.
            In paragraph mode, the ``\par`` command terminates paragraph
            mode, switching LaTeX to vertical mode (see
            `Modes <#Modes>`__).

            You cannot use the ``\par`` command in a math mode. You also
            cannot use it in the argument of many commands, such as the
            sectioning commands, e.g. ``\section`` (see `Making
            paragraphs <#Making-paragraphs>`__ and ```\newcommand`` &
            ``\renewcommand`` <#g_t_005cnewcommand-_0026-_005crenewcommand>`__).

            The ``\par`` command is not the same as the ``\paragraph``
            command. The latter is, like ``\section`` or
            ``\subsection``, a sectioning command used by the LaTeX
            document standard classes (see ```\subsubsection``,
            ``\paragraph``,
            ``\subparagraph`` <#g_t_005csubsubsection-_0026-_005cparagraph-_0026-_005csubparagraph>`__).

            The ``\par`` command is not the same as ``\newline`` or the
            line break double backslash, ``\\``. The difference is that
            ``\par`` ends the paragraph, not just the line, and also
            triggers the addition of the between-paragraph vertical
            space ``\parskip`` (see ```\parindent`` &
            ``\parskip`` <#g_t_005cparindent-_0026-_005cparskip>`__).

            The output from this example

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

            is: after â\ ``xyz``\ â there is a vertical skip of 5Â inches
            and then â\ ``test``\ â appears, aligned with the left
            margin. On the same line, there is an empty horizontal space
            of 3Â inches and then â\ ``test1``\ â appears. Finally. there
            is a vertical space of 5Â inches, followed by a fresh
            paragraph with a paragraph indent of 3Â inches, and then
            LaTeX puts the text â\ ``test2``\ â.

            Go into horizontal mode (see `Modes <#Modes>`__). The
            ``\indent`` command first outputs an empty box whose width
            is ``\parindent``. These commands are robust (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            Ordinarily you create a new paragraph by putting in a blank
            line. See ```\par`` <#g_t_005cpar>`__, for the difference
            between this command and ``\par``. To start a paragraph
            without an indent, or to continue an interrupted paragraph,
            use ``\noindent``.

            In the middle of a paragraph the ``\noindent`` command has
            no effect, because LaTeX is already in horizontal mode
            there. The ``\indent`` commandâs only effect is to output a
            space.

            This example starts a fresh paragraph.

                  \end{center}

                  \noindent shows this clearly.

            To omit indentation in the entire document put
            ``\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}`` in the preamble. If you do
            that, you may want to also set the length of spaces between
            paragraphs, ``\parskip`` (see ```\parindent`` &
            ``\parskip`` <#g_t_005cparindent-_0026-_005cparskip>`__).

            Default LaTeX styles have the first paragraph after a
            section that is not indented, as is traditional typesetting
            in English. To change that, look on CTAN for the package
            ``indentfirst``.

            For example, if this is put in the preamble:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \setlength{\parindent}{0em}
                  \setlength{\parskip}{1ex}

            The document will have paragraphs that are not indented, but
            instead are vertically separated by about the height of a
            lowercase â\ ``x``\ â.

            In LaTeX standard class documents, the default value for
            ``\parindent`` in one-column documents is ``15pt`` when the
            default text size is ``10pt``, ``17pt`` for ``11pt``, and
            ``1.5em`` for ``12pt``. In two-column documents it is
            ``1em``. (These values are set before LaTeX calls
            ``\normalfont`` so ``em`` is derived from the default font,
            Computer Modern. If you use a different font then to set
            ``\parindent`` to 1em matching that font, put
            ``\AtBeginDocument{\setlength{\parindent}{1em}}`` in the
            preamble.)

            The default value for ``\parskip`` in LaTeXâs standard
            document classes is ``0pt plus1pt``.

               :name: Marginal-notes-1
               :class: section

            Synopsis, one of:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \marginpar{right}
                  \marginpar[left]{right}

            Create a note in the margin. The first line of the note will
            have the same baseline as the line in the text where the
            ``\marginpar`` occurs.

            The margin that LaTeX uses for the note depends on the
            current layout (see `Document class
            options <#Document-class-options>`__) and also on
            ``\reversemarginpar`` (see below). If you are using
            one-sided layout (document option ``oneside``) then it goes
            in the right margin. If you are using two-sided layout
            (document option ``twoside``) then it goes in the outside
            margin. If you are in two-column layout (document option
            ``twocolumn``) then it goes in the nearest margin.

            If you declare ``\reversemarginpar`` then LaTeX will place
            subsequent marginal notes in the opposite margin to that
            given in the prior paragraph. Revert that to the default
            position with ``\normalmarginpar``.

            When you specify the optional argument ``left`` then it is
            used for a note in the left margin, while the mandatory
            argument ``right`` is used for a note in the right margin.

            Normally, a noteâs first word will not be hyphenated. You
            can enable hyphenation there by beginning ``left`` or
            ``right`` with ``\hspace{0pt}``.

            These parameters affect the formatting of the note:

            ``\marginparpush`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmarginparpush-2>`__
               Minimum vertical space between notes; default
               â\ ``7pt``\ â for â\ ``12pt``\ â documents, â\ ``5pt``\ â
               else. See alsoÂ `page layout parameters
               marginparpush <#page-layout-parameters-marginparpush>`__.

            ``\marginparsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmarginparsep>`__
               Horizontal space between the main text and the note;
               default â\ ``11pt``\ â for â\ ``10pt``\ â documents,
               â\ ``10pt``\ â else.

            ``\marginparwidth`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmarginparwidth-2>`__
               Width of the note itself; default for a one-sided
               â\ ``10pt``\ â document is â\ ``90pt``\ â, â\ ``83pt``\ â
               for â\ ``11pt``\ â, and â\ ``68pt``\ â for
               â\ ``12pt``\ â; â\ ``17pt``\ â more in each case for a
               two-sided document. In two column mode, the default is
               â\ ``48pt``\ â.

            The standard LaTeX routine for marginal notes does not
            prevent notes from falling off the bottom of the page.

            :name: Math-formulas-1
            :class: chapter

         Produce mathematical text by putting LaTeX into math mode or
         display math mode (see `Modes <#Modes>`__). This example shows
         both.

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               The wave equation for \( u \) is
               \begin{displaymath}
                 \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2} = c^2\nabla^2u
               \end{displaymath}
               where \( \nabla^2 \) is the spatial Laplacian and \( c \) is constant.

         Math mode is for inline mathematics. In the above example it is
         invoked by the starting ``\(`` and finished by the matching
         ending ``\)``. Display math mode is for displayed equations and
         here is invoked by the ``displaymath`` environment. Note that
         any mathematical text whatever, including mathematical text
         consisting of just one character, is handled in math mode.

         When in math mode or display math mode, LaTeX handles many
         aspects of your input text differently than in other text
         modes. For example,

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               contrast x+y with \( x+y \)

         in math mode the letters are in italics and the spacing around
         the plus sign is different.

         There are three ways to make inline formulas, to put LaTeX in
         math mode.

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               \( mathematical material \)
               $ mathematical material $
               \begin{math} mathematical material \end{math}

         The first form is preferred and the second is quite common, but
         the third form is rarely used. You can sometimes use one and
         sometimes another, as in ``\(x\) and $y$``. You can use these
         in paragraph mode or in LR mode (see `Modes <#Modes>`__).

         To make displayed formulas, put LaTeX into display math mode
         with either:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               \begin{displaymath}
                 mathematical material
               \end{displaymath}

         or

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               \begin{equation}
                 mathematical material
               \end{equation}

         (see ```displaymath`` <#displaymath>`__, see
         ```equation`` <#equation>`__). The only difference is that with
         the ``equation`` environment, LaTeX puts a formula number
         alongside the formula. The construct ``\[``\ ``math``\ ``\]``
         is equivalent to
         ``\begin{displaymath}``\ ``math``\ ``\end{displaymath}``. These
         environments can only be used in paragraph mode (see
         `Modes <#Modes>`__).

         The American Mathematical Society has made freely available a
         set of packages that greatly expand your options for writing
         mathematics, ``amsmath`` and ``amssymb`` (also be aware of the
         ``mathtools`` package that is an extension to, and loads,
         ``amsmath``). New documents that will have mathematical text
         should use these packages. Descriptions of these packages is
         outside the scope of this document; see their documentation on
         CTAN.

            Synopsis (in math mode or display math mode), one of:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  base^exp
                  base^{exp}

            or, one of:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  base_exp
                  base_{exp}

            Make ``exp`` appear as a superscript of ``base`` (with the
            caret character,Â ``^``) or a subscript (with
            underscore,Â ``_``).

            In this example the ``0``\ âs and ``1``\ âs are subscripts
            while the ``2``\ âs are superscripts.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \( (x_0+x_1)^2 \leq (x_0)^2+(x_1)^2 \)

            To have the subscript or superscript contain more than one
            character, surround the expression with curly braces, as in
            ``e^{-2x}``. This exampleâs fourth line shows curly braces
            used to group an expression for the exponent.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{displaymath}
                    (3^3)^3=27^3=19\,683
                    \qquad
                    3^{(3^3)}=3^{27}=7\,625\,597\,484\,987
                  \end{displaymath}

            LaTeX knows how to handle a superscript on a superscript, or
            a subscript on a subscript, or supers on subs, or subs on
            supers. So, expressions such as ``e^{x^2}`` and ``x_{i_0}``
            give correct output. Note the use in those expressions of
            curly braces to give the ``base`` a determined ``exp``. If
            you enter ``\(3^3^3\)``, this interpreted as
            ``\(3^{3}^{3}\)`` and then you get TeX error
            â\ ``Double superscript``\ â.

            LaTeX does the right thing when something has both a
            subscript and a superscript. In this example the integral
            has both. They come out in the correct place without any
            author intervention.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{displaymath}
                    \int_{x=a}^b f'(x)\,dx = f(b)-f(a)
                  \end{displaymath}

            Note the curly braces around ``x=a`` to make the entire
            expression a subscript.

            To put a superscript or subscript before a symbol, use a
            construct like ``{}_t K^2``. The empty curly braces ``{}``
            give the subscript something to attach to and keeps it from
            accidentally attaching to a prior symbols.

            Using the subscript or superscript character outside of math
            mode or display math mode, as in ``the expression x^2``,
            will get you the TeX error â\ ``Missing $ inserted``\ â.

            A common reason to want subscripts outside of a mathematics
            mode is to typeset chemical formulas. There are packages for
            that, such as ``mhchem``; see CTAN.

            that anyone uses. For example, if you include ``$\pi$`` in
            your source, you will get the pi symbol Ï. See the

            and its symbol class, which determines the spacing around

               ``$f^{\prime\prime\prime}$``, but uses rather less
               typing. You can only use ``\prime`` in math mode. Using
               the right single quoteÂ ``'`` in text mode produces a

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \unboldmath \( math \)

               Declarations to change the letters and symbols in
               ``math`` to be in a bold font, or to countermand that and
               bring back the regular (non-bold) default, respectively.
               They must be used when *not* in math mode or display math
               mode (see `Modes <#Modes>`__). Both commands are fragile
               (see ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

               In this example each ``\boldmath`` command takes place
               inside an ``\mbox``,

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     we have $\mbox{\boldmath \( v \)} = 5\cdot\mbox{\boldmath \( u \)$}$

               which means ``\boldmath`` is only called in a text mode,
               here LR mode, and explains why we must switch LaTeX into
               math mode to set ``v`` and ``u``.

               If you use either command inside math mode, as with
               ``Trouble: \( \boldmath x \)``, then you get something
               like
               â\ ``LaTeX Font Warning: Command \boldmath invalid in math mode``\ â
               and
               â\ ``LaTeX Font Warning: Command \mathversion invalid in math mode``\ â.

                  Specifying ``\boldmath`` is the best method for
                  typesetting a whole math expression in bold. But to
                  typeset individual symbols within an expression in
                  bold, the ``bm`` package provided by the LaTeX Project
                  team is better. Its usage is outside the scope of this
                  document (see its documentation at
                  https://ctan.org/pkg/bm or in your installation) but
                  the spacing in the output of this small example will
                  show that it is an improvement over ``\boldmath``
                  within an expression:

                     :class: subsubsection

                  Unfortunately, when using the Unicode engines
                  (XeLaTeX, LuaLaTeX), neither ``\boldmath`` nor ``bm``
                  usually work well, because the OpenType math fonts
                  normally used with those engines rarely come with a
                  bold companion, and both ``\boldmath`` and ``bm``
                  require this. (The implementation of ``bm`` relies on
                  ``\boldmath``, so the requirements are the same.) If
                  you do have a bold math font, though, then
                  ``\boldmath`` and ``bm`` work fine.

                  If no such font is available, one alternative is to
                  construct fake bold fonts with the ``fontspec``
                  packageâs ``FakeBold=1`` parameter (see its
                  documentation, https://ctan.org/pkg/fontspec). This
                  may be acceptable for drafting or informal
                  distribution, but the results are far from a true bold
                  font.

                  Another alternative to handling bold for OpenType math
                  fonts is to use the ``\symbf`` (bold), ``\symbfit``
                  (bold italic), and related commands from the
                  ``unicode-math`` package. These do not change the
                  current font, but rather change the (Unicode)
                  âalphabetâ used, which in practice is more widely
                  supported than a separate bold font. Many variations
                  are possible, and so there are subtleties to getting
                  the desired output. As usual, see the package
                  documentation (https://ctan.org/pkg/unicode-math).

               Provide blackboard bold symbols, sometimes also known as
               doublestruck letters, used to denote number sets such as
               the natural numbers, the integers, etc.

                     \( \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, n^2 \geq 0 \)

               the ``\mathbb{N}`` gives blackboard bold symbol â,
               representing the natural numbers.

               If the argument contains something other than an
               uppercase letter, you do not get an error but you do get
               strange results, including unexpected characters.

               There are packages that give access to symbols other than
               just the capital letters; look on CTAN.

               Delimiters are parentheses, braces, or other characters
               used to mark the start and end of subformulas. This
               formula has three sets of parentheses delimiting the
               three subformulas.

                     (z-z_0)^2 = (x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2

               The delimiters do not need to match, so you can enter
               ``\( [0,1) \)``.

               Here are the common delimiters:

                     - ``\|`` or ``\Vert``
                     - Double vertical bar

               The ``mathtools`` package allows you to create commands
               for paired delimiters. For instance, if you put
               ``\DeclarePairedDelimiter\abs{\lvert}{\rvert}`` in your
               preamble then you get two commands for single-line
               vertical bars (they only work in math mode). The starred
               form, such as ``\abs*{\frac{22}{7}}``, has the height of
               the vertical bars match the height of the argument. The
               unstarred form, such as ``\abs{\frac{22}{7}}``, has the
               bars fixed at a default height. This form accepts an
               optional argument, as in
               ``\abs[``\ ``size command``\ ``]{\frac{22}{7}}``, where
               the height of the bars is given in ``size command``, such
               as ``\Bigg``. Using instead ``\lVert`` and ``\rVert`` as
               the symbols will give you a norm symbol with the same
               behavior.

                  Make matching parentheses, braces, or other
                  delimiters. LaTeX makes the delimiters tall enough to
                  just cover the size of the formula that they enclose.

                  This makes a unit vector surrounded by parentheses
                  tall enough to cover the entries.

                            1   \\
                            0   \\
                          \end{array}\right)
                        \end{equation}

                  See `Delimiters <#Delimiters>`__, for a list of the
                  common delimiters.

                  Every ``\left`` must have a matching ``\right``. In
                  the above example, leaving out the ``\left(`` gets the
                  error message â\ ``Extra \right``\ â. Leaving out the
                  ``\right)`` gets
                  â\ :literal:`You can't use \`\\eqno' in math mode`\ â.

                  However, ``delimiter1`` and ``delimiter2`` need not
                  match. A common case is that you want an unmatched
                  brace, as below. Use a period, â\ ``.``\ â, as a *null
                  delimiter*.

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        \begin{equation}
                          f(n)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
                                        1             &\mbox{--if \(n=0\)} \\
                                        f(n-1)+3n^2   &\mbox{--else}       
                               \end{array}\right.
                        \end{equation}

                  Note that to get a curly brace as a delimiter you must
                  prefix it with a backslash, ``\{`` (see `Reserved
                  characters <#Reserved-characters>`__). (The packages
                  ``amsmath`` and ``mathtools`` allow you to get the
                  above construct through in a ``cases`` environment.)

                  The ``\left ... \right`` pair make a group. One
                  consequence is that the formula enclosed in the
                  ``\left ... \right`` pair cannot have line breaks in
                  the output. This includes both manual line breaks and
                  LaTeX-generated automatic ones. In this example, LaTeX
                  breaks the equation to make the formula fit the
                  margins.

                  But with ``\left`` and ``\right``

                  LaTeX wonât break the line, causing the formula to
                  extend into the margin.

                  Because ``\left ... \right`` make a group, all the
                  usual grouping rules hold. Here, the value of
                  ``\testlength`` set inside the equation will be
                  forgotten, and the output is â\ ``1.2pt``\ â.

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        \newlength{\testlength} \setlength{\testlength}{1.2pt}
                        \begin{equation}
                          \left( a+b=c \setlength{\testlength}{3.4pt} \right)
                          \the\testlength
                        \end{equation}

                  The ``\left ... \right`` pair affect the horizontal
                  spacing of the enclosed formula, in two ways. The
                  first is that in
                  ``\( \sin(x) = \sin\left(x\right) \)`` the one after
                  the equals sign has more space around the ``x``.
                  Thatâs because ``\left( ... \right)`` inserts an inner
                  node while ``( ... )`` inserts an opening node. The
                  second way that the pair affect the horizontal spacing
                  is that because they form a group, the enclosed
                  subformula will be typeset at its natural width, with
                  no stretching or shrinking to make the line fit
                  better.

                  TeX scales the delimiters according to the height and
                  depth of the enclosed formula. Here LaTeX grows the
                  brackets to extend the full height of the integral.

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        \begin{equation}
                          \left[ \int_{x=r_0}^{\infty} -G\frac{Mm}{r^2}\, dr \right] 
                        \end{equation}

                  Manual sizing is often better. For instance, although
                  below the rule has no depth, TeX will create
                  delimiters that extend far below the rule.

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        \begin{equation}
                          \left( \rule{1pt}{1cm} \right)
                        \end{equation}

                  TeX can choose delimiters that are too small, as in
                  ``\( \left| |x|+|y| \right| \)``. It can also choose
                  delimiters that are too large, as here.

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        \begin{equation}
                          \left( \sum_{0\leq i<n} i^k \right)
                        \end{equation}

                  A third awkward case is when a long displayed formula
                  is on more than one line and you must match the sizes
                  of the opening and closing delimiter; you canât use
                  ``\left`` on the first line and ``\right`` on the last
                  because they must be paired.

                  ``\right`` <#g_t_005cleft-_0026-_005cright>`__).

                  This produces slightly larger outer vertical bars.

                          \bigl| |x|+|y| \bigr|

                  The commands above are listed in order of increasing
                  size. You can use the smallest size such as
                  ``\bigl...\bigr`` in a paragraph without causing LaTeX
                  to spread the lines apart. The larger sizes are meant
                  for displayed equations.

                  See `Delimiters <#Delimiters>`__, for a list of the
                  common delimiters. In the family of commands with
                  â\ ``l``\ â orÂ â\ ``r``\ â, ``delimiter1`` and
                  ``delimiter2`` need not match together.

                  The â\ ``l``\ â and â\ ``r``\ â commands produce open
                  and close delimiters that insert no horizontal space
                  between a preceding atom and the delimiter, while the
                  commands without â\ ``l``\ â and â\ ``r``\ â insert
                  some space (because each delimiter is set as an
                  ordinary variable). Compare these two.

                  The traditional typographic treatment is on the first
                  line. On the second line the output will have some
                  extra space between the ``\sin`` and the open
                  parenthesis.

                  Commands without â\ ``l``\ â orÂ â\ ``r``\ â do give
                  correct spacing in some circumstances, as with this
                  large vertical line

                  (many authors would replace ``\frac`` with the

                  as with this larger slash.

                  Unlike the ``\left...\right`` pair (see ```\left`` &
                  ``\right`` <#g_t_005cleft-_0026-_005cright>`__), the
                  commands here with â\ ``l``\ â orÂ â\ ``r``\ â do not
                  make a group. Strictly speaking they need not be
                  matched so you can write something like this.

                  The commands with â\ ``m``\ â are for relations, which
                  are in the middle of formulas, as here.

               ``\dots``. A synonym from the ``amsmath`` package is
               ``\hdots``.

               You can also use this command outside of mathematical
               text, as in
               ``The gears, brakes, \ldots{} are all broken``.

               ``\vdots`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cvdots>`__

               usage.

               The ``amsmath`` package has the command ``\dots`` to
               semantically mark up ellipses. This example produces two
               different-looking outputs for the first two uses of the
               ``\dots`` command.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \usepackage{amsmath}  % in preamble
                       ...
                     Suppose that \( p_0, p_1, \dots, p_{n-1} \) lists all of the primes.
                     Observe that \( p_0\cdot p_1 \dots \cdot p_{n-1} +1 \) is not a
                       multiple of any \( p_i \).
                     Conclusion: there are infinitely many primes \( p_0, p_1, \dotsc \).

               In the first line LaTeX looks to the comma following
               ``\dots`` to determine that it should output an ellipsis
               on the baseline. The second line has a ``\cdot``
               following ``\dots`` so LaTeX outputs an ellipsis that is
               on the math axis, vertically centered. However, the third
               usage has no follow-on character so you have to tell
               LaTeX what to do. You can use one of the commands:
               ``\dotsc`` if you need the ellipsis appropriate for a
               comma following, ``\dotsb`` if you need the ellipses that
               fits when the dots are followed by a binary operator or
               relation symbol, ``\dotsi`` for dots with integrals, or
               ``\dotso`` for others.

               The ``\dots`` command from ``amsmath`` differs from the
               LaTeX kernelâs ``\dots`` command in another way: it
               outputs a thin space after the ellipsis. Furthermore, the
               ``unicode-math`` package automatically loads ``amsmath``,
               so ``amsmath``\ âs ``\dots`` may be active even when you
               did not explicitly load it, thus changing the output from
               ``\dots`` in both text and math mode.

               Yet more about the ellipsis commands: when running under
               Unicode engines (``lualatex``, ``xelatex``), LaTeX will
               use the Unicode ellipsis character (U+2026) in the font
               if itâs available; under traditional TeX engines
               (``pdflatex``, ``latex``), it will typeset three spaced
               periods. Generally, the Unicode single-character ellipsis
               has almost no space between the three periods, while the
               spacing of the non-Unicode ellipsis is looser, more in
               accordance with traditional typography.

               For omicron, if you are using LaTeXâs default Computer
               Modern font then enter omicron just as â\ ``o``\ â or
               â\ ``O``\ â. If you like having the name or if your font
               shows a difference then you can use something like
               ``\newcommand\omicron{o}``. The package ``unicode-math``
               has ``\upomicron`` for upright omicron and
               ``\mitomicron`` for math italic.

               While the set membership relation symbol â generated by
               ``\in`` is related to epsilon, it is never used for a
               variable.

            identity operator with
            ``\DeclareMathOperator{\identity}{id}`` that is like the
            ones above but prints as â\ ``id``\ â. The starred form
            ``\DeclareMathOperator*{\op}{op}`` sets any superscript or
            subscript to be above and below, as is traditional with
            ``\lim``, ``\sup``, or ``\max``.

            LaTeX provides a variety of commands for producing accented

            is to use one without a dot, ``\imath`` or ``jmath`` (see

            LaTeX provides commands for making overlines or underlines,
            or putting braces over or under some material.

            ``\underline{``\ ``text``\ ``}`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cunderline_007btext_007d>`__
               Underline ``text``. Works inside math mode, and outside.
               The line is always completely below the text, taking
               account of descenders, so in ``\(\underline{y}\)`` the
               line is lower than in ``\(\underline{x}\)``. This command
               is fragile (see ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

               Note that the package ``ulem`` does text mode underlining
               and allows line breaking as well as a number of other
               features. See the documentation on CTAN. See
               alsoÂ ```\hrulefill`` &
               ``\dotfill`` <#g_t_005chrulefill-_0026-_005cdotfill>`__
               for producing a line, for such things as a signature.

            ``\overline{``\ ``text``\ ``}`` `Â¶ <#index-_005coverline_007btext_007d>`__
               Put a horizontal line over ``text``. Works inside math
               mode, and outside. For example, ``\overline{x+y}``. Note
               that this differs from the command ``\bar`` (see `Math
               accents <#Math-accents>`__).

            ``\underbrace{``\ ``math``\ ``}`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cunderbrace_007bmath_007d>`__
               Put a brace under ``math``. For example, this
               ``(1-\underbrace{1/2)+(1/2}-1/3)`` emphasizes the
               telescoping part. Attach text to the brace by using the
               subscript command, ``_``, or superscript, ``^``, as here.

               :name: Spacing-in-math-mode-1
               :class: section

            When typesetting mathematics, LaTeX puts in spacing
            according to the normal rules for mathematics texts. If you
            enter ``y=m x`` then LaTeX ignores the space and in the
            output the m is next to the x, as *y=mx*.

            But LaTeXâs rules occasionally need tweaking. For example,
            in an integral the tradition is to put a small extra space
            between the ``f(x)`` and the ``dx``, here done with the
            ``\,`` command:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \int_0^1 f(x)\,dx

            LaTeX provides the commands that follow for use in math
            mode. Many of these spacing definitions are expressed in
            terms of the math unit *mu*. It is defined as 1/18em, where
            the em is taken from the current math symbols family (see
            `Units of length <#Units-of-length>`__). Thus, a
            ``\thickspace`` is something like 5/18 times the width of
            aÂ â\ ``M``\ â.

            ``\;`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_003b>`__

               Synonym: ``\thickspace``. Normally ``5.0mu plus 5.0mu``.
               With the ``amsmath`` package, or as of the 2020-10-01
               LaTeX release, can be used in text mode as well as math
               mode; otherwise, in math mode only.

            ``\negthickspace`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cnegthickspace>`__
               Normally ``-5.0mu plus 2.0mu minus 4.0mu``. With the
               ``amsmath`` package, or as of the 2020-10-01 LaTeX
               release, can be used in text mode as well as math mode;
               otherwise, in math mode only.

            ``\:`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_003a>`__
            ``\>``

               Synonym: ``\medspace``. Normally
               ``4.0mu plus 2.0mu minus 4.0mu``. With the ``amsmath``
               package, or as of the 2020-10-01 LaTeX release, can be
               used in text mode as well as math mode; before that, in
               math mode only.

            ``\negmedspace`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cnegmedspace>`__
               Normally ``-4.0mu plus 2.0mu minus 4.0mu``. With the
               ``amsmath`` package, or as of the 2020-10-01 LaTeX
               release, can be used in text mode as well as math mode;
               before that, in math mode only.

            ``\,`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_002c>`__

               Synonym: ``\thinspace``. Normally ``3mu``, which is
               1/6em. Can be used in both math mode and text mode (see
               ```\thinspace`` &
               ``\negthinspace`` <#g_t_005cthinspace-_0026-_005cnegthinspace>`__).

               This space is widely used, for instance between the
               function and the infinitesimal in an integral
               ``\int f(x)\,dx`` and, if an author does this, before
               punctuation in a displayed equation.

                     The antiderivative is
                     \begin{equation}
                       3x^{-1/2}+3^{1/2}\,.
                     \end{equation}

            ``\!`` `Â¶ <#index-_005c_0021>`__

               Synonym: ``\negthinspace``. A negative thin space.
               Normally ``-3mu``. With the ``amsmath`` package, or as of
               the 2020-10-01 LaTeX release, can be used in text mode as
               well as math mode; otherwise, the ``\!`` command is math
               mode only but the ``\negthinspace`` command has always
               also worked in text mode (see ```\thinspace`` &
               ``\negthinspace`` <#g_t_005cthinspace-_0026-_005cnegthinspace>`__).

            ``\quad`` `Â¶ <#index-quad>`__

               This is 18mu, that is, 1em. This is often used for space
               surrounding equations or expressions, for instance for
               the space between two equations inside a ``displaymath``
               environment. It is available in both text and math mode.

            ``\qquad`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cqquad>`__
               A length of 2 quads, that is, 36mu = 2em. It is available

                  :class: subsection

               Synopsis:

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \smash{subformula}

               Typeset ``subformula`` as if its height and depth were
               zero.

               In this example the exponential is so tall that without
               the ``\smash`` command LaTeX would separate its line from
               the line above it, and the uneven line spacing might be
               unsightly.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     To compute the tetration $\smash{2^{2^{2^2}}}$,
                     evaluate from the top down, as $2^{2^4}=2^{16}=65536$.

               (Because of the ``\smash`` the printed expression could
               run into the line above so you may want to wait until the
               final version of the document to make such adjustments.)

               This pictures the effect of ``\smash`` by using ``\fbox``
               to surround the box that LaTeX will put on the line. The
               ``\blackbar`` command makes a bar extending from
               10Â points below the baseline to 20Â points above.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \newcommand{\blackbar}{\rule[-10pt]{5pt}{30pt}}
                     \fbox{\blackbar}
                     \fbox{\smash{\blackbar}}

               The first box that LaTeX places is 20Â points high and
               10Â points deep. But the second box is treated by LaTeX as
               having zero height and zero depth, despite that the ink
               printed on the page still extends well above and below
               the line.

               The ``\smash`` command appears often in mathematics to
               adjust the size of an element that surrounds a
               subformula. Here the first radical extends below the
               baseline while the second lies just on the baseline.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{equation}
                     \sqrt{\sum_{0\leq k< n} f(k)}
                     \sqrt{\vphantom{\sum}\smash{\sum_{0\leq k< n}} f(k)}
                     \end{equation}

               Note the use of ``\vphantom`` to give the ``\sqrt``
               command an argument with the height of the ``\sum`` (see
               ```\phantom`` & ``\vphantom`` &
               ``\hphantom`` <#g_t_005cphantom-_0026-_005cvphantom-_0026-_005chphantom>`__).

               While most often used in mathematics, the ``\smash``
               command can appear in other contexts. However, it doesnât
               change into horizontal mode. So if it starts a paragraph
               then you should first put a ``\leavevmode``, as in the
               bottom line below.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     Text above.

                     \smash{smashed, no indent}  % no paragraph indent

                     \leavevmode\smash{smashed, with indent}  % usual paragraph indent

               The package ``mathtools`` has operators that provide even
               finer control over smashing a subformula box.

                  :class: subsection

               Synopsis:

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \hphantom{subformula}

               The ``\phantom`` command creates a box with the same
               height, depth, and width as ``subformula``, but empty.
               That is, this command causes LaTeX to typeset the space
               but not fill it with the material. Here LaTeX will put a
               blank line that is the correct width for the answer, but
               will not show that answer.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{displaymath}
                       \int x^2\,dx=\mbox{\underline{$\phantom{(1/3)x^3+C}$}} 
                     \end{displaymath}

               The ``\vphantom`` variant produces an invisible box with
               the same vertical size as ``subformula``, the same height
               and depth, but having zero width. And ``\hphantom`` makes
               a box with the same width as ``subformula`` but with zero
               height and depth.

               In this example, the tower of exponents in the second
               summand expression is so tall that TeX places this
               expression further down than its default. Without
               adjustment, the two summand expressions would be at
               different levels. The ``\vphantom`` in the first
               expression tells TeX to leave as much vertical room as it
               does for the tower, so the two expressions come out at
               the same level.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{displaymath}
                         \sum_{j\in\{0,\ldots\, 10\}\vphantom{3^{3^{3^j}}}}
                           \sum_{i\in\{0,\ldots\, 3^{3^{3^j}}\}} i\cdot j
                     \end{displaymath}

               These commands are often used in conjunction with
               ``\smash``. See ```\smash`` <#g_t_005csmash>`__, which
               includes another example of ``\vphantom``.

               The three phantom commands appear often but note that
               LaTeX provides a suite of other commands to work with box
               sizes that may be more convenient, including ``\makebox``
               (see ```\mbox`` &
               ``\makebox`` <#g_t_005cmbox-_0026-_005cmakebox>`__) as
               well as ``\settodepth`` (see
               ```\settodepth`` <#g_t_005csettodepth>`__),
               ``\settoheight`` (see
               ```\settoheight`` <#g_t_005csettoheight>`__), and
               ``\settowidth`` (see
               ```\settowidth`` <#g_t_005csettowidth>`__). In addition,
               the ``mathtools`` package has many commands that offer
               fine-grained control over spacing.

               All three commands produce an ordinary box, without any
               special mathematics status. So to do something like
               attaching a superscript you should give it such a status,
               for example with the ``\operatorname`` command from the
               package ``amsmath``.

               While most often used in mathematics, these three can
               appear in other contexts. However, they donât cause LaTeX
               to change into horizontal mode. So if one of these starts
               a paragraph then you should prefix it with
               ``\leavevmode``.

               vertical space without any horizontal space, so that the
               two have the same height, use
               ``$\sqrt{x\mathstrut} + \sqrt{x^i\mathstrut}$``.

               The ``\mathstrut`` command adds the vertical height of an
               open parenthesis, ``(``, but no horizontal space. It is
               defined as ``\vphantom{(}``, so see ```\phantom`` &
               ``\vphantom`` &
               ``\hphantom`` <#g_t_005cphantom-_0026-_005cvphantom-_0026-_005chphantom>`__
               for more. An advantage over ``\strut`` is that
               ``\mathstrut`` adds no depth, which is often the right
               thing for formulas. Using the height of an open
               parenthesis is just a convention; for complete control
               over the amount of space, use ``\rule`` with a width of
               zero. See ```\rule`` <#g_t_005crule>`__.

               :class: section

            TeXâs rules for typesetting a formula depend on the context.
            For example, inside a displayed equation, the input
            ``\sum_{0\leq i<n}k^m=\frac{n^{m+1}}{m+1}+\mbox{lower order terms}``
            will give output with the summation index centered below the
            summation symbol. But if that input is inline then the
            summation index is off to the right rather than below, so it
            wonât push the lines apart. Similarly, in a displayed
            context, the symbols in the numerator and denominator will
            be larger than for an inline context, and in display math
            subscripts and superscripts are further apart then they are
            in inline math.

            TeX uses four math styles.

            -   Display style is for a formula displayed on a line by
               itself, such as with
               ``\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}``.
            -   Text style is for an inline formula, as with
               â\ ``so we have $ ... $``\ â.
            -   Script style is for parts of a formula in a subscript or
               superscript.
            -   Scriptscript style is for parts of a formula at a second
               level (or more) of subscript or superscript.

            TeX determines a default math style but you can override it
            with a declaration of ``\displaystyle``, or ``\textstyle``,
            or ``\scriptstyle``, or ``\scriptscriptstyle``.

            In this example, the â\ ``Arithmetic``\ â lineâs fraction
            will look scrunched.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{tabular}{r|cc}
                    \textsc{Name}  &\textsc{Series}  &\textsc{Sum}  \\  \hline
                    Arithmetic     &$a+(a+b)+(a+2b)+\cdots+(a+(n-1)b)$
                                     &$na+(n-1)n\cdot\frac{b}{2}$  \\
                    Geometric      &$a+ab+ab^2+\cdots+ab^{n-1}$
                                     &$\displaystyle a\cdot\frac{1-b^n}{1-b}$  \\
                  \end{tabular}

            But because of the ``\displaystyle`` declaration, the
            â\ ``Geometric``\ â lineâs fraction will be easy to read,
            with characters the same size as in the rest of the line.

            Another example is that, compared to the same input without
            the declaration, the result of

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  we get
                  $\pi=2\cdot{\displaystyle\int_{x=0}^1 \sqrt{1-x^2}\,dx}$

            will have an integral sign that is much taller. Note that
            here the ``\displaystyle`` applies to only part of the
            formula, and it is delimited by being inside curly braces,
            as â\ ``{\displaystyle ...}``\ â.

            The last example is a continued fraction.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{equation}
                  a_0+\frac{1}{
                         \displaystyle a_1+\frac{\mathstrut 1}{
                         \displaystyle a_2+\frac{\mathstrut 1}{
                         \displaystyle a_3}}}
                  \end{equation}

            Without the ``\displaystyle`` declarations, the denominators
            would be set in script style and scriptscript style. (The
            ``\mathstrut`` improves the height of the denominators; see
            ```\mathstrut`` <#g_t_005cmathstrut>`__.)

                     \colon

               In mathematics, the colon character, ``:``, is a
               relation.

                     With side ratios \( 3:4 \) and \( 4:5 \), the triangle is right.

               Ordinary LaTeX defines ``\colon`` to produce the colon
               character with the spacing appropriate for punctuation,
               as in set-builder notation ``\{x\colon 0\leq x<1\}``.

               But the widely-used ``amsmath`` package defines
               ``\colon`` for use in the definition of functions
               ``f\colon D\to C``. So if you want the colon character as
               a punctuation then use ``\mathpunct{:}``.

               A multiplication symbol that allows a line break. If

               for example between the two middle ones, then LaTeX sets

            :class: chapter

         As LaTeX processes your document, at any point it is in one of
         six modes. They fall into three categories of two each, the
         horizontal modes, the math modes, and the vertical modes. Some
         commands only work in one mode or another (in particular, many
         commands only work in one of the math modes), and error
         messages will refer to these.

         -   *Paragraph mode* (in plain TeX this is called *horizontal
            mode*) is what LaTeX is in when processing ordinary text. It
            breaks the input text into lines and finds the positions of
            line breaks, so that in vertical mode page breaks can be
            done. This is the mode LaTeX is in most of the time.

            *LR mode* (for left-to-right mode; in plain TeX this is
            called *restricted horizontal mode*) is in effect when LaTeX
            starts making a box with an ``\mbox`` command. As in
            paragraph mode, LaTeXâs output is a string of words with
            spaces between them. Unlike in paragraph mode, in LR mode
            LaTeX never starts a new line, it just keeps going from left
            to right. (Although LaTeX will not complain that the LR box
            is too long, when it is finished and next tries to put that
            box into a line, it might well complain that the finished LR
            box wonât fit there.)

         -   *Math mode* is when LaTeX is generating an inline
            mathematical formula.

            *Display math mode* is when LaTeX is generating a displayed
            mathematical formula. (Displayed formulas differ somewhat
            from inline ones. One example is that the placement of the
            subscript on ``\int`` differs in the two situations.)

         -   *Vertical mode* is when LaTeX is building the list of lines
            and other material making the output page, which comprises
            insertion of page breaks. This is the mode LaTeX is in when
            it starts a document.

            *Internal vertical mode* is in effect when LaTeX starts
            making a ``\vbox``. It has not such thing as page breaks,
            and as such is the vertical analogue of LR mode.

         For instance, if you begin a LaTeX article with
         â\ ``Let \( x \) be ...``\ â then these are the modes: first
         LaTeX starts every document in vertical mode, then it reads the
         â\ ``L``\ â and switches to paragraph mode, then the next
         switch happens at the â\ ``\(``\ â where LaTeX changes to math
         mode, and then when it leaves the formula it pops back to
         paragraph mode.

         Paragraph mode has two subcases. If you use a ``\parbox``
         command or a ``minipage`` then LaTeX is put into paragraph
         mode. But it will not put a page break here. Inside one of
         these boxes, called a *parbox*, LaTeX is in *inner paragraph
         mode*. Its more usual situation, where it can put page breaks,
         is *outer paragraph mode* (see `Page
         breaking <#Page-breaking>`__).

            Ensure that ``formula`` is typeset in math mode.

            For instance, you can redefine commands that ordinarily can
            be used only in math mode, so that they can be used both in
            math and in plain text.

                  In $\int f(x)\, \dx$, the \dx{} is an infinitesimal.

            Caution: the ``\ensuremath`` command is useful but not a
            panacea.

                  But compare the correct spacing in $\alf+\alf$ with that in \alf+\alf.

            Best is to typeset math things in a math mode.

         The style of a page determines where LaTeX places the
         components of that page, such as headers and footers, and the
         text body. This includes pages in the main part of the document
         but also includes special pages such as the title page of a
         book, a page from an index, or the first page of an article.

         The package ``fancyhdr`` is commonly used for constructing page
         styles. See its documentation.

                  That started from this tropic port, aboard this tiny ship. The mate was
                  a mighty sailin' man, the Skipper brave and sure. Five passengers set
                  sail that day for a three hour tour. A three hour tour.

            You tell LaTeX the information used to produce the title by
            making the following declarations. These must come before
            the ``\maketitle``, either in the preamble or in the
            document body.

            ``\author{``\ ``name1``\ ``\and``\ ``name2``\ ``\and ...}`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cauthor_007bname1-_005cand-name2-_005cand-_002e_002e_002e_007d>`__

               Required. Declare the document author or authors. The
               argument is a list of authors separated by ``\and``
               commands. To separate lines within a single authorâs
               entry, for instance to give the authorâs institution or
               address, use a double backslash, ``\\``. If you omit the
               ``\author`` declaration then you get
               â\ ``LaTeX Warning: No \author given``\ â.

            ``\date{``\ ``text``\ ``}`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cdate_007btext_007d>`__
               Optional. Declare ``text`` to be the documentâs date. The
               ``text`` doesnât need to be in a date format; it can be
               any text at all. If you omit ``\date`` then LaTeX uses
               the current date (see ```\today`` <#g_t_005ctoday>`__).
               To have no date, instead use ``\date{}``.

            ``\thanks{``\ ``text``\ ``}`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cthanks_007btext_007d>`__

               Optional. Produce a footnote. You can use it in the
               author information for acknowledgements as illustrated
               above, but you can also use it in the title, or anywhere
               that a footnote mark makes sense. It can be any text at
               all so you can use it for any purpose, such as to print
               an email address.

            ``\title{``\ ``text``\ ``}`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctitle_007btext_007d>`__

               Required. Declare ``text`` to be the title of the
               document. Get line breaks inside ``text`` with a double
               backslash, ``\\``. If you omit the ``\title`` declaration
               then the ``\maketitle`` command yields error
               â\ ``LaTeX Error: No \title given``\ â.

            To make your own title page, see
            ```titlepage`` <#titlepage>`__. You can either create this
            as a one-off or you can include it as part of a renewed
            ``\maketitle`` command. Many publishers will provide a class
            to use in place of ``article`` that formats the title
            according to their house requirements.

                  \pagenumbering{number-style}

            Specifies the style of page numbers, and resets the page
            number. The numbering style is reflected on the page, and
            also in the table of contents and other page references.
            This declaration has global scope so its effect is not
            stopped by an end of group such as a closing brace or an end
            of environment.

            By default, LaTeX numbers pages starting at 1, using Arabic
            numerals.

            The argument ``number-style`` is one of the following (see
            also ```\alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol``:
            Printing
            counters <#g_t_005calph-_005cAlph-_005carabic-_005croman-_005cRoman-_005cfnsymbol>`__).

            ``arabic``
               Arabic numerals: 1, 2, â¦

            ``roman``
               lowercase Roman numerals: i, ii, â¦

            ``Roman``
               uppercase Roman numerals: I, II, â¦

            ``alph``
               lowercase letters: a, b, â¦ If you have more than 26 pages
               then you get â\ ``LaTeX Error: Counter too large``\ â.

            ``Alph``
               uppercase letters: A, B, â¦ If you have more than 26 pages
               then you get â\ ``LaTeX Error: Counter too large``\ â.

            ``gobble``
               no page number is output, though the number is still
               reset. References to that page also are blank.

               This setting does not work with the popular package
               ``hyperref``, so to omit page numbers you may want to
               instead use ``\pagestyle{empty}`` or
               ``\thispagestyle{empty}``.

            If you want to typeset the page number in some other way, or
            change where the page number appears on the page,
            seeÂ ```\pagestyle`` <#g_t_005cpagestyle>`__ (in short: use
            the ``fancyhdr`` package). The list above of LaTeXâs
            built-in numbering styles cannot be extended.

            Traditionally, if a document has front matterâpreface, table
            of contents, etc.âthen it is numbered with lowercase Roman
            numerals. The main matter of a document uses arabic. LaTeX
            implements this, by providing explicit commands for the
            different parts (see ```\frontmatter``, ``\mainmatter``,
            ``\backmatter`` <#g_t_005cfrontmatter-_0026-_005cmainmatter-_0026-_005cbackmatter>`__).

            As an explicit example, before the â\ ``Main``\ â section
            the pages are numbered â\ ``a``\ â, etc. Starting on the
            page containing the ``\pagenumbering`` call in that section,
            the pages are numbered â\ ``1``\ â, etc.

                  \section{Main}\pagenumbering{arabic}
                    ...

            If you want to change the value of the page number, then you
            manipulate the ``page`` counter (see
            `Counters <#Counters>`__).

            Declaration that specifies how the page headers and footers
            are typeset, from the current page onwards.

            A discussion with an example is below. First, however: the
            package ``fancyhdr`` is now the standard way to manipulate
            headers and footers. New documents that need to do anything
            other than one of the standard options below should use this
            package. See its documentation
            (https://ctan.org/pkg/fancyhdr).

            Values for ``style``:

            ``plain``
               The header is empty. The footer contains only a page
               number, centered.

            ``empty``
               The header and footer are both empty.

            ``headings``
               Put running headers and footers on each page. The
               document style specifies what goes in there; see the
               discussion below.

            ``myheadings``
               Custom headers, specified via the ``\markboth`` or the
               ``\markright`` commands.

            Some discussion of the motivation for LaTeXâs mechanism will
            help you work with the options ``headings`` or
            ``myheadings``. The document source below produces an
            article, two-sided, with the pagestyle ``headings``. On this
            documentâs left hand pages, LaTeX wants (in addition to the
            page number) the title of the current section. On its right
            hand pages LaTeX wants the title of the current subsection.
            When it makes up a page, LaTeX gets this information from
            the commands ``\leftmark`` and ``\rightmark``. So it is up
            to ``\section`` and ``\subsection`` to store that
            information there.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \documentclass[twoside]{article}
                  \pagestyle{headings}
                  \begin{document}
                    ... \section{Section 1} ... \subsection{Subsection 1.1} ...
                  \section{Section 2}
                    ...
                  \subsection{Subsection 2.1}
                    ...
                  \subsection{Subsection 2.2}
                    ...

            Suppose that the second section falls on a left page.
            Although when the page starts it is in the first section,
            LaTeX will put â\ ``SectionÂ 2``\ â in the left page header.
            As to the right header, if no subsection starts before the
            end of the right page then LaTeX blanks the right hand
            header. If a subsection does appear before the right page
            finishes then there are two cases. If at least one
            subsection starts on the right hand page then LaTeX will put
            in the right header the title of the first subsection
            starting on that right page. If at least one of 2.1, 2.2, â¦,
            starts on the left page but none starts on the right then
            LaTeX puts in the right hand header the title of the last
            subsection to start, that is, the one in effect during the
            right hand page.

            To accomplish this, in a two-sided article, LaTeX has
            ``\section`` issue a command ``\markboth``, setting
            ``\leftmark`` to â\ ``SectionÂ 2``\ â and setting
            ``\rightmark`` to an empty content. And, LaTeX has
            ``\subsection`` issue a command ``\markright``, setting
            ``\rightmark`` to â\ ``SubsectionÂ 2.1``\ â, etc.

            Here are the descriptions of ``\markboth`` and
            ``\markright``:

            ``\markboth{``\ ``left-head``\ ``}{``\ ``right-head``\ ``}`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmarkboth_007bleft_002dhead_007d_007bright_002dhead_007d>`__
               Sets both the right hand and left hand heading
               information for either a page style of ``headings`` or
               ``myheadings``. A left hand page heading ``left-head`` is
               generated by the last ``\markboth`` command before the
               end of the page. A right hand page heading ``right-head``
               is generated by the first ``\markboth`` or ``\markright``
               that comes on the page if there is one, otherwise by the
               last one that came before that page.

            ``\markright{``\ ``right-head``\ ``}`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmarkright_007bright_002dhead_007d>`__
               Sets the right hand page heading, leaving the left
               unchanged.

            Works in the same way as the ``\pagestyle`` (see
            ```\pagestyle`` <#g_t_005cpagestyle>`__), except that it
            changes to ``style`` for the current page only. This
            declaration has global scope, so its effect is not delimited
            by braces or environments.

            Often the first page of a chapter or section has a different
            style. For example, this LaTeX book document has the first
            page of the first chapter in ``plain`` style, as is the
            default (see `Page styles <#Page-styles>`__).

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \chapter{Second chapter}\thispagestyle{empty}
                    ...

            The ``plain`` style has a page number on it, centered in the
            footer. To make the page entirely empty, the command
            ``\thispagestyle{empty}`` immediately follows the second
            ``\chapter``.

            If you want to change the appearance of page numbers only in
            the page headers, for example by adding an ornament,
            typesetting in small caps, etc., then the ``fancyhdr``
            package, as mentioned in a previous section, is the best
            approach.

            On the other hand, you may want to change how page numbers
            are denoted everywhere, including the table of contents and
            cross-references, as well as the page headers. In this case,
            you should redefine ``\thepage``, which is the command LaTeX
            uses for the representation of page numbers.

            However, ``\thepage`` should do any typesetting or other
            complicated maneuvers, but merely expand to the intended
            page number representation. The results of a complicated
            redefinition of ``\thepage`` are not predictable, but
            LaTeXâs report of page numbers in diagnostic messages, at
            least, will become unusable.

            There is some discussion of this issue at
            https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/687258.

            Insert a horizontal space of 1/2em, 1em, or 2em. The em is a
            length defined by a font designer, often thought of as being
            the width of a capitalÂ M. One advantage of describing space
            in ems is that it can be more portable across documents than
            an absolute measurement such as points (see
            `Lengths/em <#Lengths_002fem>`__).

            This puts a suitable gap between two graphics.

                  \hspace*{length}

            Insert the amount ``length`` of horizontal space. The
            ``length`` can be positive, negative, or zero; adding a
            negative amount of space is like backspacing. It is a rubber
            length, that is, it may contain a ``plus`` or ``minus``
            component, or both (see `Lengths <#Lengths>`__). Because the
            space is stretchable and shrinkable, it is sometimes called
            *glue*.

            This makes a line with â\ ``Name:``\ â an inch from the
            right margin.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \noindent\makebox[\linewidth][r]{Name:\hspace{1in}}

            The ``*``-form inserts horizontal space that is
            non-discardable. More precisely, when TeX breaks a paragraph
            into lines any white spaceâglues and kernsâthat come at a
            line break are discarded. The ``*``-form avoids that
            (technically, it adds a non-discardable invisible item in
            front of the space).

            In this example

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \parbox{0.8\linewidth}{%
                    Fill in each blank: Four \hspace*{1in} and seven years ago our
                    fathers brought forth on this continent, a new \hspace*{1in},
                    conceived in \hspace*{1in}, and dedicated to the proposition
                    that all men are created \hspace*{1in}.}

            the 1Â inch blank following â\ ``conceived in``\ â falls at
            the start of a line. If you erase the ``*`` then LaTeX
            discards the blank.

            Here, the ``\hspace`` separates the three graphics.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{center}
                    \includegraphics{lion.png}%   comment keeps out extra space
                    \hspace{1cm minus 0.25cm}\includegraphics{tiger.png}%
                    \hspace{1cm minus 0.25cm}\includegraphics{bear.png}
                  \end{center}

            Because the argument to each ``\hspace`` has
            ``minus 0.25cm``, each can shrink a little if the three
            figures are too wide. But each space wonât shrink more than
            0.25cm (see `Lengths <#Lengths>`__).

            Influence LaTeXâs stretching and shrinking of glue. Few
            user-level documents need to use this.

            While LaTeX is laying out the material, it may stretch or
            shrink the gaps between words. (This space is not a
            character; it is called the *interword glue*; see
            ```\hspace`` <#g_t_005chspace>`__). The ``\spacefactor``
            parameter (a TeX primitive) allows you to, for instance,
            have the space after a period stretch more than the space
            after a word-ending letter.

            After LaTeX places each character, or rule or other box, it
            sets a parameter called the *space factor*. If the next
            thing in the input is a space then this parameter affects
            how much stretching or shrinking can happen. A space factor
            that is larger than the normal value means that the glue can
            stretch more and shrink less. Normally, the space factor is
            1000. This value is in effect following most characters, and
            any non-character box or math formula. But it is 3000 after
            a period, exclamation mark, or question mark, 2000 after a
            colon, 1500 after a semicolon, 1250 after a comma, and 0
            after a right parenthesis or bracket, or closing double
            quote or single quote. Finally, it is 999 after a capital
            letter.

            If the space factorÂ ``f`` is 1000 then the glue gap will be
            the fontâs normal space value (for Computer Modern Roman 10
            point this is 3.3333pt). Otherwise, if the space factor
            ``f`` is greater than 2000 then TeX adds the fontâs extra
            space value (for Computer Modern Roman 10 point this is
            1.11111pt), and then the fontâs normal stretch value is
            multiplied by *f /1000* and the normal shrink value is
            multiplied by *1000/f* (for Computer Modern Roman 10 point
            these are 1.66666 and 1.11111pt).

            For example, consider the period ending
            â\ ``A man's best friend is his dog.``\ â. After it, TeX
            puts in a fixed extra space, and also allows the glue to
            stretch 3 times as much and shrink 1/3 as much, as the glue
            after ``friend`` or any of the other words, since they are
            not followed by punctuation.

            The rules for space factors are even more complex because
            they play additional roles. In practice, there are two
            consequences. First, if a period or other punctuation is
            followed by a right parenthesis or bracket, or right single
            or double quote then the spacing effect of that period
            carries through those characters (that is, the following
            glue will have increased stretch and shrink). Second, if
            punctuation comes after a capital letter then the normal
            effect of the period is does not happen, so you get an
            ordinary space. This second case also affects abbreviations
            that do not end in a capital letter (see
            ```\@`` <#g_t_005c_0040>`__).

            You can only use ``\spacefactor`` in paragraph mode or LR
            mode (see `Modes <#Modes>`__). You can see the current value
            with ``\the\spacefactor`` or ``\showthe\spacefactor``.

            Finally, not especially related to ``\spacefactor`` itself:
            if you get errors like
            â\ :literal:`You can't use \`\\spacefactor' in vertical mode`\ â,
            or
            â\ :literal:`You can't use \`\\spacefactor' in math mode.`\ â,
            or â\ ``Improper \spacefactor``\ â then you have probably
            tried to redefine an internal command. See

                  :class: subsection

               Synopsis:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     capital-letter\@.    

               Treat a period (or other punctuation) as sentence-ending,
               where LaTeX would otherwise think it is part of an
               abbreviation. LaTeX thinks that a period ends an
               abbreviation if the period comes after a capital letter,
               and otherwise thinks the period ends the sentence.

               This example shows the two cases to remember.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     The songs \textit{Red Guitar}, etc.\ are by Loudon Wainwright~III\@.

               The first period ends the abbreviation â\ ``etc.``\ â but
               not the sentence. The backslash-space, ``\``, produces a
               mid-sentence space. The second period ends the sentence,
               despite it being preceded by a capital letter. We tell
               LaTeX that it ends the sentence by putting ``\@`` before
               it.

               So: if you have a capital letter followed by a period
               that ends the sentence, then put ``\@`` before the
               period. This holds even if there is an intervening right
               parenthesis or bracket, or right single or double quote,
               because the spacing effect of that period carries through
               those characters. For example, this

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     Use the \textit{Instructional Practices Guide},
                     (a book by the MAA)\@.

               will have correct inter-sentence spacing after the
               period.

               The ``\@`` command is only for text modes. If you use it
               outside of a text mode then you get the error
               â\ :literal:`You can't use \`\\spacefactor' in vertical mode`\ â
               (see `Modes <#Modes>`__).

               All the above applies equally to question marks and
               exclamation points as periods, since all are
               sentence-ending punctuation, and LaTeX increases the
               space after each in the same way, when they end a
               sentence. LaTeX also increases spacing after colon,
               semicolon, and comma characters (see
               ```\spacefactor`` <#g_t_005cspacefactor>`__).

               In addition: the converse case is a period (or other
               punctuation) that does not end a sentence. For that case,
               follow the period with a backslash-space, (``\``), or a
               tie, (``~``), or ``\@``. Examples are
               ``Nat.\ Acad.\ Science``, and ``Mr.~Bean``, and
               ``(manure, etc.\@) for sale`` (note in the last one that
               the ``\@`` comes after the period but before the closing
               parenthesis).

               Synopsis, one of:

                     \frenchspacing
                     \nonfrenchspacing

               ``\frenchspacing`` causes LaTeX to make spacing after all
               punctuation, including periods, be the same as the space
               between words in the middle of a sentence.
               ``\nonfrenchspacing`` switches back to the default
               handling in which spacing after most punctuation
               stretches or shrinks differently than a word space (see
               ```\spacefactor`` <#g_t_005cspacefactor>`__).

               In American English, the typesetting tradition is to
               adjust, typically increasing, the space after punctuation
               more than the space between words that are in the middle
               of a sentence. Declaring ``\frenchspacing`` (the command
               is inherited from plain TeX) switches to the tradition
               that all spaces are treated equally.

               If your LaTeX document specifies the language being used,
               for example with the ``babel`` package, the necessary
               settings should be taken care of for you.

               :class: section

            This section refers to the command consisting of two
            characters, a backslash followed by a space. Synopsis:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \ 

            Produce a space. By default it produces white space of
            length 3.33333pt plus 1.66666pt minus 1.11111pt.

            When you type one or more blanks between words, LaTeX
            produces whitespace that is different than an explicit
            space. This illustrates:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \begin{tabular}{rl}
                  One blank:& makes some space \\
                  Three blanks:&   in a row \\
                  Three spaces:&\ \ \ in a row \\
                  \end{tabular}

            On the first line LaTeX puts some space after the colon. On
            the second line LaTeX collapses the three blanks to output
            one whitespace, so you end with the same space after the
            colon as in the first line. LaTeX would similarly collapse
            them to a single whitespace if one, two or all of the three
            blanks were replaced by a tab, or by a newline. However, the
            bottom line asks for three spaces so the white area is
            wider. That is, the backslash-space command creates a fixed
            amount of horizontal space. (Note that you can define a
            horizontal space of any width at all with ``\hspace``;
            seeÂ ```\hspace`` <#g_t_005chspace>`__.)

            The backslash-space command has two main uses. It is often
            used after control sequences to keep them from gobbling the
            blank that follows, as after ``\TeX`` in
            ``\TeX\ (or \LaTeX)``. (But using curly braces has the
            advantage of still working whether the next character is a
            blank or any other non-letter, as in
            ``\TeX{} (or \LaTeX{})`` in which ``{}`` can be added after
            ``\LaTeX`` as well as after ``\TeX``.) The other common use
            is that it marks a period as ending an abbreviation instead
            of ending a sentence, as in ``Prof.\ Smith`` or
            ``Jones et al.\ (1993)`` (see ```\@`` <#g_t_005c_0040>`__).

            Under normal circumstances, ``\``\ TAB and ``\``\ NEWLINE
            are equivalent to backslash-space, ``\``.

            In order to allow source code indentation, under normal
            circumstances, TeX ignores leading blanks in a line. So the
            following prints â\ ``one word``\ â:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  one
                   word

            where the white space between â\ ``one``\ â and
            â\ ``word``\ â is produced by the newline after
            â\ ``one``\ â, not by the space before â\ ``word``\ â.

            The *tie* character, ``~``, produces a space between
            ``before`` and ``after`` at which the line will not be
            broken. By default the white space has length 3.33333pt plus
            1.66666pt minus 1.11111pt (see `Lengths <#Lengths>`__). The
            command ``\nobreakspace`` and the Unicode input character
            U+00A0 (also in many 8-bit encodings) are synonyms.

            Note that the word â\ ``tie``\ â has this meaning in the
            TeX/Texinfo community; this differs from the typographic
            term âtieâ, which is a diacritic in the shape of an arc,
            called a âtie-afterâ accent in The TeXbook.

            Here LaTeX will not break the line between the final two
            words:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  Thanks to Prof.~Lerman.

            In addition, despite the period, LaTeX does not use the
            end-of-sentence spacing (see ```\@`` <#g_t_005c_0040>`__).

            Ties prevent a line break where that could cause confusion.
            They also still allow hyphenation (of either of the tied
            words), so they are generally preferable to putting
            consecutive words in an ``\mbox`` (see ```\mbox`` &
            ``\makebox`` <#g_t_005cmbox-_0026-_005cmakebox>`__).

            Exactly where ties should be used is something of a matter
            of taste, sometimes alarmingly dogmatic taste, among
            readers. Nevertheless, here are some usage models, many of
            them from The TeXbook.

            -  Between an enumerator label and number, such as in
               references: ``Chapter~12``, or
               ``Theorem~\ref{th:Wilsons}``, or
               ``Figure~\ref{fig:KGraph}``.
            -  When cases are enumerated inline:
               ``(b)~Show that $f(x)$ is (1)~continuous, and (2)~bounded``.
            -  Between a number and its unit: ``$745.7.8$~watts`` (the
               ``siunitx`` package has a special facility for this) or
               ``144~eggs``. This includes between a month and day
               number in a date: ``October~12`` or ``12~Oct``. In
               general, in any expressions where numbers and
               abbreviations or symbols are separated by a space:
               ``AD~565``, or ``2:50~pm``, or ``Boeing~747``, or
               ``268~Plains Road``, or ``\$$1.4$~billion``. Other common
               choices here are a thin space (see ```\thinspace`` &
               ``\negthinspace`` <#g_t_005cthinspace-_0026-_005cnegthinspace>`__)
               and no space at all.
            -  When mathematical phrases are rendered in words:
               ``equals~$n$``, or ``less than~$\epsilon$``, or
               ``given~$X$``, or ``modulo~$p^e$ for all large~$n$`` (but
               compare ``is~$15$`` with ``is $15$~times the height``).
               Between mathematical symbols in apposition with nouns:
               ``dimension~$d$`` or ``function~$f(x)$`` (but compare
               ``with length $l$~or more``). When a symbol is a tightly
               bound object of a preposition: ``of~$x$``, or
               ``from $0$ to~$1$``, or ``in common with~$m$``.
            -  Between symbols in series: ``$1$,~$2$, or~$3$`` or
               ``$1$,~$2$, \ldots,~$n$``.
            -  Between a personâs given names and between multiple
               surnames: ``Donald~E. Knuth``, or
               ``Luis~I. Trabb~Pardo``, or ``Charles~XII``âbut you must
               give TeX places to break the line so you might do
               ``Charles Louis Xavier~Joseph de~la Vall\'ee~Poussin``.

            These produce unbreakable and unstretchable spaces of 1/6em
            and -1/6em, respectively. These are the text mode
            equivalents of ``\,`` and ``\!`` (see `Spacing in math
            mode/\\thinspace <#Spacing-in-math-mode_002f_005cthinspace>`__).

            You can use ``\,`` as a synonym for ``\thinspace`` in text
            mode.

            One common use of ``\thinspace`` is as the space between
            nested quotes:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  Killick replied, ``I heard the Captain say, `Ahoy there.'\thinspace''

            Another use is that some style guides call for a
            ``\thinspace`` between an ellipsis and a sentence ending
            period (other style guides, think the three dots and/or four
            dots are plenty). Another style-specific use is between
            initials, as in ``D.\thinspace E.\ Knuth``.

            LaTeX provides a variety of similar spacing commands for
            math mode (see `Spacing in math
            mode <#Spacing-in-math-mode>`__). With the ``amsmath``
            package, or as of the 2020-10-01 LaTeX release, they can be
            used in text mode as well as math mode, including ``\!`` for
            ``\negthinspace``; but otherwise, they are available only in
            math mode.

                  before-character\/after-character

            Insert an *italic correction*, a small space defined by the
            font designer for each character (possibly zero), to avoid
            the character colliding with whatever follows. When you use
            ``\/``, LaTeX takes the correction from the font metric
            file, scales it by any scaling that has been applied to the
            font, and then inserts that much horizontal space.

            Here, were it not for the ``\/``, the ``before-character``
            italicÂ f would hit the ``after-character`` romanÂ H

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\companylogo}{{\it f}\/H}

            because the italic letter f leans far to the right.

            If ``after-character`` is a period or comma then donât
            insert an italic correction since those punctuation symbols
            are so low to the baseline already. However, with semicolons
            or colons, as well as with normal letters, the italic
            correction can help. It is typically used between a switch
            from italic or slanted fonts to an upright font.

            When you use commands such as ``\emph`` and ``\textit`` and
            ``\textsl`` to change fonts, LaTeX automatically inserts the
            italic correction when needed (see `Font
            styles <#Font-styles>`__). However, declarations such as
            ``\em`` and ``\itshape`` and ``\slshape`` do not
            automatically insert italic corrections.

            Upright characters can also have an italic correction. An
            example where this is needed is the name ``pdf\/\TeX``.
            However, most upright characters have a zero italic
            correction. Some font creators do not include italic
            correction values even for italic fonts.

            Technically, LaTeX uses another font-specific value, the
            so-called *slant parameter* (namely ``\fontdimen1``), to
            determine whether to possibly insert an italic correction,
            rather than tying the action to particular font commands.

            There is no concept of italic correction in math mode; math
            spacing is done in a different way.

                  Mr Saumarez would have something rude to say to him, no doubt: he
                  was at home again, and it was delightful.

                  \bigskip
                  ``A hundred and fifty-seven miles and one third, in twenty-four hours,''
                  said Peter.

            Each command is associated with a length defined in the
            document class file.

            ``\bigskip`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cbigskip-1>`__
            The same as ``\vspace{\bigskipamount}``, ordinarily about
            one line space, with stretch and shrink. The default for the
            ``book`` and ``article`` classes is
            ``12pt plus 4pt minus 4pt``.

            ``\medskip`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cmedskip-1>`__
            The same as ``\vspace{\medskipamount}``, ordinarily about
            half of a line space, with stretch and shrink. The default
            for the ``book`` and ``article`` classes is
            ``6pt plus 2pt minus 2pt``.

            ``\smallskip`` `Â¶ <#index-_005csmallskip-1>`__
            The same as ``\vspace{\smallskipamount}``, ordinarily about
            a quarter of a line space, with stretch and shrink. The
            default for the ``book`` and ``article`` classes is
            ``3pt plus 1pt minus 1pt``.

            Because each command is a ``\vspace``, if you use it in
            mid-paragraph then it will insert its vertical space between
            the line in which you use it and the next line, not
            necessarily at the place that you use it. So these are best
            between paragraphs.

            The commands ``\bigbreak``, ``\medbreak``, and
            ``\smallbreak`` are similar but also suggest to LaTeX that
            this is a good place to put a page break (see ```\bigbreak``

            ``0.7\baselineskip`` and depth at least
            ``0.3\baselineskip``. Essentially, LaTeX inserts into the

            ``\rule[-0.3\baselineskip]{0pt}{\baselineskip}`` (see

            changes with the current font or fontsize.

            The final two lists use ``\fbox`` to show whatâs happening.
            The first item ``\parbox`` of the third list goes only to
            the bottom of its second â\ ``test``\ â, which happens not
            have any characters that descend below the baseline. The
            fourth list adds the strut that gives the needed extra
            below-baseline space.

            The ``\strut`` command is often useful in graphics, such as
            in ``TikZ`` or ``Asymptote``. For instance, you may have a
            command such as ``\graphnode{``\ ``node-name``\ ``}`` that
            fits a circle around ``node-name``. However, unless you are
            careful the ``node-name``\ âs â\ ``x``\ â and â\ ``y``\ â
            will produce different-diameter circles because the
            characters are different sizes. A careful ``\graphnode``
            might insert a ``\strut``, then ``node-name``, and then draw
            the circle.

            The general approach of using a zero width ``\rule`` is
            useful in many circumstances. In this table, the zero-width
            rule keeps the top of the first integral from hitting the
            ``\hline``. Similarly, the second rule keeps the second
            integral from hitting the first.

            (Although the line-ending double backslash command has an
            available optional argument to change the corresponding
            baseline skip, that wonât solve this issue. Changing the
            first double backslash to something like ``\\[2.5ex]`` will
            put more room between the header line and the ``\hline``
            rule, and the integral would still hit the rule.)

                  \vspace*{length}

            Add the vertical space ``length``. The ``length`` can be
            positive, negative, or zero. It is a rubber lengthâit may
            contain a ``plus`` or ``minus`` component (see
            `Lengths <#Lengths>`__).

            This puts space between the two paragraphs.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  And I slept.

                  \vspace{1ex plus 0.5ex}
                  The new day dawned cold.

            ``\smallskip`` <#g_t_005cbigskip-_0026-_005cmedskip-_0026-_005csmallskip>`__,
            for common inter-paragraph spaces.)

            The ``*``-form inserts vertical space that is
            non-discardable. More precisely, LaTeX discards vertical
            space at a page break and the ``*``-form causes the space to
            stay. This example leaves space between the two questions.

                  Question: Find the integral of \( 5x^4+5 \).

                  \vspace*{2cm plus 0.5cm}
                  Question: Find the derivative of \( x^5+5x+9 \).

            That space will be present even if the page break happens to
            fall between the questions.

            If you use ``\vspace`` in the middle of a paragraph (i.e.,
            in horizontal mode) then the space is inserted after the
            line containing the ``\vspace`` command; it does not start a
            new paragraph at the ``\vspace`` command.

            In this example the two questions will be evenly spaced
            vertically on the page, with at least one inch of space
            below each.

            It is often used in the same way as ``\vspace{\fill}``,
            except that ``\vfill`` ends the current paragraph whereas
            ``\vspace{\fill}`` adds the infinite vertical space below
            its line, irrespective of the paragraph structure. In both
            cases that space will disappear at a page boundary; to
            circumvent this see the starred option

            In this example the page is filled, so the top and bottom

                  \addvspace{vert-length}

            Add a vertical space of ``vert-length``. However, if there
            are two or more ``\addvspace``\ âs in a sequence then
            together they only add the space needed to make the natural
            length equal to the maximum of the ``vert-length``\ âs in
            that sequence. This command is fragile (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__). The ``vert-length`` is
            a rubber length (see `Lengths <#Lengths>`__).

            This example illustrates. The ``picture`` draws a scale over
            which to rules are placed. In a standard LaTeX article the
            length ``\baselineskip`` is 12pt. As shown by the scale, the
            two rules are 22pt apart: the sum of the ``\baselineskip``
            and the 10pt from the first ``\addvspace``.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \documentclass{article}
                  \usepackage{color}
                  \begin{document}
                  \setlength{\unitlength}{2pt}%
                  \noindent\begin{picture}(0,0)%
                    \multiput(0,0)(0,-1){25}{{\color{blue}\line(1,0){1}}}
                    \multiput(0,0)(0,-5){6}{{\color{red}\line(1,0){2}}}
                  \end{picture}%
                  \rule{0.25\linewidth}{0.1pt}% 
                  \par\addvspace{10pt}% \addvspace{20pt}%
                  \par\noindent\rule{0.25\linewidth}{0.1pt}%
                  \end{document}

            Now uncomment the second ``\addvspace``. It does not make
            the gap 20pt longer; instead the gap is the sum of
            ``\baselineskip`` and 20pt. So ``\addvspace`` in a sense
            does the opposite of its nameâit makes sure that multiple
            vertical spaces do not accumulate, but instead that only the
            largest one is used.

            LaTeX uses this command to adjust the vertical space above
            or below an environment that starts a new paragraph. For
            instance, a ``theorem`` environment begins and ends with
            ``\addvspace`` so that two consecutive ``theorem``\ âs are
            separated by one vertical space, not two.

            A error â\ ``Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item``\ â
            pointing to an ``\addvspace`` means that you were not in
            vertical mode when you hit this command. One way to change
            that is to precede ``\addvspace`` with a ``\par`` command
            (see ```\par`` <#g_t_005cpar>`__), as in the above example.

         At its core, LaTeX puts things in boxes and then puts the boxes
         on a page. So these commands are central.

         There are many packages on CTAN that are useful for
         manipulating boxes. One useful adjunct to the commands here is
         ``adjustbox``.

                  \makebox[width]{text}
                  \makebox[width][position]{text}

            Create a box, a container for material. The ``text`` is
            typeset in LR mode (see `Modes <#Modes>`__) so it is not
            broken into lines. The ``\mbox`` command is robust, while
            ``\makebox`` is fragile (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            Because ``text`` is not broken into lines, you can use
            ``\mbox`` to prevent hyphenation. In this example, LaTeX
            will not hyphenate the tank name, â\ ``T-34``\ â.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  The soviet tank \mbox{T-34} is a symbol of victory against nazism.

            The first two command invocations shown, ``\mbox`` and
            ``\makebox``, are roughly the same. They create a box just
            wide enough to contain the ``text``. (They are like plain
            TeXâs ``\hbox``.)

            In the third version the optional argument ``width``
            specifies the width of the box. Note that the space occupied
            by the text need not equal the width of the box. For one
            thing, ``text`` can be too small; this creates a full-line
            box:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \makebox[\linewidth]{Chapter Exam}

            with â\ ``Chapter Exam``\ â centered. But ``text`` can also
            be too wide for ``width``. See the example below of
            zero-width boxes.

            In the ``width`` argument you can use the following lengths
            that refer to the dimension of the box that LaTeX gets on
            typesetting ``text``: ``\depth``, ``\height``, ``\width``,
            ``\totalheight`` (this is the boxâs height plus its depth).
            For example, to make a box with the text stretched to double
            the natural size you can say this.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \makebox[2\width]{Get a stretcher}

            For the fourth command synopsis version the optional
            argument ``position`` gives position of the text within the
            box. It may take the following values:

            ``c``
               The ``text`` is centered (default).

            ``l``
               The ``text`` is flush left.

            ``r``
               Flush right.

            ``s``
               Stretch the interword space in ``text`` across the entire
               ``width``. The ``text`` must contain stretchable space
               for this to work. For instance, this could head a press
               release:
               ``\noindent\makebox[\textwidth][s]{\large\hfil IMMEDIATE\hfil RELEASE\hfil}``

            A common use of ``\makebox`` is to make zero-width text
            boxes. This puts the value of the quiz questions to the left
            of those questions.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\pts}[1]{\makebox[0em][r]{#1 points\hspace*{1em}}}
                  \pts{10}What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?

                  \pts{90}An African or European swallow?

            The right edge of the output â\ ``10 points``\ â (note the
            ending space after â\ ``points``\ â) will be just before the
            â\ ``What``\ â. You can use ``\makebox`` similarly when
            making graphics, such as in ``TikZ`` or ``Asymptote``, where
            you put the edge of the text at a known location, regardless
            of the length of that text.

            For boxes with frames seeÂ ```\fbox`` &
            ``\framebox`` <#g_t_005cfbox-_0026-_005cframebox>`__. For
            colors seeÂ `Colored boxes <#Colored-boxes>`__.

            There is a related version of ``\makebox`` that is used
            within the ``picture`` environment, where the length is
            given in terms of ``\unitlength`` (see ```\makebox``
            (picture) <#g_t_005cmakebox-_0028picture_0029>`__).

            As ``text`` is typeset in LR mode, neither a double
            backslash ``\\`` nor ``\par`` will give you a new line; for
            instance ``\makebox{abc def \\ ghi}`` outputs
            â\ ``abc defghi``\ â while ``\makebox{abc def \par ghi}``
            outputs â\ ``abc def ghi``\ â, both on a single line. To get
            multiple lines seeÂ ```\parbox`` <#g_t_005cparbox>`__

            Create a box with an enclosing frame, four rules surrounding
            the ``text``. These commands are the same as ``\mbox`` and
            ``\makebox`` except for the frame (see ```\mbox`` &
            ``\makebox`` <#g_t_005cmbox-_0026-_005cmakebox>`__). The
            ``\fbox`` command is robust, the ``\framebox`` command is
            fragile (see ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

                  \fbox{Warning! No work shown, no credit given.}

            LaTeX puts the text into a box, the text cannot be
            hyphenated. Around that box, separated from it by a small
            gap, are four rules making a frame.

            The first two command invocations, ``\fbox{...}`` and
            ``\framebox{...}``, are roughly the same. As to the third
            and fourth invocations, the optional arguments allow you to
            specify the box width as ``width`` and the position of the
            text inside that box as ``position``. See ```\mbox`` &
            ``\makebox`` <#g_t_005cmbox-_0026-_005cmakebox>`__, for the
            full description but here is an example creating an empty
            box that is 1/4in wide.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \setlength{\fboxsep}{0pt}\framebox[0.25in]{\strut}}

            The ``\strut`` ensures a total height of ``\baselineskip``
            (see ```\strut`` <#g_t_005cstrut>`__).

            These parameters determine the frame layout.

            ``\fboxrule`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cfboxrule-2>`__
            The thickness of the rules around the enclosed box. The
            default is 0.2pt. Change it with a command such as
            ``\setlength{\fboxrule}{0.8pt}`` (see
            ```\setlength`` <#g_t_005csetlength>`__).

            ``\fboxsep`` `Â¶ <#index-_005cfboxsep-2>`__
            The distance from the frame to the enclosed box. The default
            is 3pt. Change it with a command such as
            ``\setlength{\fboxsep}{0pt}`` (see
            ```\setlength`` <#g_t_005csetlength>`__). Setting it to 0pt
            is useful sometimes: this will put a frame around the
            picture with no white border.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                   \framebox{%
                     \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{prudence.jpg}}}

            The extra curly braces keep the effect of the ``\setlength``
            local.

            As with ``\mbox`` and ``\makebox``, LaTeX will not break
            lines in ``text``. But this example has LaTeX break lines to
            make a paragraph, and then frame the result.

            The ``picture`` environment has a version of the
            ``\framebox`` command where the units depend on
            ``picture``\ âs ``\unitlength`` (see ```\framebox``

            Produce a box of text that is ``width`` wide. Use this
            command to make a box of small pieces of text, of a single
            paragraph. This command is fragile (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

                  \end{picture}

            The ``contents`` are processed in a text mode (see
            `Modes <#Modes>`__) so LaTeX will break lines to make a
            paragraph. But it wonât make multiple paragraphs; for that,
            use a ``minipage`` environment (see
            ```minipage`` <#minipage>`__).

            The options for ``\parbox`` (except for ``contents``) are
            the same as those for ``minipage``. For convenience a
            summary of the options is here but
            seeÂ ```minipage`` <#minipage>`__ for a complete description.

            There are two required arguments. The ``width`` is a rigid
            length (see `Lengths <#Lengths>`__). It sets the width of
            the box into which LaTeX typesets ``contents``. The
            ``contents`` is the text that is placed in that box. It
            should not have any paragraph-making components.

            There are three optional arguments, ``position``,
            ``height``, and ``inner-pos``. The ``position`` gives the
            vertical alignment of the *parbox* with respect to the
            surrounding material. The supported values are ``c`` or
            ``m`` to make the vertical center of the parbox lines up
            with the center of the adjacent text line (this is the
            default), or ``t`` to match the top line of the parbox with
            the baseline of the surrounding material, or ``b`` to match
            the bottom line.

            The optional argument ``height`` overrides the natural
            height of the box.

            The optional argument ``inner-pos`` controls the placement
            of ``content`` inside the ``parbox``. Its default is the
            value of ``position``. Its possible values are: ``t`` to put
            the ``content`` at the top of the box, ``c`` to put it in
            the vertical center, ``b`` to put it at the bottom of the
            box, and ``s`` to stretch it out vertically (for this, the
            text must contain vertically stretchable space).

                  \raisebox{distance}[height][depth]{text}

            Raise or lower ``text``. This command is fragile (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            This example makes a command for denoting the restriction of
            a function by lowering the vertical bar symbol.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand*\restricted[1]{\raisebox{-.5ex}{$|$}_{#1}}
                  $f\restricted{A}$

            The first mandatory argument ``distance`` specifies how far
            to raise the second mandatory argument ``text``. This is a
            rigid length (see `Lengths <#Lengths>`__). If it is negative
            then it lowers ``text``. The ``text`` is processed in LR
            mode so it cannot contain line breaks (see
            `Modes <#Modes>`__).

            The optional arguments ``height`` and ``depth`` are
            dimensions. If they are specified, they override the natural
            height and depth of the box LaTeX gets by typesetting
            ``text``.

            In the arguments ``distance``, ``height``, and ``depth`` you
            can use the following lengths that refer to the dimension of
            the box that LaTeX gets on typesetting ``text``: ``\depth``,
            ``\height``, ``\width``, ``\totalheight`` (this is the boxâs
            height plus its depth).

            This will align two graphics on their top (see
            `Graphics <#Graphics>`__).

                      \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{meta.png}}
                  \end{center}

            The first ``\height`` is the height of ``lion.png`` while
            the second is the height of ``meta.png``.

            Typeset ``text`` just as with ``\makebox`` (see ```\mbox`` &
            ``\makebox`` <#g_t_005cmbox-_0026-_005cmakebox>`__) except
            that LaTeX does not output it but instead saves it in a box
            register referred to by a variable named ``box-cmd``. The
            variable name ``box-cmd`` begins with a backslash, ``\``.
            You must have previously allocated the box register
            ``box-cmd`` with ``\newsavebox`` (see
            ```\newsavebox`` <#g_t_005cnewsavebox>`__). The ``\sbox``
            command is robust while ``\savebox`` is fragile (see
            ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            This creates and uses a box register.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newsavebox{\fullname}

                  There goes \usebox{\fullname}!  Ya da da da da da da.

            One advantage of using and reusing a box register over a
            ``\newcommand`` macro variable is efficiency, that LaTeX
            need not repeatedly retypeset the contents. See the example
            below.

            The first two command invocations shown above,
            ``\sbox{``\ ``box-cmd``\ ``}{``\ ``text``\ ``}`` and
            ``\savebox{``\ ``box-cmd``\ ``}{``\ ``text``\ ``}``, are
            roughly the same. As to the third and fourth, the optional
            arguments allow you to specify the box width as ``width``,
            and the position of the text inside that box as
            ``position``. See ```\mbox`` &
            ``\makebox`` <#g_t_005cmbox-_0026-_005cmakebox>`__, for the
            full description.

            In the ``\sbox`` and ``\savebox`` commands the ``text`` is
            typeset in LR mode so it does not have line breaks (see
            `Modes <#Modes>`__). If you use these then LaTeX doesnât
            give you an error but it ignores what you want: if you enter
            ``\sbox{\newreg}{test \\ test}`` and ``\usebox{\newreg}``
            then you get â\ ``testtest``\ â, while if you enter
            ``\sbox{\newreg}{test \par test}`` and ``\usebox{\newreg}``
            then you get â\ ``test test``\ â, but no error or warning.
            To fix this use a ``\parbox`` or ``minipage`` as here.

            As an example of the efficiency of reusing a registerâs
            contents, this puts the same picture on each page of the
            document by putting it in the header. LaTeX only typesets it
            once.

            The ``picture`` environment is good for fine-tuning the
            placement.

            If the register ``\noreg`` has not already been defined then
            you get something like
            â\ ``Undefined control sequence. <argument> \noreg``\ â.

            :class: chapter

         You can use graphics such as PNG or PDF files in your LaTeX
         document. You need an additional package, which comes standard
         with LaTeX. This example is the short how-to.

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               \include{graphicx}  % goes in the preamble
                 ...
               \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{plot.pdf}

         To use the commands described here your document preamble must
         contain either ``\usepackage{graphicx}`` or
         ``\usepackage{graphics}``. Most of the time, ``graphicx`` is
         the better choice.

         Graphics come in two main types, raster and vector. LaTeX can
         use both. In raster graphics the file contains an entry for
         each location in an array, describing what color it is. An
         example is a photograph in JPG format. In vector graphics, the
         file contains a list of instructions such as
         â\ ``draw a circle with this radius and that center``\ â. An
         example is a line drawing produced by the Asymptote program, in
         PDF format. Generally vector graphics are more useful because
         you can rescale their size without pixelation or other
         problems, and because they often have a smaller size.

         There are systems particularly well-suited to make graphics for
         a LaTeX document. For example, these allow you to use the same
         fonts as in your document. LaTeX comes with a ``picture``
         environment (see ```picture`` <#picture>`__) that has simple
         capabilities. Besides that, there are other ways to include the
         graphic-making commands in the document. Two such systems are
         the PSTricks and TikZ packages. There are also systems external
         to LaTeX, that generate a graphic that you include using the
         commands of this chapter. Two that use a programming language
         are Asymptote and MetaPost. One that uses a graphical interface
         is Xfig. Full description of these systems is outside the scope
         of this document; see their documentation on CTAN.

                  \usepackage[comma-separated option list]{graphicx}

            The ``graphicx`` package has a format for optional arguments
            to the ``\includegraphics`` command that is convenient (it
            is the key-value format), so it is the better choice for new
            documents. When you load the ``graphics`` or ``graphicx``
            package with ``\usepackage`` there are two kinds of
            available options.

            The first is that LaTeX does not contain information about
            different output systems but instead depends on information
            stored in a *printer driver* file. Normally you should not
            specify the driver option in the document, and instead rely
            on your systemâs default. One advantage of this is that it
            makes the document portable across systems.

            For completeness here is a list of the drivers. The
            currently relevant ones are: ``dvipdfmx``, ``dvips``,
            ``dvisvgm``, ``luatex``, ``pdftex``, ``xetex``. The two
            ``xdvi`` and ``oztex`` are essentially aliases for ``dvips``
            (and ``xdvi`` is monochrome). Ones that should not be used
            for new systems are: ``dvipdf``, ``dvipdfm``, ``dviwin``,
            ``dvipsone``, ``emtex``, ``pctexps``, ``pctexwin``,
            ``pctexhp``, ``pctex32``, ``truetex``, ``tcidvi``, ``vtex``
            (and ``dviwindo`` is an alias for ``dvipsone``). These are
            stored in files with a ``.def`` extension, such as
            ``pdftex.def``.

            The second kind of options are below.

            ``demo``
               Instead of an image file, LaTeX puts in a 150Â pt by
               100Â pt rectangle (unless another size is specified in the
               ``\includegraphics`` command).

            ``draft``
               For each graphic file, it is not shown but instead its
               file name is printed in a box of the correct size. In
               order to determine the size, the file must be present.

            ``final``
               (Default) Override any previous ``draft`` option, so that
               the document shows the contents of the graphic files.

            ``hiderotate``
               Do not show rotated text. (This allows for the
               possibility that a previewer does not have the capability
               to rotate text.)

            ``hidescale``
               Do not show scaled text. (This allows for the possibility
               that a previewer does not have the capability to scale.)

            ``hiresbb``
               In a PS or EPS file the graphic size may be specified in
               two ways. The ``%%BoundingBox`` lines describe the
               graphic size using integer multiples of a PostScript
               point, that is, integer multiples of 1/72 inch. A later
               addition to the PostScript language allows decimal
               multiples, such as 1.23, in ``%%HiResBoundingBox`` lines.
               This option has LaTeX to read the size from the latter.

                     \graphicspath{list of directories inside curly braces}

               Declare a list of directories to search for graphics
               files. This allows you to later say something like
               ``\includegraphics{lion.png}`` instead of having to give
               its path.

               LaTeX always looks for graphic files first in the current
               directory (and the output directory, if specified; see
               `output directory <#output-directory>`__). The
               declaration below tells the system to then look in the
               subdirectory ``pix``, and then ``../pix``.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \usepackage{graphicx}   % or graphics; put in preamble
                       ...
                     \graphicspath{ {pix/} {../pix/} }

               The ``\graphicspath`` declaration is optional. If you
               donât include it then LaTeXâs default is to search all of
               the places that it usually looks for a file (it uses
               LaTeXâs ``\input@path``). In particular, in this case one
               of the places it looks is the current directory.

               Enclose each directory name in curly braces; for example,
               above it says â\ ``{pix}``\ â. Do this even if there is
               only one directory. Each directory name must end in a
               forward slash, ``/``. This is true even on Windows, where
               good practice is to use forward slashes for all the
               directory separators since it makes the document portable
               to other platforms. If you have spaces in your directory
               name then use double quotes, as with ``{"my docs/"}``.
               Getting one of these rules wrong will cause LaTeX to
               report
               :literal:`Error: File \``\ ``filename``\ ``' not found``.

               Basically, the algorithm is that with this example, after
               looking in the current directory,

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \graphicspath{ {pix/} {../pix/} }
                     ...
                     \usepackage{lion.png}

               for each of the listed directories, LaTeX concatenates it
               with the filename and searches for the result, checking
               for ``pix/lion.png`` and then ``../pix/lion.png``. This
               algorithm means that the ``\graphicspath`` command does
               not recursively search subdirectories: if you issue
               ``\graphicspath{{a/}}`` and the graphic is in
               ``a/b/lion.png`` then LaTeX will not find it. It also
               means that you can use absolute paths such as
               ``\graphicspath{{/home/jim/logos/}}`` or
               ``\graphicspath{{C:/Users/Albert/Pictures/}}``. However,
               using these means that the document is not portable. (You
               could preserve portability by adjusting your TeX system
               settings configuration file parameter ``TEXINPUTS``; see
               the documentation of your system.)

               You can use ``\graphicspath`` anywhere in the document.
               You can use it more than once. Show its value with
               ``\makeatletter\typeout{\Ginput@path}\makeatother``.

               The directories are taken with respect to the base file.
               That is, suppose that you are working on a document based
               on ``book/book.tex`` and it contains
               ``\include{chapters/chap1}``. If in ``chap1.tex`` you put
               ``\graphicspath{{plots/}}`` then LaTeX will not search
               for graphics in ``book/chapters/plots``, but instead in
               ``book/plots``.

               Declare the filename extensions to try. This allows you
               to specify the order in which to choose graphic formats
               when you include graphic files by giving the filename
               without the extension, as in
               ``\includegraphics{functionplot}``.

               In this example, LaTeX will find files in the PNG format
               before PDF files.

                     \includegraphics{lion}   % will find lion.png before lion.pdf 

               Because the filename ``lion`` does not have a period,
               LaTeX uses the extension list. For each directory in the
               graphics path (see
               ```\graphicspath`` <#g_t_005cgraphicspath>`__), LaTeX
               will try the extensions in the order given. If it does
               not find such a file after trying all the directories and
               extensions then it reports
               â\ :literal:`! LaTeX Error: File \``\ ``lion``\ ``' not found``\ â.
               Note that you must include the periods at the start of
               the extensions.

               Because GNU/Linux and Macintosh filenames are case
               sensitive, the list of file extensions is case sensitive
               on those platforms. The Windows platform is not case
               sensitive.

               You are not required to include
               ``\DeclareGraphicsExtensions`` in your document; the
               printer driver has a sensible default. For example, the
               most recent ``pdftex.def`` has this extension list.

               To change the order, use the ``grfext`` package.

               You can use this command anywhere in the document. You
               can use it more than once. Show its value with

               Synopsis:

               .. container:: example

                     \DeclareGraphicsRule{extension}{type}{size-file extension}{command}

               Declare how to handle graphic files whose names end in
               ``extension``.

               This example declares that all files with names of the
               form ``filename-without-dot.mps`` will be treated as
               output from MetaPost, meaning that the printer driver
               will use its MetaPost-handling code to input the file.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \DeclareGraphicsRule{.mps}{mps}{.mps}{}

               This

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \DeclareGraphicsRule{*}{mps}{*}{}

               tells LaTeX that it should handle as MetaPost output any
               file with an extension not covered by another rule, so it
               covers ``filename.1``, ``filename.2``, etc.

               This describes the four arguments.

               ``extension``
                  The file extension to which this rule applies. The
                  extension is anything after and including the first
                  dot in the filename. Use the Kleene star, ``*``, to
                  denote the default behavior for all undeclared
                  extensions.

               ``type``
                  The type of file involved. This type is a string that
                  must be defined in the printer driver. For instance,
                  files with extensions ``.ps``, ``.eps``, or ``.ps.gz``
                  may all be classed as type ``eps``. All files of the
                  same type will be input with the same internal command
                  by the printer driver. For example, the file types
                  that ``pdftex`` recognizes are: ``jpg``, ``jbig2``,
                  ``mps``, ``pdf``, ``png``, ``tif``.

               ``size-file extension``
                  The extension of the file to be read to determine the
                  size of the graphic, if there is such a file. It may
                  be the same as ``extension`` but it may be different.

                  As an example, consider a PostScript graphic. To make
                  it smaller, it might be compressed into a ``.ps.gz``
                  file. Compressed files are not easily read by LaTeX so
                  you can put the bounding box information in a separate
                  file. If ``size-file extension`` is empty then you
                  must specify size information in the arguments of
                  ``\includegraphics``.

                  If the driver file has a procedure for reading size
                  files for ``type`` then that will be used, otherwise
                  it will use the procedure for reading ``.eps`` files.
                  (Thus you may specify the size of bitmap files in a
                  file with a PostScript style ``%%BoundingBox`` line if
                  no other format is available.)

               ``command``
                  A command that will be applied to the file. This is
                  often left empty. This command must start with a
                  single backward quote. Thus,
                  :literal:`\\DeclareGraphicsRule{.eps.gz}{eps}{.eps.bb}{\`gunzip -c #1}`
                  specifies that any file with the extension ``.eps.gz``
                  should be treated as an ``eps`` file, with the
                  BoundingBox information stored in the file with
                  extension ``.eps.bb``, and that the command
                  ``gunzip -c`` will run on your platform to
                  decompresses the file.

                  Such a command is specific to your platform. In
                  addition, your TeX system must allow you to run
                  external commands; as a security measure modern
                  systems restrict running commands unless you
                  explicitly allow it. See the documentation for your
                  TeX distribution.

               Include a graphics file. The starred form
               ``\includegraphics*`` will clip the graphic to the size
               specified, while for the unstarred form any part of the
               graphic that is outside the box of the specified size
               will over-print the surrounding area.

                     \begin{center}
                       \includegraphics{plot.pdf}
                     \end{center}

               will incorporate into the document the graphic in
               ``plot.pdf``, centered and at its nominal size. You can
               also give a path to the file, as with
               ``\includegraphics{graphics/plot.pdf}``. To specify a
               list of locations to search for the file, see
               ```\graphicspath`` <#g_t_005cgraphicspath>`__.

               If your filename includes spaces then put it in double
               quotes. An example is
               ``\includegraphics{"sister picture.jpg"}``.

               The ``\includegraphics{``\ ``filename``\ ``}`` command
               decides on the type of graphic by splitting ``filename``
               on the first dot. You can instead use ``filename`` with
               no dot, as in ``\includegraphics{turing}``, and then
               LaTeX tries a sequence of extensions such as ``.png`` and
               ``.pdf`` until it finds a file with that extension (see
               ```\DeclareGraphicsExtensions`` <#g_t_005cDeclareGraphicsExtensions>`__).

               If your file name contains dots before the extension then
               you can hide them with curly braces, as in
               ``\includegraphics{{plot.2018.03.12.a}.pdf}``. Or, if you
               use the ``graphicx`` package then you can use the options
               ``type`` and ``ext``; see below. This and other filename
               issues are also handled with the package ``grffile``.

               This example puts a graphic in a ``figure`` environment
               so LaTeX can move it to the next page if fitting it on
               the current page is awkward (see
               ```figure`` <#figure>`__).

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{figure}

                     \end{figure}

               This places a graphic that will not float, so it is sure
               to appear at this point in the document even if makes
               LaTeX stretch the text or resort to blank areas on the
               page. It will be centered and will have a caption.

                     \end{center}

               This example puts a box with a graphic side by side with
               one having text, with the two vertically centered.

               .. container:: example

               ```\scalebox`` <#g_t_005cscalebox>`__). When one optional
               argument is present then it is
               ``[``\ ``urx``\ ``,``\ ``ury``\ ``]`` and it gives the
               coordinates of the top right corner of the image, as a
               pair of TeX dimensions (see `Units of
               length <#Units-of-length>`__). If the units are omitted
               they default to ``bp``. In this case, the lower left
               corner of the image is assumed to be at (0,0). If two
               optional arguments are present then the leading one is
               ``[``\ ``llx``\ ``,``\ ``lly``\ ``]``, specifying the
               coordinates of the imageâs lower left. Thus,
               ``\includegraphics[1in,0.618in]{...}`` calls for the
               graphic to be placed so it is 1Â inch wide and
               0.618Â inches tall and so its origin is at (0,0).

               The ``graphicx`` package gives you many more options.
               Specify them in a key-value form, as here.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{center}
                       \includegraphics[width=1in,angle=90]{lion}
                       \hspace{2em}
                       \includegraphics[angle=90,width=1in]{lion}
                     \end{center}

               The options are read left-to-right. So the first graphic
               above is made one inch wide and then rotated, while the
               second is rotated and then made one inch wide. Thus,
               unless the graphic is perfectly square, the two will end
               with different widths and heights.

               There are many options. The primary ones are listed
               first.

               Note that a graphic is placed by LaTeX into a box, which
               is traditionally referred to as its *bounding box*
               (distinct from the PostScript BoundingBox described
               below). The graphicâs printed area may go beyond this
               box, or sit inside this box, but when LaTeX makes up a
               page it puts together boxes and this is the box allocated
               for the graphic.

               ``width``
               The graphic will be shown so its bounding box is this
               width. An example is
               ``\includegraphics[width=1in]{plot}``. You can use the
               standard TeX dimensions (see `Units of
               length <#Units-of-length>`__) and also convenient is
               ``\linewidth``, or in a two-column document,
               ``\columnwidth`` (see `Page layout
               parameters <#Page-layout-parameters>`__). An example is
               that by using the ``calc`` package you can make the
               graphic be 1Â cm narrower than the width of the text with
               ``\includegraphics[width=\linewidth-1.0cm]{hefferon.jpg}``.

               ``height``
               The graphic will be shown so its bounding box is this
               height. You can use the standard TeX dimensions (see
               `Units of length <#Units-of-length>`__), and also
               convenient are ``\pageheight`` and ``\textheight`` (see
               `Page layout parameters <#Page-layout-parameters>`__).
               For instance, the command
               ``\includegraphics[height=0.25\textheight]{godel}`` will
               make the graphic a quarter of the height of the text
               area.

               ``totalheight``
               The graphic will be shown so its bounding box has this
               height plus depth. This differs from the height if the
               graphic was rotated. For instance, if it has been rotated
               by -90 then it will have zero height but a large depth.

               ``keepaspectratio``
               If set to ``true``, or just specified as here

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \includegraphics[...,keepaspectratio,...]{...}

               and you give as options both ``width`` and ``height`` (or
               ``totalheight``), then LaTeX will make the graphic is as
               large as possible without distortion. That is, LaTeX will
               ensure that neither is the graphic wider than ``width``
               nor taller than ``height`` (or ``totalheight``).

               ``scale``
               Factor by which to scale the graphic. To make a graphic
               twice its nominal size, enter
               ``\includegraphics[scale=2.0]{...}``. This number may be
               any value; a number between 0 andÂ 1 will shrink the
               graphic and a negative number will reflect it.

               ``angle``
               Rotate the graphic. The angle is taken in degrees and
               counterclockwise. The graphic is rotated about its
               ``origin``; see that option. For a complete description
               of how rotated material is typeset, see
               ```\rotatebox`` <#g_t_005crotatebox>`__.

               ``origin``
               The point of the graphic about which the rotation
               happens. Possible values are any string containing one or
               two of: ``l`` for left, ``r`` for right, ``b`` for
               bottom, ``c`` for center, ``t`` for top, and ``B`` for
               baseline. Thus, entering the command
               ``\includegraphics[angle=180,origin=c]{moon}`` will turn
               the picture upside down about that pictureâs center,
               while the command
               ``\includegraphics[angle=180,origin=lB]{LeBateau}`` will
               turn its picture upside down about its left baseline.
               (The character ``c`` gives the horizontal center in
               ``bc`` or ``tc``, but gives the vertical center in ``lc``
               or ``rc``.) The default is ``lB``.

               To rotate about an arbitrary point, see
               ```\rotatebox`` <#g_t_005crotatebox>`__.

               These are lesser-used options.

               ``viewport``
               Pick out a subregion of the graphic to show. Takes four
               arguments, separated by spaces and given in TeX
               dimensions, as with
               ``\includegraphics[.., viewport=0in 0in 1in 0.618in]{...}``.
               When the unit is omitted, the dimensions default to big
               points,Â ``bp``. They are taken relative to the origin
               specified by the bounding box. See also the ``trim``
               option.

               ``trim``
               Gives parts of the graphic to not show. Takes four
               arguments, separated by spaces, that are given in TeX
               dimensions, as with
               ``\includegraphics[.., trim= 0in 0.1in 0.2in 0.3in, ...]{...}``.
               These give the amounts of the graphic not to show, that
               is, LaTeX will crop the picture by 0Â inches on the left,
               0.1Â inches on the bottom, 0.2Â inches on the right, and
               0.3Â inches on the top. See also the ``viewport`` option.

               ``clip``
               If set to ``true``, or just specified as here

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \includegraphics[...,clip,...]{...}

               then the graphic is cropped to the bounding box. This is
               the same as using the starred form of the command,
               ``\includegraphics*[...]{...}``.

               ``page``
               Give the page number of a multi-page PDF file. The
               default is ``page=1``.

               ``pagebox``
               Specifies which bounding box to use for PDF files from
               among ``mediabox``, ``cropbox``, ``bleedbox``,
               ``trimbox``, or ``artbox``. PDF files do not have the
               BoundingBox that PostScript files have, but may specify
               up to four predefined rectangles. The MediaBox gives the
               boundaries of the physical medium. The CropBox is the
               region to which the contents of the page are to be
               clipped when displayed. The BleedBox is the region to
               which the contents of the page should be clipped in
               production. The TrimBox is the intended dimensions of the
               finished page. The ArtBox is the extent of the pageâs
               meaningful content. The driver will set the image size
               based on CropBox if present, otherwise it will not use
               one of the others, with a driver-defined order of
               preference. MediaBox is always present.

               ``interpolate``
               Enable or disable interpolation of raster images by the
               viewer. Can be set with ``interpolate=true`` or just
               specified as here.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \includegraphics[...,interpolate,...]{...}

               ``quiet``
               Do not write information to the log. You can set it with
               ``quiet=true`` or just specified it with
               ``\includegraphics[...,quiet,...]{...}``,

               ``draft``
               If you set it with ``draft=true`` or just specify it with

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \includegraphics[...,draft,...]{...}

               then the graphic will not appear in the document,
               possibly saving color printer ink. Instead, LaTeX will
               put an empty box of the correct size with the filename
               printed in it.

               These options address the bounding box for Encapsulated
               PostScript graphic files, which have a size specified
               with a line ``%%BoundingBox`` that appears in the file.
               It has four values, giving the lower *x* coordinate,
               lower *y* coordinate, upper *x* coordinate, and upper *y*
               coordinate. The units are PostScript points, equivalent
               to TeXâs big points, 1/72Â inch. For example, if an
               ``.eps`` file has the line ``%%BoundingBox 10 20 40 80``
               then its natural size is 30/72Â inch wide by 60/72Â inch
               tall.

               ``bb``
               Specify the bounding box of the displayed region. The
               argument is four dimensions separated by spaces, as with
               ``\includegraphics[.., bb= 0in 0in 1in 0.618in]{...}``.
               Usually ``\includegraphics`` reads the BoundingBox
               numbers from the EPS file automatically, so this option
               is only useful if the bounding box is missing from that
               file or if you want to change it.

               ``bbllx, bblly, bburx, bbury``
               Set the bounding box. These four are obsolete, but are
               retained for compatibility with old packages.

               ``natwidth, natheight``
               An alternative for ``bb``. Setting

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \includegraphics[...,natwidth=1in,natheight=0.618in,...]{...}

               is the same as setting ``bb=0 0 1in 0.618in``.

               ``hiresbb``
               If set to ``true``, or just specified as with

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \includegraphics[...,hiresbb,...]{...}

               then LaTeX will look for ``%%HiResBoundingBox`` lines
               instead of ``%%BoundingBox`` lines. (The ``BoundingBox``
               lines use only natural numbers while the
               ``HiResBoundingBox`` lines use decimals; both use units
               equivalent to TeXâs big points, 1/72Â inch.) To override a
               prior setting of ``true``, you can set it to ``false``.

               These following options allow a user to override LaTeXâs
               method of choosing the graphic type based on the filename
               extension. An example is that
               ``\includegraphics[type=png,ext=.xyz,read=.xyz]{lion}``
               will read the file ``lion.xyz`` as though it were
               ``lion.png``. For more on these, see
               ```\DeclareGraphicsRule`` <#g_t_005cDeclareGraphicsRule>`__.

               ``type``
               Specify the graphics type.

               ``ext``
               Specify the graphics extension. Only use this in
               conjunction with the option ``type``.

               ``read``
               Specify the file extension of the read file. Only use
               this in conjunction with the option ``type``.

               ``command``
               Specify a command to be applied to this file. Only use
               this in conjunction with the option ``type``. See
               `Command line options <#Command-line-options>`__, for a
               discussion of enabling the ``\write18`` functionality to
               run external commands.

               Synopsis if you use the ``graphics`` package:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \rotatebox{angle}{material}

               Synopses if you use the ``graphicx`` package:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \rotatebox{angle}{material}
                     \rotatebox[key-value list]{angle}{material}

               Put ``material`` in a box and rotate it ``angle`` degrees
               counterclockwise.

               This example rotates the table column heads forty-five
               degrees.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{tabular}{ll}

                     \end{tabular}

               The ``material`` can be anything that goes in a box,
               including a graphic.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                       \rotatebox[origin=c]{45}{\includegraphics[width=1in]{lion}}

               To place the rotated material, the first step is that
               LaTeX sets ``material`` in a box, with a reference point
               on the left baseline. The second step is the rotation, by
               default about the reference point. The third step is that
               LaTeX computes a box to bound the rotated material.
               Fourth, LaTeX moves this box horizontally so that the
               left edge of this new bounding box coincides with the
               left edge of the box from the first step (they need not
               coincide vertically). This new bounding box, in its new
               position, is what LaTeX uses as the box when typesetting
               this material.

               If you use the ``graphics`` package then the rotation is
               about the reference point of the box. If you use the
               ``graphicx`` package then these are the options that can
               go in the ``key-value list``, but note that you can get
               the same effect without needing this package, except for
               the ``x`` and ``y`` options (see
               ```\includegraphics`` <#g_t_005cincludegraphics>`__).

               ``origin``
                  The point of the ``material``\ âs box about which the
                  rotation happens. Possible value is any string
                  containing one or two of: ``l`` for left, ``r`` for
                  right, ``b`` for bottom, ``c`` for center, ``t`` for
                  top, and ``B`` for baseline. Thus, the first line here

                  .. container:: example

                     .. code:: example-preformatted

                        \rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{moon}
                        \rotatebox[origin=lB]{180}{LeBateau}

                  will turn the picture upside down from the center
                  while the second will turn its picture upside down
                  about its left baseline. (The character ``c`` gives
                  the horizontal center in ``bc`` or ``tc`` but gives
                  the vertical center in ``lc`` or ``rc``, and gives
                  both in ``c``.) The default is ``lB``.

               ``x, y``
                  Specify an arbitrary point of rotation with
                  ``\rotatebox[x=``\ ``TeX dimension``\ ``,y=``\ ``TeX dimension``\ ``]{...}``
                  (see `Units of length <#Units-of-length>`__). These
                  give the offset from the boxâs reference point.

               ``units``
                  This key allows you to change the default of degrees
                  counterclockwise. Setting ``units=-360`` changes the
                  direction to degrees clockwise and setting
                  ``units=6.283185`` changes to radians
                  counterclockwise.

               Scale the ``material``.

               This example halves the size, both horizontally and
               vertically, of the first text and doubles the size of the
               second.

               If you do not specify the optional ``vertical factor``
               then it defaults to the same value as the
               ``horizontal factor``.

               You can use this command to resize a graphic, as here.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics{lion}}

               If you use the ``graphicx`` package then you can
               accomplish the same thing with optional arguments to
               ``\includegraphics`` (see
               ```\includegraphics`` <#g_t_005cincludegraphics>`__).

               The ``\reflectbox`` command abbreviates
               ``\scalebox{-1}[1]{``\ ``material``\ ``}``. Thus,
               ``Able was I\reflectbox{Able was I}`` will show the
               phrase â\ ``Able was I``\ â immediately followed by its
               mirror reflection against a vertical axis.

                     \resizebox*{horizontal length}{vertical length}{material}

               Given a size, such as ``3cm``, transform ``material`` to
               make it that size. If either ``horizontal length`` or
               ``vertical length`` is an exclamation pointÂ ``!`` then
               the other argument is used to determine a scale factor
               for both directions.

               This example makes the graphic be a half inch wide and
               scales it vertically by the same factor to keep it from
               being distorted.

               .. container:: example

                     \resizebox{0.5in}{!}{\includegraphics{lion}}

               The unstarred form ``\resizebox`` takes
               ``vertical length`` to be the boxâs height while the
               starred form ``\resizebox*`` takes it to be height+depth.
               For instance, make the text have a height+depth of a
               quarter-inch with
               ``\resizebox*{!}{0.25in}{\parbox{3.5in}{This box has both height and depth.}}``.

               You can use ``\depth``, ``\height``, ``\totalheight``,
               and ``\width`` to refer to the original size of the box.
               Thus, make the text two inches wide but keep the original
               height with ``\resizebox{2in}{\height}{Two inches}``.

            When you load the ``color`` package there are two kinds of
            available options.

            The first specifies the *printer driver*. LaTeX doesnât
            contain information about different output systems but
            instead depends on information stored in a file. Normally
            you should not specify the driver option in the document,
            and instead rely on your systemâs default. One advantage of
            this is that it makes the document portable across systems.
            For completeness we include a list of the drivers. The
            currently relevant ones are: ``dvipdfmx``, ``dvips``,
            ``dvisvgm``, ``luatex``, ``pdftex``, ``xetex``. The two
            ``xdvi`` and ``oztex`` are essentially aliases for ``dvips``
            (and ``xdvi`` is monochrome). Ones that should not be used
            for new systems are: ``dvipdf``, ``dvipdfm``, ``dviwin``,
            ``dvipsone``, ``emtex``, ``pctexps``, ``pctexwin``,
            ``pctexhp``, ``pctex32``, ``truetex``, ``tcidvi``, ``vtex``
            (and ``dviwindo`` is an alias for ``dvipsone``).

            The second kind of options, beyond the drivers, are below.

            ``monochrome``
               Disable the color commands, so that they do not generate
               errors but do not generate color either.

            ``dvipsnames``
               Make available a list of 68 color names that are often
               used, particularly in legacy documents. These color names
               were originally provided by the ``dvips`` driver, giving
               the option name.

            ``nodvipsnames``
               Do not load that list of color names, saving LaTeX a tiny
               amount of memory space.

               :class: section

            A *color model* is a way of representing colors. LaTeXâs
            capabilities depend on the printer driver. However, the
            ``pdftex``, ``xetex``, and ``luatex`` printer drivers are
            today by far the most commonly used. The models below work
            for those drivers. All but one of these is also supported by
            essentially all other printer drivers used today.

            Note that color combination can be additive or subtractive.
            Additive mixes colors of light, so that for instance
            combining full intensities of red, green, and blue produces
            white. Subtractive mixes pigments, such as with inks, so
            that combining full intensity of cyan, magenta, and yellow
            makes black.

            ``cmyk``
            A comma-separated list with four real numbers between 0 and
            1, inclusive. The first number is the intensity of cyan, the
            second is magenta, and the others are yellow and black. A
            number value of 0 means minimal intensity, while a 1 is for
            full intensity. This model is often used in color printing.
            It is a subtractive model.

            ``gray``
            A single real number between 0 and 1, inclusive. The colors
            are shades of grey. The number 0 produces black while 1
            gives white.

            ``rgb``
            A comma-separated list with three real numbers between 0 and
            1, inclusive. The first number is the intensity of the red
            component, the second is green, and the third the blue. A
            number value of 0 means that none of that component is added
            in, while a 1 means full intensity. This is an additive
            model.

            ``RGB``
            (``pdftex``, ``xetex``, ``luatex`` drivers) A
            comma-separated list with three integers between 0 and 255,
            inclusive. This model is a convenience for using ``rgb``
            since outside of LaTeX colors are often described in a
            red-green-blue model using numbers in this range. The values
            entered here are converted to the ``rgb`` model by dividing
            by 255.

            ``named``
            Colors are accessed by name, such as â\ ``PrussianBlue``\ â.
            The list of names depends on the driver, but all support the
            names â\ ``black``\ â, â\ ``blue``\ â, â\ ``cyan``\ â,
            â\ ``green``\ â, â\ ``magenta``\ â, â\ ``red``\ â,
            â\ ``white``\ â, and â\ ``yellow``\ â (See the
            ``dvipsnames`` option in ```color`` package

               The affected text gets the color. This line

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \textcolor{magenta}{My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;}
                     Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!

               causes the first half to be in magenta while the rest is
               in black. You can use a color declared with
               ``\definecolor`` in exactly the same way that we just
               used the builtin color â\ ``magenta``\ â.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \definecolor{MidlifeCrisisRed}{rgb}{1.0,0.11,0.0}
                     I'm thinking about getting a \textcolor{MidlifeCrisisRed}{sports car}.

               The two ``\textcolor`` and ``\color`` differ in that the
               first is a command form, enclosing the text to be colored
               as an argument. Often this form is more convenient, or at
               least more explicit. The second form is a declaration, as
               in ``The moon is made of {\color{green} green} cheese``,
               so it is in effect until the end of the current group or
               environment. This is sometimes useful when writing macros
               or as below where it colors everything inside the
               ``center`` environment, including the vertical and
               horizontal lines.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{center} \color{blue}
                       \begin{tabular}{l|r}
                         UL &UR \\ \hline
                         LL &LR 
                       \end{tabular}
                     \end{center}

               You can use color in equations. A document might have
               this definition in the preamble

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \definecolor{highlightcolor}{RGB}{225,15,0}

               and then contain this equation.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \begin{equation}
                       \int_a^b \textcolor{highlightcolor}{f'(x)}\,dx=f(b)-f(a)
                     \end{equation}

               Typically the colors used in a document are declared in a
               class or style but sometimes you want a one-off. Those
               are the second forms in the synopses.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     Colors of \textcolor[rgb]{0.33,0.14,0.47}{Purple} and
                     {\color[rgb]{0.72,0.60,0.37}Gold} for the team.

               The format of ``color specification`` depends on the
               color model (see `Color models <#Color-models>`__). For
               instance, while ``rgb`` takes three numbers, ``gray``
               takes only one.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     The selection was \textcolor[gray]{0.5}{grayed out}.

               Colors inside colors do not combine. Thus

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \textcolor{green}{kind of \textcolor{blue}{blue}}

               has a final word that is blue, not a combination of blue
               and green.

               Make a box with the stated background color. The
               ``\fcolorbox`` command puts a frame around the box. For

               makes a cyan-colored box that is five centimeters long
               and gets its depth and height from the ``\strut`` (so the
               depth is ``-.3\baselineskip`` and the height is
               ``\baselineskip``). This puts white text on a blue

               The ``\fcolorbox`` commands use the same parameters as
               ``\fbox`` (see ```\fbox`` &
               ``\framebox`` <#g_t_005cfbox-_0026-_005cframebox>`__),
               ``\fboxrule`` and ``\fboxsep``, to set the thickness of
               the rule and the boundary between the box interior and
               the surrounding rule. LaTeXâs defaults are ``0.4pt`` and
               ``3pt``, respectively.

               This example changes the thickness of the border to 0.8
               points. Note that it is surrounded by curly braces so
               that the change ends at the end of the second line.

               :name: Reserved-characters-1
               :class: section

            LaTeX sets aside the following characters for special
            purposes. For example, the percent signÂ ``%`` is for
            comments. They are called *reserved characters* or *special
            characters*. They are all discussed elsewhere in this
            manual.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  # $ % & { } _ ~ ^ \ 

            If you want a reserved character to be printed as itself, in
            the text body font, for all but the final three characters
            in that list simply put a backslashÂ ``\`` in front of the
            character. Thus, typing ``\$1.23`` will produceÂ ``$1.23`` in
            your output.

            As to the last three characters, to get a tilde in the text
            body font use ``\~{}`` (omitting the curly braces would
            result in the next character receiving a tilde accent).
            Similarly, to get a text body font circumflex use ``\^{}``.
            To get a backslash in the font of the text body, enter
            ``\textbackslash{}``.

            To produce the reserved characters in a typewriter font use
            ``\verb!!`` as below (the double backslashÂ ``\\`` in the
            example is only there to split the lines in the output).

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

            Synopsis:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \uppercase{text}
                  \lowercase{text}
                  \MakeUppercase{text}
                  \MakeLowercase{text}

            Change the case of characters. The TeX primitive commands
            ``\uppercase`` and ``\lowercase`` are set up by default to
            work only with the 26 letters aâz and AâZ. The LaTeX
            commands ``\MakeUppercase`` and ``\MakeLowercase`` commands
            also change characters accessed by commands such as ``\ae``
            or ``\aa``. The commands ``\MakeUppercase`` and
            ``\MakeLowercase`` are robust but they have moving arguments
            (see ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__).

            These commands do not change the case of letters used in the
            name of a command within ``text``. But they do change the
            case of every other Latin letter inside the argument
            ``text``. Thus, ``\MakeUppercase{Let $y=f(x)$``} produces
            â\ ``LET Y=F(X)``\ â. Another example is that the name of an
            environment will be changed, so that
            ``\MakeUppercase{\begin{tabular} ... \end{tabular}}`` will
            produce an error because the first half is changed to
            ``\begin{TABULAR}``.

            LaTeX uses the same fixed table for changing case throughout
            a document, The table used is designed for the font encoding
            T1; this works well with the standard TeX fonts for all
            Latin alphabets but will cause problems when using other
            alphabets.

            To change the case of text that results from a macro inside
            ``text`` you need to do expansion. Here the ``\Schoolname``
            produces â\ ``COLLEGE OF MATHEMATICS``\ â.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\schoolname}{College of Mathematics}
                  \newcommand{\Schoolname}{\expandafter\MakeUppercase
                                             \expandafter{\schoolname}}

            The ``textcase`` package brings some of the missing feature
            of the standard LaTeX commands ``\MakeUppercase`` and
            ``\MakeLowerCase``.

            To uppercase only the first letter of words, you can use the
            package ``mfirstuc``.

            Handling all the casing rules specified by Unicode, e.g.,
            for non-Latin scripts, is a much bigger job than anything
            envisioned in the original TeX and LaTeX. It has been
            implemented in the ``expl3`` package as of 2020. The article
            âCase changing: From TeX primitives to the Unicode
            algorithmâ, (Joseph Wright, TUGboatÂ 41:1,
            https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb41-1/tb127wright-case.pdf), gives
            a good overview of the topic, past and present.

            You can access any character of the current font using its
            number with the ``\symbol`` command. For example, the
            visible space character used in the ``\verb*`` command has
            the code decimal 32 in the standard Computer Modern
            typewriter font, so it can be typed as ``\symbol{32}``.

            You can also specify numbers in octal (base 8) by using a
            ``'`` prefix, or hexadecimal (base 16) with a ``"`` prefix,
            so the visible space at 32 decimal could also be written as
            ``\symbol{'40}`` or ``\symbol{"20}``.

            .. rubric:: 23.4 Text symbols
               :name: Text-symbols-1
               :class: section

            LaTeX provides commands to generate a number of non-letter
            symbols in running text. Some of these, especially the more
            obscure ones, are not available in OT1. As of the LaTeX
            February 2020 release, all symbols are available by default;
            before that, it was necessary to use the ``textcomp``
            package for some (technically, those in the ``TS1`` font
            encoding).

               \\ Backslash. However, ``\texttt{\textbackslash}``
               produces a roman (not typewriter) backslash by default;
               for a typewriter backslash, it is necessary to use the T1
               (or other non-default) font encoding, as in:

               .. container:: example

            ``\textascendercompwordmark`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextascendercompwordmark>`__

               Used to separate letters that would normally ligature.
               For example, ``f\textcompwordmark i`` produces
               â\ ``fi``\ â without a ligature. This is most useful in
               non-English languages. The ``\textcapitalcompwordmark``
               form has the cap height of the font while the
               ``\textascendercompwordmark`` form has the ascender
               height.

            ``\textdagger`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextdagger>`__
               â  Dagger.

               .. container:: raggedright

                  â Em-dash. Used for punctuation, usually similar to
                  commas or parentheses, as in
                  â\ ``The playoffs---if you're lucky enough to make the playoffs---are more like a sprint.``\ â
                  Conventions for spacing around em-dashes vary widely.
            ``\textendash``\ ``(or``\ ``--``\ ``)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextendash-_0028or-_002d_002d_0029>`__

            ``\texteuro`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctexteuro>`__

               The Euro currency symbol: â¬.

               For an alternative glyph design, try the ``eurosym``
               package; also, most fonts nowadays come with their own
               Euro symbol (Unicode U+20AC).

            ``\textexclamdown``\ ``(or``\ :literal:`!\``\ ``)`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextexclamdown-_0028or-_0021_0060_0029>`__
               Â¡ Upside down exclamation point.

            ``\textfiguredash`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextfiguredash>`__
               Dash used between numerals, Unicode U+2012. Defined in
               the June 2021 release of LaTeX. When used in pdfTeX,
               approximated by an en-dash; with a Unicode engine, either
               typesets the glyph if available in the current font, or
               writes the usual âMissing characterâ warning to the log
               file.

            ``\textgreater`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextgreater>`__

            ``\texthorizontalbar`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctexthorizontalbar>`__
               Horizontal bar character, Unicode U+2015. Defined in the
               June 2021 release of LaTeX. Behavior as with
               ``\textfiguredash`` above; the pdfTeX approximation is an
               em-dash.

            ``\textless`` `Â¶ <#index-_005ctextless>`__
               < Less than symbol.

               Non-breaking hyphen character, Unicode U+2011. Defined in
               the June 2021 release of LaTeX. Behavior as with
               ``\textfiguredash`` above; the pdfTeX approximation is a

               :name: Accents-1
               :class: section

            LaTeX has wide support for many of the worldâs scripts and
            languages, provided through the core ``babel`` package,
            which supports pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX. The
            ``polyglossia`` package provides similar support with the
            latter two engines.

            This section does not cover that support. It only lists the
            core LaTeX commands for creating accented characters. The
            ``\capital...`` commands shown here produce alternative
            forms for use with capital letters. These are not available
            with OT1.

            Below, to make them easier to find, the accents are all
            illustrated with lowercase â\ ``o``\ â.

            Note that ``\i`` produces a dotless i, and ``\j`` produces a
            dotless j. These are often used in place of their dotted
            counterparts when they are accented.

               Related to this, ``\underbar{``\ ``text``\ ``}`` produces
               a bar under ``text``. The argument is always processed in
               LR mode (see `Modes <#Modes>`__). The bar is always a
               fixed position under the baseline, thus crossing through
               descenders. See also ``\underline`` in `Over- and

                     \accent number character

               A TeX primitive command used to generate accented
               characters from accent marks and letters. The accent mark
               is selected by ``number``, a numeric argument, followed
               by a space and then a ``character`` argument to construct
               the accented character in the current font.

               These are accented â\ ``e``\ â characters.

                     \accent22 e
                     \accent23 e

               The first is a grave, the second a caron, the third a
               breve, the fourth a macron, and the fifth a ring above.

               The position of the accent is determined by the font
               designer and so the outcome of ``\accent`` use may differ
               between fonts. In LaTeX it is desirable to have glyphs
               for accented characters rather than building them using
               ``\accent``. Using glyphs that already contain the
               accented characters (as in T1 encoding) allows correct
               hyphenation whereas ``\accent`` disables hyphenation
               (specifically with OT1 font encoding where accented
               glyphs are absent).

               There can be an optional font change between ``number``
               and ``character``. Note also that this command sets the
               ``\spacefactor`` to 1000 (see
               ```\spacefactor`` <#g_t_005cspacefactor>`__).

               An unavoidable characteristic of some Cyrillic letters
               and the majority of accented Cyrillic letters is that
               they must be assembled from multiple elements (accents,
               modifiers, etc.) while ``\accent`` provides for a single
               accent mark and a single letter combination. There are
               also cases where accents must appear between letters that
               \\accent does not support. Still other cases exist where
               the letters I and J have dots above their lowercase
               counterparts that conflict with dotted accent marks. The
               use of ``\accent`` in these cases will not work as it
               cannot analyze upper/lower case.

                  \usepackage[encoding-name]{inputenc}

            Declare the input fileâs text encoding to be
            ``encoding-name``. The default, if this package is not
            loaded, is UTF-8. Technically, specifying the encoding name
            is optional, but in practice it is not useful to omit it.

            In a computer file, the characters are stored according to a
            scheme called the *encoding*. There are many different
            encodings. The simplest is ASCII, which supports 95
            printable characters, not enough for most of the worldâs
            languages. For instance, to typeset the a-umlaut character
            â\ ``Ã¤``\ â in an ASCII-encoded LaTeX source file, the
            sequence ``\"a`` is used. This would make source files for
            anything but English hard to read; even for English, often a
            more extensive encoding is more convenient.

            The modern encoding standard, in some ways a union of the
            others, is UTF-8, one of the representations of Unicode.
            This is the default for LaTeX since 2018.

            The ``inputenc`` package is how LaTeX knows what encoding is
            used. For instance, the following command explicitly says
            that the input file is UTF-8 (note the lack of a dash).

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

            Caution: use ``inputenc`` only with the pdfTeX engine (see
            `TeX engines <#TeX-engines>`__). (The XeTeX and LuaTeX
            engines assume that the input file is UTF-8 encoded.) If you
            invoke LaTeX with either the ``xelatex`` command or the
            ``lualatex`` command, and try to declare a non-UTF-8
            encoding with ``inputenc``, such as ``latin1``, then you
            will get the error
            ``inputenc is not designed for xetex or luatex``.

            An ``inputenc`` package error such as
            ``Invalid UTF-8 byte "96`` means that some of the material
            in the input file does not follow the encoding scheme. Often
            these errors come from copying material from a document that
            uses a different encoding than the input file; this one is a
            left single quote from a web page using ``latin1`` inside a
            LaTeX input file that uses UTF-8. The simplest solution is
            to replace the non-UTF-8 character with its UTF-8
            equivalent, or use a LaTeX equivalent command or character.

            In some documents, such as a collection of journal articles
            from a variety of authors, changing the encoding in
            mid-document may be necessary. Use the command
            ``\inputencoding{``\ ``encoding-name``\ ``}``. The most
            common values for ``encoding-name`` are: ``ascii``,
            ``latin1``, ``latin2``, ``latin3``, ``latin4``, ``latin5``,
            ``latin9``, ``latin10``, andÂ ``utf8``.

                  \rule[raise]{width}{thickness}

            Produce a *rule*, a filled-in rectangle.

            This example produces a rectangular blob, sometimes called a
            Halmos symbol, or just âqedâ, often used to mark the end of
            a proof:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\qedsymbol}{\rule{0.4em}{2ex}}

            The ``amsthm`` package includes this command, with a
            somewhat different-looking symbol.

            The mandatory arguments give the horizontal ``width`` and
            vertical ``thickness`` of the rectangle. They are rigid
            lengths (see `Lengths <#Lengths>`__). The optional argument
            ``raise`` is also a rigid length, and tells LaTeX how much
            to raise the rule above the baseline, or lower it if the
            length is negative.

            This produces a line, a rectangle that is wide but not tall.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

            The line is the width of the page and 0.4Â points tall. This
            line thickness is common in LaTeX.

            A rule that has zero width, or zero thickness, will not show
            up in the output, but can cause LaTeX to change the output
            around it. See ```\strut`` <#g_t_005cstrut>`__, for
            examples.

            Multilingual packages such as ``babel`` or ``polyglossia``,
            or classes such as ``lettre``, will localize ``\today``. For

            ``\today`` uses the counters ``\day``, ``\month``, and
            ``\year`` (see ```\day`` & ``\month`` &

            A number of package on CTAN work with dates. One is
            ``datetime`` package which can produce a wide variety of
            date formats, including ISO standards.

            The date is not updated as the LaTeX process runs, so in
            principle the date could be incorrect by the time the
            program finishes.

         LaTeX lets you split a large document into several smaller
         ones. This can simplify editing or allow multiple authors to
         work on the document. It can also speed processing.

         Regardless of how many separate files you use, there is always
         one *root file*, on which LaTeX compilation starts. This shows
         such a file with five included files.

               \include{bib} 
               \end{document}

         This will bring in material from ``pref.tex``, ``chap1.tex``,
         ``chap2.tex``, ``append.tex``, and ``bib.tex``. If you compile
         this file, and then comment out all of the lines inside
         ``\includeonly{...}`` except for ``chap1``, and compile again,
         then LaTeX will only process the material in the first chapter.
         Thus, your output will appear more quickly and be shorter to
         print. However, the advantage of the ``\includeonly`` command
         is that LaTeX will retain the page numbers and all of the cross
         reference information from the other parts of the document so
         these will appear in your output correctly.

         See `Larger ``book`` template <#Larger-book-template>`__, for
         another example of ``\includeonly``.

            When you ``\include{filename}``, inside ``filename.tex`` the
            material after ``\endinput`` will not be included. This
            command is optional; if ``filename.tex`` has no
            ``\endinput`` then LaTeX will read all of the file.

            For example, suppose that a documentâs root file has
            ``\input{chap1}`` and this is ``chap1.tex``.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \chapter{One}
                  This material will appear in the document. 
                  \endinput
                  This will not appear.

            This can be useful for putting documentation or comments at
            the end of a file, or for avoiding junk characters that can
            be added if the file is transmitted in the body of an email.
            It is also useful for debugging: one strategy to localize
            errors is to put ``\endinput`` halfway through the included
            file and see if the error disappears. Now, knowing which
            half contains the error, moving ``\endinput`` to halfway
            through that area further narrows down the location. This
            process rapidly finds the offending line.

            After reading ``\endinput``, LaTeX continues to read to the
            end of the line, so something can follow this command and be
            read nonetheless. This allows you, for instance, to close an
            ``\if...`` with a ``\fi``.

            Bring material from the external file ``filename``\ ``.tex``
            into a LaTeX document.

            The ``\include`` command does three things: it executes
            ``\clearpage`` (see ```\clearpage`` &
            ``\cleardoublepage`` <#g_t_005cclearpage-_0026-_005ccleardoublepage>`__),
            then it inputs the material from ``filename``\ ``.tex`` into
            the document, and then it does another ``\clearpage``. This
            command can only appear in the document body.

            The ``\includeonly`` command controls which files will be
            read by LaTeX under subsequent ``\include`` commands. Its
            list of filenames is comma-separated. It must appear in the
            preamble or even earlier, e.g., the command line; it canât
            appear in the document body.

            This example root document, ``constitution.tex``, brings in
            three files, ``preamble.tex``, ``articles.tex``, and
            ``amendments.tex``.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \documentclass{book}

                    preamble,
                    articles,
                    amendments
                    }
                  \begin{document}
                  \include{preamble}
                  \include{articles}
                  \include{amendments}
                  \end{document}

            The file ``preamble.tex`` contains no special code; you have
            just excerpted the chapter from ``consitution.tex`` and put
            it in a separate file just for editing convenience.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \chapter{Preamble}
                  We the People of the United States,
                  in Order to form a more perfect Union, ...

            Running LaTeX on ``constitution.tex`` makes the material
            from the three files appear in the document but also
            generates the auxiliary files ``preamble.aux``,
            ``articles.aux``, and ``amendments.aux``. These contain
            information such as page numbers and cross-references (see
            `Cross references <#Cross-references>`__). If you now
            comment out ``\includeonly``\ âs lines with ``preamble`` and
            ``amendments`` and run LaTeX again then the resulting
            document shows only the material from ``articles.tex``, not
            the material from ``preamble.tex`` or ``amendments.tex``.
            Nonetheless, all of the auxiliary information from the
            omitted files is still there, including the starting page
            number of the chapter.

            If the document preamble does not have ``\includeonly`` then
            LaTeX will include all the files you call for with
            ``\include`` commands.

            The ``\include`` command makes a new page. To avoid that,
            see ```\input`` <#g_t_005cinput>`__ (which, however, does
            not retain the auxiliary information).

            See `Larger ``book`` template <#Larger-book-template>`__,
            for another example using ``\include`` and ``\includeonly``.
            That example also uses ``\input`` for some material that
            will not necessarily start on a new page.

            File names can involve paths.

            To make your document portable across distributions and

            Nevertheless, for the name â\ ``amo amas amat``\ â, this

                  \end{document}

            and this works under MiKTeX on Windows:

                  \begin{document}
                  \include{{"amo amas amat"}}
                  \end{document}

            You cannot use ``\include`` inside a file that is being
            included or you get
            â\ ``LaTeX Error: \include cannot be nested.``\ â The
            ``\include`` command cannot appear in the document preamble;
            you will get
            â\ ``LaTeX Error: Missing \begin{document}``\ â.

            If a file that you ``\include`` does not exist, for instance
            if you ``\include{athiesm}`` but you meant
            ``\include{atheism}``, then LaTeX does not give you an error
            but will warn you â\ ``No file athiesm.tex.``\ â (It will
            also create ``athiesm.aux``.)

            If you ``\include`` the root file in itself then you first
            get â\ ``LaTeX Error: Can be used only in preamble.``\ â
            Later runs get
            â\ ``TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [text input levels=15]``\ â.
            To fix this, you must remove the inclusion
            ``\include{``\ ``root``\ ``}`` but also delete the file
            ``root``\ ``.aux`` and rerun LaTeX.

            LaTeX processes the file as if its contents were inserted in

            If ``filename`` does not end in â\ ``.tex``\ â then LaTeX
            first tries the filename with that extension; this is the
            usual case. If ``filename`` ends with â\ ``.tex``\ â then
            LaTeX looks for the filename as it is.

                  \input{macros}

            will cause LaTeX to first look for ``macros.tex``. If it
            finds that file then it processes its contents as thought
            they had been copy-pasted in. If there is no file of the
            name ``macros.tex`` then LaTeX tries the name ``macros``,
            without an extension. (This may vary by distribution.)

            Produce a table of contents, or list of figures, or list of
            tables. Put the command in the input file where you want the
            table or list to go. You do not type the entries; for
            example, typically the table of contents entries are
            automatically generated from the sectioning commands
            ``\chapter``, etc.

            This example illustrates the first command,
            ``\tableofcontents``. LaTeX will produce a table of contents
            on the bookâs first page.

                  \end{document}

            Uncommenting the second line would cause that table to
            contain chapter and section listings but not subsection
            listings, because the ``\section`` command has levelÂ 1. See
            `Sectioning <#Sectioning>`__, for level numbers of the
            sectioning units. For more on the ``tocdepth`` see
            `Sectioning/tocdepth <#Sectioning_002ftocdepth>`__.

            Another example of the use of ``\tableofcontents`` is in
            `Larger ``book`` template <#Larger-book-template>`__.

            If you want a page break after the table of contents, write
            a ``\newpage`` command after the ``\tableofcontents``
            command, as above.

            To make the table of contents, LaTeX stores the information
            in an auxiliary file named ``root-file``\ ``.toc`` (see
            `Splitting the input <#Splitting-the-input>`__). For
            example, this LaTeX file ``test.tex``

            writes these lines to ``test.toc``.

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \contentsline {section}{\numberline {1}First section}{2}
                  \contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {1.1}First subsection}{2}

            Each line contains a single command, ``\contentsline`` (see
            ```\contentsline`` <#g_t_005ccontentsline>`__). The first
            argument, the ``section`` or ``subsection``, is the
            sectioning unit. The second argument has two components. The
            hook ``\numberline`` determines how the sectioning number,
            ``1`` or ``1.1``, appears in the table of contents (see
            ```\numberline`` <#g_t_005cnumberline>`__). The remainder of
            the second argument of ``\contentsline``,
            â\ ``First section``\ â or â\ ``First subsection``\ â, is
            the sectioning title text. Finally, the third argument,
            â\ ``2``\ â, is the page number on which this sectioning
            unit starts.

            To typeset these lines, the document class provides
            ``\l@``\ ``section-unit`` commands such as
            ``\l@section{``\ ``text``\ ``}{``\ ``pagenumber``\ ``}`` and
            ``\l@subsection{``\ ``text``\ ``}{``\ ``pagenumber``\ ``}``.
            These commands often use the ``\@dottedtocline`` command
            (see ```\@dottedtocline`` <#g_t_005c_0040dottedtocline>`__).

            A consequence of LaTeXâs strategy of using auxiliary files
            is that to get the correct information in the document you
            must run LaTeX twice, once to store the information and the
            second time to retrieve it. In the ordinary course of
            writing a document authors run LaTeX a number of times, but
            you may notice that the first time that you compile a new
            document, the table of contents page will be empty except
            for its â\ ``Contents``\ â header. Just run LaTeX again.

            The commands ``\listoffigures`` and ``\listoftables``
            produce a list of figures and a list of tables. Their
            information is stored in files with extension ``.lof`` and
            ``.lot``. They work the same way as ``\tableofcontents`` but
            the latter is more common, so we use it for most examples.

            You can manually add material to the table of contents, the
            list of figures, and the list of tables. For instance, add a
            line about a section to the table of contents with
            ``\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{``\ ``text``\ ``}``. (see
            ```\addcontentsline`` <#g_t_005caddcontentsline>`__). Add
            arbitrary material, that is, non-line material, with
            ``\addtocontents``, as with the command
            ``\addtocontents{lof}{\protect\vspace{2ex}}``, which adds
            vertical space to the list of figures (see
            ```\addtocontents`` <#g_t_005caddtocontents>`__).

            Lines in the table of contents, the list of figures, and the
            list of tables, have four parts. First is an indent. Next is
            a box into which sectioning numbers are placed, and then the
            third box holds the title text, such as
            â\ ``First section``\ â. Finally there is a box up against
            the right margin, inside of which LaTeX puts the page number
            box. For the indent and the width of the number box, see
            ```\@dottedtocline`` <#g_t_005c_0040dottedtocline>`__. The
            right margin box has width ``\@tocrmarg`` and the page
            number is flush right in that space, inside a box of width
            ``\@pnumwidth``. By default ``\@tocrmarg`` is ``2.55em`` and
            ``\@pnumwidth`` is ``1.55em``. Change these as with
            ``\renewcommand{\@tocrmarg}{3.5em}``.

            CTAN has many packages for the table of contents and lists
            of figures and tables (see `CTAN: The Comprehensive TeX
            Archive Network <#CTAN>`__). The package ``tocloft`` is
            convenient for adjusting some aspects of the default such as
            spacing. And, ``tocbibbind`` will automatically add the
            bibliography, index, etc. to the table of contents.

            To change the header for the table of contents page, do
            something like these commands before you call
            ``\tableofcontents``, etc.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \renewcommand{\contentsname}{Table of Contents}
                  \renewcommand{\listfigurename}{Plots}
                  \renewcommand{\listtablename}{Specifications}

            Internationalization packages such as ``babel`` or
            ``polyglossia`` will change these headers depending on the
            chosen base language.

               Synopsis:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \@dottedtocline{section-level-num}{indent}{numwidth}{text}{pagenumber}

               Used internally by LaTeX to format an entry line in the
               table of contents, list of figures, or list of tables.
               Authors do not directly enter ``\@dottedtocline``
               commands.

               This command is typically used by ``\l@section``,
               ``\l@subsection``, etc., to format the content lines. For
               example, the ``article.cls`` file contains these
               definitions:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \newcommand*\l@section{\@dottedtocline{1}{1.5em}{2.3em}}
                     \newcommand*\l@subsection{\@dottedtocline{2}{3.8em}{3.2em}}
                     \newcommand*\l@subsubsection{\@dottedtocline{3}{7.0em}{4.1em}}

               In this example, ``\@dottedcline`` appears to have been
               given only three arguments. But tracing the internal code
               shows that it picks up the final ``text`` and
               ``pagenumber`` arguments in the synopsis from a call to
               ``\contentsline`` (see
               ```\contentsline`` <#g_t_005ccontentsline>`__).

               Between the box for the title text of a section and the
               right margin box, these ``\@dottedtocline`` commands
               insert *leaders*, that is, evenly-spaced dots. The
               dot-to-dot space is given by the command ``\@dotsep``. By
               default it is 4.5 (it is in math units, aka. ``mu``,
               which are ``1/18``Â em. Change it using ``\renewcommand``,
               as in ``\renewcommand{\@dotsep}{3.5}``.

               In the standard ``book`` class, LaTeX does not use dotted
               leaders for the Part and Chapter table entries, and in
               the standard ``article`` class it does not use dotted
               leaders for Section entries.

                     \addcontentsline{ext}{unit}{text}

               Add an entry to the auxiliary file with extension
               ``ext``.

               The following will result in an â\ ``Appendices``\ â line
               in the table of contents.

               .. container:: example

                     \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\protect\textbf{Appendices}}

               It will appear at the same indentation level as the
               sections, will be in boldface, and will be assigned the
               page number associated with the point where the command
               appears in the input file.

               The ``\addcontentsline`` command writes information to
               the file ``root-name``\ ``.``\ ``ext``, where
               ``root-name`` is the file name of the root file (see
               `Splitting the input <#Splitting-the-input>`__). It
               writes that information as the text of the command
               ``\contentsline{``\ ``unit``\ ``}{``\ ``text``\ ``}{``\ ``num``\ ``}``,
               where ``num`` is the current value of counter ``unit``
               (see ```\contentsline`` <#g_t_005ccontentsline>`__). The
               most common case is the table of contents and there
               ``num`` is the page number of the first page of ``unit``.

               This command is invoked by the sectioning commands
               ``\chapter``, etc. (see `Sectioning <#Sectioning>`__),
               and also by ``\caption`` inside a float environment (see
               `Floats <#Floats>`__). But it is also directly used by
               authors. For example, an author writing a book whose
               style is to have an unnumbered preface may use the
               starred ``\chapter*``. But that command leaves out table
               of contents information, which can be entered manually,
               as here.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \chapter*{Preface}
                     \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\protect\numberline{}Preface}

               In the ``root-name``\ ``.toc`` file LaTeX will put the
               line
               ``\contentsline {chapter}{\numberline {}Preface}{3}``;
               note that the page number â\ ``3``\ â is automatically
               generated by the system, not entered manually.

               All of the arguments for ``\addcontentsline`` are
               required.

               ``ext``
                  Typically one of the strings ``toc`` for the table of
                  contents, ``lof`` for the list of figures, or ``lot``
                  for the list of tables. The filename extension of the
                  information file.

               ``unit``
                  A string that depends on the value of the ``ext``
                  argument, typically one of:

                  ``toc``
                     For the table of contents, this is the name of a
                     sectional unit: ``part``, ``chapter``, ``section``,
                     ``subsection``, etc.

                  ``lof``
                     For the list of figures: ``figure``.

                  ``lot``
                     For the list of tables: ``table``.

               ``text``
                  The text of the entry. You must ``\protect`` any
                  fragile commands (see
                  ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__) used in it.

               The ``\addcontentsline`` command has an interaction with
               ``\include`` (see ```\include`` &
               ``\includeonly`` <#g_t_005cinclude-_0026-_005cincludeonly>`__).
               If you use them at the same level, as with
               ``\addcontentsline{...}{...}{...}\include{...}`` then
               lines in the table of contents can come out in the wrong
               order. The solution is to move ``\addcontentsline`` into
               the file being included.

               If you use a ``unit`` that LaTeX does not recognize, as
               with the typo here

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \addcontentsline{toc}{setcion}{\protect\textbf{Appendices}}

               then you donât get an error but the formatting in the
               table of contents will not make sense.

               This is most commonly used for the table of contents so
               that is the discussion here, but it also applies to the
               list of figures and list of tables.

               The difference between ``\addtocontents`` and
               ``\addcontentsline`` is that the latter is strictly for
               lines, such as with a line giving the page number for the
               start of a new subset of the chapters. As the above
               examples show, ``\addtocontents`` is for material such as
               spacing.

               The ``\addtocontents`` command has two arguments. Both
               are required.

               ``ext``
                  Typically one of: ``toc`` for the table of contents,
                  ``lof`` for the list of figures, or ``lot`` for the

                  information.

               ``text``
                  The text, and possibly commands, to be written.

               The sectioning commands such as ``\chapter`` use the
               ``\addcontentsline`` command to store information. This
               command creates lines in the ``.toc`` auxiliary file
               containing the ``\contentsline`` command (see
               ```\addcontentsline`` <#g_t_005caddcontentsline>`__). In
               contrast, the command ``\addtocontents`` puts material
               directly in that file.

               The ``\addtocontents`` command has an interaction with
               ``\include`` (see ```\include`` &
               ``\includeonly`` <#g_t_005cinclude-_0026-_005cincludeonly>`__).
               If you use them at the same level, as with
               ``\addtocontents{...}{...}\include{...}`` then lines in
               the table of contents can come out in the wrong order.
               The solution is to move ``\addtocontents`` into the file
               being included.

               Used internally by LaTeX to typeset an entry of the table
               of contents, list of figures, or list of tables (see
               `Table of contents, list of figures, list of
               tables <#Table-of-contents-etc_002e>`__). Authors do not
               directly enter ``\contentsline`` commands.

               Usually adding material to these lists is done
               automatically by the commands ``\chapter``, ``\section``,
               etc. for the table of contents, or by the ``\caption``
               command inside of a ``\figure`` or ``\table`` environment
               (see ```figure`` <#figure>`__ and see
               ```table`` <#table>`__). Thus, where the root file is
               ``thesis.tex``, and contains the declaration
               ``\tableofcontents``, the command
               ``\chapter{Chapter One}`` produces something like this in
               the file ``thesis.toc``.

                     \contentsline {chapter}{\numberline {1}Chapter One}{3}

               If the file contains the declaration ``\listoffigures``
               then a figure environment involving ``\caption{Test}``
               will produce something like this in ``thesis.lof``.

               .. container:: example

                     \contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces Test}}{6}

               To manually add material, use
               ``\addcontentsline{``\ ``filetype``\ ``}{``\ ``unit``\ ``}{``\ ``text``\ ``}``,
               where ``filetype`` is ``toc``, ``lof``, or ``lot`` (see
               ```\addcontentsline`` <#g_t_005caddcontentsline>`__).

               For manipulating how the ``\contentline`` material is
               typeset, see the ``tocloft`` package.

               Note that the ``hyperref`` package changes the definition
               of ``\contentsline`` (and ``\addcontentsline``) to add
               more arguments, to make hyperlinks. This is the source of
               the error ``Argument of \contentsline has an extra }``
               when one adds/remove the use of package ``hyperref`` and
               a compilation was already run. Fix this error by deleting
               the ``.toc`` or ``.lof`` or ``.lot`` file, and running
               LaTeX again.

               Typeset its argument flush left in a box. This is used in
               a ``\contentsline`` command to typeset the section number
               (see ```\contentsline`` <#g_t_005ccontentsline>`__).

               For example, this line in a ``.toc`` file causes the
               ``1.1`` to be typeset flush left.

               .. container:: example

                     \contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {1.1}Motivation}{2}

               By default, LaTeX typesets the section numbers in a box
               of length ``\@tempdima``. That length is set by the
               commands ``\l@section``, ``\l@subsection``, etc. Put
               section numbers inside a natural-width box with
               ``\renewcommand{\numberline}[1]{#1~}`` before
               ``\tableofcontents``.

               This command is fragile so you may need to precede it
               with ``\protect`` (see
               ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__). An example is the
               use of ``\protect`` in this command,

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\protect\numberline{}Summary}

               to get the ``\numberline`` into the ``\contentsline``
               command in the ``.toc`` file:
               ``\contentsline {section}{\numberline {}Summary}{6}``
               (the page number â\ ``6``\ â is automatically added by
               LaTeX; see
               ```\addcontentsline`` <#g_t_005caddcontentsline>`__).

            If you tell LaTeX what terms you want to appear in an index
            then it can produce that index, alphabetized and with the
            page numbers automatically maintained. This illustrates the
            basics.

                  Wilson's Theorem\index{Wilson's Theorem}
                  says that a number $n>1$ is prime if and only if the factorial
                  of $n-1$ is congruent to $-1$
                  modulo~$n$.\index{congruence!and Wilson's Theorem}
                    ...
                  \printindex
                  \end{document}

            As that shows, declare index entries with the ``\index``
            command (see ```\index`` <#g_t_005cindex>`__). When you run
            LaTeX, the ``\index`` writes its information, such as
            â\ ``Wilson's Theorem``\ â and the page number, to an
            auxiliary file whose name ends in ``.idx``. Next, to
            alphabetize and do other manipulations, run an external
            command, typically ``makeindex`` (see
            ```makeindex`` <#makeindex>`__), which writes a file whose
            name ends in ``.ind``. Finally, ``\printindex`` brings this
            manipulated information into the output (see
            ```\printindex`` <#g_t_005cprintindex>`__).

            Thus, if the above example is in the file ``numth.tex`` then
            running â\ ``pdflatex numth``\ â will save index entry and
            page number information to ``numth.idx``. Then running
            â\ ``makeindex numth``\ â will alphabetize and save the
            results to ``numth.ind``. Finally, again running
            â\ ``pdflatex numth``\ â will show the desired index, at the
            place where the ``\printindex`` command is in the source
            file.

            There are many options for the output. An example is that
            the exclamation point in
            ``\index{congruence!and Wilson's Theorem}`` produces a main
            entry of â\ ``congruence``\ â with a subentry of
            â\ ``and Wilson's Theorem``\ â. For more, see
            ```makeindex`` <#makeindex>`__.

            The ``\makeindex`` and ``\printindex`` commands are
            independent. Leaving out the ``\makeindex`` will stop LaTeX
            from saving the index entries to the auxiliary file. Leaving
            out the ``\printindex`` will cause LaTeX to not show the
            index in the document output.

            There are many packages in the area of indexing. The
            ``showidx`` package causes each index entries to be shown in
            the margin on the page where the ``\index`` appears. This
            can help in preparing the index. The ``multind`` package,
            among others, supports multiple indexes. See also the TeX
            FAQ entry on this topic, https://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-multind,
            and the CTAN topic, https://ctan.org/topic/index-multi.

               Note that the author must enter the page numbers, which
               is tedious and which will result in wrong numbers if the
               document changes. This is why in most cases automated
               methods such as ``makeindex`` are best. See
               `Indexes <#Indexes>`__.

               However we cover the commands for completeness, and
               because the automated methods are based on these
               commands. There are three levels of entries. As the
               example shows, a main entry uses ``\item``, subentries
               use ``\subitem``, and the lowest level uses
               ``\subsubitem``. Blank lines between entries have no
               effect. The example above includes ``\indexspace`` to
               produce vertical space in the output that some index
               styles use before the first entry starting with a new
               letter.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     % file test.tex
                       ...
                     W~Ackermann (1896--1962).\index{Ackermann}
                       ...
                     Ackermann function\index{Ackermann!function}
                       ...
                     rate of growth\index{Ackermann!function!growth rate}

               All three index entries will get a page number, such as
               â\ ``Ackermann, 22``\ â. LaTeX will format the second as
               a subitem of the first, on the line below it and
               indented, and the third as a subitem of the second. Three
               levels deep is as far as you can nest subentries. (If you
               add ``\index{Ackermann!function!growth rate!comparison}``
               then ``makeindex`` says
               â\ ``Scanning input file test.idx....done (4 entries accepted, 1 rejected)``\ â
               and the fourth level is silently missing from the index.)

               If you enter a second ``\index`` with the same
               ``index-entry-string`` then you will get a single index
               entry with two page numbers (unless they happen to fall
               on the same page). Thus, adding
               ``as for Ackermann.\index{Ackermann}`` later in the same
               document as above will give an index entry like
               â\ ``Ackermann, 22, 151``\ â. Also, you can enter the
               index entries in any order, so for instance
               ``\index{Ackermann!function}`` could come before
               ``\index{Ackermann}``.

               Get a page range in the output, like
               â\ ``Hilbert, 23--27``\ â, as here.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     W~Ackermann (1896--1962).\index{Ackermann}
                       ...
                     D~Hilbert (1862--1943)\index{Ackermann!Hilbert|(}
                       ...
                     disapproved of his marriage.\index{Ackermann!Hilbert|)}

               If the beginning and ending of the page range are equal
               then the system just gives a single page number, not a
               range.

               If you index subentries but not a main entry, as with
               ``\index{Jones!program}`` and ``\index{Jones!results}``,
               then the output is the item â\ ``Jones``\ â with no comma
               or page number, followed by two subitems, like
               â\ ``program, 50``\ â and â\ ``results, 51``\ â.

               Generate a index entry that says â\ ``see``\ â by using a
               vertical bar character:
               ``\index{Ackermann!function|see{P\'eter's function}}``.
               You can instead get â\ ``see also``\ â with ``seealso``.
               (The text â\ ``see``\ â is defined by ``\seename``, and
               â\ ``see also``\ â by ``\alsoname``. You can redefine
               these either by using an internationalization package
               such as ``babel`` or ``polyglossia``, or directly as with
               ``\renewcommand{\alsoname}{Also see}``.)

               The â\ ``see``\ â feature is part of a more general
               functionality. After the vertical bar you can put the
               name of a one-input command, as in
               ``\index{group|textit}`` (note the missing backslash on
               the ``\textit`` command) and the system will apply that
               command to the page number, here giving something like
               ``\textit{7}``. You can define your own one-input
               commands, such as
               ``\newcommand{\definedpage}[1]{{\color{blue}#1}}`` and
               then ``\index{Ackermann!function|definedpage}`` will give
               a blue page number (see `Color <#Color>`__). Another,
               less practical, example is this,

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \newcommand\indexownpage[1]{#1, \thepage}
                       ... Epimenides.\index{self-reference|indexownpage}

               which creates an entry citing the page number of its own
               index listing.

               The two functions just described combine, as here

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \index{Ackermann!function|(definedpage}
                       ...
                     \index{Ackermann!function|)}

               which outputs an index entry like
               â\ ``function, 23--27``\ â where the page number range is
               in blue.

               Consider an index entry such as â\ ``Î±-ring``\ â.
               Entering it as ``$\alpha$-ring`` will cause it to be
               alphabetized according to the dollar sign. You can
               instead enter it using an at-sign, as
               ``\index{alpha-ring@$\alpha$-ring}``. If you specify an
               entry with an at-sign separating two strings,
               ``pos``\ ``@``\ ``text``, then ``pos`` gives the
               alphabetical position of the entry while ``text``
               produces the text of the entry. Another example is that
               ``\index{Saint Michael's College@SMC}`` produces an index
               entry â\ ``SMC``\ â alphabetized into a different
               location than its spelling would naturally give it.

               To put a ``!``, or ``@``, or ``|``, or ``"`` character in
               an index entry, escape it by preceding it with a double
               quote, ``"``. (The double quote gets deleted before
               alphabetization.)

               A number of packages on CTAN have additional
               functionality beyond that provided by ``makeidx``. One is
               ``index``, which allows for multiple indices and contains
               a command ``\index*{``\ ``index-entry-string``\ ``}``
               that prints the ``index-entry-string`` as well as
               indexing it.

               The ``\index`` command writes the indexing information to
               the file ``root-name``\ ``.idx`` file. Specifically, it
               writes text of the command
               ``\indexentry{``\ ``index-entry-string``\ ``}{``\ ``page-num``\ ``}``,
               where ``page-num`` is the value of the ``\thepage``
               counter. On occasion, when the ``\printindex`` command is
               confused, you have to delete this file to start with a
               fresh slate.

               If you omit the closing brace of an ``\index`` command
               then you get a message like this.

               .. container:: example

                  :class: subsection

               Synopsis, one of:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     makeindex filename
                     makeindex -s style-file filename
                     makeindex options filename0 ...

               Sort, and otherwise process, the index information in the
               auxiliary file ``filename``. This is a command line
               program. It takes one or more raw index files,
               ``filename``\ ``.idx`` files, and produces the actual
               index file, the ``filename``\ ``.ind`` file that is input
               by ``\printindex`` (see
               ```\printindex`` <#g_t_005cprintindex>`__).

               The first form of the command suffices for many uses. The
               second allows you to format the index by using an *index
               style file*, a ``.isty`` file. The third form is the most
               general; see the full documentation on CTAN.

               This is a simple ``.isty`` file.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     % book.isty 
                     %   $ makeindex -s book.isty -p odd book.idx
                     % creates the index as book.ind, starting on an odd page.

                     \\begin{theindex}

               The description here covers only some of the index
               formatting possibilities in ``style-file``. For a full
               list see the documentation on CTAN.

               A style file consists of a list of pairs: ``specifier``
               and ``attribute``. These can appear in the file in any
               order. All of the ``attribute``\ s are strings, except
               where noted. Strings are surrounded with double quotes,
               ``"``, and the maximum length of a string is 144
               characters. The ``\n`` is for a newline and ``\t`` is for
               a tab. Backslashes are escaped with another backslash,
               ``\\``. If a line begins with a percent sign, ``%``, then
               it is a comment.

               ``preamble`` `Â¶ <#index-preamble>`__
               Preamble of the output index file. Defines the context in
               which the index is formatted. Default:
               ``"\\begin{theindex}\n"``.

               ``postamble`` `Â¶ <#index-postamble>`__
               Postamble of the output index file. Default:
               ``"\n\n\\end{theindex}\n"``.

               ``group_skip`` `Â¶ <#index-group_005fskip>`__
               Traditionally index items are broken into groups,
               typically a group for entries starting with letter
               â\ ``a``\ â, etc. This specifier gives what is inserted
               when a new group begins. Default:
               ``"\n\n \\indexspace\n"`` (``\indexspace`` is a command
               inserting a rubber length, by default
               ``10pt plus5pt minus3pt``).

               ``lethead_flag`` `Â¶ <#index-lethead_005fflag>`__
               An integer. It governs what is inserted for a new group
               or letter. If it is 0 (which is the default) then other
               than ``group_skip`` nothing will be inserted before the
               group. If it is positive then at a new letter the
               ``lethead_prefix`` and ``lethead_suffix`` will be
               inserted, with that letter in uppercase between them. If
               it is negative then what will be inserted is the letter
               in lowercase. The default isÂ 0.

               ``lethead_prefix`` `Â¶ <#index-lethead_005fprefix>`__
               If a new group begins with a different letter then this
               is the prefix inserted before the new letter header.
               Default: ``""``

               ``lethead_suffix`` `Â¶ <#index-lethead_005fsuffix>`__
               If a group begins with a different letter then this is
               the suffix inserted after the new letter header. Default:
               ``""``.

               ``item_0`` `Â¶ <#index-item_005f0>`__
               What is put between two levelÂ 0 items. Default:
               ``"\n \\item "``.

               ``item_1`` `Â¶ <#index-item_005f1>`__
               Put between two levelÂ 1 items. Default:
               ``"\n \\subitem "``.

               ``item_2`` `Â¶ <#index-item_005f2>`__
               put between two levelÂ 2 items. Default:
               ``"\n \\subsubitem "``.

               ``item_01`` `Â¶ <#index-item_005f01>`__
               What is put between a levelÂ 0 item and a levelÂ 1 item.
               Default: ``"\n \\subitem "``.

               ``item_x1`` `Â¶ <#index-item_005fx1>`__
               What is put between a levelÂ 0 item and a levelÂ 1 item in
               the case that the levelÂ 0 item doesnât have any page
               numbers (as in ``\index{aaa|see{bbb}}``). Default:
               ``"\n \\subitem "``.

               ``item_12`` `Â¶ <#index-item_005f12>`__
               What is put between a levelÂ 1 item and a levelÂ 2 item.
               Default: ``"\n \\subsubitem "``.

               ``item_x2`` `Â¶ <#index-item_005fx2>`__
               What is put between a levelÂ 1 item and a levelÂ 2 item, if
               the levelÂ 1 item doesnât have page numbers. Default:
               ``"\n \\subsubitem "``.

               ``delim_0`` `Â¶ <#index-delim_005f0>`__
               Delimiter put between a levelÂ 0 key and its first page
               number. Default: a comma followed by a blank, ``", "``.

               ``delim_1`` `Â¶ <#index-delim_005f1>`__
               Delimiter put between a levelÂ 1 key and its first page
               number. Default: a comma followed by a blank, ``", "``.

               ``delim_2`` `Â¶ <#index-delim_005f2>`__
               Delimiter between a levelÂ 2 key and its first page
               number. Default: a comma followed by a blank, ``", "``.

               ``delim_n`` `Â¶ <#index-delim_005fn>`__
               Delimiter between two page numbers for the same key (at
               any level). Default: a comma followed by a blank,
               ``", "``.

               ``delim_r`` `Â¶ <#index-delim_005fr>`__
               What is put between the starting and ending page numbers
               of a range. Default: ``"--"``.

               ``line_max`` `Â¶ <#index-line_005fmax>`__
               An integer. Maximum length of an index entryâs line in
               the output, beyond which the line wraps. Default: ``72``.

               ``indent_space`` `Â¶ <#index-indent_005fspace>`__
               What is inserted at the start of a wrapped line. Default:
               ``"\t\t"``.

               ``indent_length`` `Â¶ <#index-indent_005flength>`__
               A number. The length of the wrapped line indentation. The
               default ``indent_space`` is two tabs and each tab is
               eight spaces so the default here is ``16``.

               ``page_precedence`` `Â¶ <#index-page_005fprecedence>`__
               A document may have pages numbered in different ways. For
               example, a book may have front matter pages numbered in
               lowercase roman while main matter pages are in arabic.
               This string specifies the order in which they will appear
               in the index. The ``makeindex`` command supports five
               different types of numerals: lowercase roman ``r``, and
               numeric or arabic ``n``, and lowercase alphabetic ``a``,
               and uppercase roman ``R``, and uppercase alphabetic
               ``A``. Default: ``"rnaRA"``.

               There are a number of other programs that do the job
               ``makeindex`` does. One is ``xindy``
               (https://ctan.org/pkg/xindy), which does
               internationalization and can process indexes for
               documents marked up using LaTeX and a number of other
               languages. It is written in Lisp, highly configurable,
               both in markup terms and in terms of the collating order
               of the text, as described in its documentation.

               A more recent indexing program supporting Unicode is
               ``xindex``, written in Lua (https://ctan.org/pkg/xindex).

            The ``glossaries`` package allows you to make glossaries,
            including multiple glossaries, as well as lists of acronyms.

            To get the output from this example, compile the document
            (for instance with ``pdflatex filename``), then run the
            command line command ``makeglossaries filename``, and then
            compile the document again.

                    name={Turing machine},

                                 but can compute anything any existing device can compute.

                  \printglossaries
                  \end{document}

            That gives two things. In the main text it outputs
            â\ ``... definition of a Turing machine``\ â. In addition,
            in a separate sectional unit headed â\ ``Glossary``\ â there
            appears a description list. In boldface it says
            â\ ``Turing machine``\ â and the rest of the item says in
            normal type
            â\ ``A model of a machine â¦ Computer Science``\ â.

            The command ``\makeglossary`` opens the file that will
            contain the entry information, ``root-file``\ ``.glo``. Put
            the ``\printglossaries`` command where you want the
            glossaries to appear in your document.

            The ``glossaries`` package is very powerful. For instance,
            besides the commands ``\newglossaryentry`` and ``\gls``,
            there are similar commands for a list of acronyms. See the
            package documentations on CTAN.

               label are pairs: ``key``\ ``=``\ ``value``.

               This puts the blackboard bold symbol for the real numbers

               ``description`` `Â¶ <#index-description>`__
                  (Required.) The description that will appear in the
                  glossary. If this has more than one paragraph then you
                  must use the second command form given in the
                  synopsis.

               ``plural`` `Â¶ <#index-plural>`__
                  The plural form of ``name``. Refer to the plural form
                  using ``\glspl`` or ``\Glspl`` (see

               \end{document}

         Produce one or more letters.

         Each letter is in a separate ``letter`` environment, whose
         argument ``recipient address`` often contains multiple lines
         separated with a double backslash,Â (``\\``). For example, you
         might have:

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

                \begin{letter}{Ninon de l'Enclos \\
                               l'h\^otel Sagonne}
                  ...
                \end{letter}

         The start of the ``letter`` environment resets the page number
         to 1, and the footnote number to 1 also.

         The ``sender address`` and ``sender name`` are common to all of
         the letters, whether there is one or more, so these are best
         put in the preamble. As with the recipient address, often
         ``sender address`` contains multiple lines separated by a
         double backslashÂ (``\\``). LaTeX will put the ``sender name``
         under the closing, after a vertical space for the traditional
         hand-written signature.

         Each ``letter`` environment body begins with a required
         ``\opening`` command such as ``\opening{Dear Madam or Sir:}``.
         The ``letter body`` text is ordinary LaTeX so it can contain
         everything from enumerated lists to displayed math, except that
         commands such as ``\chapter`` that make no sense in a letter
         are turned off. Each ``letter`` environment body typically ends
         with a ``\closing`` command such as ``\closing{Yours,}``.

         Additional material may come after the ``\closing``. You can
         say who is receiving a copy of the letter with a command like
         ``\cc{the Boss \\ the Boss's Boss}``. Thereâs a similar
         ``\encl`` command for a list of enclosures. And, you can add a
         postscript with ``\ps``.

         LaTeXâs default is to indent the sender name and the closing
         above it by a length of ``\longindentation``. By default this
         is ``0.5\textwidth``. To make them flush left, put
         ``\setlength{\longindentation}{0em}`` in your preamble.

         To set a fixed date use something like
         ``\renewcommand{\today}{1958-Oct-12}``. If put in your preamble
         then it will apply to all the letters.

         This example shows only one ``letter`` environment. The three
         lines marked as optional are typically omitted.

               \end{letter}
               \end{document}

            on the envelope. Separate multiple lines in
            ``senders address`` with a double backslash,Â ``\\``.

            Because it can apply to multiple letters this declaration is
            often put in the preamble. However, it can go anywhere,
            including inside an individual ``letter`` environment.

            This command is optional: if you do not use it then the
            letter is formatted with some blank space on top, for
            copying onto pre-printed letterhead paper. If you do use the

                  \makelabels   % in preamble

            Optional, for a document that contains ``letter``
            environments. If you just put ``\makelabels`` in the
            preamble then at the end of the document you will get a
            sheet with labels for all the recipients, one for each
            letter environment, that you can copy to a sheet of peel-off
            address labels.

            Customize the labels by redefining the commands
            ``\startlabels``, ``\mlabel``, and ``\returnaddress`` (and
            perhaps ``\name``) in the preamble. The command
            ``\startlabels`` sets the width, height, number of columns,
            etc., of the page onto which the labels are printed. The
            command
            ``\mlabel{``\ ``return address``\ ``}{``\ ``recipient address``\ ``}``
            produces the two labels (or one, if you choose to ignore the
            ``return address``) for each letter environment. The first
            argument, ``return address``, is the value returned by the
            macro ``\returnaddress``. The second argument,
            ``recipient address``, is the value passed in the argument
            to the ``letter`` environment. By default ``\mlabel``
            ignores the first argument, the ``return address``, causing
            the default behavior described in the prior paragraph.

            This illustrates customization. Its output includes a page
            with two columns having two labels each.

            The first column contains the return address twice. The
            second column contains the address for each recipient.

            The package ``envlab`` makes formatting the labels easier,
            with standard sizes already provided. The preamble lines
            ``\usepackage[personalenvelope]{envlab}`` and
            ``\makelabels`` are all that you need to print envelopes.

            The senderâs name. This command is optional, although its
            inclusion is usual.

            The argument text appears at the end of the letter, after
            the closing. LaTeX leaves some vertical space for a
            handwritten signature. Separate multiple lines with a double
            backslash,Â ``\\``. For example:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \signature{J Fred Muggs \\
                             White House}

            LaTeXâs default for the vertical space from the ``\closing``
            text down to the ``\signature`` text is ``6\medskipamount``,
            which is six times ``\medskipamount`` (where
            ``\medskipamount`` is equal to a ``\parskip``, which in turn
            is defined by default here to 0.7em).

            This command is usually in the preamble, to apply to all the
            letters in the document. To have it apply to one letter
            only, put it inside a ``letter`` environment and before the
            ``\closing``.

            You can include a graphic in the signature as here.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \signature{\vspace{-6\medskipamount}\includegraphics{sig.png}\\
                               My name}

            For this you must put ``\usepackage{graphicx}`` in the
            preamble (see `Graphics <#Graphics>`__).

         LaTeX uses the ability to write to a file and later read it
         back in to build document components such as a table of
         contents or index. You can also read a file that other programs
         written, or write a file for others to read. You can
         communicate with users through the terminal. And, you can issue
         instructions for the operating system.

            Open a file for reading material, or for writing it. In most
            engines, the ``number`` must be between 0 and 15, as in
            ``\openin3``; in LuaLaTeX, ``number`` can be between 0 and
            127.

            Here TeX opens the file ``presidents.tex`` for reading.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newread\presidentsfile
                  \openin\presidentsfile=presidents
                  \typeout{presidentsfile is \the\presidentsfile}
                  \read\presidentsfile to\presidentline
                  \typeout{\presidentline}

            The ``\newread`` command allocates input stream numbers from
            0 toÂ 15 (there is also a ``\newwrite``). The
            ``\presidentsfile`` is more memorable but under the hood it
            is still a number; the first ``\typeout`` gives something
            like â\ ``presidentsfile is 1``\ â. In addition,
            ``\newread`` keeps track of the allocation so that if you
            use too many then you get an error like
            â\ ``! No room for a new \read``\ â. The second ``\typeout``
            gives the first line of the file, something like
            â\ ``1 Washington, George``\ â.

            Ordinarily TeX will not try to open the file until the next
            page shipout. To change this, use
            ``\immediate\openin``\ ``number``\ ``=``\ ``filename`` or
            ``\immediate\openout``\ ``number``\ ``=``\ ``filename``.

            Close files with ``\closein``\ ``number`` and
            ``\closeout``\ ``number``.

            How LaTeX handles filenames varies among distributions, and
            even can vary among versions of a distribution. If the file
            does not have an extension then TeX will add a ``.tex``.
            This creates ``presidents.tex``, writes one line to it, and
            closes it.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newwrite\presidentsfile
                  \openout\presidentsfile=presidents
                  \write\presidentsfile{1 Washington, George}
                  \closeout\presidentsfile

            But filenames with a period can cause trouble: if TeX finds
            a ``filename`` of ``presidents.dat`` it could look first for
            ``presidents.dat.tex`` and later for ``presidents.dat``, or
            it could do the opposite. Your distributionâs documentation
            should say more, and if you find something that works for
            you then you are good, but to ensure complete portability
            the best thing is to use file names containing only the
            twenty six ASCII letters (not case-sensitive) and the ten
            digits, along with underscore and dash, and in particular
            with no dot or space.

            For ``\openin``, if TeX cannot find the file then it does
            not give an error. It just considers that the stream is not
            open (test for this with ``\ifeof``; one recourse is the
            command ``\InputIfFileExists``, see `Class and package
            commands <#Class-and-package-commands>`__). If you try to
            use the same number twice, LaTeX wonât give you an error. If
            you try to use a bad number then you get an error message
            like
            â\ ``! Bad number (16). <to be read again> = l.30 \openin16=test.jh``\ â.

            Make the command ``macro`` contain the next line of input
            from text stream ``number``, as in ``\read5 to\data``.

            This opens the file ``email.tex`` for reading, puts the
            contents of the first line into the command ``\email``, and

            If ``number`` is outside the range from 0 toÂ 15 or if no
            file of that number is open, or if the file has ended, then
            ``\read`` will take input from the terminal (or exit if
            interaction is not allowed, e.g., ``\nonstopmode``; see
            `interaction modes <#interaction-modes>`__). (However, the
            natural way in LaTeX to take input from the terminal is
            ``\typein`` (see ```\typein`` <#g_t_005ctypein>`__.)

            To read an entire file as additional LaTeX source, use
            ``\input`` (see ```\input`` <#g_t_005cinput>`__) or
            ``\include`` (see ```\include`` &
            ``\includeonly`` <#g_t_005cinclude-_0026-_005cincludeonly>`__).

            A common reason to want to read from a data file is to do
            mail merges. CTAN has a number of packages for that; one is
            ``datatool``.

                  \typein{prompt-msg}
                  \typein[cmd]{prompt-msg}

            Print ``prompt-msg`` on the terminal and cause LaTeX to stop
            and wait for you to type a line of input. This line of input
            ends when you hit the return key.

            For example, this

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \@typein=Aphra Behn

            gives the output â\ ``... never forget Aphra Behn``\ â.

            The first command version,
            ``\typein{``\ ``prompt-msg``\ ``}``, causes the input you
            typed to be processed as if it had been included in the
            input file in place of the ``\typein`` command.

            In the second command version the optional argument ``cmd``
            argument must be a command name, that is, it must begin with
            a backslash, \\. This command name is then defined or
            redefined to be the input that you typed. For example, this

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  Enter student name:

                  Recommendation for John Dee.

            outputs â\ ``Recommendation for John Dee``\ â. Like what
            happens here with ``\student``, commands that are defined
            with ``\newcommand`` or ``\renewcommand`` (among others) are
            replaced by their definitions before being printed.

            LaTeXâs usual rules for treating multiple spaces as a single
            space and ignoring spaces after a command name apply to
            ``msg``. Use the command ``\space`` to get a single space,
            independent of surrounding spaces. Use ``^^J`` to get a
            newline. Get a percent character with
            ``\csname @percentchar\endcsname``.

            This command can be useful for simple debugging, as here:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newlength{\jhlength}
                  \setlength{\jhlength}{5pt}
                  \typeout{The length is \the\jhlength.}

            produces on the command line â\ ``The length is 5.0pt``\ â.

            Synopsis:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \write number{string}

            Write ``string`` to the log file, to the terminal, or to a
            file opened by ``\openout``. For instance, ``\write6``
            writes to text stream numberÂ 6.

            If the following appears in ``basefile``\ ``.tex`` then it
            opens ``basefile``\ ``.jh``, writes â\ ``Hello World!``\ â
            and a newline to it, and closes that file.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newwrite\myfile
                  \immediate\openout\myfile=\jobname.jh  % \jobname is root file basename
                  ...
                  \immediate\write\myfile{Hello world!}
                  ...
                  \immediate\closeout\myfile

            The ``\newwrite`` allocates a stream number, giving it a
            symbolic name to make life easier, so that
            ``stream \newwrite\myfile\the\myfile`` produces something
            like â\ ``stream 3``\ â. Then ``\openout`` associates the
            stream number with the given file name. TeX ultimately
            executed ``\write3`` which puts the string in the file.

            Typically ``number`` is between 0 andÂ 15, because typically
            LaTeX authors follow the prior example and the number is
            allocated by the system. If ``number`` is outside the range
            from 0 to 15 or if it is not associated with an open file
            then LaTeX writes ``string`` to the log file. If ``number``
            is positive then in addition LaTeX writes ``string`` to the
            terminal.

            Thus, ``test \write-1{Hello World!}`` puts
            â\ ``Hello World!``\ â followed by a newline in the log
            file. (This is what the ``\wlog`` command does; see
            ```\wlog`` <#g_t_005cwlog>`__). And
            ``\write100{Hello World!}`` puts the same in the log file
            but also puts â\ ``Hello World!``\ â followed by a newline
            in the terminal output. (But 16, 17, and 18 are special as
            ``number``; see below.)

            In LuaTeX, instead of 16 output streams there are 256 (see
            `TeX engines <#TeX-engines>`__).

            Use ``\write\@auxout{``\ ``string``\ ``}`` to write to the
            current ``.aux`` file, which is associated with either the
            root file or with the current include file; and use
            ``\write\@mainaux{``\ ``string``\ ``}`` to write to the main
            ``.aux``. These symbolic names are defined by LaTeX.

            By default LaTeX does not write ``string`` to the file right
            away. This is because, for example, you may need ``\write``
            to save the current page number, but when TeX comes across a
            ``\write`` it typically does not know what the page number
            is, since it has not yet done the page breaking. So, you use
            ``\write`` in one of three contexts:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \immediate\write\@auxout{string}      %1
                  \write\@auxout{string}                %2
                  \protected@write\@auxout{}{string}    %3

            #.  With the first, LaTeX writes ``string`` to the file
               immediately. Any macros in ``string`` are fully expanded
               (just as in ``\edef``) so to prevent expansion you must
               use ``\noexpand``, ``toks``, etc., except that you should
               use ``#`` instead of ``##``).
            #.  With the second, ``string`` is stored on the current
               list of things (as a TeX âwhatsitâ item) and kept until
               the page is shipped out and likewise the macros are
               unexpanded until ``\shipout``. At ``\shipout``,
               ``string`` is fully expanded.
            #.  The third, ``\protected@write``, is like the second
               except that you can use ``\protect`` to avoid expansion.
               The extra first argument allows you to locally insert
               extra definitions to make more macros protected or to
               have some other special definition for the write.

            As a simple example of expansion with ``\write``, ``string``
            here contains a control sequence ``\triplex`` which weâve
            defined to be the text â\ ``XYZ``\ â:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newwrite\jhfile
                  \openout\jhfile=test.jh
                  \newcommand{\triplex}{XYZ}
                  \write\jhfile{test \triplex test}

            This results in the file ``test.jh`` containing the text
            â\ ``test XYZtest``\ â followed by a newline.

            The cases where ``number`` is 16, 17, or 18 are special.
            Because of ``\write``\ âs behavior when ``number`` is
            outside the range from 0 to 15 described above, in PlainÂ TeX
            ``\write16`` and ``\write17`` were sometimes used to write
            to the log file and the terminal; however, in LaTeX, the
            natural way to do that is with ``\typeout`` (see
            ```\typeout`` <#g_t_005ctypeout>`__). The ``\write18``
            command is even more special; modern TeX systems use it for
            giving commands to the operating system (see
            ```\write18`` <#g_t_005cwrite18>`__).

            Ordinarily ``\write`` outputs a single line. You can include
            a newline with ``^^J``. Thus, this produces two lines in the
            log file:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \wlog{Parallel lines have a lot in common.^^JBut they never meet.}

            A common case where authors need to write their own file is
            for answers to exercises, or another situation where you
            want to write out verbatim, without expanding the macros.
            CTAN has a number of packages for this; one is ``answers``.

                  :class: subsection

               The ability to write files raises security issues. If you
               compiled a downloaded LaTeX file and it overwrote your
               password file then you would be justifiably troubled.

               Thus, by default TeX systems only allow you to open files
               for writing that are in the current directory or output
               directory, if specified (see `output
               directory <#output-directory>`__), or in a subdirectory
               of those. So, this code

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \newwrite\jhfile
                     \openout\jhfile=../test.jh

               gives an error like:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     Not writing to ../test.jh (openout_any = p).
                     ! I can't write on file `../test.jh'

               You can get just such an error when using commands such
               as ``\include{../filename}`` because LaTeX will try to
               open ``../filename.aux``. The simplest solution is to put
               the included files in the same directory as the root
               file, or in subdirectories.

                  :class: subsection

               Synopsis:

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \message{string}

               Write ``string`` to the log file and the terminal.

               Typically, LaTeX authors use ``\typeout`` (see
               ```\typeout`` <#g_t_005ctypeout>`__). It allows you to
               use ``\protect`` on any fragile commands in ``string``
               (see ```\protect`` <#g_t_005cprotect>`__). But
               ``\typeout`` always inserts a newline at the end of
               ``string`` while ``\message`` does not, so the latter can
               be useful.

               With this example document body.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     before\message{One Two}\message{Three}\message{Four^^JI}
                     \message{declare a thumb war.}After

               under some circumstances (see below) LaTeX writes the
               following to both the terminal and the log file.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     One Two Three Four
                     I declare a thumb war.

               The ``^^J`` produces a newline. Also, in the output
               document, between â\ ``before``\ â and â\ ``After``\ â
               will be a single space (from the end of line following
               â\ ``I}``\ â).

               While ``\message`` allows you more control over
               formatting, a gotcha is that LaTeX may mess up that
               formatting because it inserts line breaks depending on
               what it has already written. Contrast this document body,
               where the â\ ``Two``\ â has moved, to the one given
               above.

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     before\message{One}\message{Two Three}\message{Four^^JI}
                     \message{declare a thumb war.}After

               This can happen: when LaTeX is outputting the messages to
               the terminal, now the message with â\ ``One``\ â is
               shorter and it fits at the end of the output terminal
               line, and so LaTeX breaks the line between it and the
               â\ ``Two Three``\ â. That line break appears also in the
               log file. This line break insertion can depend on, for
               instance, the length of the full path names of included
               files. So producing finely-formatted lines in a way that
               is portable is hard, likely requiring starting your
               message at the beginning of a line.

               is blocked until that finishes.

               This sequence (on Unix)

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \newcommand{\fignum}{1}
                     \immediate\write18{cd pix && asy figure\fignum}
                     \includegraphics{pix/figure\fignum.pdf}

               will run Asymptote (the ``asy`` program) on
               ``pix/figure1.asy``, so that the document can later read
               in the resulting graphic (see
               ```\includegraphics`` <#g_t_005cincludegraphics>`__).
               Like any ``\write``, here LaTeX expands macros in
               ``shell_command`` so that ``\fignum`` is replaced by
               â\ ``1``\ â.

               Another example is that you can automatically run BibTeX
               at the start of each LaTeX run (see `Using
               BibTeX <#Using-BibTeX>`__) by including
               ``\immediate\write18{bibtex8 \jobname}`` as the first
               line of the file. Note that ``\jobname`` expands to the
               basename of the root file unless the ``--jobname`` option
               is passed on the command line, in which case this is the
               option argument.

               You sometimes need to do a multi-step process to get the
               information that you want. This will insert into the
               input a list of all PDF files in the current directory
               (but see ``texosquery`` below):

               .. container:: example

                  .. code:: example-preformatted

                     \immediate\write18{ls *.pdf > tmp.dat}
                     \input{tmp.dat}

               The standard behavior of any ``\write`` is to wait until
               a page is being shipped out before expanding the macros
               or writing to the stream (see
               ```\write`` <#g_t_005cwrite>`__). But sometimes you want
               it done now. For this, use
               ``\immediate\write18{``\ ``shell_command``\ ``}``.

               There are obvious security issues with allowing system
               commands inside a LaTeX file. If you download a file off
               the net and it contains commands to delete all your files
               then you would be unhappy. The standard settings in
               modern distributions turn off full shell access. You can
               turn it on, if you are sure the shell commands are safe,
               by compiling with
               ``latex --enable-write18``\ ``filename`` (see `Command
               line options <#Command-line-options>`__). (The
               ``--shell-escape`` option is a synonym, in TeX Live.)

               In the place of full shell access, modern distributions
               by default use a restricted version that allows some
               commands to work, such as those that run Metafont to
               generate missing fonts, even if you do not use the
               ``enable-write18`` option. By default this list of
               allowed commands is short and features only commands that
               are under the control of the distribution maintainers
               (see `Command line options <#Command-line-options>`__).

               The ``shell_command`` text is always passed to
               ``/bin/sh`` on Unix-like operating systems, and the DOS
               command interpreter ``cmd.exe`` on Windows. Any different
               shell set by the user, and the ``SHELL`` environment
               variable, is ignored.

               If what you need is system information, such as the
               operating system name, locale information, or directory
               contents, take a look at the ``texosquery`` package,
               which provides a convenient and secure interface for
               this, unlike the above examples using the raw
               ``\write18``: https://ctan.org/pkg/texosquery.

               LaTeX provides a package ``shellesc`` on top of the
               primitive ``\write18`` command. Its primary purpose is to
               provide a command ``\ShellEscape`` which works
               identically on all TeX engines; LuaTeX intentionally did
               not retain ``\write18`` as a way to invoke a shell
               command, so some engine-specific code is needed. The
               ``shellesc`` package also provides a command
               ``\DelayedShellEscape``, executed at ``\output`` time,
               for the same reason.

         Synopsis (from a terminal command line):

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               pdflatex options argument

         Run LaTeX on ``argument``. In place of ``pdflatex`` you can
         also use (for PDF output) ``xelatex`` or ``lualatex``, or (for
         DVI output) ``latex`` or ``dvilualatex``, among others (see
         `TeX engines <#TeX-engines>`__).

         For example, this will run LaTeX on the file ``thesis.tex``,
         creating the output ``thesis.pdf``.

         .. container:: example

            .. code:: example-preformatted

               pdflatex thesis

         Note that ``.tex`` is the default file name extension.

         pdfTeX is an extension of the original TeX program, as are
         XeTeX and LuaTeX (see `TeX engines <#TeX-engines>`__). The
         first two are completely backward compatible and the latter,
         almost so. Perhaps the most fundamental new feature for all
         three is that the original TeX output its own DVI format, while
         the newer ones can output directly to PDF. This allows them to
         take advantage of the extra features in PDF such as hyperlinks,
         support for modern image formats such as JPG and PNG, and
         ubiquitous viewing programs. In short, if you run ``pdflatex``
         or ``xelatex`` or ``lualatex`` then you will by default get PDF
         and have access to all its modern features. If you run
         ``latex``, or ``dvilualatex``, then you will get DVI. The
         description here assumes ``pdflatex``.

         See `Command line options <#Command-line-options>`__, for a
         selection of the most useful command line options. As to
         ``argument``, the usual case is that it does not begin with a
         backslash, so the system takes it to be the name of a file and
         it compiles that file. If ``argument`` begins with a backslash
         then the system will interpret it as a line of LaTeX input,
         which can be used for special effects (see `Command line
         input <#Command-line-input>`__).

         If you gave no arguments or options then ``pdflatex`` prompts
         for input from the terminal. You can escape from this by
         entering CTRL-D.

         If LaTeX finds an error in your document then by default it
         stops and asks you about it. See `Recovering from
         errors <#Recovering-from-errors>`__, for an outline of what to
         do.

               :class: section

            These are the command-line options relevant to ordinary
            document authoring. For a full list, try running
            â\ ``latex --help``\ â from the command line.

            With many implementations you can specify command line
            options by prefixing them with â\ ``-``\ â or â\ ``--``\ â.
            This is the case for both TeX Live (including MacTeX) and
            MiKTeX. We will use both conventions interchangeably. If an
            option takes a value, it can be specified either as a
            separate argument (â\ ``--foo val``\ â), or as one argument
            with an â\ ``=``\ â sign (â\ ``--foo=val``\ â), but there
            can be no spaces around the â\ ``=``\ â. We will generally
            use the â\ ``=``\ â syntax.

            ``-version``
            Show the current version, like
            â\ ``pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.16 (TeX Live 2015/Debian)``\ â
            along with a small amount of additional information, and
            exit.

            ``-help``
            Give a brief usage message that is useful as a prompt and
            exit.

            ``-interaction=``\ ``mode`` `Â¶ <#index-batchmode>`__
            TeX compiles a document in one of four interaction modes:
            ``batchmode``, ``nonstopmode``, ``scrollmode``,
            ``errorstopmode``. In *errorstopmode* (the default), TeX
            stops at each error and asks for user intervention. In
            *batchmode* it prints nothing on the terminal, errors are
            scrolled as if the user hit RETURN at every error, and
            missing files cause the job to abort. In *nonstopmode*,
            diagnostic message appear on the terminal but as in batch
            mode there is no user interaction. In *scrollmode*, TeX
            stops for missing files or keyboard input, but nothing else.

            For instance, starting LaTeX with this command line

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  pdflatex -interaction=batchmode filename

            eliminates most terminal output.

            ``-jobname=``\ ``string``
            Set the value of TeXâs *jobname* to the string. The log file
            and output file will then be named ``string``\ ``.log`` and
            ``string``\ ``.pdf``. see `Jobname <#Jobname>`__.

            ``-output-directory=``\ ``directory``
            Write files in the directory ``directory``. It must already
            exist. This applies to all external files created by TeX or
            LaTeX, such as the ``.log`` file for the run, the ``.aux``,
            ``.toc``, etc., files created by LaTeX, as well as the main
            ``.pdf`` or ``.dvi`` output file itself.

            When specified, the output directory ``directory`` is also
            automatically checked first for any file that it is input,
            so that the external files can be read back in, if desired.
            The true current directory (in which LaTeX was run) remains
            unchanged, and is also checked for input files.

            ``--enable-write18``
            ``--disable-write18``
            ``--shell-escape``
            ``--no-shell-escape``
            Enable or disable ``\write18{``\ ``shell_command``\ ``}``
            (see ```\write18`` <#g_t_005cwrite18>`__). The first two
            options are supported by both TeX Live and MiKTeX, while the
            second two are synonyms supported by TeX Live.

            Enabling this functionality has major security implications,
            since it allows a LaTeX file to run any command whatsoever.
            Thus, by default, unrestricted ``\write18`` is not allowed.
            (The default for TeX Live, MacTeX, and MiKTeX is to allow
            the execution of a limited number of TeX-related programs,
            which they distribute.)

            For example, if you invoke LaTeX with the option
            ``no-shell-escape``, and in your document you call
            ``\write18{ls -l}``, then you do not get an error but the
            log file says â\ ``runsystem(ls -l)...disabled``\ â.

            ``-halt-on-error``
            Stop processing at the first error.

            ``-file-line-error``
            ``-no-file-line-error``
            Enable or disable
            ``filename``\ ``:``\ ``lineno``\ ``:``\ ``error``-style
            error messages. These are only available with TeX Live or
            MacTeX.

            As part of the command line invocation

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  latex-engine options argument

            you can specify arbitrary LaTeX input by starting
            ``argument`` with a backslash. (All the engines support
            this.) This allows you to do some special effects.

            For example, this file (which uses the ``hyperref`` package
            for hyperlinks) can produce two kinds of output, one to be
            read on physical paper and one to be read online.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \ifdefined\paperversion        % in preamble
                  \newcommand{\urlcolor}{black}
                  \else
                  \newcommand{\urlcolor}{blue}
                  \fi
                  \usepackage[colorlinks=true,urlcolor=\urlcolor]{hyperref}
                    ...
                  \href{https://www.ctan.org}{CTAN}  % in body
                    ...

            Compiling this document ``book.tex`` with the command line
            ``pdflatex book`` will give the â\ ``CTAN``\ â link in blue.
            But compiling it with

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  pdflatex "\def\paperversion{}\input book.tex"

            has the link in black. We use double quotes to prevent
            interpretation of the symbols by the command line shell.
            (This usually works on both Unix and Windows systems, but
            there are many peculiarities to shell quoting, so read your
            system documentation if need be.)

            In a similar way, from the single file ``main.tex`` you can
            compile two different versions.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  pdflatex -jobname=students "\def\student{}\input{main}"
                  pdflatex -jobname=teachers "\def\teachers{}\input{main}"

            The ``jobname`` option is there because otherwise both files
            would be called ``main.pdf`` and the second would overwrite
            the first (see `Jobname <#Jobname>`__).

            In this example we use the command line to select which
            parts of a document to include. For a book named
            ``mybook.tex`` and structured like this.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \documentclass{book}
                  \begin{document}
                     ...
                  \include{chap1} 
                  \include{chap2}
                    ...
                  \end{document}

            the command line

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  pdflatex "\includeonly{chap1}\input{mybook}"

            will give output that has the first chapter but no other
            chapter. See `Splitting the input <#Splitting-the-input>`__.

               :name: Jobname-1
               :class: section

            Running LaTeX creates a number of files, including the main
            PDF (or DVI) output but also including others. These files
            are named with the so-called *jobname*. The most common case
            is also the simplest, where for instance the command
            ``pdflatex thesis`` creates ``thesis.pdf`` and also
            ``thesis.log`` and ``thesis.aux``. Here the job name is
            ``thesis``.

            In general, LaTeX is invoked as
            ``latex-engine``\ ````\ ``options``\ ````\ ``argument``,
            where ``latex-engine`` is ``pdflatex``, ``lualatex``, etc.
            (see `TeX engines <#TeX-engines>`__). If ``argument`` does
            not start with a backslash, as is the case above with
            ``thesis``, then TeX considers it to be the name of the file
            to input as the main document. This file is referred to as
            the *root file* (see `Splitting the
            input <#Splitting-the-input>`__, and
            ```\input`` <#g_t_005cinput>`__). The name of that root
            file, without the ``.tex`` extension if any, is the jobname.
            If ``argument`` does start with a backslash, or if TeX is in
            interactive mode, then it waits for the first ``\input``
            command, and the jobname is the argument to ``\input``.

            There are two more possibilities for the jobname. It can be
            directly specified with the ``-jobname`` option, as in
            ``pdflatex -jobname=myname`` (see `Command line
            input <#Command-line-input>`__ for a practical example).

            The final possibility is ``texput``, which is the final
            fallback default if no other name is available to TeX. That
            is, if no ``-jobname`` option was specified, and the
            compilation stops before any input file is met, then the log
            file will be named ``texput.log``.

            A special case of this is that in LaTeX versions of
            (approximately) 2020 or later, the jobname is also
            ``texput`` if the first ``\input`` occurs as a result of
            being called by either ``\documentclass`` or
            ``\RequirePackage``. So this will produce a file named
            ``texput.pdf``:

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  pdflatex "\documentclass{minimal}\begin{document}Hello!\end{document}"

            However, this special case only applies to those two
            commands. Thus, with

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  pdflatex "\documentclass{article}\usepackage{lipsum}\input{thesis}"

            the output file is ``lipsum.pdf``, as ``\usepackage`` calls
            ``\input``.

            Within the document, the macro ``\jobname`` expands to the
            jobname. (When you run LaTeX on a file whose name contains
            spaces, the string returned by ``\jobname`` contains
            matching start and end quotes.) In the expansion of that
            macro, all characters are of catcodeÂ 12 (other) except that
            spaces are categoryÂ 10, including letters that are normally
            catcodeÂ 11.

            Because of this catcode situation, using the jobname in a
            conditional can become complicated. One solution is to use
            the macro ``\IfBeginWith`` from the ``xstring`` package in
            its star variant, which is insensitive to catcode. For
            example, in the following text the footnote âIncluding
            Respublica Bananensis Francorum.â is only present if the
            task name starts with ``my-doc``.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  If a democracy is just a regime where citizens vote then
                  all banana republics \IfBeginWith*{\jobname}{my-doc}%
                  {\footnote{Including Respublica Bananensis Francorum.}}{} are
                  democracies.

            Manipulating the value of ``\jobname`` inside of a document
            does not change the name of the output file or the log file.

            If LaTeX finds an error in your document then it gives you
            an error message and prompts you with a question mark,
            ``?``. For instance, running LaTeX on this file

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  \newcommand{\NP}{\ensuremath{\textbf{NP}}}
                  The \PN{} problem is a million dollar one.

            causes it show this, and wait for input.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ! Undefined control sequence.
                  l.5 The \PN
                             {} problem is a million dollar one.
                  ? 

            The simplest thing is to enter x and RETURN and fix the
            typo. You could instead enter ? and RETURN to see other
            options.

            There are two other error scenarios. The first is that you
            forgot to include the ``\end{document}`` or misspelled it.
            In this case LaTeX gives you a â\ ``*``\ â prompt. You can
            get back to the command line by typing \\stop and RETURN;
            this command does its best to exit LaTeX immediately,
            whatever state it may be in.

            The last scenario is that you mistyped the filename. For
            instance, instead of ``pdflatex test`` you might type
            ``pdflatex tste``.

            .. container:: example

               .. code:: example-preformatted

                  ! I can't find file `tste'.
                  <*> tste
                          
                  (Press Enter to retry, or Control-D to exit)
                  Please type another input file name:

            The simplest thing is to enter CTRL d (holding the Control
            and d keys down at the same time), and then retype the
            correct command line.

            .. code:: verbatim

               \documentclass{beamer}

               \title{Beamer Class template}
               \author{Alex Author}
               \date{July 31, 2020}

               \begin{document}

               \maketitle

               % without [fragile], any {verbatim} code gets mysterious errors.
               \begin{frame}[fragile]
                \frametitle{First Slide}

               \begin{verbatim}
                 This is \verbatim!
               \end{verbatim}

               :class: section

            This is a somewhat elaborate template for a book. See
            ```book`` template <#book-template>`__, for a simpler one.

            This template uses ``\frontmatter``, ``\mainmatter``, and
            ``\backmatter`` to control the typography of the three main
            areas of a book (see ```\frontmatter``, ``\mainmatter``,
            ``\backmatter`` <#g_t_005cfrontmatter-_0026-_005cmainmatter-_0026-_005cbackmatter>`__).
            The book has a bibliography and an index.

            Also notable is that it uses ``\include`` and
            ``\includeonly`` (see `Splitting the
            input <#Splitting-the-input>`__). While you are working on a
            chapter you can comment out all the other chapter entries
            from the argument to ``\includeonly``. That will speed up
            compilation without losing any information such as
            cross-references. (Material that does not need to come on a
            new page is brought in with ``\input`` instead of
            ``\include``. You donât get the cross-reference benefit with
            ``\input``.)
